    <measure>Body Fat Mass at Baseline, Week 24 and Endpoint in Core Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1, pre-dose), Week 24, Endpoint in Core Period (post-baseline value prior to Week 24)</time_frame>
    <description>The primary efficacy measure for the study was body fat mass (kg) measured by DXA imaging. The primary outcome as defined in the protocol was the change from baseline to week 24 in body fat mass. Due to the early termination of the study, endpoint values are also reported. Endpoint values are the last observed post-baseline value in the Core Period, and are reported for participants who had not reached Week 24.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Total Trunk Fat at Baseline, Week 24 and Endpoint in Core Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1, pre-dose), Week 24, Endpoint in Core Period (last post-baseline value prior to Week 24)</time_frame>
    <description>Trunk fat (kg) was assessed based on DXA results. Trunk fat was defined as fat mass - (total arm fat + total leg fat + total head fat). The outcome as defined in the protocol was the within-patient change from baseline to week 24 in trunk fat.
Due to the early termination of the study, endpoint values are also reported. Endpoint values are the last observed post-baseline value in the Core Period, and are reported for participants who had not reached Week 24.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Insulin-Like Growth Factor 1 Standard Deviation Score (IGF-I SDS) at Baseline, Week 24 and Endpoint in Core Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1, pre-dose), Week 24, Endpoint in Core Period (last post-baseline value prior to Week 24)</time_frame>
    <description>IGF-I SDS, as reported by the central laboratory, was a key secondary variable. The week 24 value is a trough value as it was taken 7 days after the last TV-1106 or placebo injection.
The outcome as defined in the protocol was the within-patient change from baseline to week 24. Due to the early termination of the study, endpoint values are also reported. Endpoint values are the last observed post-baseline value in the Core Period, and are reported for participants who had not reached Week 24.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Scored Analysis of Quality of Life Assessment of GH Deficiency in Adults (QoL-AGHDA) at Baseline, Week 24 and Endpoint in Core Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1, pre-dose), Week 24, Endpoint in Core Period (last post-baseline value prior to Week 24)</time_frame>
    <description>The AGHDA instrument is comprised of 25 questions, with yes or no answers. To each of the 25 questions comprising QOL AGHDA, a score of 1 was assigned if the answer was affirmative and 0 if the answer was negative. Data reported is the total score across the 25 questions for a total range of 0-25 with higher scores representing a poorer quality of life. The outcome as defined in the protocol was the within-patient change from baseline to week 24.
Due to the early termination of the study, endpoint values are also reported. Endpoint values are the last observed post-baseline value in the Core Period, and are reported for participants who had not reached Week 24.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Participants With Adverse Events During the Core Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 up to 24 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that develops or worsens in severity during the conduct of a clinical study and does not necessarily have a causal relationship to the study drug. Severity was rated by the investigator on a scale of mild, moderate and severe, with severe= an AE which prevents usual activities. Relationship of AE to treatment was determined by the investigator. Serious AEs include death, a life-threatening adverse event, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, a congenital anomaly or birth defect, OR an important medical event that jeopardized the patient and required medical intervention to prevent the previously listed serious outcomes.</description>

    <description>TV-1106 was injected subcutaneously once weekly on the same day and time for 24 weeks. A common starting dose was 5.0 mg. Doses could be titrated by an unblinded central reader on weeks 4, 8, 12 and 16 until the participant's insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) standard deviation score (SDS) was within the range of -0.5 to +1.5.</description>

    <description>A starting dose of 5.0 mg was expected to be appropriate for most patients because the daily recommended starting dose of recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) treatments (e.g. somatropin) is 0.2 mg/day, and the conversion factor was 28. Dosage could be titrated by an unblinded central reader on weeks 4, 8, 12 and 16 until the participant's insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) standard deviation score (SDS) was within the range of -0.5 to +1.5.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Of the 46 patients screened, 14 patients at 10 centers located in the US and Europe (Austria, Greece, Hungary) met entry criteria and were considered eligible for randomization. Of the 32 patients not randomly assigned to study treatment, 26 were excluded on the basis of inclusion/exclusion criteria and 6 were excluded for “other” reasons.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants were randomly allocated to 1 of 2 treatment groups (TV-1106 or placebo) in a 2:1 allocation to prevent selection bias.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>An adverse event was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that develops or worsens in severity during the conduct of a clinical study and does not necessarily have a causal relationship to the study drug. Severity was rated by the investigator on a scale of mild, moderate and severe, with severe= an AE which prevents usual activities. Relationship of AE to treatment was determined by the investigator. Serious AEs include death, a life-threatening adverse event, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, a congenital anomaly or birth defect, OR an important medical event that jeopardized the patient and required medical intervention to prevent the previously listed serious outcomes.</description>

          <title>Participants With Adverse Events During the Core Period</title>
          <description>An adverse event was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that develops or worsens in severity during the conduct of a clinical study and does not necessarily have a causal relationship to the study drug. Severity was rated by the investigator on a scale of mild, moderate and severe, with severe= an AE which prevents usual activities. Relationship of AE to treatment was determined by the investigator. Serious AEs include death, a life-threatening adverse event, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, a congenital anomaly or birth defect, OR an important medical event that jeopardized the patient and required medical intervention to prevent the previously listed serious outcomes.</description>

          <description>Placebo was injected subcutaneously once weekly on the same day and time for 24 weeks during the Core Period. To maintain the blind, placebo could be titrated by an unblinded central reader on weeks 4, 8, 12 and 16 to match the effect of dose titration.
Participants who completed the Core Period were eligible to enter an open-label extension phase for 12 additional months where all participants received treatment with TV-1106.</description>

          <description>TV-1106 was injected subcutaneously once weekly on the same day and time for 24 weeks during the Core Period. A common starting dose was 5.0 mg. Doses could be titrated by an unblinded central reader on weeks 4, 8, 12 and 16 until the participant’s insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) standard deviation score (SDS) was within the range of -0.5 to +1.5.

Due to early termination of the study, two participants spent a maximum of two weeks in the extension period.</description>
