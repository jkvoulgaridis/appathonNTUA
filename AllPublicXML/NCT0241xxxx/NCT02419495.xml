    <textblock>
      This phase Ib trial studies the side effects and best dose of selinexor when given together
      with several different standard chemotherapy or immunotherapy regimens in treating patients
      with malignancies that have spread to other places in the body and usually cannot be cured or
      controlled with treatment (advanced). Selinexor may stop the growth of cancer cells by
      blocking enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to
      stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing,
      or by stopping them from spreading. Studying selinexor with different standard chemotherapy
      or immunotherapy regimens may help doctors learn the side effects and best dose of selinexor
      that can be given with different types of treatments in one study.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To establish the safety and tolerability of selinexor when given in combination with
      standard chemotherapy or immunotherapy regimens.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine disease control and progression free survival of selinexor administered with
      standard chemotherapy or immunotherapy treatments.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the correlation of translational biomarkers. II. To compare serial assessment
      of mutation status in biopsies obtained at baseline and progression after clinical response
      to combination therapy.

      III. To assess the efficacy of olanzapine as incorporated in the National Comprehensive
      Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for the management of chemotherapy-induced nausea and
      cachexia.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of selinexor. Patients are assigned to 1 of 13
      treatment arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive selinexor orally (PO) on days 1, 8, and 15 and carboplatin
      intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 cycles in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After 6 cycles, patients can
      continue single agent selinexor until disease progression. (ARM CLOSED)

      ARM B: Patients receive selinexor PO twice weekly (e.g. Monday/Wednesday or Tuesday/Thursday
      or Wednesday/Friday or Thursday/Saturday or Friday/Sunday) on days 1-14. Patients then
      receive selinexor PO on days 1, 3, 8 and 10 and paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on days 1 and 8.
      Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. After 8 cycles, of combination treatment, patients can continue single agent
      selinexor until disease progression.

      ARM C: Patients receive selinexor PO on days 1, 8, and 15 and eribulin mesylate IV over 1
      hour on days 1 and 8. Combination treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 cycles in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After 6 cycles, patients can continue single
      agent selinexor until disease progression.

      ARM D: Patients receive selinexor PO on days 1, 8, and 15, doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over
      90 minutes and cyclophosphamide IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days
      for 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After 6 cycles,
      patients can continue single agent selinexor until disease progression. (ARM CLOSED)

      ARM E: Patients receive selinexor PO on days 1, 8, and 15 and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes
      and paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 8 cycles
      depending on cancer type (6 cycles for non-small cell lung cancer, up to 8 cycles for ovarian
      cancer and other histological malignancies) in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. After 6 to 8 cycles, patients can continue single agent selinexor
      until disease progression. (ARM CLOSED)

      ARM F: Patients receive selinexor PO on days 1, 8, and 15 and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes
      and pemetrexed disodium IV over 10 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6
      cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After 6 cycles,
      patients can continue single agent selinexor until disease progression. (ARM CLOSED)

      ARM G: Patients receive selinexor PO on days 1, 8, and 15 and topotecan hydrochloride IV over
      30 minutes on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 8 cycles in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After 8 cycles, patients can continue single
      agent selinexor until disease progression. (ARM CLOSED)

      ARM H: Patients receive selinexor PO on days 1, 8, 15 and 22, irinotecan hydrochloride IV
      over 90 minutes, fluorouracil continuous IV and leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours on days 1
      and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. After 6 cycles, patients can continue single agent selinexor until
      disease progression. (ARM CLOSED)

      ARM I: Patients receive selinexor PO on days 1, 8 and 15 and irinotecan hydrochloride IV over
      90 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 8 cycles in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After 8 cycles, patients can continue single
      agent selinexor until disease progression. (ARM CLOSED)

      ARM J: Patients receive selinexor PO on days 1, 8 and 15, capecitabine PO twice daily (BID)
      on days 1-14 and oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up
      to 8 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After 8 cycles,
      patients can continue single agent selinexor until disease progression. (ARM CLOSED)

      ARM K: Patients receive selinexor PO on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 and olaparib PO BID on days
      1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. (ARM CLOSED)

      ARM L: Patients receive selinexor PO twice weekly (e.g. Monday/Wednesday or Tuesday/Thursday
      or Wednesday/Friday or Thursday/Saturday or Friday/Sunday) and pembrolizumab IV over 30
      minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM M: Patients receive selinexor PO twice weekly (e.g. Monday/Wednesday or Tuesday/Thursday
      or Wednesday/Friday or Thursday/Saturday or Friday/Sunday) and nivolumab IV over 30 minutes
      on days 1 and 15. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients may continue to receive selinexor and chemotherapy after confirmed progressive
      disease in the absence of clinical deterioration and if the investigator considers that the
      patient continues to receive benefit from the treatment.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks for 1 year.
