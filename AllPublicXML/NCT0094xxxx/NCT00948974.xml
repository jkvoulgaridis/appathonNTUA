      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of two variants of cognitive behavioral
      therapy (CBT) (cognitive therapy (CT) and acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT)), for the
      treatment of generalized social anxiety disorder.

    <textblock>
      We are recruiting a clinical sample of patients who meet diagnostic criteria (per DSM-5) for
      the generalized subtype of social anxiety disorder. Participants are randomly assigned to the
      two active intervention conditions; no placebo or sham treatments will be employed.
      Assessments take place at baseline, pre-treatment, mid-treatment, post-treatment, and at 3-
      and 12-months follow-up; participants also complete a brief weekly assessment of functioning.
      Treatment is administered individually by trained graduate students in clinical psychology,
      directly trained and supervised by the PI and Co-PI. Participants receive 12 weekly 1-hour
      long sessions. The study design is a 2 (treatment condition) by 5 (assessment occasion) mixed
      factorial design.

    <measure>Social Phobia and Anxiety Inventory (SPAI) - Social Phobia Subscale</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline (pre-treatment; immediately prior to beginning treatment); post-treatment (12 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The SPAI social phobia assess symptoms of social anxiety in the presence of (a) strangers, (b) authority figures, (c) members of the opposite sex, and (d) people in general. The subscale ranges from 32 to 192, where higher scores reflect more severe symptoms of social anxiety.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Outcomes Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline (pre-treatment; just before beginning treatment); post-treatment (12 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The Outcomes Questionnaire is a 45-item measure that assesses functioning and is comprised of three subscales: symptom distress, interpersonal relationships, and social role performance, that are combined to create a total score. Scores range from 45 to 180, where higher scores reflect greater levels of dysfunction.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Behavioral Assessment Test</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline (pre-treatment; just prior to beginning treatment); post-treatment (12 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The assessment consists of two role-played interpersonal interactions and an impromptu speech. The role-plays were video recorded for subsequent rating by two independent assessors. Using a 5-point Likert scale (1 = poor and 5 = excellent), assessors rated global social skills, which were comprised of assessments of verbal content (e.g., amount of speech during task and degree to which speech was relevant and appropriate), nonverbal skills (e.g., degree of fidgeting and eye contact; appropriateness of gestures and posture), and paralinguistic skills (e.g., appropriateness of tone, enunciation, inflection, and rate). Prior research has employed this behavioral assessment protocol (Glassman et al., 2016; Herbert et al., 2005). These results reflect global social skills, which reflect the sum of ratings of verbal, nonverbal, and paralinguistic skills. Scores range from 3 to 15 with higher scores reflecting better social skills.</description>

    <description>Cognitive therapy (CT) highlights the identification and reappraisal of distorted or dysfunctional cognitions in the treatment of psychopathology. For example, socially anxious patients are taught to identify the thoughts and underlying beliefs that trigger strong emotional reactions (e.g., &quot;if I attempt to initiate a conversation I'll humiliate myself&quot;), and then replace these with more accurate, functional thoughts. There is a large body of research supporting the efficacy of CT for mood and anxiety disorders, and for social anxiety disorder in particular (Beck, 2005).</description>

    <description>ACT does not attempt to modify cognitions directly, but rather seeks to foster a mindful acceptance of whatever thoughts or feelings arise, while still pursuing specific behavioral goals. For example, the individual would be taught simply to notice the thoughts as if from a distance without attempting to modify them, and initiate a conversation. Like other newer mindfulness and acceptance-based models of CBT, ACT also expands the traditional focus on symptom reduction to include an emphasis on broader life goals. The scientific literature on ACT has expanded rapidly over the past ten years. Recent reviews conclude that it appears to be at least as effective as CT, and may work at least in part via distinct treatment mechanisms (Powers, Zum Vörde Sive Vörding, &amp; Emmelkamp, 2009).</description>

        <title>Social Phobia and Anxiety Inventory (SPAI) - Social Phobia Subscale</title>
        <description>The SPAI social phobia assess symptoms of social anxiety in the presence of (a) strangers, (b) authority figures, (c) members of the opposite sex, and (d) people in general. The subscale ranges from 32 to 192, where higher scores reflect more severe symptoms of social anxiety.</description>

            <description>cognitive therapy and exposure
Cognitive Therapy: Cognitive therapy (CT) highlights the identification and reappraisal of distorted or dysfunctional cognitions in the treatment of psychopathology. For example, socially anxious patients are taught to identify the thoughts and underlying beliefs that trigger strong emotional reactions (e.g., &quot;if I attempt to initiate a conversation I'll humiliate myself&quot;), and then replace these with more accurate, functional thoughts. There is a large body of research supporting the efficacy of CT for mood and anxiety disorders, and for social anxiety disorder in particular (Beck, 2005).</description>

            <description>acceptance and commitment therapy and exposure
Acceptance and Commitment Therapy: ACT does not attempt to modify cognitions directly, but rather seeks to foster a mindful acceptance of whatever thoughts or feelings arise, while still pursuing specific behavioral goals. For example, the individual would be taught simply to notice the thoughts as if from a distance without attempting to modify them, and initiate a conversation. Like other newer mindfulness and acceptance-based models of CBT, ACT also expands the traditional focus on symptom reduction to include an emphasis on broader life goals. The scientific literature on ACT has expanded rapidly over the past ten years. Recent reviews conclude that it appears to be at least as effective as CT, and may work at least in part via distinct treatment mechanisms (Powers, Zum Vörde Sive Vörding, &amp; Emmelkamp, 2009).</description>

        <title>Behavioral Assessment Test</title>
        <description>The assessment consists of two role-played interpersonal interactions and an impromptu speech. The role-plays were video recorded for subsequent rating by two independent assessors. Using a 5-point Likert scale (1 = poor and 5 = excellent), assessors rated global social skills, which were comprised of assessments of verbal content (e.g., amount of speech during task and degree to which speech was relevant and appropriate), nonverbal skills (e.g., degree of fidgeting and eye contact; appropriateness of gestures and posture), and paralinguistic skills (e.g., appropriateness of tone, enunciation, inflection, and rate). Prior research has employed this behavioral assessment protocol (Glassman et al., 2016; Herbert et al., 2005). These results reflect global social skills, which reflect the sum of ratings of verbal, nonverbal, and paralinguistic skills. Scores range from 3 to 15 with higher scores reflecting better social skills.</description>
