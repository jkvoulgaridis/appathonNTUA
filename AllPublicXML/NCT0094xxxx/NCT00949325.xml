  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify a safe dosing regimen for the combination of Torisel
      and liposomal doxorubicin in patients with recurrent sarcoma. A secondary purpose of the
      study is to determine how effective this combination is for the treatment of recurrent
      sarcoma.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The effectiveness of treatments for recurrent sarcomas is quite limited. One hypothesis to
      explain the refractory nature of recurrent sarcomas is the existence of
      chemotherapy-resistant sarcoma stem cells.

    <description>Patients were treated with temsirolimus (Torisel) weekly by IV and with liposomal doxorubicin (Doxil) (standard dose) by IV once every 28 days. Cohorts of patients receive sequentially increasing dose of temsirolimus until dose limiting toxicity (DLT) occurred and the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) was identified. The MTD dose was the standard dose of temsirolimus used for the remainder of the study. Dose modifications were based on protocol parameters for toxicities.</description>

          <description>Single arm consists of temsirolimus (Torisel) plus liposomal doxorubicin (Doxil). Temsirolimus is administered IV in sequentially escalating cohorts at doses between 15 and 50 mg/M2 (body surface area), once weekly. Liposomal doxorubicin is administered IV at 30 mg per M2 (body surface area) once every 28 days. Treatment may continue with both drugs for 2 years. Temsirolimus may continue beyond 2 years.
temsirolimus plus liposomal doxorubicin: Patients will be treated with temsirolimus (Torisel) temsirolimus weekly by iv and with liposomal doxorubicin (Doxil) (standard dose) by iv once every 28 days. Cohorts of patients receive sequentially increasing dose of temsirolimus until maximally tolerated dose (MTD) is reached. Once MTD (standard dose) is achieved, dosing will be with standard doses for each drug, but dosing will be modified based on toxicity.</description>

            <description>Single arm consists of temsirolimus (Torisel) plus liposomal doxorubicin (Doxil). Temsirolimus is administered IV in sequentially escalating cohorts at doses between 15 and 50 mg/M2 (body surface area), once weekly. Liposomal doxorubicin is administered IV at 30 mg per M2 (body surface area) once every 28 days. Treatment may continue with both drugs for 2 years. Temsirolimus may continue beyond 2 years.
temsirolimus plus liposomal doxorubicin: Patients will be treated with temsirolimus (Torisel) temsirolimus weekly by iv and with liposomal doxorubicin (Doxil) (standard dose) by iv once every 28 days. Cohorts of patients receive sequentially increasing dose of temsirolimus until maximally tolerated dose (MTD) is reached. Once MTD (standard dose) is achieved, dosing will be with standard doses for each drug, but dosing will be modified based on toxicity.</description>

          <description>Single arm consists of temsirolimus (Torisel) plus liposomal doxorubicin (Doxil). Temsirolimus is administered IV in sequentially escalating cohorts at doses between 15 and 50 mg/M2 (body surface area), once weekly. Liposomal doxorubicin is administered IV at 30 mg per M2 (body surface area) once every 28 days. Treatment may continue with both drugs for 2 years. Temsirolimus may continue beyond 2 years.
temsirolimus plus liposomal doxorubicin: Patients will be treated with temsirolimus (Torisel) temsirolimus weekly by iv and with liposomal doxorubicin (Doxil) (standard dose) by iv once every 28 days. Cohorts of patients receive sequentially increasing dose of temsirolimus until maximally tolerated dose (MTD) is reached. Once MTD (standard dose) is achieved, dosing will be with standard doses for each drug, but dosing will be modified based on toxicity.</description>
