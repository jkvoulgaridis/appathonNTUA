  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-part study of a compound called PF-05212384 (also known as PKI-587). The
      purpose of part 1 is to identify the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of PF-05212384 using a
      Continual Reassessment Method (CRM). Part 1 will include subjects with any solid tumor. In
      Part 2 two cohorts will be enrolled. One cohort will assess safety, tolerability and
      preliminary efficacy in 20 subjects at the MTD and will include subjects with breast cancer,
      ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, colorectal cancer renal cancer or glioblastoma (a type of
      brain tumor). The other cohort will include 5 to 15 subjects with any type of tumor who
      consent to provide tumor biopsies while participating in the study.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (AEs) or Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Cycle 14 (each cycle is 28 days)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent were events between first dose of study drug and up to Cycle 14, that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pre-treatment state. AEs included both serious and non-serious adverse events.</description>

    <description>Treatment-related AE was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to study drug in a participant who received study drug. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent are events between first dose of study drug and up to Cycle 14, that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. Relatedness to drug was assessed by the investigator. Participants with multiple occurrences of an AE within a category were counted once within the category. AEs included both serious and non-serious adverse events.</description>

        <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent were events between first dose of study drug and up to Cycle 14, that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pre-treatment state. AEs included both serious and non-serious adverse events.</description>

An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent were events between first dose of study drug and up to Cycle 14, that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pre-treatment state.

        <description>Treatment-related AE was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to study drug in a participant who received study drug. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent are events between first dose of study drug and up to Cycle 14, that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. Relatedness to drug was assessed by the investigator. Participants with multiple occurrences of an AE within a category were counted once within the category.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Fresh Tumor Biopsy Biomarkers at Cycle 1 Day 22</title>
        <description>Tumor biopsies were taken from participants of reporting arm PF-05212384 154 mg dose level at baseline and at Cycle 1/Day 22. Biopsies were fixed in optimal cutting temperature compound and analyzed via RPMA. The biomarkers tested were phosphorylated versions of the proteins: AKT S473, AKT T308, FKHR T24 / FKHR1 T32, and STAT3. This outcome measure was planned to be analyzed only for the reporting arm Part 1 and 2: PF-05212384 154 mg, as pre-specified in protocol.</description>
