      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays and other types of radiation to kill
      tumor cells. It is not yet known whether a single dose of radiation therapy is more effective
      than implant radiation therapy for 5 days in treating patients with recurrent breast cancer.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying implant radiation therapy to see how well it works
      compared with radiation therapy during surgery in treating patients with recurrent breast
      cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine the in breast recurrence rate following repeat radiation to the breast.
           These patients will be followed for a period of five years following completion of
           radiation to determine these rates.

        -  To determine the cosmetic outcome resulting from partial breast re-irradiation using
           different techniques, including both physician and patient rated scales.

        -  To determine patient satisfaction of partial breast re-irradiation as it pertains to
           their overall treatment experience, as measured by a questionnaire.

        -  To determine if there are patient factors illuminated during a discussion of informed
           consent, which limit a patient's suitability to receive partial breast re-irradiation
           delivered by a particular technique.

        -  To evaluate tylectomy wound healing and overall complication rate after partial breast
           re-irradiation.

        -  To determine ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence rates and tumor bed recurrence
           rates.These patients will be followed for a period of five years following completion of
           the second course of radiation to determine these rates.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to which modality is best suited for the patient.
      Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups.

      All patients undergo excisional biopsy or needle localization removal of the tumor. Patients
      with margins &lt; 2 mm undergo re-excision of the biopsy cavity.

        -  Group 1: Patients undergo partial breast irradiation delivered as a single
           intra-operative radiation dose to the tumor bed.

        -  Group 2: Patients undergo partial breast irradiation delivered by Mammosite®
           brachytherapy consisting of 10 fractions over 5 days.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, 1 month after completion of radiotherapy, and then
      at follow-up visits.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 month, every 3 months for
      1 year, and then every 6 months for 5 years.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients' recurrences must have histologically confirmed ductal carcinoma in-situ,
             invasive ductal, medullary, papillary, colloid (mucinous), or tubular histologies.

          -  Lesion size ≤ 3 cm treated with a tylectomy and whole breast irradiation (with or
             without tumor bed boost)

          -  Unifocal breast cancer recurrence

          -  Negative resection margins with at least a 2 mm margin from invasive and in situ
             cancer or a negative re-excision

          -  Hormonal therapy is allowed. If chemotherapy is planned, the radiation is delivered
             first and chemotherapy must begin no earlier than two weeks following completion of
             radiation.

          -  Signed study-specific informed consent prior to study entry.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with distant metastatic disease

          -  Patients with invasive lobular carcinoma, extensive lobular carcinoma in-situ,
             extensive ductal carcinoma in-situ (spanning more than 3 cm), or nonepithelial breast
             malignancies such as lymphoma or sarcoma.

          -  Patients with multicentric carcinoma (tumors in different quadrants of the breast or
             tumors separated by at least 4 cm). Palpable or radiographically suspicious
             contralateral axillary, ipsilateral or contralateral supraclavicular, infraclavicular,
             or internal mammary lymph nodes unless these are histologically or cytologically
             confirmed negative.

          -  Extensive intraductal component (EIC) by the Harvard definition, i.e. 1) more than 25%
             of the invasive tumor is DCIS and DCIS present in adjacent breast tissue. Presence of
             an EIC increases the chance of local recurrence, and as such, one might not be a
             candidate for repeat breast conservation.

          -  Patients with Paget's disease of the nipple.

          -  Patients with skin involvement.

          -  Patients with collagen vascular disorders, specifically systemic lupus erythematosis,
             scleroderma, or dermatomyositis.

          -  Patients with psychiatric, neurologic, or addictive disorders that would preclude
             obtaining informed consent.

          -  Other malignancy, except non-melanomatous skin cancer, &lt; 5 years prior to
             participation in this study.

          -  Patients who are pregnant or lactating due to potential fetal exposure to radiation
             and unknown effects of radiation on lactating females.

          -  Patients with known BRCA 1/BRCA 2 mutations.
