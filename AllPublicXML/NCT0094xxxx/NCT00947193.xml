  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemophilia A (HA) and hemophilia B (HB) are inherited bleeding disorders caused by mutations
      in the gene for factor VIII (FVIII) and factor IX (FIX), respectively. These proteins are
      essential for blood clotting. The lack of FVIII/FIX can produce bleeding episodes that cause
      damage of the bone, muscles, joints, and tissues. A specific type of mutation, called a
      nonsense (premature stop codon) mutation, is the cause of the disease in approximately 10-30%
      of participants with hemophilia and results in severe manifestations. Ataluren (PTC124) is an
      orally delivered, investigational drug that acts to overcome the effects of the premature
      stop codon, potentially enabling the production of functional FVIII/FIX. This study is a
      Phase 2a trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of ataluren in participants with HA or HB
      due to a nonsense mutation. The main purpose of this study is to understand whether ataluren
      can safely increase FVIII/FIX activity levels.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, participants with hemophilia A or hemophilia B due to a nonsense mutation were
      treated with an investigational drug called ataluren (PTC124). Evaluation procedures to
      determine if a participant qualifies for the study was performed within 14 days prior to the
      start of treatment. Eligible participants who elected to enroll in the study then
      participated in a 28-day treatment period. Within the 28-day period, ataluren (PTC124)
      treatment was to be taken for 2 cycles of 14 days each 3 times per day with meals at a dose
      level of 5, 5, 10 milligrams/kilograms (mg/kg) in the first cycle and a dose level of 20, 20,
      40 mg/kg in the second cycle. After the first 14-day cycle, study doses were changed to 10
      mg/kg (morning), 10 mg/kg (midday), and 20 mg/kg (evening) and the doses were administered
      for 1 cycle only. Then, there was an interval of approximately 14 days without treatment.
      During the study, ataluren (PTC124) efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics were evaluated
      periodically with measurement of FVIII/FIX activity and inhibitor levels, other blood tests,
      and urinalysis.

    <measure>Number of Participants With a Change From Baseline in Plasma Anti-FVIII/FIX Inhibitor Titers at Day 14</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the change from Baseline in plasma anti-FVIII/FIX inhibitor titers, it was determined if any potential antibodies were neutralizing using the Bethesda assay. The Bethesda assay demonstrates antibodies that are neutralizing by quantifying residual FVIII/FIX activity in normal plasma after serial dilutions with participant plasma. For this assay, the neutralizing antibody threshold value was 0.6 Bethesda units (BU).</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Treatment Emergent Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) by Severity and Relationship to Study Drug</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>The relationship of TEAEs and SAEs to the study drugs was assessed as: probable related, possible related, unlikely related, and unrelated. The severity of TEAEs were graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 3.0, as: Grade 1 (mild), Grade 2 (moderate), Grade 3 (severe), Grade 4 (life-threatening), or Grade 5 (fatal). A summary of other non-serious adverse events (AEs) and all serious AEs, regardless of causality is located in Reported AE section.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With a Clinically Meaningful Abnormal Clinical Laboratory (Hematology, Adrenal Assays, Biochemistry, and Urinalysis) Parameters</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>The Investigator used his/her judgment in determining whether an abnormality was clinically significant, diagnostic evaluation was warranted, and potential interruption of ataluren was appropriate. Life-threatening (Grade 4) or severe (Grade 3) laboratory abnormalities were considered dose-limiting, although recurrent or persistent moderate (Grade 2) events were also considered dose-limiting in certain circumstances. Values considered abnormal included -Hematology: Serum total bilirubin Grade 2 (&gt;1.5-3.0*upper limit of normal [ULN]) and Serum alanine aminotransferase, Serum aspartate aminotransferase, and Serum gamma glutamyl transferase Grade 2 (&gt;2.5-3.0*ULN); -Adrenal: Plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone &gt;ULN (and cortisol within normal limits); and -Renal: serum creatinine Grade 1 (&gt;ULN-1.5*ULN) and Serum blood urea nitrogen ≥1.5-3.0*ULN. A summary of other non-serious AEs and all serious AEs, regardless of causality is located in Reported AE section.</description>

The dose level for ataluren was 5 mg/kg in the morning, 5 mg/kg at midday, and 10 mg/kg in the evening or 10 mg/kg in the morning, 10 mg/kg at midday, and 20 mg/kg in the evening for 14 days, followed by an interval of 14 days without treatment.</description>

        <description>To assess the change from Baseline in plasma anti-FVIII/FIX inhibitor titers, it was determined if any potential antibodies were neutralizing using the Bethesda assay. The Bethesda assay demonstrates antibodies that are neutralizing by quantifying residual FVIII/FIX activity in normal plasma after serial dilutions with participant plasma. For this assay, the neutralizing antibody threshold value was 0.6 Bethesda units (BU).</description>
