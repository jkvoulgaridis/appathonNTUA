  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate deferasirox and placebo with regard to event-free
      survival (EFS) (a composite primary endpoint including death and non-fatal events related to
      cardiac and liver function and transformation to AML) in patients with myelodysplastic
      syndromes (low/int-1 risk) and transfusional iron overload.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A screening period lasting up to 35 days with two screening visits (Visit 1 and Visit 2 - at
      least 14 days apart) was used to assess patient eligibility. Eligible patients were
      randomized in a 2:1 ratio in deferasirox and placebo arms respectively. All patients who were
      randomized in this study started study treatment at 10 mg/kg/day and could be titrated up to
      40 mg/kg/day based on dose modification guidelines.

      Patients who met a non-fatal event, as specified in the protocol, discontinued from the study
      treatment and were followed for safety (28 days) and then evaluated with visits every three
      months if they agreed to move into the post treatment evaluation phase. Subsequent to the
      evaluation period, or at the end of treatment if a patient and treating physician decided
      that a patient would not participate in the evaluation period, patients were followed by
      phone monitoring every six months for their need for iron chelation therapy (ICT) and
      survival follow-up (OS) until study end.

      Patients who did not meet a non-fatal event continued study treatment as long as the patient
      and the treating physician felt it was in the best interest for the patient or until the
      study terminated. After termination of study treatment, all patients continued to be followed
      for safety and endpoints during the evaluation period at visits occurring every three months.
      Subsequent to the evaluation period, or at the end of treatment if a patient and treating
      physician decided that a patient would not participate in the evaluation period, patients
      were followed every 6 months for ICTs and OS.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of patients with hypothyroidism</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Year 5</time_frame>
    <description>As assessed by annual measurement of TSH and free T4. Hypothyroidism is defned as follows:

    <measure>Proportion of patients with worsening of glucose metabolism</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Year 5</time_frame>
    <description>An annual oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was carried out. The proportion of patients with an increase in glucose metabolism category (normal, impaired glucose metabolism, diabetes mellitus) based on the American Diabetes Association criteria (American Diabetes Association 2009) compared to their baseline result was determined.
