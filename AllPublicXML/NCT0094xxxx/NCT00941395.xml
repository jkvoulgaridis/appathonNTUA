      This trial studies how well a new smoking cessation and prevention intervention works in
      enhancing smoking cessation for university students. The new intervention may be easier to
      use for students to quit smoke.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To establish the feasibility of a new smoking cessation and prevention intervention
      including two new modules addressing alcohol use and depression.

      II. Demonstrate the feasibility of a smoking prevention website.

      OUTLINE: Participants are assigned to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Participants who currently smoke complete a survey over 30 minutes and discuss the
      survey results with the counselor over 30 minutes at week 2. Participants also complete 3
      internet surveys over 20 minutes.

      ARM II: Participants who currently do not smoke complete a survey over 30 minutes and discuss
      the survey results with the counselor over 30 minutes at week 2.

      After completion of study, participants are followed up at 3 months.
