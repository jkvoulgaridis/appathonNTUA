    <textblock>
      Background:

        -  Bronchiectasis is a disease characterized by airways that are inflamed, abnormally
           dilated, and chronically infected. Individuals with bronchiectasis have a history of
           chronic and recurring respiratory infections. Depending on the underlying cause, these
           infections may involve the entire respiratory tract, resulting in sinus, ear, and lung
           disease.

        -  Bronchiectasis continues to be a significant problem in developing countries and in
           specific groups of individuals, particularly in people who have cystic fibrosis.
           Although treatments are available or under development for bronchiectasis related to
           cystic fibrosis, many of the disease-specific treatments may not be effective for
           bronchiectasis not related to cystic fibrosis.

      Objectives:

      - To study the natural history of bronchiectasis to identify inherited and immune factors
      that may explain why certain individuals have chronic recurring infections.

      Eligibility:

        -  Individuals 5 years of age and older who have an established diagnosis of bronchiectasis
           or a history of chronic/recurring respiratory infections.

        -  Direct family members (e.g., parents, siblings, children) of patients in the study may
           also be asked to participate.

      Design:

        -  Potential participants will be screened with an initial clinic evaluation and full
           medical history, as well as a general quality of life and respiratory symptom
           questionnaire.

        -  The following standard procedures may be done as part of the study: air sampling from
           the nose; imaging studies, which may include an x-ray or computed tomography (CT), lung
           function tests; and collection of samples of blood, urine, and sputum (phlegm or mucus).
           Other tests may be performed as required by the researchers, and will be explained to
           patients as needed.

        -  Both patients and relatives (if asked to participate) will provide the following
           samples: blood or buccal (cheek swab) cells for genetic testing, sputum, and urine.

        -  To prevent infections and potential disease progression, patients may receive standard
           medical care and treatment for bronchiectasis and related infections during this
           protocol.

        -  Patients older than 18 years of age will be invited to join the Bronchiectasis Research
           Registry, a program supported by the Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)
           Foundation. The purpose of the program is to identify a group of people who are
           interested in receiving information about research studies focused on bronchiectasis and
           possibly participating in these research studies. Participants may be offered the
           opportunity to participate in selected clinic trials related to bronchiectasis or
           related medical conditions.

    <textblock>
      Bronchiectasis, or abnormal dilation of the airways, is a condition typically characterized
      by chronic and recurring respiratory tract infections. Frequently, depending on the
      underlying cause, these infections involve the entire respiratory tract resulting in sinus,
      ear, and lung disease. This condition used to be more common in children prior to
      immunizations for childhood infections. It continues to be a significant problem in
      developing countries and in specific groups of individuals in the U.S. Cystic fibrosis (CF)
      is the most commonly associated genetic condition and tremendous strides have been made in
      recent years in understanding the mechanisms of this disease that are leading to a multitude
      of emerging novel treatment strategies. The mechanisms of other causes for bronchiectasis
      have not evolved to this degree, and many of the disease-specific treatments being assessed
      for cystic fibrosis may not be effective for non-CF bronchiectasis. Often bronchiectasis can
      be associated with chronic infections from environmental germs such as the nontuberculous
      mycobacteria.

        -  PARTICIPANT INCLUSION CRITERIA:

               1. Children age 5 years and above and adults referred to the NIH with chronic or
                  recurring respiratory infections will be eligible for participation.

               2. Males and females will be considered without regard to race or ethnicity or upper
                  age limit.

               3. Emphasis will be primarily on non CF bronchiectasis for elucidation of mechanisms
                  of infection susceptibility. However, select patients with cystic fibrosis or
                  acquired immune defects (such as HIV) may be studied if relevant host defects are
                  suspected or if needed for comparison purposes or to evaluate and study the
                  management of chronic pathogen associated conditions such as nontuberculous
                  mycobacterial infections or allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.

               4. Subjects must have a primary or referring physician

               5. Subjects must be willing to have samples stored

        INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR RELATIVES:

        As a part of this protocol we may obtain blood, sputum, urine, or buccal swabs from some
        blood relatives of patients on the study, with the hope of isolating and characterizing the
        primary host defense defect(s) or genetic links responsible for airway infection
        susceptibility and/or bronchiectasis seen within families. Male and female relatives will
        be accepted without limitation due to age. These relatives may have pertinent
        disease-related history obtained, but will neither receive treatment nor have any other
        protocol procedures done unless they are enrolled on the study.

        PARTICIPANT EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. We wish to avoid enrolling subjects, especially children, who have common respiratory
             problems (aeroallergen sensitivity, asthma, gastric esophageal reflux) that are not
             associated with an underlying abnormality in host defenses. Evidence of significance
             of chronic or recurring infections suggestive of an underlying airway surface or
             systemic host defense defect should be documented by one or more of the following: a)
             sinus or lower airway cultures positive for bacterial, fungal, or mycobacterial
             pathogens characteristic of these defects; or b) radiographic evidence of sinusitis
             with mucosal thickening and/or air-fluid levels; or c) radiographic evidence of
             bronchiectasis; d) severity of otitis media requiring placement of tympanic membrane
             pressure equalization tubes; e) severity of sinusitis requiring surgical intervention.

          2. Patients who are unable or unwilling to provide informed consent either directly or
             via appropriately designated surrogate.

          3. Any patient who, in the opinion of the Investigator, is unable or unwilling to comply
             with regular follow-up or is unlikely to provide pertinent information regarding
             disease progression or response to treatment may be excluded from longitudinal
             follow-up.

          4. Children under the age of 5 will be excluded from this protocol.

        When a pediatric subject reaches age 18, continued participation will require reconsenting
        with the adult consent document.
