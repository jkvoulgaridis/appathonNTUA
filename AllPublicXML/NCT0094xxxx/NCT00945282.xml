  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK has in-licensed a novel NNRTI-class candidate (GSK2248761, IDX12899) for the treatment of
      subjects with HIV-1 infection from Idenix Pharmaceuticals. Idenix Pharmaceuticals completed a
      proof-of-concept study evaluating GSK2248761 monotherapy over seven days in forty
      treatment-na√Øve subjects infected with HIV-1. GSK2248761 doses sequentially evaluated were
      800 mg QD, 400 mg QD, 200 mg QD and 100mg QD.

      This study will evaluate a lower dose, or doses, of GSK2248761 to better characterize the
      dose-response and concentration-response curves. The results from this study will be used to
      select doses for future clinical studies in HIV-1 infected subjects.

    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or is an important medical events that jeopardize the participants or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition, or a drug-induced liver injury.</description>

    <description>The pre-dose GSK2248761 steady state concentration, following repeated dose administration from Day 2 through Day 7 was assessed. Serial dose sampling was done on each day of Day 2, 3, 4, 5 and Day 6 and for Day 7 (Pre-dose and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16 and 24 hours postdose), before the administration of the study drug daily.</description>

    <description>Data for IDX899 100 mg, IDX899 200 mg, IDX899 400 mg and IDX899 800 mg for Day 1 and Day 2 were taken from the Idenix NV-05A-002 study which were combined with GSK2248761 30 mg once daily data from this study, to assess the dose proportionality. The dose proportionality occurred when increase in the administered doses were accompanied by proportional increases in measure of exposure of the drug in the plasma PK parameters like AUC, Cmax, Ctau and other factors. The dose proportionality effects of IDX899 100 mg, IDX899 200 mg, IDX899 400 mg and IDX899 800 mg, following repeat dose administration on Day 7 for the PK parameter AUC(0-tau) has been reported.</description>

        <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or is an important medical events that jeopardize the participants or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition, or a drug-induced liver injury.</description>

        <description>The data for hematology parameter red blood cell count, for the change from baseline was reported. The change from baseline was calculated by subtracting the baseline values from the individual post-randomization values. Baseline (pre-dose [Screening, Day -1 or Day 1]) was defined as last available scheduled assessment prior to time of the first dose unless it is specified otherwise.</description>

The change from baseline was calculated by subtracting the baseline values from the individual post-randomization values. Baseline (pre-dose [Screening, Day -1 or Day 1]) was defined as last available scheduled assessment prior to time of the first dose unless it is specified otherwise.</description>

        <description>Vital sign measurements for SBP and DBP after sitting for 5 minutes were measured. The change from baseline was calculated by subtracting the baseline values from the individual post-randomization values. Baseline (pre-dose [Screening, Day -1 or Day 1]) was defined as last available scheduled assessment prior to time of the first dose unless it is specified otherwise.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline Through Day 8 in Plasma HIV-1 RNA</title>
        <description>The quantitative analysis of plasma was done to evaluate the amount of HIV-1 RNA at Day 1,2,3,4,5,6,7, 8 and End of treatment visit. The quantification was done using a Polymerase chain reactor (PCR). The change from baseline was calculated by subtracting the baseline values from the individual post-randomization values. Baseline (pre-dose Day 1) was defined as last available scheduled assessment prior to time of the first dose unless it is specified otherwise.</description>

        <description>Cmax represents the maximum concentration of GSK2248761 in the plasma. C24 is defined as the measure of plasma drug concentration of GSK2248761, 24 hours post dose, determined on Day 1. Serial blood samples were collected on Pre-dose and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16 and 24 hours postdose on Day 1 and used for analysis.Data for dose normalized Cmax and C24 was reported.</description>
