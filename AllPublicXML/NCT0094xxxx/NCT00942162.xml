  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the clinical activity of the GSK2132231A
      immunotherapeutic in patients with MAGE-A3 positive unresectable metastatic melanoma
      presenting with the predictive gene signature.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, patients were to receive a maximum of 24 doses of recMAGE-A3 + AS15 according
      four cycles over a period of four years. An active follow-phase (up to five years after
      registration into the study) was planned for all patients.

      As of Amendment 2, there will no longer be an active follow-up of patients after
      discontinuation or completion of the treatment. The study will end approximately 30 days
      after the last dose will be administered.

      In addition, no more biological samples will be collected for protocol research purposes. For
      each biological sample already collected in the scope of this study and not tested yet,
      testing will not be performed by default, except if a scientific rationale remains relevant.

      Blood sampling for safety monitoring as per protocol will continue.

    <measure>One-year Overall Survival Rate (OSR) Estimated by Complete Case Method</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 0 - Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>The 1-year overall survival rate (OSR) in the GS+ Population would be above 50% (target = 71%), a percentage which was reported together with its 95% confidence interval (CI). Maximum 1-year OSR of any currently available treatment in the MAGE-A3-positive population = 50% (P0). This median OS of 12 months is based on the observed median OS for MAGE-A3-positive patients, whose tumor did not present the predictive GS. The target 1-year OSR for patients presenting the predictive GS = 71% (P1). This corresponds to a median OS of 24 months when assuming an exponential distribution of OS.</description>

    <measure>Number of Patients Reported With Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 0 - Month 49</time_frame>
    <description>Serious adverse events (SAEs) assessed included medical occurrences that result in death, are life threatening, require hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization or result in disability/ incapacity. Any new primary cancer (non-related to the cancer under study) was reported as an SAE.</description>

    <measure>Number of Patients With Diseases Characteristics by GS</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 0 - Month 49</time_frame>
    <description>Cancer staging (characteristics and categories) as by the categorization by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Staging Manual 2002: &quot;Stage IIIA patients have up to three microscopic nodal metastases arising from a non-ulcerating primary melanoma and have an ' intermediate risk' for distant metastases and melanom-specific survival. Stage IIIB patients have up to three microscopic nodal metastases arising from a non-ulcerating melanoma or have up to three microscopic nodal metastases arising from an ulcerating melanoma, or have intralymphatic metastases without nodal metastases. They constitute a 'high-risk' group prognostically.&quot; The remaining patients with regional melanoma are Stage IIIC patients are at 'very high risk' for distant metastases and melanoma-specific mortality. Stage IV melanoma patients have metastasis at any distant site and constitute the group with the worst prognosis. Stage MC patients are those with confirmed missing cancer.</description>

    <measure>Progression-free Survival (PFS) by GS</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 0 - Month 24</time_frame>
    <description>From study start (Month 0) to Month 24, each patient was censored out of the analysis at 1st report of disease progression or death. PFS was defined and calculated as the time from first treatment to either the first progression of the disease or the date of death, whichever occurred first. Patients still alive with no evidence of disease progression at the time of their last visit or for whom date of first documented progression was not applicable, were censored at the time of the last examination.</description>

    <measure>Progression-free Survival (PFS) Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 6, Month 12, Month 24</time_frame>
    <description>PFS was defined as the time from the date of registration of the patient to either the date of disease progression or the date of death, whichever comes first. Patients alive and without disease progression were censored at the date of their last tumor evaluation. The PFS rate was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. The rate estimated the percentage of patients who did not progress and were alive at a given time.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS) by GS</measure>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Best Overall Response (BOR) by GS</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 0 - Month 24</time_frame>
    <description>The BOR was the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/ recurrence, except for confirmed objective response, which was reported as BOR independently of its time of occurrence. Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI and/or CT: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), &gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions without any new lesions and/or progression of existing non-target lesions; Stable Disease (SD), neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for a Partial Response nor sufficient increase to qualify for Progression of Disease (PD) without any new lesions and/or progression of existing non-target lesions; PD, &gt;=20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions; NE = Non-evaluable response.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response (CR or PR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 0 - Month 24</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of response was measured from the time when the measurement criteria for CR/ PR (whichever was recorded first) were met until the first date that recurrent or PD was objectively documented (taking as reference for PD the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). Note: As there was only one patient analysed in the MAGE-A3 GS- Group, the median duration of response was not calculated for this latter group.</description>

    <time_frame>Month 0 - Month 24</time_frame>
    <description>The duration of stable disease (SD), or TTP, was tabulated for patients whose best response was SD. The minimal time interval required between 2 measurements for determination of SD was 12 weeks.</description>

        <title>One-year Overall Survival Rate (OSR) Estimated by Complete Case Method</title>
        <description>The 1-year overall survival rate (OSR) in the GS+ Population would be above 50% (target = 71%), a percentage which was reported together with its 95% confidence interval (CI). Maximum 1-year OSR of any currently available treatment in the MAGE-A3-positive population = 50% (P0). This median OS of 12 months is based on the observed median OS for MAGE-A3-positive patients, whose tumor did not present the predictive GS. The target 1-year OSR for patients presenting the predictive GS = 71% (P1). This corresponds to a median OS of 24 months when assuming an exponential distribution of OS.</description>

        <population>The analysis was performed on the Total Treated Population (TTP), which included all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment, but did not include patients who dropped out from the study (i.e. patients alive at the last evaluation visit and followed for less than 1 year at first database freeze).</population>

          <title>One-year Overall Survival Rate (OSR) Estimated by Complete Case Method</title>
          <description>The 1-year overall survival rate (OSR) in the GS+ Population would be above 50% (target = 71%), a percentage which was reported together with its 95% confidence interval (CI). Maximum 1-year OSR of any currently available treatment in the MAGE-A3-positive population = 50% (P0). This median OS of 12 months is based on the observed median OS for MAGE-A3-positive patients, whose tumor did not present the predictive GS. The target 1-year OSR for patients presenting the predictive GS = 71% (P1). This corresponds to a median OS of 24 months when assuming an exponential distribution of OS.</description>
