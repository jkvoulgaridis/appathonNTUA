      The proposed study evaluates the effectiveness of a family-based psychosocial treatment
      program for teens with ADHD (Supporting Teens' Academic Needs Daily; STAND) developed to be
      delivered in community settings. STAND is BT enhanced by Motivational Interviewing (MI) that
      was developed (R34 MH092466) for teens with ADHD through a stakeholder informed process.
      STAND consists of ten 50-minute sessions delivered by therapists with community-typical
      levels of training and supervision. Across randomized controlled pilot (N=28; N=36) and
      efficacy trials (N=128), STAND demonstrates medium to large effects on ADHD and ODD symptoms
      and indices of academic and family impairment. In the proposed study, 300 adolescents with
      ADHD who present for treatment at one of four community mental health agencies in Miami-Dade
      County, FL will be randomly assigned to STAND or agency usual care (UC). Participating agency
      therapists also will be randomly assigned to deliver STAND or UC. STAND therapists will
      receive a comprehensive treatment manual, three-day training, and weekly supervision from a
      project psychologist. Participants will be screened by research staff in the community
      setting and enrolled on a rolling basis over 30 months. Participants will be assessed at
      baseline, post-treatment, and three-month follow-up. In line with RDoC, multi-method measures
      will be obtained for treatment outcome (family and academic impairment), treatment mediators
      (executive functioning, parent academic involvement, parent-teen communication,
      parent/adolescent motivation, ADHD symptoms), and moderators of effectiveness (patient,
      practitioner, service delivery, and organization characteristics). Additional consumer
      perspective (satisfaction, therapeutic alliance) and agency fit (therapist competence,
      treatment fidelity, need for additional treatment, attendance, therapist attitude toward
      treatment, cost effectiveness) measures will also be obtained to evaluate effectiveness. We
      will recruit an ethnically diverse sample (65% Hispanic, 19% African-American, 16%
      Non-Hispanic White) that is historically underrepresented in research, but ideal for
      evaluating therapy effectiveness.
