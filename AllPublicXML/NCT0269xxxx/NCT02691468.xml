    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare difference of displacement between Polyvinyl
      Chloride(PVC) and Silicon double-lumen endobronchial tubes(DLTs) during changing position
      from supine to lateral in thoracic surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung isolation and differential lung ventilation, resulting in collapse of operative lung and
      ventilation of non-operating lung (one lung ventilation; OLV) are essential for thoracic
      surgery in lung, esophagus and thoracic aorta.

      DLT, consisted of tracheal and bronchial lumens, is commonly used to perform differential
      lung ventilation. The correct position of each lumen in trachea and main bronchus is
      essential for successful OLV. However, DLT displacement occurs commonly while patients are
      changed position from the supine to the lateral. The deleterious consequences of a
      malpositioned DLT can be substantial, even life-threatening including severe hypoxemia.

      Considering displacement of DLT during position change and surgical traction, previous
      studies recommended endobronchial cuff of DLT should be positioned at 0.5cm below the
      tracheal carina when using left-sided DLT. However, it is based on the data from several
      research conducted by PVC DLT.

      These days, Silicon DLT, different in material from PVC DLT, is also widely used in clinical
      practice. Silicon DLT is different in not only position of ballon but also distance of each
      lumen. Furthermore,there are no identified studies about the displacement of silicon DLT
      during patient position change in thoracic surgery.

      Therefore, it is necessary to measure the movement of silicon DLT during positional change
      from supine to lateral for finding the proper positioning of DLT.

      The investigators compare the difference of displacement between PVC DLT and silicon DLT
      distance during positional change from supine to lateral by fiberotic bronchoscope. And the
      investigators try to find proper position of PVC and silicon DLT, respectively, to perform
      safe and successful OLV during thoracic surgery.

    <description>The tracheal distance was defined as the distance between the distal tip of the tracheal lumen and tracheal carina whereas the bronchial distance was defined as that between the bronchial carina and distal tip of endobronchial lumen. The displacement of DLT was determined by changes in tracheal and bronchial distances, obtained by subtracting supine measurements from lateral measurements and subtracting measurements at start of surgery from measurements at the end of surgery, respectively. Clinically significant displacement was defined when the DLT was deviated by more than 10 mm from the initial correct position, regardless of the direction of displacement.</description>

The first set of measurements tracheal distance(from tracheal carina to proximal tip of DLT) and bronchial distance(from bronchial carina to distal tip of DLT) measured by bronchoscope is taken in supine position .
The second set of measurements is taken in lateral position after position change.
The displacement of PVC DLT is calculated from difference in tracheal distance between supine and lateral position.</description>

        <title>the Incidence of Clinically Significant Displacement of DLTs During Change of Patient Position</title>
        <description>The tracheal distance was defined as the distance between the distal tip of the tracheal lumen and tracheal carina whereas the bronchial distance was defined as that between the bronchial carina and distal tip of endobronchial lumen. The displacement of DLT was determined by changes in tracheal and bronchial distances, obtained by subtracting supine measurements from lateral measurements and subtracting measurements at start of surgery from measurements at the end of surgery, respectively. Clinically significant displacement was defined when the DLT was deviated by more than 10 mm from the initial correct position, regardless of the direction of displacement.</description>
