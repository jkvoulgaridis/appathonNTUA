  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a titration arm of tanezumab
      in which treatment is started at a lower dose (2.5 mg) and increased to a higher dose (5 mg)
      at Week 8, compared to giving 2 doses of tanezumab 2.5 mg or 2 doses of placebo. The study
      also evaluates the safety of the treatment regimens.

    <description>EQ-5D-5L is a standardized participant completed questionnaire that measures health-related quality of life and translates that score into an index value or utility score. EQ-5D-5L consists of two components: a health state profile and an optional visual analogue scale (VAS). EQ-5D health state profile is comprised of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: 1=no problems, 2=slight problems, 3=moderate problems, 4=severe problems, and 5=extreme problems. The health utility score for a patient with no problems in all 5 items is 1 for all countries (except for Zimbabwe where it is 0.9), and is reduced where a patient reports greater levels of problems across the five dimensions.</description>

        <description>WOMAC: self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with osteoarthritis. The WOMAC pain subscale is a 5-item questionnaire used to assess the amount of pain experienced due to osteoarthritis of index joint (knee or hip) during past 48 hours. It was calculated as the mean of scores from 5 individual questions scored on a numerical rating scale (NRS) of 0 (no pain) to 10 (extreme pain), where higher scores indicated higher pain.</description>

        <description>WOMAC: self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with osteoarthritis. Physical function refers to participant's ability to move around and perform usual activities of daily living. The WOMAC physical function subscale is a 17-item questionnaire used to assess the degree of difficulty experienced due to osteoarthritis in index joint (knee or hip) during past 48 hours. It was calculated as mean of the scores from 17 individual questions scored on a NRS of 0 (minimum difficulty) to 10 (extreme difficulty), where higher scores indicated extreme difficulty/worse physical function.</description>

The WOMAC pain subscale is a 5-item questionnaire used to assess the amount of pain experienced due to osteoarthritis of index joint (knee or hip) during past 48 hours. It was calculated as the mean of scores from 5 individual questions scored on NRS of 0 (no pain) to 10 (extreme pain), where higher scores indicated higher pain.</description>

        <description>WOMAC: self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with osteoarthritis. The WOMAC pain subscale is a 5-item questionnaire used to assess the amount of pain experienced due to osteoarthritis of index joint (knee or hip) during past 48 hours. It was calculated as the mean of scores from 5 individual questions scored on NRS of 0 (no pain) to 10 (extreme pain), where higher scores indicated higher pain.</description>

        <description>WOMAC: self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with osteoarthritis. Physical function refers to participant's ability to move around and perform usual activities of daily living. The WOMAC physical function subscale is a 17-item questionnaire used to assess the degree of difficulty experienced due to osteoarthritis in index joint (knee or hip) during past 48 hours. It was calculated as mean of the scores from 17 individual questions scored on a NRS of 0 (minimum difficulty) to 10 (extreme difficulty), where higher scores indicated extreme difficulty/worse physical function.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Physical Function Subscale at Week 24</title>
        <description>WOMAC: self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with osteoarthritis. Physical function refers to participant's ability to move around and perform usual activities of daily living. The WOMAC physical function subscale is a 17-item questionnaire used to assess the degree of difficulty experienced due to osteoarthritis in index joint (knee or hip) during past 48 hours. It was calculated as mean of the scores from 17 individual questions scored on a NRS of 0 (minimum difficulty) to 10 (extreme difficulty), where higher scores indicated maximum difficulty/worse physical function.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants Meeting Outcomes Measures in Arthritis Clinical Trials-Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OMERACT-OARSI) Responder Index</title>
          <description>Participants were considered as OMERACT-OARSI responders: if the change (improvement) from baseline to week of interest was greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 50 percent and greater or equal to (&gt;=) 2 units in either WOMAC pain subscale or physical function subscale score; if change (improvement) from baseline to week of interest was &gt;=20 percent and &gt;=1 unit in at least 2 of the following: 1) WOMAC pain subscale score, 2) WOMAC physical function subscale score, 3) PGA of osteoarthritis. WOMAC pain subscale assess amount of pain experienced (score: 0 [no pain] to 10 [extreme pain], higher score = more pain), WOMAC physical function subscale assess degree of difficulty experienced (score: 0 [minimum difficulty] to 10 [extreme difficulty], higher score = worse physical function) and PGA of osteoarthritis (score: 1 [very good] to 5 [very poor], higher score = worse condition). Missing data was imputed using mixed baseline/last observation carried forward (BOCF/LOCF).</description>
          <population>The intent to treat population included all randomized participants who received at least one dose of subcutaneous study medication (either Tanezumab or placebo).</population>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Pain Subscale Reduction &gt;= 30 Percent (%), &gt;=50%, &gt;=70% and &gt;=90% Response</title>
        <description>Percentage of participants with reduction in WOMAC pain intensity of at least (&gt;=) 30%, 50%, 70% and 90% at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16 and 24 compared to baseline were classified as responders to WOMAC pain subscale and are reported here. WOMAC: self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with osteoarthritis. The WOMAC pain subscale is a 5-item questionnaire used to assess the amount of pain experienced due to osteoarthritis of index joint (knee or hip) during past 48 hours. It was calculated as the mean of scores from 5 individual questions scored on a numerical rating scale (NRS) of 0 (no pain) to 10 (extreme pain), where higher scores indicated higher pain. Missing data was imputed using mixed BOCF/LOCF.</description>

        <description>WOMAC: self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with OA. The WOMAC pain subscale is a 5-item questionnaire used to assess the amount of pain experienced due to osteoarthritis of index joint during past 48 hours. It was calculated as the mean of scores from 5 individual questions scored on a NRS of 0 (no pain) to 10 (extreme pain), where higher scores indicated higher pain. Total score range for WOMAC pain subscale score was 0 (no pain) to 10 (extreme pain), where higher scores indicated higher pain. Percentage of participants with cumulative reduction (as percent) (greater than 0% ; &gt;= 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90%; = 100 %) in WOMAC pain subscale from Baseline to Week 16 were reported, participants (%) are reported more than once in categories specified.

WOMAC: self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with osteoarthritis. Physical function refers to participant's ability to move around and perform usual activities of daily living. WOMAC physical function subscale: 17-item questionnaire used to assess the degree of difficulty experienced due to osteoarthritis in index joint (knee or hip) during past 48 hours,calculated as mean of the scores from 17 individual questions scored on a NRS of 0 (minimum difficulty) to 10 (extreme difficulty), where higher scores indicated extreme difficulty/worse physical function.

          <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Physical Function Subscale Reduction &gt;= 30 Percent (%), &gt;=50%, &gt;=70% and &gt;=90% Response</title>
          <description>Percentage of participants with reduction in WOMAC physical function of at least (&gt;=) 30%, 50%, 70% and 90% at weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16 and 24 compared to baseline were classified as responders to WOMAC physical function subscale. WOMAC: self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with osteoarthritis. Physical function refers to participant's ability to move around and perform usual activities of daily living. WOMAC physical function subscale: 17-item questionnaire used to assess the degree of difficulty experienced due to osteoarthritis in index joint (knee or hip) during past 48 hours,calculated as mean of the scores from 17 individual questions scored on a NRS of 0 (minimum difficulty) to 10 (extreme difficulty), where higher scores indicated extreme difficulty/worse physical function. Missing data was imputed using mixed BOCF/LOCF.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Cumulative Percent Change From Baseline in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Physical Function Subscale at Week 16</title>
        <description>WOMAC: self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with osteoarthritis. Physical function: participant's ability to move around and perform usual activities of daily living. WOMAC physical function subscale: 17-item questionnaire used to assess the degree of difficulty experienced due to osteoarthritis in index joint (knee or hip) during past 48 hours, calculated as mean of the scores from 17 individual questions scored on a NRS of 0 (minimum difficulty) to 10 (extreme difficulty),higher scores indicate extreme difficulty/worse physical function. Percentage of participants with cumulative reduction (as percent) (greater than 0 %; &gt;= 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 %, 60 %, 70 %, 80 % and 90%; = 100 %) in WOMAC physical function subscale from Baseline to Week 16 were reported.

        <title>Change From Baseline for Average Pain Score in the Index Joint at Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 16</title>
        <description>Participants assessed their average pain in the index hip/knee in the past 24 hours using a scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). Higher scores indicated higher pain. Data represents averages of the values reported during the 4-week interval up to and including the given week. Change from baseline was calculated using the difference between each post-baseline weekly mean and the baseline mean score.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Stiffness Subscale at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12 and 16</title>
        <description>WOMAC: self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with osteoarthritis. Stiffness was defined as a sensation of decreased ease of movement in the index joint (knee or hip).The WOMAC stiffness subscale was a 2-item questionnaire used to assess the amount of stiffness experienced due to osteoarthritis in the index joint (knee or hip) during the past 48 hours. It was calculated as mean of the scores from 2 individual questions scored on NRS of 0 (no stiffness) to 10 (extreme stiffness), where higher scores indicated higher stiffness.</description>

It was calculated as mean of the scores from 2 individual questions scored on NRS of 0 (no stiffness) to 10 (extreme stiffness), where higher scores indicated higher stiffness.</description>
          <population>The intent to treat population included all randomized participants who received at least one dose of subcutaneous study medication (either Tanezumab or placebo).</population>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Stiffness Subscale at Week 24</title>
          <description>WOMAC: self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with osteoarthritis. Stiffness was defined as a sensation of decreased ease of movement in the index joint (knee or hip).The WOMAC stiffness subscale was a 2-item questionnaire used to assess the amount of stiffness experienced due to osteoarthritis in the index joint (knee or hip) during the past 48 hours. It was calculated as mean of the scores from 2 individual questions scored on NRS of 0 (no stiffness) to 10 (extreme stiffness), where higher scores indicated higher stiffness.</description>
          <population>The intent to treat population included all randomized participants who received at least one dose of subcutaneous study medication (either Tanezumab or placebo). Here, ‘Number analyzed’ = Participants evaluable for this outcome measure at specified time point.</population>

        <description>WOMAC: self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with osteoarthritis of index joint (knee or hip). WOMAC pain subscale assess amount of pain experienced (score: 0 [no pain] to 10 [extreme pain], higher score = more pain), WOMAC physical function subscale assess degree of difficulty experienced (score: 0 [minimum difficulty] to 10 [extreme difficulty], higher score = worse physical function) and WOMAC stiffness subscale assess the amount of stiffness experienced (score: 0 [no stiffness] to 10 [extreme stiffness], higher score = higher stiffness). WOMAC average score was the mean of WOMAC pain, physical function and stiffness subscale scores and ranges from 0 to 10, where higher scores indicated worse response.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Pain Subscale (Pain When Going up or Down Stairs) at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12 and 16</title>
          <description>WOMAC: self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with osteoarthritis in index joint (knee or hip). Participants answered a question: &quot;How much pain have you had when going up or down the stairs?&quot; Participants responded about the amount of pain they experienced when going up or down stairs by using a NRS of 0 (no pain) to 10 (extreme pain), where higher scores indicated higher pain.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Pain Subscale (Pain When Going up or Down Stairs) at Week 24</title>
          <description>WOMAC: self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with osteoarthritis in index joint (knee or hip). Participants answered a question: &quot;How much pain have you had when going up or down the stairs?&quot; Participants responded about the amount of pain they experienced when going up or down stairs by using a NRS of 0 (no pain) to 10 (extreme pain), where higher scores indicated higher pain.</description>
          <population>The intent to treat population included all randomized participants who received at least one dose of subcutaneous study medication (either Tanezumab or placebo). Here, ‘Number analyzed’ = Participants evaluable for this outcome measure at specified time points.</population>

        <description>WPAI is 6-question participant rated questionnaire to determine the impact of osteoarthritis on absenteeism, presenteeism, work productivity, and daily activity impairment for a period of 7 days prior to a visit. It yields 4 sub-scores: work time missed (absenteeism), impairment while working (presenteeism), overall work impairment (work productivity) and activity impairment (daily activity impairment). These sub-scores are expressed as an impairment percentage (range from 0 to 100), with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity.</description>

        <title>European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions-5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L) Dimensions Score</title>
        <description>EQ-5D-5L is a standardized participant completed questionnaire that measures health-related quality of life and translates that score into an index value or utility score. EQ-5D-5L consists of two components: a health state profile and an optional visual analogue scale (VAS). EQ-5D health state profile is comprised of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: 1=no problems, 2=slight problems, 3=moderate problems, 4=severe problems, and 5=extreme problems. The health utility score for a patient with no problems in all 5 items is 1 for all countries (except for Zimbabwe where it is 0.9), and is reduced where a patient reports greater levels of problems across the five dimensions.</description>

        <title>European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions-5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L) Overall Health Utility Score/Index Value</title>
        <description>EQ-5D-5L: standardized participant completed questionnaire that measures health-related quality of life and translates that score into an index value or utility score. EQ-5D-5L consists of two components: a health state profile and an optional VAS. EQ-5D health state profile comprises of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: 1=no problems, 2=slight problems, 3=moderate problems, 4=severe problems, and 5=extreme problems. Responses from the five domains were used to calculate a single utility index (the Overall health utility score) where values are &lt;=1.

          <title>European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions-5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L) Overall Health Utility Score/Index Value</title>
          <description>EQ-5D-5L: standardized participant completed questionnaire that measures health-related quality of life and translates that score into an index value or utility score. EQ-5D-5L consists of two components: a health state profile and an optional VAS. EQ-5D health state profile comprises of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: 1=no problems, 2=slight problems, 3=moderate problems, 4=severe problems, and 5=extreme problems. Responses from the five domains were used to calculate a single utility index (the Overall health utility score) where values are &lt;=1. The Overall health utility score for a patient with no problems in all 5 items is 1 for all countries (except for Zimbabwe where it is 0.9), and is reduced where a patient reports greater levels of problems across the five dimensions.</description>

        <title>Health Care Resource Utilization (HCRU): Number of Participants Who Used Any Aids/Devices for Doing Things</title>
        <description>Osteoarthritis HCRU assessed healthcare usage during last 3 months (for Baseline and Week 40) and past 8 weeks (for Week 24). Domain evaluated was number of participants who used any aids/devices for doing things. Aids such as walking aid, wheelchair, device or utensil for dress/bathe/eat and any other aids/devices.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 24 and 40</time_frame>
        <population>The intent to treat (ITT) population included all randomized participants who received at least one dose of subcutaneous (SC) study medication (either Tanezumab or placebo). Here, ‘Number analyzed’ = Participants evaluable for this outcome measure for specified categories.</population>

        <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent were events between first dose of study drug and up to Week 40 that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. AEs included both serious and non-serious AEs.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Neuropathy Impairment Score (NIS) at Weeks 2, 4, 8,12,16, 24 and 40</title>
        <description>NIS is a standardized instrument used to evaluate participant for signs of peripheral neuropathy. NIS is the sum of scores of 37 items, from both the left and right side, where 24 items scored from 0 (normal) to 4 (paralysis), higher score indicated higher abnormality/impairment and 13 items scored from 0 (normal), 1 (decreased) and 2 (absent), higher score indicated higher impairment. NIS possible overall score ranged from 0 (no impairment) to 244 (maximum impairment), higher scores indicated increased impairment.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Confirmed Orthostatic Hypotension</title>
        <description>Orthostatic hypotension was defined as postural change (supine to standing) that met the following criteria: For systolic BP &lt;=150 mmHg (mean supine): Reduction in systolic BP&gt;=20 mmHg or reduction in diastolic BP&gt;=10 mmHg at the 1 and/or 3 minute standing BP measurements. For systolic BP &gt;150 mmHg (mean supine): Reduction in systolic BP&gt;=30 mmHg or reduction in diastolic BP&gt;=15 mmHg at the 1 and/or 3 minute standing BP measurements. If the 1 minute or 3 minute standing BP in a sequence met the orthostatic hypotension criteria, then that sequence was considered positive. If 2 of 2 or 2 of 3 sequences were positive, then orthostatic hypotension was considered confirmed.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Survey of Autonomic Symptom (SAS) Scores at Weeks 24 and 40</title>
        <description>The SAS is a 12 item (11 for females) questionnaire, from which the total number of symptoms (0-12 for males and 0-11 for females) is calculated. Each positive symptom is rated from 1 (not at all) to 5 (a lot). The total impact score was the sum of all symptom rating scores, with 0 assigned where the participant did not have the particular symptom. The range for the total impact score is 0-60 for males and 0-55 for females, higher scores indicating higher impact.</description>
