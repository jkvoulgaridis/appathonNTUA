      This pilot trial studies a peer mentoring and online self-management program to see how well
      it works in promoting follow-up care self-management in younger childhood cancer survivors.
      Childhood cancer survivors require lifelong follow-up care to identify, monitor, and treat
      medical and psychosocial late effects stemming from their cancer, its treatment, and
      lifestyle factors. A peer mentoring program + self-management may improve disease knowledge,
      health motivation, problem-solving skills, stress management, and communication with
      caregivers and providers in adolescent and young adult cancer survivors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Develop the self-management + peer mentoring program to improve adolescent and young adult
      (AYA) self-management of long-term follow-up care.

      II. Evaluate the feasibility of the self-management + peer mentoring program in a pilot
      trial.

      III. Assess preliminary outcomes of the peer mentoring program.

      OUTLINE:

      PHASE 1: Participants (providers, survivors, and caregivers) complete a 60 minute interview
      to help develop the intervention to improve AYA self-management of care.

      PHASE 2: Participants will be asked to complete online self-management educational modules
      and 6 weekly peer mentor calls to facilitate engagement with the online modules and offer
      specialized support.

    <measure>Qualitative interview data (Phase 1)</measure>
    <time_frame>60 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Qualitative data will be analyzed using content analysis. Specifically, themes will be identified based on the a priori theoretical framework (SMART model). Data will be constantly compared to evaluate fit to the model and new themes that emerge from participants' data will be added to the model. Data analysis will continue until theme saturation occurred (that is, no new themes emerge from additional participants).</description>

    <measure>Feasibility as measured by study enrollment rates, retention rates, adherence to the intervention, and reasons for study drop out (Phase 2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Descriptive analyses (frequencies, means) will be used to evaluate expected enrollment (&gt; 50%), retention (&gt; 80%), and completion of intervention sessions (&gt; 75%).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient and mentor satisfaction with intervention, as measured by satisfaction survey (Phase 2)</measure>
    <time_frame>At 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This survey includes six items developed specifically for this study (responses on a 5-point scale from &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;very&quot;) and items adapted from standardized set of interned-based intervention evaluation tool (Internet Intervention Utility Questionnaire [12 items], Impact Questionnaire [16 items], and Adherence Questionnaire [6 items]). The Utility Questionnaire measures perceived usefulness, enjoyment, and ease of use on a 5-point scale from &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;very&quot;. It includes two additional open-ended questions about the most and least helpful aspects of the program. The Impact Questionnaire measures perceived effectiveness in improving targeted skills on a 5-point scale from &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;very&quot;. The Adherence Questionnaire measures barriers to engagement (on a 3-point scale from &quot;Not a problem&quot; to &quot;A major problem.&quot; Items will be analyzed individually.</description>

    <measure>Improvement in Transition readiness, as measured by the Readiness for Transition Questionnaire - Survivor Version (phase 2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to up to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Respondents rate how responsible they are for various healthcare tasks on a 4-point scale from &quot;not responsible at all&quot; to &quot;almost always responsible.&quot; The Adolescent Responsibility Scale is calculated by averaging responses across all 10 items. A single item assessing &quot;overall readiness to assume complete responsibility for health care&quot; on the same 4-point scale is analyzed separately.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Improvement in Transition readiness, as measured by the Transition Readiness Inventory (phase 2).</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to up to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Transition Readiness Inventory yields six subscale scores: Knowledge, Skills/Self-Efficacy, Beliefs/Expectations, Goals/Motivation, Relationship/Communication, and Psychosocial/Emotional. Scores are averaged across items on a 5-point scale, with higher scores indicating better functioning.</description>

    <description>Respondents report symptoms on a 5-point rating scale from 1 (never) to 5 (always) in the past 7 days, with higher scores indicating higher levels of negative affect. A total raw summary score is calculated and then translated into a standardized T-score with a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10.</description>
