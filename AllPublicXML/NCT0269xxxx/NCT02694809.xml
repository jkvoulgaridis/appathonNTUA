    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to determine if taking the study drug, conjugated
      estrogens/bazedoxifene (Duavee®) causes any changes in the proliferation markers within the
      breast tissue of the study subjects. The study drug is approved by the US Food and Drug
      Administration in healthy postmenopausal women to treat certain symptoms of menopause such as
      hot flashes. Since it is not approved in women with DCIS, its use in this study is
      experimental. This study will also look at whether taking the study drug causes any
      significant or undesirable side effects in women with DCIS. The researchers hope that this
      study will help them determine if taking the study drug is safe in women taking DCIS and if
      it can possibly reduce the risk of developing breast cancer in women with DCIS.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES;

      • To determine if CE/BZA reduces proliferation as measured by Ki-67 protein expression

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To determine if CE/BZA modulates expression of ERα, progesterone receptor (PR) and human
           epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2).

        -  To determine if CE/BZA modulates a previously validated set of epithelial markers of
           progression.

        -  To determine if TSECs will restore expression of the stromal marker CD36 and repress
           pro-tumorigenic ECM proteins and soluble factors.

        -  To determine if a short intervention with CE/BZA results in any difference in Quality of
           Life (QOL) as it relates to menopausal symptoms in postmenopausal women with DCIS.

        -  To determine if a short intervention with CE/BZA has a favorable side effect profile
           compared with other endocrine therapy interventions using the validated Breast Cancer
           Prevention Trial Eight Symptom Scale (BESS) questionnaire.

      Exploratory Objectives

        -  To determine if CE/BZA alters expression of estrogen-modulated genes and elicits novel
           ER dependent-gene signatures in breast epithelium

        -  To demonstrate that CE/BZA does not upregulate Anterior Gradient 2 (AGR2), a marker of
           ERα agonist activity.

        -  To determine if CE/BZA will modulate some aspects of immune function as measured by a
           switch to a M2-type pro-tumorigenic macrophage signature and an immunosuppressive T cell
           signature.

        -  To determine if a short intervention with CE/BZA alters expression of estrogen-modulated
           genes and elicits novel ER dependent-gene signatures in the breast stroma.

        -  To determine if CE/BZA affects plasma concentrations of BZA in patients with the
           UGT1A1*28 gene polymorphism.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive conjugated estrogens/bazedoxifene orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 28
      +/- 7 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then
      undergo surgery.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO QD for 28 +/- 7 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo surgery.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women must have newly diagnosed histologically confirmed ER (+) DCIS scheduled to
             undergo surgical therapy. The pathology report (signed pathology report from attending
             pathologist) from each individual institution will be used to determine eligibility.
             Extent of DCIS in imaging per site institutional standard.

        Note: After the patient has completed the study and the slides have been sent to NU, our
        pathologists will review the slides to confirm the diagnosis.

        Note: DCIS suspicious for micro invasion is eligible on core biopsy. This is due to the
        fact that many these patients will not have invasion on final pathology.

        Note: Women presenting with bilaterial DCIS are eligible but if both right and left DCIS
        are ER+, we will only accept tissue from the side with the largest area of DCIS based on
        imaging and pathology criteria outlined later in the protocol.

          -  DCIS must be ≥ 1cm based on extent of calcifications, presence of a mass on ultrasound
             OR enhancement on MRI OR DCIS must be ≥ 5mm of DCIS on one single core. Can be &lt; 5mm
             if DCIS is identified on multiple cores (at least 2 cores)

          -  Women presenting after excision with positive margins are eligible. Ki-67, Cox-2,
             P-16, expression in immediately adjacent tissue is similar to what is found in DCIS.

        Note: Positive margins are defined as DCIS present at the inked margin or DCIS &lt;1mm from
        the margin. - Women must be postmenopausal (defined as no menstrual cycle for 12 months or
        surgical history of bilateral salpingoopherectomy. Postmenopausal women of all races and
        ethnic groups are eligible to participate for this trial. Men are not eligible.

        Note: women who have had a hysterectomy without a bilateral salpingoopherectomy may still
        be pre-menopausal. Confirmation of postmenopausal status is required for these patients and
        will be measured by testing levels of estradiol, progesterone and FSH (lab ranges per
        institutional standards). In addition, confirmation of postmenopausal status may be
        performed in any patient with unclear menopausal status per treating physician discretion.

          -  Women in the age range of ≥18-79 (inclusive)

          -  ECOG performance status ≤ 2 (Karnofsky ≥60%, see Appendix A).

          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below Leukocytes
             ≥3,000/mcL Platelets ≥100,000/mcL Hemoglobin ≥ 9g/dl Total Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper
             limit of normal (ULN) AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT)

               -  2.5 × institutional upper limit of normal Serum Creatinine OR Creatinine
                  Clearance

               -  1.5 x ULN ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine levels above
                  institutional normal (calculated with the Cockcroft-Gault Equation in EPIC)

          -  Patients must have the ability to swallow oral medication

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document
             and comply with all procedures

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents. A minimum of 4 weeks
             wash-out period is required for eligibility. Please contact Principal Investigator,
             Dr. Swati Kulkarni for further clarification

          -  Patients with a &quot;currently active&quot; second malignancy other than non-melanoma skin
             cancers. Patients are not considered to have a &quot;currently active&quot; malignancy if they
             have completed therapy and are free of disease for ≥ 3 years.

          -  History of allergic reactions/hypersensitivity attributed to compounds of similar
             chemical or biologic composition to CE/BZA. (I.e. same class of drug as CE/BZA)

          -  Current HRT, SERM or Aromatase Inhibitor (AI) use. If yes, the wash-out period is 30
             days before diagnostic core needle biopsy.

        Note: Local therapy (i.e. estrogen cream) will be permitted due to low systemic absorption
        of estrogen. Note: if patient is registered prior to completed washout, diagnostic core
        needle biopsy date will need to be provided.

          -  Confirmed current or past diagnosis of invasive breast cancer

          -  History of gynecologic malignancy that is estrogen dependent

          -  Patients with recurrent ipsilateral DCIS

          -  Active deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, retinal vascular thrombosis, and
             any arterial thrombosis including stroke and myocardial infarction or history of these
             conditions

          -  Known protein C, protein S, or anti-thrombin deficiency or other known thrombophilic
             disorders

          -  Unexplained/undiagnosed abnormal uterine bleeding (concern for undiagnosed endometrial
             cancer)

          -  Women who are pregnant or lactating. CE/BZA may cause fetal harm when administered to
             a pregnant woman. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes
             pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential
             hazard to a fetus.

          -  Patients receiving any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors or
             inducers of CYP3A4 and UGT are ineligible. The wash out period for such drugs is a
             minimum of 7 days or 5 half-lives whichever is shorter. Refer to Appendix C.

        Note: As this list is constantly evolving, if a medication is incorrectly documented as
        prohibited in this protocol, documentation from the site pharmacist to the contrary will be
        acceptable for the purposes of registration.

        - Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
        infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
        arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
        requirements.
