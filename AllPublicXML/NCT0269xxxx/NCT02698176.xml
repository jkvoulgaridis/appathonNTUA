  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to determine the recommended dose of MK-8628 (formerly known as OTX015) for
      further studies in participants with advanced nuclear protein in testis (NUT) midline
      carcinoma (NMC), triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), or
      castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). This is a two-part parallel study: Part A will
      establish the recommended dose by evaluating dose limiting toxicity (DLT), safety,
      discontinuation, and early efficacy and Part B will enroll participants with NMC only and
      will evaluate safety and efficacy in this population.
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The sponsor decided to terminate the program after evaluation of safety and efficacy data at
      the dose levels tested (Part A). The decision to discontinue the MK-8628 program was based on
      limited efficacy signals and was not due to safety-related concerns. No participants entered
      or were treated in Part B of the study.

    <measure>Number of Participants Who Experienced a Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) During Cycle 1</measure>
    <time_frame>From time of first dose up to the end of the first cycle (up to 21 days)</time_frame>
    <description>A DLT was any of the following deemed drug related (DR) by investigator: Grade (G)4 hematologic toxicity lasting ≥7 days except thrombocytopenia; G4 thrombocytopenia; G3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding; G3 or 4 febrile neutropenia. G4 non-hematologic (NH) toxicity (not laboratory); G3 NH toxicity (not laboratory), nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea lasting &gt;3 days despite supportive care; G3 or 4 NH laboratory abnormality requiring medical intervention, hospitalization, or persisting &gt;1 week; alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &gt;8X Upper Limit of Normal(ULN); ALT or AST &gt;5XULN for &gt;2 weeks; ALT or AST &gt;3XULN and total bilirubin &gt;2XULN or international normalization ratio &gt;1.5; ALT or AST &gt;3XULN with fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash and/or eosinophilia (&gt;5%); DR adverse event leading to discontinuation or &gt;20% missed planned doses in Cycle 1; DR toxicity causing &gt;2 week delay in starting Cycle 2; or G5 toxicity.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Who Experienced at Least One Adverse Event (AE)</measure>
    <time_frame>From time of first dose until the end of the 30-day follow-up (up to 25 months)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which did not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product/protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product/protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening of a preexisting condition temporally associated with the use of the product was also an AE. The number of participants who experienced at least one AE is presented.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Who Discontinued Study Treatment Due to an AE</measure>
    <time_frame>From time of first dose until the end of treatment (up to 24 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The number of participants who discontinued study treatment due to an AE is presented.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed every 6 weeks from time of first dose until disease progression (up to 24 months)</time_frame>
    <description>ORR was defined as the percentage of the participants in the analysis population who had a Complete Response (CR: Disappearance of all target lesions Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] 1.1) or a Partial Response (PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions per RECIST 1.1) and lack of progression according to the guidelines for prostate cancer endpoints developed by Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group (PCWG) 2 as assessed by investigator radiologic review. The number of participants who achieved a CR or PR is presented.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response (DOR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed every 6 weeks from time of first dose until disease progression (up to 24 months)</time_frame>
    <description>For participants who demonstrated CR or PR, DOR was defined as the time from first documented evidence of CR or PR per RECIST 1.1 until disease progression per RECIST 1.1 and PCWG2 or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Per RECIST 1.1, progressive disease was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also have demonstrated an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. Note: The appearance of one or more new lesions was also considered progression per RECIST 1.1. Per PCWG2, progressive disease was defined as a confirmed increase of at least two new lesions on a bone scan. DOR assessments were assessed by investigator radiologic review. The DOR for all participants who experienced a CR or PR is presented.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease Control Rate (DCR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed every 6 weeks from time of first dose until disease progression (up to 24 months)</time_frame>
    <description>DCR was defined as the number of subjects with CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) as assessed by investigator radiologic review according to RECIST version 1.1 and PCWG2. CR: defined as disappearance of all target and all non-target lesions and any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to less than &lt;10 mm per RECIST 1.1. PR: defined as at least a 30% decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters along with absence of new lesions and disease progression in non-target lesions per RECIST 1.1. SD: defined as, neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR, nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study per RECIST 1.1 and lack of a confirmed increase of at least two new lesions on a bone scan per PCWG2. The number of participants who experienced DCR is presented.</description>

        <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which did not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product/protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product/protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening of a preexisting condition temporally associated with the use of the product was also an AE. The number of participants who experienced at least one AE is presented.</description>

          <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which did not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product/protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product/protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening of a preexisting condition temporally associated with the use of the product was also an AE. The number of participants who experienced at least one AE is presented.</description>
