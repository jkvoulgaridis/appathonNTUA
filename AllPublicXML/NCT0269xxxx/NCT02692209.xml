  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pivotal reader study is to assess the comparative accuracy of Fujifilm
      FFDM plus DBT versus FFDM alone in the detection of breast cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The safety and effectiveness of FFDM + DBT are both linked to the ability of radiologists
      interpreting FFDM + DBT images to accurately diagnose breast cancer. Each study endpoint
      therefore addresses both safety and effectiveness.

    <measure>Correct Lesion Localization: Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve (AUC) for FFDM + DBT Versus FFDM Alone Based on Probability of Malignancy (POM) Scores and Requiring Correct Lesion Localization.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The study will be considered to have successfully demonstrated safety and effectiveness of the Fujifilm Aspire Cristalle: FFDM +DBT system if the per-subject average AUC for FFDM+DBT is statistically significantly superior to the average AUC for FFDM alone at the alpha = 0.05 significance level. Per-subject BI-RADS, POM and recall scores requiring correct lesion localization were derived. The general principle is that even at the subject level, credit was only given for identifying a subject with cancer if the reader marked findings in at least one location with cancer. When computing sensitivity and specificity based on BI-RADS, a score of 4 or 5 constituted a positive test result.</description>

        This research is a retrospective study with an enriched sample of breast screening or
        diagnostic cases that were selected from the library of mammograms collected under Fujifilm

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eligible subjects under protocol FMSU2013-004A, defined as female subjects with known
             true clinical status and with complete FFDM and DBT examinations, in which there is
             sufficient anatomical coverage, sufficient contrast, and no significant motion or
             other artifacts, as determined by the image-acquisition sites.

          -  Meet none of the exclusion criteria under protocol FMSU2013-004A.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who are in violation of protocol FMSU2013-004A.

          -  Subjects who meet exclusion criteria under protocol FMSU2013-004A.

          -  Subjects with unknown clinical status.

          -  Any subject whose positive mammogram was not read during the truthing process (see
             section 8) will not be considered for the pivotal MRMC reader study.
