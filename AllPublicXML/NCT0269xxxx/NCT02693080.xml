    <textblock>
      This study assesses computed tomography (CT) perfusion imaging in predicting treatment
      response in patients with non-small cell lung cancer or tumors that have spread from the
      primary site (place where it started) to the lungs (metastases) treated with stereotactic
      ablative radiation therapy. CT perfusion imaging is a special type of CT that uses an
      injected dye in order to see how blood flow through tissues, including lung tissue. CT
      perfusion imaging of the lungs may help doctors learn whether perfusion characteristics of
      lung tumors may be predictive of response to treatment and whether lung perfusion
      characteristics can be used to follow response to treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the feasibility of performing computed tomography (CT) perfusion imaging (CT
      perfusion imaging) at baseline, within 48 hours post-stereotactic ablative radiation therapy
      (SABR), and at 2-4 months SABR in patients undergoing SABR for treatment of a lung tumor per
      standard of care.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        1. To determine the range (variability) of perfusion parameters at baseline, within 48
           hours post-SABR, and at 2-4 months post-SABR

        2. To assess the change in perfusion parameters at baseline, within 48 hours post-SABR, and
           at 2-4 months post-SABR

        3. To correlate any change in perfusion parameters with circulating-tumor deoxyribonucleic
           acid (DNA) levels at baseline, within 48 hours post-SABR, and at 2-4 months post-SABR

        4. To correlate perfusion parameters with tumor response 1 year post-SABR

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive an infusion of Isovue-200 and undergo CT perfusion imaging of the lungs at
      baseline, within 48 hours of first SABR, and at 2-4 months after completion of SABR. Cancer
      Personalized Profiling by Deep Sequencing (CAPP-Seq) will be conducted evaluate
      circulating-tumor DNA levels.

      Perfusion parameters will be correlated with tumor control at 1 year post-SABR, with tumor
      control defined as no evidence of disease seen at the site of SABR by surveillance imaging at
      1 year post-SABR.

      After completion of treatment, patients are followed up at 2-4 months and then at 1 year.
