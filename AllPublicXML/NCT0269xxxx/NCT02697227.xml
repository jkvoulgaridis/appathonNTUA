  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial studies how well behavioral activation therapy and nicotine
      replacement therapy work in increasing smoking cessation. Behavioral interventions use
      techniques to help patients change the way they react to environmental triggers that may
      cause a negative reaction. Giving behavioral activation therapy and nicotine replacement
      therapy may help patients quit smoking or change their smoking behavior.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the comparative effectiveness of Behavioral Activation Treatment for Smoking
      (BATS) plus nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) versus standard cessation treatment plus NRT
      on high reward sensitivity smokers (IRS+) and low reward sensitivity (IRS-) smokers.

      II. To identify mediators of the BATS plus NRT treatment effect in IRS- smokers.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I (STANDARD CESSATION): Patients receive NRT patch daily for 8 weeks. Patients receive
      individual behavioral treatment sessions consisting of behavioral treatment strategies for
      smoking cessation and health education information over 45 minutes for 8 sessions.

      GROUP II (BATS): Patients receive NRT patch daily for 8 weeks. Patients receive individual
      treatment sessions consisting of standard cessation (SC) strategies and behavioral activation
      (BA) strategies over 45 minutes for 8 sessions.

      After completion of study intervention, patients are followed up at 3 months.
