      This study is a single arm, pilot study of Sorafenib in patient with BRAF mutation Refractory
      solid tumor and specific sensitivity to Sorafenib by Avatar scan that has progressed
      following standard therapy or that has not responded to standard therapy or for which there
      is no standard therapy.

      To investigate the efficacy and safety of Sorafenib in patient with Refractory solid tumor.
