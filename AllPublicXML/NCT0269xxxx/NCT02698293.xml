  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I dose escalation study of photodynamic therapy (PDT) for the treatment of
      patients with pre-malignant tumors and superficial microinvasive disease of the anal canal
      and/or perianal skin. All subjects (a maximum of 12) will be given the photosensitizer ALA
      orally followed by the administration of red light (629-635 nm) to the tumor from a laser.
      The dose of ALA will be 40 mg/kg administered approximately 4-6 hours before light
      administration. There will be two levels of light dose: 50 and 100 J/cm2, 3-6 patients in
      each. Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) supplementation (10,000 IU daily) will be provided from 3
      days prior through 14 weeks after light delivery for PDT. Patients will be observed for 30
      days for the development of DLT. Patients will be followed up for 24 months for additional
      toxicity and efficacy data collection.

    <description>Approximately 4-6 hours after photosensitizer administration, activating light will be applied.
The target mucosal lesion will be identified based on the initial clinical evaluation. Treatment light will be generated using a Modulight ML7710-630-6K diode laser, This laser produces up to 6W total power, with a peak wavelength of 630nm and 90% of laser power within 630-633 nm.
The light fluence (doses) will be 50 and 100 Joules per square centimeter.</description>

          -  Study subjects with abnormal baseline creatinine level or diagnosed kidney disease.

          -  Treatment with 5-FU, Imiquimod, trichloroacetic acid or ablative therapy within the
             previous month.

          -  Study subjects who have a medical history of immune suppression. This will include
             patients with a past transplantation requiring ongoing immunosuppressive medications.

          -  A history of sarcoidosis, hyperphosphatemia, or known kidney stones
