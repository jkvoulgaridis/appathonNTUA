    <textblock>
      Peri-menopausal women will be randomized to hormone replacement therapy or placebo for 12
      weeks to determine if markers of systolic and diastolic function change by echocardiography
      as well as laboratory markers of heart failure, including b-type natriuretic peptide (BNP).

    <textblock>
      This preliminary, feasibility study will randomize 28 peri-menopausal women to either hormone
      replacement therapy or placebo for 12 weeks. Prior to randomization, each participant will
      undergo echocardiography, measurements of activity using the Duke Activity Status Index,
      measurements of quality of life and laboratory data, including b-type natriuretic peptide
      (BNP) measurements. Following the intervention for 12 weeks, these measurements will all be
      repeated.

    <measure>Activity Level Assessed by Duke Activity Status Index (DASI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in activity level as assessed by Duke Activity Status Index. The DASI estimates functional capacity through a series of 12 questions related to daily activity. Questions are scored as zero for a &quot;No&quot; answer or awarded a fixed number of points ranging from 1.75-8 for a &quot;Yes&quot; answer. Scores for each question are added, with the maximum score being 58.2 indicating a fully functional individual. Data are presented as the change in Mean score +/- SEM for each group at baseline and 12 weeks.</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life Score Assessed by Utian Quality of Life Scale (UQoLS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in quality of life score as assessed by Utian Quality of Life scale. The UQoLS measures quality of life in four subcategories: Occupational, health, emotional and sexual. Questions are scored on a scale of 1-5 were 1 indicates &quot;Not true of me&quot; and 5 indicates an answer of &quot;mostly true&quot;. Scores to the responses are added and evaluated within each subcategory. Higher scores indicate a higher quality of life within each subcategory with a maximum of 35 points for &quot;Occupational&quot;, 31 points for &quot;Health&quot;, 28 points for &quot;Emotional&quot; and 15 points for &quot;Sexual&quot; for a total of 100 points indicating the highest quality of life score possible. Data will be presented as the change in quality of life Mean +/- SEM over time.</description>

    <description>Change in B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels will be measure. Participants will have blood drawn via venipuncture and B-type natriuretic peptide will be measured using a quantitative chemiluminescent immunoassay. Data will be presented as the change in B-type natriuretic peptide over time.</description>

          <title>Activity Level Assessed by Duke Activity Status Index (DASI)</title>
          <description>Change in activity level as assessed by Duke Activity Status Index. The DASI estimates functional capacity through a series of 12 questions related to daily activity. Questions are scored as zero for a &quot;No&quot; answer or awarded a fixed number of points ranging from 1.75-8 for a &quot;Yes&quot; answer. Scores for each question are added, with the maximum score being 58.2 indicating a fully functional individual. Data are presented as the change in Mean score +/- SEM for each group at baseline and 12 weeks.</description>

        <description>Change in quality of life score as assessed by Utian Quality of Life scale. The UQoLS measures quality of life in four subcategories: Occupational, health, emotional and sexual. Questions are scored on a scale of 1-5 were 1 indicates &quot;Not true of me&quot; and 5 indicates an answer of &quot;mostly true&quot;. Scores to the responses are added and evaluated within each subcategory. Higher scores indicate a higher quality of life within each subcategory with a maximum of 35 points for &quot;Occupational&quot;, 31 points for &quot;Health&quot;, 28 points for &quot;Emotional&quot; and 15 points for &quot;Sexual&quot; for a total of 100 points indicating the highest quality of life score possible. Data will be presented as the change in quality of life Mean +/- SEM over time.</description>
