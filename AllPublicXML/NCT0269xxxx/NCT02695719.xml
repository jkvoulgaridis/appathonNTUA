  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral administration of
      lubiprostone 24 μg twice daily (BID) for 4 weeks in participants with chronic idiopathic
      constipation (CIC) compared with placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called lubiprostone. Lubiprostone is being tested to
      treat people who have chronic idiopathic constipation. This study will look at the frequency
      of spontaneous bowel movements (SBMs) in people who take lubiprostone compared to placebo.

      The study will enroll 150 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned (by chance,
      like flipping a coin) equally to one of the two treatment groups, which will remain
      undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent
      medical need):

        -  Lubiprostone 24 μg

        -  Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a capsule that looks like the study drug but has
           no active ingredient

      All participants will be asked to take one capsule with breakfast and one capsule with dinner
      each day throughout the study. All participants will be asked to record each time they have a
      SBM and all details of each SBM (including the consistency of the stool and the difficulty
      they have in passing it) in a diary.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in South Korea. The overall time to participate in
      this study is 8 weeks. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, and will be
      contacted by telephone 14 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Spontaneous Bowel Movement (SBM) Frequency at Week 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1</time_frame>
    <description>A SBM was defined as any bowel movement (BM) that does not occur within 24 hours after rescue medication use (laxative, suppository, or enema). Participants will be given a diary to complete at home where they will record all details of each SBM including the consistency of the stool and the difficulty they have in passing it.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>SBM Frequency at Weeks 2, 3 and 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 2, 3 and 4</time_frame>
    <description>A SBM was defined as any BM that does not occur within 24 hours after rescue medication use. Participants will be given a diary to complete at home where they will record all details of each SBM including the consistency of the stool and the difficulty they have in passing it.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Had a SBM Within 24 Hours After the First Dose of Study Medication</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 hours after the first dose of study medication</time_frame>
    <description>A SBM was defined as any BM that does not occur within 24 hours after rescue medication use. Percentage of participants who have an SBM within 24 hours after the first dose will be assessed and derived from the data on SBMs collected in the participant diary.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Degree of Straining Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4</time_frame>
    <description>For each participant, the mean degree of straining was averaged for all SBMs in a given week. The degree of straining for each SBM was collected in the participant diary. The degree of straining is scored on a 5-point scale where: 0=No straining, 1=Mild straining, 2=Moderate straining, 3=Strong straining or 4=Very strong straining with higher scores indicating more severe straining.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Degree Stool Consistency Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4</time_frame>
    <description>For each participant, the mean stool consistency score was averaged for all SBMs in a given week. The mean degree of stool consistency for each SBM was collected in the participant diary based on the Bristol Stool Chart. The Bristol Stool Chart is a visual medical aid designed to classify the form of human feces into seven categories where: 1=Hard and round (difficult-to-pass), 2=Sausage-shaped but hard stool, 3=Sausage-shaped stool with cracks on the surface, 4=Sausage-shaped, soft stool with smooth surface, or coiled stool, 5=Soft, half-solid (and easy-to-pass) stool with clear crease, 6=Unshaped, loose stool with small, irregular-shaped pieces, or mushy stool or 7=Watery stool without solid pieces (entirely liquid).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Weekly Abdominal Symptoms Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4</time_frame>
    <description>The abdominal symptoms (bloating and discomfort upon waking in the morning) were scored weekly on a 5-point scale, where: 0=None, 1=Mild, 2=Moderate, 3=Severe or 4=Very severe, with a higher score indicating more severe symptoms. Assessment of weekly abdominal symptoms were recorded by the participant in the diary.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Weekly Responder Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4</time_frame>
    <description>The responder rate was assessed each week and was derived from the data on SBMs collected in the diary. A non-responder was defined as any participant with a spontaneous BM frequency rate of less than 3 for a given week, any participant who dropped out during or before the given week due to lack of efficacy, or any participant who used rescue medication during or within 24 hours before the given week. Otherwise, the participant subject was considered a responder.
A responder with a spontaneous BM frequency rate ≥3 but &lt;4 was considered a moderate responder. Otherwise, the participant was a full responder (≥4 SBM).</description>

The mean degree of stool consistency for each SBM was collected in the participant diary based on the Bristol Stool Chart. The Bristol Stool Chart is a visual medical aid designed to classify the form of human feces into seven categories where: 1=Hard and round (difficult-to-pass), 2=Sausage-shaped but hard stool, 3=Sausage-shaped stool with cracks on the surface, 4=Sausage-shaped, soft stool with smooth surface, or coiled stool, 5=Soft, half-solid (and easy-to-pass) stool with clear crease, 6=Unshaped, loose stool with small, irregular-shaped pieces, or mushy stool or 7=Watery stool without solid pieces (entirely liquid).</description>

        <description>The responder rate was assessed each week and was derived from the data on SBMs collected in the diary. A non-responder was defined as any participant with a spontaneous BM frequency rate of less than 3 for a given week, any participant who dropped out during or before the given week due to lack of efficacy, or any participant who used rescue medication during or within 24 hours before the given week. Otherwise, the participant subject was considered a responder.
A responder with a spontaneous BM frequency rate ≥3 but &lt;4 was considered a moderate responder. Otherwise, the participant was a full responder (≥4 SBM).</description>
