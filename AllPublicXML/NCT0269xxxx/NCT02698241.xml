    <textblock>
      The INTERVENE-HF study is a prospective, non-randomized, multi-center (US only),
      investigational, feasibility study. The purpose of this study is to characterize safety of
      managing heart failure patients with integrated device diagnostics that have an implanted
      commercially available Medtronic cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is expected to be conducted at up to 20 centers located in the United States. Up to
      400 subjects will be enrolled to yield up to 200 eligible subjects that meet screening
      criteria. This study will be conducted in subjects with an implanted, commercially available,
      Medtronic, CRT-D device. Each enrolled subject will be followed every 2 months from time of
      enrollment to end of the study.The study will end after the last enrolled subject completes
      the 12-month follow-up.

    <time_frame>12 months post enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>The Integrated Diagnostic Medication Intervention Strategy was physician-directed and nurse-implemented and it was based on a heart failure risk score diagnostic feature of a Medtronic CRT-D device implanted in the patients with heart failure. Effectiveness of this intervention strategy was measured as the percentage of implemented interventions being effective. Once initiated, an Integrated Diagnostic Medication Intervention would be effective if all the following criteria were met:
The intrathoracic impedance of a subject recovered per defined criterion after completion of the Integrated Diagnostic Medication Intervention;
The subject had no HF-related event (as adjudicated by the CEC) during or in the next 14 days after completion of the Integrated Diagnostic Medication Intervention;
The subject had not experienced any adverse events that were related to the Integrated Diagnostic Medication Intervention per CEC adjudication and require medical care.</description>

    <description>The Integrated Diagnostic Medication Intervention Strategy was physician-directed and nurse-implemented and it was based on a heart failure risk score diagnostic feature of a Medtronic CRT-D device implanted in the patients with heart failure. Safety of this intervention strategy was measured as the percentage of implemented interventions being safe. Once initiated, the Integrated Diagnostic Medication Intervention Strategy would be regarded as being safe if all the following criteria were met:
The Integrated Diagnostic Medication Intervention applied to an episode was not terminated due to safety issues;
The Integrated Diagnostic Medication Intervention applied to an episode had not caused treatment-related adverse events (as adjudicated by the CEC).</description>

          <description>The New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Classification is commonly used to classify patients' heart failure according to the severity of their symptoms. It places patients in one of four categories based on how much they are limited during physical activity: Class I: No limitation of physical activity; Class II: Slight limitation of physical activity, comfortable at rest; Class III: Marked limitation of physical activity, comfortable at rest; Class IV: Unable to carry on any physical activity without discomfort. Higher classes mean worse conditions.</description>

        <description>The Integrated Diagnostic Medication Intervention Strategy was physician-directed and nurse-implemented and it was based on a heart failure risk score diagnostic feature of a Medtronic CRT-D device implanted in the patients with heart failure. Effectiveness of this intervention strategy was measured as the percentage of implemented interventions being effective. Once initiated, an Integrated Diagnostic Medication Intervention would be effective if all the following criteria were met:
The intrathoracic impedance of a subject recovered per defined criterion after completion of the Integrated Diagnostic Medication Intervention;
The subject had no HF-related event (as adjudicated by the CEC) during or in the next 14 days after completion of the Integrated Diagnostic Medication Intervention;
The subject had not experienced any adverse events that were related to the Integrated Diagnostic Medication Intervention per CEC adjudication and require medical care.</description>
