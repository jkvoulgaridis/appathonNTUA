  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and effect on FIX antigen
      and activity levels of ascending doses of SB-FIX. SB-FIX is an intravenously delivered Zinc
      Finger Nuclease (ZFN) Therapeutic for genome editing. It inserts a correct copy of the Factor
      9 gene into the albumin locus in hepatocytes with the goal of lifelong therapeutic production
      of the Factor IX clotting factor.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to provide long term expression of Factor IX in subjects with
      severe hemophilia B. SB-FIX is a therapeutic for ZFN-mediated genome editing which will be
      delivered by adeno-associated virus (AAV)-derived vectors. SB-FIX is intended to function by
      placement of a corrective copy of the Factor IX transgene into the genome of the subject's
      own hepatocytes, under the control of the highly expressed endogenous albumin locus, and is
      expected to provide permanent, liver-specific expression of Factor IX for the lifetime of a
      hemophilia B subject.
