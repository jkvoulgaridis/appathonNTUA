  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies the side effects and best dose of radiation therapy in
      patients with brain tumors that have come back after previous treatment with radiation
      therapy. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors.
      Giving radiation therapy in different ways may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the rate of grade 3 or higher central nervous system (CNS) necrosis 6 months
      after reirradiation of the brain for recurrent tumor.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate acute and late toxicities of reirradiation. II. To evaluate longitudinal
      changes in symptom burden of patients undergoing reirradiation.

      III. To use Advanced Brain Tumor Imaging (ABTI) to evaluate changes in the brain after
      reirradiation, including progression, pseudoprogression, and radionecrosis.

      IV. To estimate progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) following
      reirradiation.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 arms based on age.

      ARM I (Age 0-18 years): Patients undergo radiation therapy with conventional fractionation
      and dose constraints. Treatment continues for up to 6 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II (Age &gt; 18 years): Patients undergo radiation therapy with conventional fractionation
      and dose constraints. Patients also receive bevacizumab concurrently at the discretion of the
      treating neuro-oncologist. Treatment continues for up to 6 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 month, then every 2 months
      for 1 year, then every 3 months for 1 year.
