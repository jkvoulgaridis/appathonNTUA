  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates if electric toothbrushes with a 3D action (rotation / oscillation and
      pulsation) are more effective than manual toothbrushes in removing plaque and reducing
      gingival inflammation in patients under orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances.

      This trial is designed as a randomized, controlled, investigator blinded superiority trial,
      with two parallel groups and a 1:1 allocation ratio. Equal number of males and females will
      be allocated to each group.

      One group of orthodontic patients will receive an electric toothbrush with orthodontic head
      and the other group will receive a manual orthodontic brush. Tooth brushing instructions will
      be provided. Measurements of two plaque indices and two gingival indices will be taken at
      baseline and at 3 monthly intervals.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        - Age between 12 and 16 years. Good general health according to a recent full medical
        history. Fixed labial orthodontic appliances on all teeth from central incisor to first
        molar (bands on first molars, metallic brackets-conventional, not self ligating-on other
        teeth), in both the maxillary and the mandibular arch, placed at least two months before
        the patient is accepted into the study and no more than two years.

        Non-extraction orthodontic treatment. Plaque-induced gingivitis: patients will be included
        if they have gingival bleeding on at least 30% of the sites examined using the criteria for
        bleeding of the Modified Simplified Gingival Index.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        - Active caries. Periodontitis. Tooth agenesis (excluding third molars). Syndromes and
        craniofacial deformities. Current use of electric toothbrush. More than two cervical and/or
        proximal fillings. Dental prostheses or dental implants. Smoking or use of other tobacco
        products. Antibiotics during the last 2 months. Medication that may result in gingival
        enlargement (e.g. anticonvulsants, immunosuppressants, calcium channel blockers).

        Disabilities that might affect toothbrushing skills (manual dexterity, mental
        disabilities).

        Peri-oral or intra-oral piercing. Cardiac or other medical condition that requires
        antibiotic prophylaxis for dental treatment.

        Participation in other trials.
