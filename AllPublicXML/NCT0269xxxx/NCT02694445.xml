      This observational study covered all the 30 provincials/municipals/autonomous in mainland
      China except Hong Kong and Macau. Tier 3 hospitals, psychiatric hospitals, elderly hospitals,
      nursing home and communities were randomly selected as research centers, and more than 2500
      patients with AD and their caregivers were enrolled at last. The main outcome of this study
      was assessed not only by the electronic medical system of communities and hospitals, but also
      by questionnaires. Using a societal prevalence-based gross COI approach to estimated the
      total yearly costs of AD in China.

    <measure>The Annual National Total Socioeconomic Cost for All AD Patients in China</measure>
    <time_frame>one year</time_frame>
    <description>The annual national total socioeconomic cost for all patients with AD in China in 2015 was obtained, with the average annual cost per patient with AD from our results multiplied by the all number of patients with AD in 2015. So, the value reported in the data table below represents the total cost for all all participants in China.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. New patients who are diagnosed with AD in this investigation or old patients who were
             diagnosed prior to this investigation were eligible；

          2. AD diagnosis must meet criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
             Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) and the National Institute of
             Neurologic and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer's Disease and
             Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA). The diagnosis should also meet the
             following: Modified Hachinski Ischemic Scale (MHIS) score≤4, Activity of Daily Living
             Scale (ADL) score≥23, Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) score＜11. Neuroimaging MRI
             support AD diagnosis (exist atrophy in medial temporal lobe, white matter lesions
             score≤2 minutes according to the Fazekas criteria. AD disease classification according
             to mini-mental state examination (MMSE) scale (for illiterate dementia: mild: 21~24
             points; moderate: 11~20 points; severe: 10 points or less; for lettered dementia:
             mild: 16~19 points; moderate: 8~15 points; severe: 7 points or less). The diagnosis of
             AD was confirmed by brain CT or MRI scans and by laboratory tests to rule out any
             other significant comorbidity.

          3. 60-year-old and above, men or women.

          4. Normal vision or corrected visual, normal audition or corrected auditory, and
             cooperate with inspections and treatments.

          5. Consent to participate with a signed informed consent by himself/herself or guardians.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient with vascular dementia or dementia caused by other reasons, such as major
             depression or other major psychiatric illnesses, thyroid dysfunction, encephalitis,
             multiple sclerosis, and other dementia which includes frontotemporal dementia (FTD),
             dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and Parkinson's dementia (PDD).

          2. MRI and laboratory tests (blood cell counts, liver and renal function, electrolyte,
             vitamin B12/folic, HIV, syphilis, and so on) do not support or rule out AD diagnoses.

          3. Has a history of alcoholism and drug abuse.
