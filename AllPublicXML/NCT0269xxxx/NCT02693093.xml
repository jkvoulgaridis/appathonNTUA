      The primary objective of the Single-Dose Phase is to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) and
      safety of single doses of NI-03 when administered at doses of 100 mg, 200 mg or 300 mg to
      subjects with chronic pancreatitis.

      The primary objective of the Double-Blind Phase of the study is to determine the efficacy, PK
      and safety of three doses of NI-03 (100 mg, 200 mg and 300 mg) as compared to placebo when
      administered three times daily (TID) for 28 consecutive days in subjects with chronic
      pancreatitis.
