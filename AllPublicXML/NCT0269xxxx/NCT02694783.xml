      Background:

      Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a brain infection in people with a
      weakened immune system. Researchers think polyoma virus specific T cells (PyVST) therapy can
      treat PML. The PyVST cells are made from blood cells of a healthy relative. They are grown in
      a lab to expand the virus-killing cells, then given to the person with PML.

      Objective:

      To test whether PyVST safely treats PML.

      Eligibility:

        -  Adults ages 18 and older with PML

        -  Healthy adults ages 18 and older who have:

             -  Been screened under protocol 97-H-0041

             -  A sibling, parent, or child with PML and matching cells

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with:

             -  Medical history

             -  Physical exam

             -  Blood and urine tests

        -  PML participants will also be screened with:

             -  Cerebrospinal fluid removed by needle in the back.

             -  MRI: A dye is injected in a vein. They lie on a table that slides into a cylinder.

             -  Questionnaires

      Healthy participants will have apheresis: Blood flows through a needle in one arm into
      machine that separates blood cells needed for donation. The rest of the blood is returned by
      needle to the other arm. Some participants may have a central line placed in a vein instead.
      They can have apheresis up to 3 times, at least 28 days apart.

      Participants with PML will receive the PyVST cells by needle in the arm. They will stay in
      the hospital 1 week. They can do this up to 3 times, at least 28 days apart. After each
      infusion, they will have weekly visits for 1 month. Then they will have 4 visits over 1 year.
      Visits include repeats of screening tests.

      Objective

      This pilot clinical trial will aim to determine the feasibility and potential toxicities
      associated with treating patients with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) with
      polyomavirus (PyV)-specific partially matched polyclonal allogeneic T cells. It will further
      provide initial efficacy data for this indication.

      Study Population

      Up to 18 subjects with definite PML, defined as clinical signs and MRI compatible with active
      PML and the presence of JCV by PCR in CSF. Subjects must be 18 years of age or older and must
      have a first degree, partially HLA- matched relative able and willing to act as a donor of
      lymphocytes. Subjects with underlying reversible immunosuppression (i.e.- HIV or MS status
      post treatment with natalizumab), or subjects with uncontrolled malignancy will be excluded.
      Subjects with evidence of active CNS inflammation as determined by presence of significant
      contrast enhancement within the PML lesions by MRI will also be excluded because it is
      assumed such patients are already mounting an adequate immune response against the infection.

      Design

      This will be a first-in-human pilot study assessing the feasibility and toxicity profile of
      NIH PyVST cellular product in subjects with PML. Subjects will be screened under the existing
      NIH Natural History study of PML (13-N-0017). Sequential enrollment will be spaced at least
      28 days apart. An initial fixed dose PyVST infusion (target dose of 1 x 10(6) PyVST/kg (+/-
      10%)) will be administered by intravenous (IV) infusion, followed by 2x 10(6) PyVST/kg
      (+/-10%) up to 2 times to each subject if needed.

      Outcome Measures

      Safety will be monitored to 28 days continuously with stopping rules based on the
      treatment-related serious adverse event rate. Secondary outcomes include survival, assessed
      at day 28 and at 1 year following the last infusion. CSF viral titers, MR imaging, and
      clinical disability scales will also be collected.
