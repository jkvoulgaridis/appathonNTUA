    <description>The Bond and Lader Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) monitored the subjective mood of each participant on 16 mood scales. Participants were asked to indicate on the VAS scale ranging from 0 to 100 mm about how they felt at the moment the scale was administered (example, alert/drowsy; calm/excited; content/tensed). The individual responses from the 16 mood scales were then combined to make three affective dimensions/subscales a) alertness (average of 9 items [total range 0 to 100, where each item is ordered so that higher scores indicated more alertness]), b) mood (average of 2 items [total range 0 to 100, where higher scores indicated elevated mood]), and c) calmness (average of 5 items [total range 0 to 100, where higher scores indicated more calmness]). Baseline is defined as the last available recording prior to dosing on Day 1.</description>

                  confirming the post-menopausal state;

               2. Have undergone a documented hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy;

               3. Have medically confirmed ovarian failure. All other female subjects (including
                  females with tubal ligations and females that do NOT have a documented
                  hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy and/or ovarian failure) will be considered
                  to be of childbearing potential.

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) of 17.5 to 30.5 kg/m2; and a total body weight &gt;50 kg (110 lbs).

          -  Evidence of a personally signed and dated informed consent document indicating that
             the subject has been informed of all pertinent aspects of the study.

          -  Subjects who are willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan,
             laboratory tests, and other study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic, or
             allergic disease (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic,
             seasonal allergies at time of dosing).

          -  Treatment with an investigational drug within 30 days (or as determined by the local
             requirement) or 5 half-lives preceding the first dose of study medication (whichever
             is longer).

          -  Screening supine blood pressure &gt;= 140 mm Hg (systolic) or &gt;=90 mm Hg (diastolic),
             following at least 5 minutes of rest. If BP is &gt;=140 mm Hg (systolic) or &gt;=90 mm Hg
             (diastolic), repeat per local standard operating procedures (SOP). If orthostatic
             changes are present and deemed to be clinically significant by the investigator,
             Subject can be excluded.

        <title>Change From Baseline for Bond and Lader Visual Analogue Scale (BL-VAS) on Days 1, 4, 7, 10, 14, 15 and 16 - Alertness</title>
        <description>The Bond and Lader Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) monitored the subjective mood of each participant on 16 mood scales. Participants were asked to indicate on the VAS scale ranging from 0 to 100 mm about how they felt at the moment the scale was administered (example, alert/drowsy; calm/excited; content/tensed). The individual responses from the 16 mood scales were then combined to make three affective dimensions/subscales a) alertness (average of 9 items [total range 0 to 100, where each item is ordered so that higher scores indicated more alertness]), b) mood (average of 2 items [total range 0 to 100, where higher scores indicated elevated mood]), and c) calmness (average of 5 items [total range 0 to 100, where higher scores indicated more calmness]). Baseline is defined as the last available recording prior to dosing on Day 1.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline for Bond and Lader Visual Analogue Scale (BL-VAS) on Days 1, 4, 7, 10, 14, 15 and 16 - Alertness</title>
          <description>The Bond and Lader Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) monitored the subjective mood of each participant on 16 mood scales. Participants were asked to indicate on the VAS scale ranging from 0 to 100 mm about how they felt at the moment the scale was administered (example, alert/drowsy; calm/excited; content/tensed). The individual responses from the 16 mood scales were then combined to make three affective dimensions/subscales a) alertness (average of 9 items [total range 0 to 100, where each item is ordered so that higher scores indicated more alertness]), b) mood (average of 2 items [total range 0 to 100, where higher scores indicated elevated mood]), and c) calmness (average of 5 items [total range 0 to 100, where higher scores indicated more calmness]). Baseline is defined as the last available recording prior to dosing on Day 1.</description>
          <population>The safety analysis set included all participants who received at least 1 dose of study treatment.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline for Bond and Lader Visual Analogue Scale (BL-VAS) on Days 1, 4, 7, 10, 14, 15 and 16 - Calmness</title>
        <description>The Bond and Lader Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) monitored the subjective mood of each participant on 16 mood scales. Participants were asked to indicate on the VAS scale ranging from 0 to 100 mm about how they felt at the moment the scale was administered (example, alert/drowsy; calm/excited; content/tensed). The individual responses from the 16 mood scales were then combined to make three affective dimensions/subscales a) alertness (average of 9 items [total range 0 to 100, where each item is ordered so that higher scores indicated more alertness]), b) mood (average of 2 items [total range 0 to 100, where higher scores indicated elevated mood]), and c) calmness (average of 5 items [total range 0 to 100, where higher scores indicated more calmness]). Baseline is defined as the last available recording prior to dosing on Day 1.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline for Bond and Lader Visual Analogue Scale (BL-VAS) on Days 1, 4, 7, 10, 14, 15 and 16- Mood</title>
        <description>The Bond and Lader Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) monitored the subjective mood of each participant on 16 mood scales. Participants were asked to indicate on the VAS scale ranging from 0 to 100 mm about how they felt at the moment the scale was administered (example, alert/drowsy; calm/excited; content/tensed). The individual responses from the 16 mood scales were then combined to make three affective dimensions/subscales a) alertness (average of 9 items [total range 0 to 100, where each item is ordered so that higher scores indicated more alertness]), b) mood (average of 2 items [total range 0 to 100, where higher scores indicated elevated mood]), and c) calmness (average of 5 items [total range 0 to 100, where higher scores indicated more calmness]). Baseline is defined as the last available recording prior to dosing on Day 1.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With New Onset and Worsening of Post-baseline Suicidality for Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)</title>
        <description>The C-SSRS was an interview-based rating scale to systematically assess suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior. C-SSRS assessed whether participant experienced any of the following 1: completed suicide, 2: suicide attempt (response of &quot;yes&quot; on &quot;actual attempt&quot;), 3: preparatory acts toward imminent suicidal behavior (&quot;yes&quot; on &quot;aborted attempt&quot;, &quot;interrupted attempt&quot;, &quot;preparatory acts or behavior&quot;), 4: any suicidal behavior or ideation, suicidal ideation (&quot;yes&quot; on &quot;wish to be dead&quot;, &quot;non-specific active suicidal thoughts&quot;, &quot;active suicidal ideation with methods without intent to act or some intent to act, without specific plan or with specific plan and intent&quot;), 7: self-injurious behavior, no suicidal intent (&quot;yes&quot; on &quot;has participant engaged in non-suicidal self-injurious behavior&quot;). The new onset and worsening of post-baseline suicidality for C-SSRS was reported.</description>

          <description>Dim Light Melatonin Onset (DLMO) was defined as point in time when the smooth melatonin curve exceeds the threshold. The threshold for each melatonin profile was calculated as the mean of three low consecutive daytime values (raw data points) plus twice the standard deviation of these points.</description>
          <population>The PD (pharmacodynamic) population was defined as all enrolled participants treated who provided at least 3 measurable salivary melatonin concentrations.</population>
