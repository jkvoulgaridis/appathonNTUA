  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Female sexual dysfunction, including sexual arousal disorder, has a significant clinical
      impact, affecting millions of women in the United States alone. Peripheral nerve stimulation,
      such as posterior tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) and dorsal genital nerve stimulation (DGNS)
      can modulate neural circuits for bladder and fecal continence. The investigators hypothesize
      that periodic DGNS and PTNS will modulate autonomic neural circuits and promote improvements
      in sexual function in women with sexual arousal disorder. Subjects will be randomized to
      receive one of the stimulation approaches. Subjects will have weekly 30-minute sessions
      across twelve weeks.

    <measure>6 Weeks - Total FSFI Score</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks after beginning of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Sexual function was measured by the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), which is a validated, 19-item questionnaire evaluating sexual functioning in women. A clinical cutoff score of 26.55 differentiates women with and without sexual dysfunction, with below a 26.55 indicating sexual dysfunction. The minimum score one can receive is 2, and the maximum score is 36. Higher scores indicate better sexual functioning. The total FSFI score is the sum of the six subcategories (desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction and pain) which each have a maximum score of 6. Each subcategory has questions scored either 0-5 (arousal, lubrication, orgasm, pain) or 1-5 (desire, satisfaction). The sum for each subcategory is multiplied by a factor of either 0.3 (arousal, lubrication), 0.4 (orgasm, satisfaction, pain) or 0.6 (desire). The minimum score for desire is 1.2 and for satisfaction is 0.8, the rest are 0. Only the results from the 9 subjects who completed the study were analyzed.</description>

A clinical cutoff score of 26.55 differentiates women with and without sexual dysfunction, with below a 26.55 indicating sexual dysfunction. The minimum score one can receive is 2, and the maximum score is 36. Higher scores indicate better sexual functioning. The total FSFI score is the sum of the six subcategories (desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction and pain) which each have a maximum score of 6.</description>

Each subcategory has questions scored either 0-5 (arousal, lubrication, orgasm, pain) or 1-5 (desire, satisfaction). The sum for each subcategory is multiplied by a factor of either 0.3 (arousal, lubrication), 0.4 (orgasm, satisfaction, pain) or 0.6 (desire). The minimum score for desire is 1.2 and for satisfaction is 0.8, the rest are 0. Only the results from the 9 subjects who completed the study were analyzed.</description>

A clinical cutoff score of 26.55 differentiates women with and without sexual dysfunction, with below a 26.55 indicating sexual dysfunction. The minimum score one can receive is 2, and the maximum score is 36. Higher scores indicate better sexual functioning. The total FSFI score is the sum of the six subcategories (desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction and pain) which each have a maximum score of 6. Each subcategory has questions scored either 0-5 (arousal, lubrication, orgasm, pain) or 1-5 (desire, satisfaction). The sum for each subcategory is multiplied by a factor of either 0.3 (arousal, lubrication), 0.4 (orgasm, satisfaction, pain) or 0.6 (desire). The minimum score for desire is 1.2 and for satisfaction is 0.8, the rest are 0. Only the results from the 9 subjects who completed the study were analyzed.</description>
