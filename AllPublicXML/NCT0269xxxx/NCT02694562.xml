    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine safety and local tumor control of Embozene TANDEM
      Microspheres (40um TANDEM) loaded with Irinotecan to treat metastatic colorectal carcinoma
      (mCRC).

    <textblock>
      Colon or rectal carcinoma that has spread to the liver is considered to be metastatic and is
      a Stage IV cancer. If the metastasized tumor is unresectable, the only current treatment is
      chemotherapy. Transarterial Chemoembolization (TACE) is considered as a palliative treatment
      in advanced metastatic colorectal carcinoma (mCRC), with the potential of local tumor
      control. TACE has evolved in the past 8 years to include drug-delivery devices that can
      target and deliver drugs from small microparticles (DEB-TACE). Superselective DEB-TACE has
      the potential to penetrate deeper into the tumor's vasculature to reach peripheral growing
      points. Loading these microparticles with a cytotoxic drug may improve the level of local
      tumor control.

      The MIRACLE III study is a controlled, pilot, single center (Italy) study on 18 subjects with
      pretreated non-resectable mCRC.

    <description>Freedom from Serious Adverse Events reports the number of participants that did not have a serious adverse event reported within 30 days of treatment that results in any of the following outcomes: Death, a life-threatening adverse drug experience, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital anomaly/birth defects.</description>

    <description>Local tumor control reports the percent of subjects for which the size of the tumor does not increase. Local Tumor Control is defined as subjects having complete response or stable disease. For these subjects the treated tumor either shrinks or stays the same size when measuring the tumor using a standard tumor measurement guideline (based on the devascularization pattern from the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) criteria).</description>

    <description>Time to Tumor Progression is defined as the time from the date of first study treatment to the day of documented disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 1 year. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (mRECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions.</description>

          <title>Classification of Malignant Tumours (TNM) Stage</title>
          <description>TNM staging takes into account the size of the tumour, whether the lymph nodes (glands) are affected and whether cancer cells have spread anywhere else.
TNM stands for Tumour, Node, Metastasis. The TNM system describes the size of a primary tumour (T), whether the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes (N), and whether the cancer has spread to a different part of the body (M - for metastases).</description>

          <title>Child Pugh</title>
          <description>The Pugh-Child score is measured utilizing five clinical measures. The five measures are: total bilirubin (yellow compound in bile from hemoglobin breakdown), serum albumin (blood protein produced in the liver), prothrombin time (time for blood to clot), ascites (fluid in peritoneal cavity), and hepatic encephalopathy (brain disorder from liver disease). A score of 1, 2, or 3 is given to each measure, with 3 being the most severe.
From these assessments, Child-Pugh is scored as follows: Class A (5 to 6 points), Class B (7 to 9 points), and Class C (10 to 15 points)</description>

        <description>Local tumor control reports the percent of subjects for which the size of the tumor does not increase. Local Tumor Control is defined as subjects having complete response or stable disease. For these subjects the treated tumor either shrinks or stays the same size when measuring the tumor using a standard tumor measurement guideline (based on the devascularization pattern from the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) criteria).</description>

        <title>Time To Tumor Progression</title>
        <description>Time to Tumor Progression is defined as the time from the date of first study treatment to the day of documented disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 1 year. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (mRECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions.</description>

        <population>Two participants that did not have disease progression reported during the trial are not included in this analysis. One subject underwent liver resection surgery after their third study treatment and another subject’s tumor response was reported as stable disease prior to being lost to follow up after their third study treatment.</population>
