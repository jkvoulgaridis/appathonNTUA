      The goal of this project is to identify predictors of success in the treatment of obesity
      after bariatric surgery. The specific aims of this proposal are to:

        1. Employ behavioral tests of mechanisms that control food intake in normal weight
           individuals, to determine which intake control mechanisms lead to changes after
           Roux-en-y gastric bypass (RYGB) or sleeve gastrectomy (SG); and

        2. Measure behavioral and psycho-social predictors of weight loss and food intake
           reduction, so as to determine which are most predictive of successful weight loss and
           food intake reduction.

        3. Account for success in reduction of food intake brought about by the pattern of hormone
           release, particularly glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), Peptide YY (PYY) and gastric
           distention, known to underlie satiation, coupled with post-ingestive changes in
           reinforcing value of food and motivation to consume.

      Tests of the hypothesis will be done by measuring responses to tasting, working for, and
      consuming, foods on sensory, motivational, cognitive, and physiological variables, including
      amount consumed and rate of eating under standardized conditions, before surgery and at a two
      year follow up visit. In addition, the inhibitor sitagliptin will be administered the night
      before and day of test meal and exendin-9-39 (EX9) will be infused before and during the meal
      to determine whether blockade of GLP-1 / PYY receptors after surgery reverses intake
      reduction. Investigators predict that successful patients will show changes that favor
      reduction in food intake, rate of eating, motivation to consume, reward value of foods, and a
      hormone profile that has been shown to generate satiation and maintain reduction in intake
      (e.g. increased Cholecystokinin (CCK), GLP-1, PYY, reduced ghrelin). To the extent that
      psycho-social and cognitive factors may override physiological brakes to eating behavior, the
      subjects may fail to achieve success, and consequently the failure may be predicted from
      over-impulsiveness or inability to suppress working for rewarding food stimuli. To test these
      hypotheses, a total of 83 patients will be enrolled prior to RYGB/SG and restudied 2 years
      after the surgery. The sitagliptin / EX9 studies will be done in a subset of 32 completers.
      To test this aim, patients will be divided into 4 groups of 19. The 4 patients from each
      group with the most weight loss (% weight loss ≥35 at 2 years post-surgery, 16 patients in
      total) and least weight loss (% weight loss of ≤25 at two years 16 patients in total) will be
      recruited for these two additional post-operative visits within one year of completing Visit
      #3 after the RYGB/SG surgery. A total of 32 patients will be recruited for visits 4 and 5.

    <textblock>
      Obesity is a major public health as well as economic (expense of treating) problem
      world-wide, and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and Sleeve Gastrectomy (SG) surgeries are
      effective treatments. A barrier to progress is that between 25% and 40% patients were not
      successful in achieving and maintaining at least 30% weight loss, which is considered
      medically successful for this operation. Understanding the mechanisms that contribute to
      success or failure of this operation is an unsolved problem in obesity research, which this
      proposal is addressing. The focus of this project is to identify mechanisms that contribute
      to suppression of food intake following bariatric surgery, and to investigate whether these
      mechanisms predict long-term success following bariatric surgery
