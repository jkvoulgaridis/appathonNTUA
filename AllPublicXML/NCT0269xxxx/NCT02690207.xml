      The purpose of this study is to cross-vaccinate and collect safety data in terms of
      unsolicited Adverse Events (AEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and potential Immune Mediated
      Disease (pIMD) from subjects &gt;= 50 Years of age (YOA) who previously received placebo in
      ZOSTER-006 (NCT01165177) and ZOSTER-022 (NCT01165229).

      Since the HZ/su vaccine has not yet been licensed and marketed, this study is being conducted
      to enable potentially eligible subjects who previously received placebo in ZOSTER-006
      (NCT01165177) or ZOSTER-022 (NCT01165229) to receive the HZ/su vaccine.

      Study ZOSTER-056 is an open-label, multi-centric and single arm study to cross-vaccinate and
      collect safety data in terms of of unsolicited Adverse Events (AEs), Serious Adverse Events
      (SAEs) and pIMD from subjects &gt;= 50 YOA who previously received placebo.

    <description>An unsolicited AE covers any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. Any was defined as the occurrence of any unsolicited AE regardless of intensity grade or relation to vaccination. Grade 3 AE = an AE which prevented normal, everyday activities.

    <description>Serious adverse events (SAEs) assessed include medical occurrences that resulted in death, were life-threatening, required hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization or resulted in disability/incapacity.

    <time_frame>From Month 0 until study end (Month 14, i.e. 12 months post dose 2)</time_frame>
    <description>pIMDs are a subset of AEs that include autoimmune diseases and other inflammatory and/or neurologic disorders of interest which may or may not have an autoimmune aetiology. Related pIMDs=pIMDs assessed by the investigator as related to the vaccination.</description>

    <description>A suspected case of HZ was defined as a new rash characteristic of HZ (e.g., unilateral, dermatomal and accompanied by pain broadly defined to include allodynia, pruritus or other sensations).
Clinically confirmed HZ episode is suspected HZ episode confirmed by the Investigator/Delegate.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, can and will comply with the
             requirements of the protocol (e.g. completion of the diary cards, vaccination visits,
             follow-up contacts). Or subjects' Legally Acceptable Representative(s)
             [LAR(s)]/caregiver who, in the opinion of the investigator, can and will comply with
             the requirements of the protocol (e.g. completion of the diary cards, vaccination
             visits, availability for follow-up contacts).

          -  Written informed consent obtained from the subject/Legally Acceptable
             representative(s) [LAR(s)] of the subject prior to performing any study specific
             procedure. If the subjects is not capable of giving consent, his/her assent to
             participate should be obtained to the extent possible.

          -  Subject who previously participated in ZOSTER-006 or ZOSTER-022 studies and received
             at least one dose of placebo.

          -  Female subjects of non-childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study.

               -  Non-childbearing potential is defined as pre-menarche, current tubal ligation,
                  hysterectomy, ovariectomy or post-menopause.

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study, if the
             subject:

               -  has practiced adequate contraception for 30 days prior to vaccination, and

               -  has a negative pregnancy test on the day of vaccination and

               -  has agreed to continue adequate contraception during the entire treatment period*
                  and for 2 months after completion of the vaccination series.

                    -  treatment period refers to vaccination days and the interval between them.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use of any investigational or non-registered product (drug or vaccine) other than the

             from disease (e.g., malignancy, Human Immunodeficiency Virus [HIV] infection) or

             chemotherapy, organ transplantation or to treat autoimmune disorders).

          -  History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component
             of the vaccine.
