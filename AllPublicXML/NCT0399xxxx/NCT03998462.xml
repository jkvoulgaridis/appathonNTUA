      To investigate the efficacy of Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction (MBSR),to improve HRQoL,
      cognition, and mood, as well as to determine the longevity of the treatment response in
      individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD).

      Eligible study participants will be randomly assigned to one of two interventions: 1)
      Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction for Parkinson's disease; MBSR-PD or 2)
      Psychoeducational/supportive care. Interventions are held within a group format consisting of
      approximately 6-8 individuals with PD. Groups will meet once per week for over a 8-week
      period. All participants will be administered a battery of neuropsychological tests to
      measure HRQoL, cognition (e.g., executive function, attention, memory), and mood (i.e.,
      anxiety, depression, and apathy), as well as motor symptoms, disease severity, and
      mindfulness engagement/practice. Tests will be administered at baseline, 8 weeks
      (post-treatment), and 6- and 12-months (follow-up assessments) by an examiner blinded to
      group assignment.
