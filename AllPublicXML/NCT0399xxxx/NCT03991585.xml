  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in emotion regulation as measured by Emotion Regulation Checklist (ERC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Emotion Regulation subscale of the ERC is an 8-item, four-point Likert-type scale to assess ER processes in children. Parents and teachers will complete the ERC pre- and post-intervention. Scores range from 8 to 32 points. Higher scores reflect greater emotion regulation.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in emotional lability/negativity as measured by Emotion Regulation Checklist (ERC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Lability/Negativity subscale of the ERC is a 15-item, four-point Likert-type scale to assess emotional lability in children. Parents and teachers will complete the ERC pre- and post-intervention. Scores range from 15 to 60 points. Higher scores reflect greater emotional lability.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in behaviors as measured by the Child Behavior Checklist for Ages 1.5-5 (CBCL/1.5-5)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The CBCL/1.5-5 is a 99-item, three-point Likert-type scale to assess internalizing behaviors, externalizing behaviors, attending behaviors, and aggressive in preschool-aged children. Parents will complete the CBCL/1.5-5 pre- and post-intervention. Scores range from 0 to 198 points. Higher scores reflect greater emotional problems.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in behaviors as measured by the Caregiver-Teacher Report Form (C-TRF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The C-TRF is a 99-item, three-point Likert-type scale to assess internalizing behaviors, externalizing behaviors, attending behaviors, and aggressive in preschool-aged children. Teachers will complete the CBCL/1.5-5 pre- and post-intervention. Scores range from 0 to 198 points. Higher scores reflect greater emotional problems.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in emotion regulation state as self-reported using the Self Assessment Manikin (SAM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-session, 20-minute post-session</time_frame>
    <description>The SAM is a nonverbal, picture-based, 5-point Likert-type measure of a child's self-reported levels of pleasure (i.e., valence) and arousal (i.e., energy level). Children will complete the SAM at the beginning and end of every intervention session. Scores range from 1 to 5. Higher scores reflect greater happiness and more energy.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in emotion regulation state as observed using the Goal Attainment Scale (GAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-session, 20-minute post-session</time_frame>
    <description>The GAS is a way to measure individualized clinical progress on a predetermined goal, i.e. preschooler emotion regulation state. The interventionist will complete the GAS at the beginning and end of every intervention session. Scores range from negative 2 to positive 2. Higher scores reflect greater emotion regulation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of study measures completed</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Will be measured by adding the number of measures completed divided by total number of measured administered.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of child attendance</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Will be measured by adding the number of study sessions completed divided by total number of study sessions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of intervention components completed by interventionist</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by using a self-developed Quality Assurance (QA) checklist that tallies the number of intervention components completed. Scores will range from 0 to 100 percent, with a higher score indicating greater interventionist fidelity.</description>
