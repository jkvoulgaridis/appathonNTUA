  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project was undertaking by Qilu Hospital of Shandong University in China. In order to
      report the efficacy and safety of glycyrrhetinic acid combining with high-dose dexamethasone
      for the treatment of adults with newly-diagnosed primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP).

      The investigators anticipate to undertaking a parallel group, single-centre, randomised
      controlled trial of 30 ITP adult patients. One part of the participants are randomly selected
      to receive glycyrrhetinic acid (given compound glycyrrhizin tablets orally at a dose of 225mg
      per day for 1 month), combining with dexamethasone (given orally at a dose of 40 mg per day
      for 4 days, two-cycles with an interval of 10 days); the others are selected to receive
      high-dose of dexamethasone treatment plus placebo. Platelet count, bleeding and other
      symptoms were evaluated before and after treatment. Adverse events are also recorded
      throughout the study. In order to report the efficacy and safety of glycyrrhetinic acid
      combining with high-dose dexamethasone therapy for the treatment of adults with ITP.
