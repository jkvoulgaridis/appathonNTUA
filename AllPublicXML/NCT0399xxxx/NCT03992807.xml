      To determine whether a decision aid increases informed decision about cataract surgery for
      patients with age-related cataract.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The need for cataract surgery is on the rise globally due to the aging population and high
      demands for greater visual functioning. Patients with age-related cataract face their initial
      decision about when to undergo cataract surgery. Although the majority of patients want to
      participate in a shared decision-making process, no decision aid has been available to
      improve the quality of decision. The purpose of this study is to determine whether a decision
      aid increases informed decision about cataract surgery for patients with age-related
      cataract.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Informed choice about cataract surgery (the proportion of participants who make an informed choice，which is defined as a good knowledge score and an intention that is consistent with their attitude score)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Informed choice is an aggregated measure of multiple measurements, including knowledge (a 12-item questionnaire that assesses conceptual (items 1-10) and numerical (items 11-12) knowledge), attitudes (6 items, with 5 responses for each), and intentions (single item with 5 responses)
Analysis: Informed Choice= Good Knowledge (score ≥50% in basic knowledge, ≥40% in knowledge associated with each treatment option, and at least 1 point in each numerical knowledge question) AND Positive Attitude (score ≥24) AND Positive Intention (&quot;definitely will&quot; or &quot;likely to&quot;), OR Good Knowledge AND Negative Attitude (score &lt;23) AND Negative Intention (&quot;unsure&quot;, &quot;not likely to&quot;, or &quot;definitely will not&quot;)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Booklet utilization and acceptability</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks post intervention</time_frame>

the proportion of participants who could read the booklet all the way through;
the proportion of participants who agree that the information is new;
the proportion of participants who agree that the length is just about right;
the proportion of participants who think the information is balanced;
the proportion of participants who agree that the booklet is clear and easy to understand;
