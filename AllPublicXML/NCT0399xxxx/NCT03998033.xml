  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a open-label, dose escalation, multi-center, Phase I / Phase II study to assess the
      safety of an autologous T-cell product (ET140202) in adult subjects with advanced
      Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) positive/Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) A-2 positive Hepatocellular
      Carcinoma (HCC).

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate a genetically modified autologous T-cell therapy
      for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). ET140202 T cells are autologous T cells
      genetically modified to carry a TCR-mimic (TCRm) construct capable of mediating cell killing
      by targeting tumor specific intracellular antigens and addressing solid tumor therapy
      challenges.
