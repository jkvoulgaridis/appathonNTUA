      This research project will investigate neurofeedback training in stroke rehabilitation during
      which patients receive feedback in real time from their brain activity measured with
      ElectroEncephaloGraphy (EEG). The investigators hypothesize that the feedback training allows
      to internally stimulate brain motor networks in order to promote functional recovery of the
      hand.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be carried out as a pilot study in order to optimize and set parameters for a
      subsequent study that will involve more stroke patients. Stroke patients will be trained to
      mentally imagine the opening and closing of the hand (hereafter named MI, Motor Imagery).
      During the training, the patients will receive visual feedback in real time that reflects the
      neural activity related to motor processes. The NeuroFeedback (NF) will be projected with
      minimal time delay to maximize the neural learning. This type of brain training with feedback
      is thought to have significant importance to stimulate the ability of the brain to reorganize
      and compensate for a damaged region.

      Each participant will go through the following data collection procedure (total of 27-28
      measurement sessions per RP):

        -  Clinical baseline evaluations, 1 time/week during 3 weeks

        -  1 MRI measurement during one week

        -  2-3 calibration EEG recordings during one week

        -  MI-neurofeedback training [3 times/week] + Clinical intervention evaluation [1
           time/week] during 4 weeks

        -  1 MRI measurement + 1 calibration EEG recording during one week

        -  Clinical intervention evaluations, 1 time/week during 3 weeks

      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) measurements. The MRI exam will be carried out on a Siemens
      MAGNETOM Prisma 3T scanner (head-coil with 20 channels) at baseline and at final assessment
      session at Stockholm University Brain Imaging Centre. The MRI protocol comprises i)
      anatomical whole brain spin-echo T1 and T2 weighted sequences for description of lesion size
      and location ii) acquisition of T2*-weighted gradient echo EPI-BOLD images of the whole brain
      for assessment of resting state functional connectivity of sensorimotor networks
      (resting-state functional MRI (fMRI)), and iii) the same sequence as the previous with rest
      interleaved by a motor imagery paradigm further described below.

      Motor Imagery (MI) paradigm. The paradigm consists of instructing RP, by the use of a
      mirrored computer screen, to either i) rest his/her mind with eyes open, ii) mentally imagine
      a hand movement (MI), or ii) execute a hand movement. The hand movements that are instructed
      are either to close the hand or to open the hand and extend the fingers. RP will perform
      several repetitions of each hand movement (MI and execution) in order to collect a
      statistical basis.

      Calibration EEG recording. Calibration of EEG recordings will be performed at 2-3 times
      during 1 week prior to the intervention and one time after the intervention while the
      participant performs the mental imagery paradigm described above. RP will be seated in front
      a computer screen and ratings will be registered by the use of a button-press. During these
      session, EEG, EOG, EMG, and accelerometer-data will be collected and are further described
      below.

      ElectroEncephaloGram (EEG), ElectroOculoGram (EOG), ElectroMyoGram (EMG) and accelerometer
      equipment. The EEG equipment consists of a 64-electrode scalp EEG acquisition system (Brain
      Products ActiCHamp). The 64 electrodes (active Ag/AgCl) will be distributed according to the
      extended 10-20 reference placement system. In addition to the EEG recording, 3 electrodes
      (passive Ag/AgCl, Brain Products) will be placed on each side of both eyes and on the earlob
      to measure eye-movements during the experiment (EOG). EMG electrodes (passive Ag/AgCl, Brain
      Products) will be placed over four muscles controlling the wrist and fingers according to a
      standardized protocol. Two accelerometer-sensors (Brain Products) will be placed on the hand
      and the index finger in order to record movement-related activity.

      EEG, EOG, EMG and accelerometer data analysis. The recorded data will be further analyzed
      offline in order to evaluate the characteristic features in the data that best describe MI of
      hand movements. This will be performed in Matlab and Labview combining custom-made scripts
      with already developed toolboxes (such as EEGLab, Chronux). Features to be evaluated will
      include the evoked activity, the time-frequency spectra, phase, correlation coefficients,
      coherency among other. When the feature that best describes MI has been identified different
      classifier and pattern recognition methods will be evaluated in extracting the information.
      Intelligent algorithms, Support Vector Machine (SVM), regularized linear regression, naïve
      Bayes classifiers among others will be evaluated and compared. These are commonly used
      methods in the field of neurotechnology and a prior comparison-study using neural data from
      invasive recordings shows the importance of choosing a well-adapted classifier for extracting
      information.

      MI-NeuroFeedback Training (NFT). EEG, EOG, EMG and accelerometer-data will be collected as
      described in the section &quot;EEG, EMG and accelerometer equipment&quot;. RP will perform the MI
      paradigm without the execution of hand movements. Real-time feedback from recorded
      EEG-activity will be provided to RP during MI. The feedback consists of a virtual hand on a
      computer screen whose movements reflect the brain activity of RP related to MI. The recorded
      data will be further analyzed offline with the analytic tools that are described in previous
      section.
