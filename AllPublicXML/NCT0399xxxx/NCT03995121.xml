  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate a new SV2A tracer, [11C]APP311, in healthy aging and
      neuropsychiatric disorders including psychotic disorders and cannabis use disorders.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this protocol is to study synaptic density in two psychiatric disorders
      (namely schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, and cannabis use disorder) with this
      exciting new PET tracer. Secondary outcomes will include electroencephalography (EEG). A
      battery of EEG paradigms assessing sensory, perceptual, and cognitive functions will also be
      administered. The primary dependent measures will be traditional event related potentials
      (ERPs; e.g. latency and amplitude) as well as time X frequency analysis (inter-trial
      coherence and spectral power).

    <description>It has been shown that [11C]APP311 (aka [11C]UCB-J) displays high specificity and selectivity for the synaptic vesicle protein SV2A. Since this protein is expressed ubiquitously in active synapses, this tracer has the potential to be a general purpose tool for quantitative imaging of synaptic density.</description>

      When specimens and information are stored, researchers are careful to try to protect your
      identity from discovery by others. Samples and information will receive a unique code. Other
      researchers will only receive coded samples and information, and will not be able to link the
      code to subjects. Strict security safeguards are in place to reduce the chance of misuse or
      unplanned release of information.
