  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      New onset atrial fibrillation (NOAF) is a relatively frequent complication after
      transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). This complication has been related with worse
      short and long-term outcomes, including higher stroke, mortality, readmission and bleeding
      rates. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of amiodarone in the prevention
      of the NOAF after TAVI.

      The study is a multicenter, randomized double-blinded trial including 120 patients without
      prior AF that will undergo TAVI in a scheduled basis. Patients will be randomized to be
      treated with amiodarone orally from 6 days before to 6 days after the TAVI procedure versus
      placebo.

      All the patients will be monitored with a 60-day holter to evaluate NOAF incidence. The main
      objective is NOAF incidence after TAVI at 30-day. Secondary endpoints are the incidence of
      NOAF, stroke, bleeding and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in both groups at 60-day.
      Results of this study can contribute to optimize TAVI results in a short and long term,
      potentially improving the survival and quality of life in this group of frail patients with
      comorbidities, which makes them vulnerable to NOAF, stroke, bleeding, heart failure and
      readmission.

    <description>Compare the incidence of new onset atrial fibrillation (NOAF) on patients that receive oral amiodarone versus placebo. NOAF is defined as an irregular rhythm without P wave and irregular ventricular response during at least 30 seconds, detected in the electrocardiographic monitoring during the post-procedural period or in the 60 days ECG Holter in a patient without previous history of atrial fibrillation. NOAF incidence within 30-day after the TAVI procedure is the primary end-point.</description>
