  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients suffering from Chronic Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) have difficulties in
      executive cognition that hinder their quality of life and make it difficult to recovery and
      to reintegrate them socially and professionally. These difficulties are particularly
      important for soldiers suffering from chronic PTSD.

      The literature suggests that diving may be a complementary approach to improving cognition,
      in addition to its benefits on the quality of life of patients with chronic PTSD. It appears
      to be an intervention of interest to improve the successful recovery for veterans with PTSD
      compared to a multi-sport practice.

      A French military rehabilitation program proposes the broadening of the relationships between
      recovery and reintegration by incorporating approaches in the field of positive psychology
      for soldiers with chronic PTSD. This program was organized for a group of 10 veterans for 10
      days. Each morning, from 9 am to 12 pm, participants had sporting activities: mountain
      walking, mountain biking, climbing, canyoning and collective orienteering running. From 3 pm,
      they had individual and collective practical workshops based on PTSD psychoeducation, human
      resources competences and coaching, including a curriculum vitae workshop.

      The investigators aims to compare this program included multisport practice with the same
      praogram included diving instead of multi-sport to evaluate the impact to recovery at one
      year
