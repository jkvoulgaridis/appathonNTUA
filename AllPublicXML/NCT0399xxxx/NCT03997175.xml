  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children were exposed to biodiverse material or non-diverse material in sand pits. The two
      arms were compared. Immune response and bacterial markers were followed.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children of age 3-5 were randomly divided into two groups (arms). One received guidance and
      biodiverse material for 20 minutes each day for two weeks. The other received the a similar
      material and guidance but the microbial community in the material was poor in diversity.
      Bacterial community changes and immune system markers were analyzed and compared between the
      two arms. Potential changes in Interleukin 10 was the primary outcome.

    <masking_description>Participants nor their parents did not know the arm. Care providers did not know the group as they did not know the content of the sand box. Investigators and field assistants knew the content in each sand box but they did not know the coding of the arms when they analyzed the differences in cytokine levels. Outcomes assessors i.e. nurses who took blood samples did not know the arms nor the contents of the sand boxes.</masking_description>
