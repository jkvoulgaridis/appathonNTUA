      The aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness of combination calcipotriene 0.005%
      foam and 5% fluorouracil cream for the treatment of actinic keratoses on the scalp. The data
      obtained will be compared with the current standard of care, monotherapy with 5% fluorouracil
      cream. A recent randomized, double-blind clinical trial (NCT02019355) compared 0.005%
      calcipotriol ointment and fluorouracil 5% cream with Vaseline plus fluorouracil 5% cream for
      a 4-day treatment of actinic keratoses on the face, scalp and upper extremities. They found
      that calcipotriol plus 5-FU versus Vaseline plus fluorouracil 5% cream led to an 87.8% versus
      26.3% mean reduction in the mean number of actinic keratoses. Our study will independently
      assess the effectiveness of combination treatment (calcipotriene 0.005% foam and fluorouracil
      5% cream) on scalp actinic keratoses in a case series of up to 15 eligible participants.
      Participants will complete a 4-night application of combination treatment with follow-up
      immediately after and 8 weeks later.
