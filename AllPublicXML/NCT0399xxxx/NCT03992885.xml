      This single-arm, open, multicenter clinical study is going to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of combination therapy with ectiecinib, pemetrexed and platinum in patients with
      metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR mutations who did not progress
      after pemetrexed in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The positive rate of EGFR mutations in lung adenocarcinoma patients is about 50% in both
      Asian population and China.Domestic and international clinical studies have found that
      targeted therapy combination chemotherapy can prolong the overall survival of patients with
      EGFR mutations, and a large number of class 2A evidences have been recommended.The 2018 CSCO
      lung cancer guidelines recommend EGFR-TKIs combined with chemotherapy for first-line
      treatment of advanced EGFR mutant NSCLC (grade II recommended).The independently developed
      ectinib in China, belong to EGFR-TKIs as gefitinib and erlotinib . The results of phase III
      clinical trial (ICOGEN) showed that the efficacy of ectinib and gefitinib was similar, but in
      terms of safety, the adverse reactions of the ectinib group were significantly lower than
      that of the gefitinib group, and the difference between the two groups was statistically
      significant.Targeted combination chemotherapy has relatively large side effects, which will
      increase chemotherapy-related side effects, mainly hematological toxicity. Foreign studies
      suggest that combination therapy may be more suitable for patients with good basic
      state.Based on previous studies, this study is going to use the strategy of short-term
      induction chemotherapy and drug sensitivity platform to find the most suitable patients for
      combined therapy.

      This single-arm, open, multicenter clinical study is going to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of combination therapy with ectiecinib, pemetrexed and platinum in patients with
      metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR mutations who did not progress
      after pemetrexed in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy.

      Patients received two cycles of chemotherapy with pemetrexed/platinum before enrolling,
      followed by ectinib: ectinib 125mg/ tablet, one tablet at a time, three times a day, take
      orally, until disease progression;Pemetrexed 500mg/m2, intravenously administered on day
      1;Carboplatin AUC6/ Cisplatin 75mg/m2,intravenously on day 1,21 days for a cycle, a total of
      6 cycles.Maintenance therapy: ectinib: ectinib 125mg/ tablet, one tablet at a time, three
      times a day, take orally, pemetrexed 500mg/m2, intravenously on day 1,21 days for a cycle,
      until disease progression.Make detailed records of toxic and side effects during
      medication.The efficacy was evaluated using RESIST standard after every 2 cycles of the
      treatment, the regimen will continue until the disease progression or the appearance of not
      tolerable toxicity.
