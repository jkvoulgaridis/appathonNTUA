  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Zambia, 40% of children under five years of age are stunted and 6% are wasted. While the
      Zambian government has focused on child nutrition in recent years, more focus on holistically
      improving early child development (ECD) is needed. Through a previous randomized controlled
      trial, the investigators developed a community-based parenting intervention and demonstrated
      that this intervention can improve children's developmental outcomes in Zambia, including
      nutritional status and their early language development. During fortnightly group meetings,
      parents learn a diverse curriculum that includes content on: 1) cognitive stimulation and
      play practices; 2) child nutrition and cooking practices; and 3) self-care for good mental
      health. This information and learning content is delivered by supervised community volunteers
      using an interactive theatre-based approach.

      In this study, the newly established maternity waiting homes (MWHs) and affiliated Safe
      Motherhood Action Group leaders (SMAGs) will be used as a novel platform to launch and
      support community-based parenting groups, embedding this program directly into the existing
      health system, and making them more feasible for scale-up and sustainability.

      Despite the positive impact of the proposed parenting-group model in the pilot trial, this
      model is not currently operating in Zambia. By integrating this intervention into the
      existing health system, large populations of rural children exposed to high levels of
      adversity in the critical early years of life could be reached in a nationally scalable
      fashion. As part of this project, the investigators propose to implement and rigorously
      assess the impact of this approach in four districts of Zambia.

    <textblock>
      This research will utilize a cluster-randomized controlled trial with integrated
      mixed-methods process evaluation to understand the impact of parenting groups on child
      development outcomes when delivered at scale. The specific objectives are to: 1) assess the
      impact of the intervention on early childhood development outcomes; 2) assess the degree to
      which the intervention was implemented according to the project plan and to document
      adjustments made during the course of the project; 3) describe and document the perceptions
      of caregivers on parent groups, as well as any behavioral changes in parenting or in mother
      support networks resulting from participating in parenting groups; and approaches to
      achieving caregiving gender equality at household level; and, 4) generate a set of
      recommendations for the Government of the Republic of Zambia to further adapt and/or scale up
      community parenting groups based on the summative findings from this study.

      For the impact evaluation the investigators will collect data from two main sources: 1)
      Household Surveys and 2) In-depth interviews at both baseline and endline data collection. In
      addition, at endline we will assess child development using the Bayley Scales for Infant and
      Toddler Development, Third Edition (BSID-III).

      For the process evaluation, the investigators will conduct record review of parenting groups
      attendance registers and SMAG log books. The investigators will conduct in-depth interviews
      with health systems staff (province, district and health facility), SMAGs, and head women
      from all intervention sites, and focus group discussions with caregivers who meet the study
      eligibility criteria in both intervention and control zones.
