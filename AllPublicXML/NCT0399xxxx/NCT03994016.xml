  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adolescent dating violence (ADV) is a pressing public health problem in North America, and
      strategies to prevent perpetration are needed. To this end, a substantial body of research
      demonstrates the importance of applying a gender lens to target root causes of ADV. To date,
      however, there has been limited research on how to specifically engage boys in ADV
      prevention. As such, this protocol describes the evaluation of a program called WiseGuyz, a
      community-facilitated, gender-transformative healthy relationships program for mid-adolescent
      (~ages 13-15) male-identified youth. WiseGuyz aims to reduce male-perpetrated ADV, and
      improve mental and sexual health, by helping participants identify and deconstruct male
      gender role norms, and explore healthier, more inclusive ways of being a guy in the world.
      The primary goal of this evaluation is to explore the impact of WiseGuyz on ADV outcomes
      among mid-adolescent male-identified youth, using a mixed-methods, longitudinal,
      quasi-experimental design with a matched comparison group.

      Study Design and Overview:

      In this project, the investigators will examine the association between participation in the
      WiseGuyz program and ADV outcomes. The investigators will use a mixed-methods,
      quasi-experimental design with pre-test, post-test and one-year follow-up surveys, engaging
      participants from two Western Canadian school divisions. Through focus groups with youth
      participants, the investigators will contextualize quantitative survey data, to deepen
      understanding of how WiseGuyz may promote the prevention of ADV.

      Participants:

      The investigators plan to recruit approximately 700-800 grade nine male-identified youth in 7
      participating schools.

      Procedures:

      The investigators will make presentations on the research project to all grade 9 youth at
      participating schools. Any male-identified youth in grade 9 is welcome to participate,
      regardless of their involvement with WiseGuyz. Interested participants will need to provide
      signed parent/guardian consent (paper or electronic) and themselves complete an assent form
      to participate in the research. Quantitative data will be collected in two cohorts (Cohort
      One - pre-test: October 2019; post-test: May 2020; one-year follow-up: May 2021; Cohort Two -
      pre-test: October 2020; post-test: May 2021; one-year follow-up: May 2022).

      The investigators will gather qualitative focus group data from approximately 60 WiseGuyz
      participants immediately post-intervention. Cohort One focus groups will occur in May 2020,
      Cohort Two focus groups will occur in May 2021. The investigators will also interview school
      leadership in Spring 2021.

      To understand program implementation, implementation tracking data will be collected at the
      start of the program year, immediately following each WiseGuyz session, at the end of each
      WiseGuyz module, and at the end of the program year. The investigators will collect these
      data from October 2019-May 2021.

    <intervention_model_description>WiseGuyz' integrated and sequential curriculum is comprised of four core modules and 20 sessions per module. Sessions are a mix of targeted education, group discussion, and skills development (e.g., role play). The sequence of the modules is critical as each module builds into the next. The modules are:
Module 1: Healthy Relationships (6 sessions) Module 2: Sexual Health (5 sessions) Module 3: Gender, Sexuality and the Media (5 sessions) Module 4: Advocacy and Leadership (4 sessions)</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The WiseGuyz program was developed by the Centre for Sexuality (Calgary, AB), and aims to reduce male-perpetrated adolescent dating violence, improve mental and sexual health, and support youth to build healthier, more inclusive relationships in their peer groups, schools and communities, by helping participants identify and deconstruct gender role norms.
WiseGuyz is offered during instructional time by community-based facilitators from the Centre for Sexuality. WiseGuyz is comprised of 20 sessions across four modules. These sessions typically take the full school year (September-May) to implement.</description>
