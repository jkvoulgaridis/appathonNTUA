  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      10% of patients with hypertension potentially have the treatable condition - primary
      aldosteronism. Primary aldosteronism (PA) is caused by either bilateral adrenal disease
      (~40%), managed with lifelong medications; or unilateral disease (~60%), cured with
      laparoscopic surgery (adrenalectomy). Unfortunately, many patients with curable hypertension
      remain undiagnosed and consequently develop cardiac disease and strokes. The difficulty with
      identifying curable unilateral disease is due to adrenal vein sampling (AVS): an invasive,
      and technically-difficult procedure, with inconclusive results in 50% of patients. An
      alternative novel imaging, 11C-metomidate Positron emission tomography-computed tomography
      (PET-CT), can detect adrenal tumors, and concurrently confirm their over-activity. It is
      non-invasive, non-operator-dependent, and can identify more patients with curable
      hypertension.

      Investigators hypothesize that 11C-metomidate PET-CT can accurately identify patients with
      surgically-curable unilateral adrenal disease among hypertensive Asians with primary
      aldosteronism.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      25 patients with confirmed PA who are keen for a surgical cure if unilateral PA is confirmed,
      will undergo conventional tests, CT, AVS, as well as 11C-metomidate PET/CT.

      Results will be reviewed and discussed at a multidisciplinary meeting, and patients with
      unilateral PA will be offered surgery. Patients will be reviewed 6 months post surgery to
      assess for cure of PA.

    <intervention_model_description>11C-metomidate will be manufactured in Clinical Imaging Research Centre in compliance with good manufacturing practice using a General Electric Medical Systems PET trace 860 cyclotron. Non-contrast CT images will be acquired over the adrenal. After an intravenous injection of 11C-metomidate, PET images will be acquired within the first 45 min. Attenuation and decay-corrected images will be converted to standardized uptake value (SUV) maps through division by (injected activity per patient weight). The maximum SUV values over regions of interest will be determined for 10-min static images starting 35 min after the injection.</intervention_model_description>
