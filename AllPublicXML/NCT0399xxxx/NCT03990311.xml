  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized clinical trial in which maintenance hemodialysis patients will be
      provided with salt restricted 'dialysis friendly' meals and compared to a control arm
      receiving usual care.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients randomized to the intervention arm will receive 2 months of meals plus dietary
      counseling. Counseling will continue for an additional 3 months while the control arm will
      have 5 months of usual care followed by 2 months of meal provision. Effects on interdialytic
      weight gain, achievement of target dry weight, intradialytic hypotension episodes, blood
      pressure, and a volume assessment using lung U/S to assess lung water will be measured. Salt
      sensitivity will be tested throughout the study. Self reported questionnaires about the
      burden of adhering to the low salt diet and the level of adherence with it will be completed
      at baseline and throughout the study. The investigator hypothesizes that the prepared meals
      with prime patients behavior and may alter salt taste perception and that these effects will
      be sustained after the prepared meals have stopped.
