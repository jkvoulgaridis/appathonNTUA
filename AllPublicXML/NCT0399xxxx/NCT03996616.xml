  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elevation of the head and thorax, also known as Head-up cardiopulmonary resuscitation (HUP
      CPR), has been studied extensively in pigs in ventricular fibrillation (VF). HUP combined
      with active compression decompression and impedance threshold device (ACD+ITD) CPR improves
      vital organ perfusion and results in a doubling of cerebral perfusion when compared with the
      same method of CPR in the flat or horizontal plane. HUP CPR enhances the drainage of venous
      blood from the brain, lowers central venous pressures, reduces intracranial pressures during
      the decompression phase of CPR, redistributes blood flow through the lungs during CPR, and
      may reduce brain edema. These mechanisms collectively contribute to improved blood flow and
      less injury to the brain during CPR. These benefits are due in large part to the effects of
      gravity on the physiology of HUP CPR. Importantly, HUP CPR is dependent upon a means of
      generating enough forward flow to adequately pump blood &quot;uphill&quot; to the brain.

      In this proposed pilot study, CPR will be performed manually before the patient is placed on
      a controlled mechanical elevation device (Elegard, Minnesota Resuscitation Solutions LLC,
      USA). An ITD-16 (ResQPOD-16, Zoll, USA) will be placed on the patient's airway before the
      head is elevated. Automated CPR will be initiated as soon as feasible using a new automated
      CPR mechanical compression device that provides full active compression-decompression CPR
      (LUCAS-AD, Stryker, USA).

      The proposed feasibility clinical study will be the first ever to test the fully integrated
      system of ACD+ITD HUP CPR.

      Elevation of the head and thorax, also known as Head-up cardiopulmonary resuscitation (HUP
      CPR), has been studied extensively in pigs in ventricular fibrillation (VF). HUP combined
      with active compression decompression and impedance threshold device (ACD+ITD) CPR improves
      vital organ perfusion and results in a doubling of cerebral perfusion when compared with the
      same method of CPR in the flat or horizontal plane. HUP CPR enhances the drainage of venous
      blood from the brain, lowers central venous pressures, reduces intracranial pressures during
      the decompression phase of CPR, redistributes blood flow through the lungs during CPR, and
      may reduce brain edema. These mechanisms collectively contribute to improved blood flow and
      less injury to the brain during CPR. These benefits are due in large part to the effects of
      gravity on the physiology of HUP CPR. Importantly, HUP CPR is dependent upon a means of
      generating enough forward flow to adequately pump blood &quot;uphill&quot; to the brain.

      Animal studies have shown that HUP CPR must be performed in a specific manner to be
      effective. For example, conventional standard CPR is insufficient, by itself, for effective
      HUP CPR. Additional means to enhance circulation are needed, such as concurrent use of the
      ITD and ACD CPR devices. ACD+ITD CPR alone has been shown to improve hemodynamics and
      survival with favorable neurologic outcome in several human randomized control trials. Animal
      studies have shown that HUP CPR is best with the combination of ACD+ITD CPR. Studies have
      shown that CPR must be initiated before elevating the head. Studies have also shown that HUP
      CPR is dependent upon the time it takes to elevate the head to the HUP. Elevation of the head
      and thorax should optimally take place over a 2-minute period of time from a flat position to
      the maximum head up elevation level in order to optimize cerebral perfusion pressures. Too
      rapid an elevation of the head and thorax can result in a reduction in cerebral arterial
      pressure when compared with flat CPR.

      In this proposed pilot study, CPR will be performed manually before the patient is placed on
      a controlled mechanical elevation device (Elegard, Minnesota Resuscitation Solutions LLC,
      USA). An ITD-16 (ResQPOD-16, Zoll, USA) will be placed on the patient's airway before the
      head is elevated. Automated CPR will be initiated as soon as feasible using a new automated
      CPR mechanical compression device that provides full active compression-decompression CPR
      (LUCAS-AD, Stryker, USA).

      The proposed feasibility clinical study will be the first ever to test the fully integrated
      system of ACD+ITD HUP CPR.

    <description>The maximum value of ETCO2 during CPR before ROSC measured after a washout period of 4 positive pressure ventilations (~30 seconds with 30:2 compression: ventilation ratio) will be recorded.

    <description>During the pre-intervention period, patients will receive standard CPR in the two study groups. Standard CPR will be performed according to the current guidelines.
The only changes in current practice for the control will be the monitoring of EtCO2 and cerebral oxymetry as early as possible for the firefighter. ETCO2 will be recorded using a small portable ETCO2 monitor (EMMA, Masimo, USA). EMS first responders will receive a specific training in both group to use, recording, and reporting of ETCO2 value during CPR. This device has CE mark (see related CE mark and user manual). Cerebral oximetry will be recorded using a new small portable device (HR500, Nonin, USA). This device allows using an easy to use adhesive sensor with remote Bluetooth connection to a smartphone sized monitor.</description>

    <description>Patients will be treated with manual standard CPR ASAP upon arrival of EMS first responders, transferred to Elegard device as soon as possible, and then treated with HUP and ACD+ITD CPR using the LUCAS AD and ResQPOD-16.
Rescuers will perform CPR as continuously as possible during the placement of the Elegard, with a &lt;10 second pause in chest compressions during the placement of this device. This is similar to the manner in which the LUCAS compressor and back plate are placed at the present time. After performing LUCAS AD + ITD CPR for 2 minutes with the head in the 'flat' position, the Elegard device will be turned on and the head will begin to rise as long as the patient is being treated with the ResQPOD-16 and the LUCAS AD. The head will be elevated to approximately 22 cm from the ground to the back of the occiput.</description>
