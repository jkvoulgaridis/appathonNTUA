      metastatic breast cancer with a BRCA 1 or BRCA 2 mutation.

      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a
      specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.

      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved talazoparib for the
      participants' specific disease but it has been approved for metastatic breast cancer with a
      germline (inherited) BRCA mutation.

      Talazoparib is a study drug that inhibits (stops) the normal activity of certain proteins
      called &quot;poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases&quot; also called &quot;PARPs&quot;. PARPs are proteins (made from
      genes which are part of your DNA) that are found in all normal and cancer cells that are
      involved in the repair of DNA. PARPs are needed to repair mistakes that can happen in DNA
      when cells divide. If the mistakes are not repaired, the defective cell will usually die and
      be replaced. Cells with mistakes in their DNA that do not die can become cancer cells. Cancer
      cells may be killed by a study drug, like talazoparib, that stops the normal activity of
      PARPs. In clinical trials, the use of talazoparib and other PARP inhibitors have shown that
      these drugs can reduce tumor size and slow tumor growth in some cancer patients with BRCA1 or
      BRCA2 mutations.

      In this research study, the investigators are examining how effective talazoparib is in
      patients with metastatic breast cancer with a BRCA mutation in their tumor.

    <description>Progression-Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the time from the first dose of study treatment to the date of disease progression as assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Disease progression is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression).</description>

    <description>The number of participants that achieve either a complete (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST 1.1.
CR: Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm.
PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.</description>
