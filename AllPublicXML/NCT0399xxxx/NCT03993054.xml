  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a one year study to develop and test a culturally-tailored, web-based cognitive
      behavioral stress management (CBSM) intervention for Latino sexual minority men living with
      both HIV and cancer. Sexual minority Latino men living with HIV and cancer experience a
      variety of health disparities related to their diagnoses, including higher distress. The
      project will be a pilot randomized trial, comparing culturally-tailored CBSM to standard CBSM
      for dually-diagnosed participants. The project will use a community-based participatory
      research approach, and the investigators have included (and will continue to include)
      LGBT-serving community partners in all phases of the research from study design to
      implementation and dissemination of findings. The proposed study will aid in attenuating
      health disparities among Latino sexual minority men living with HIV and cancer.

    <description>The SmartManage CBSM intervention includes content that is of clinical relevance to sexual minority men dually diagnosed with HIV and cancer. Intervention content includes: co-management of HIV and cancer, strategies for self-advocacy, partnering with the health system and health providers, intimacy and disclosure concerns regarding both conditions, and contextual stressors (e.g., racial/ethnic minority status), stigmatization, assertiveness and communication skills, and self-efficacy in care coordination. Participants receive weekly 1.5 hour interactive group sessions online that focus on stress and self-management skill-building, and also receive access to didactic information regarding intervention content via the intervention website. Intervention length is 4 weeks.</description>
