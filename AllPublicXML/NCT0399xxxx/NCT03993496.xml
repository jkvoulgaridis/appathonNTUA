    <textblock>
      Endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) aims to reduce the risk of aneurysm
      (AAA) rupture by reducing the blood pressure transmitted to the wall of the aneurysm.
      Aneurysms that remain pressurized despite EVAR may continue to grow, therefore requiring
      additional surgical interventions. The purpose of this study is to infer the reduction of
      pressure transmitted to the aneurysm wall by using intraoperative ultrasound ('M-Mode') to
      assess the pulsatility of the aneurysm wall. The hypothesis is that intraoperative reduction
      in aneurysm wall pulsatility after EVAR will correlate with improved aneurysm sac size
      reduction.

      Endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) aims to reduce the risk of aneurysm
      (AAA) rupture by reducing the blood pressure transmitted to the wall of the aneurysm.
      Unfortunately, this procedure is not always successful, and patients need to return to the
      operating room for further procedures because the aneurysm wall remains pressurized and the
      aneurysm continues to grow. Currently, there is no standard non-invasive way of measuring
      aneurysm pressure. The purpose of this study is to infer the reduction of pressure
      transmitted to the aneurysm wall by using intraoperative ultrasound ('M-Mode') to assess the
      pulsatility of the aneurysm wall. The hypothesis is that intraoperative reduction in aneurysm
      wall pulsatility after EVAR will correlate with improved aneurysm sac size reduction. This is
      clinically relevant because physiologic intraoperative feedback of aneurysm pressure may
      potentially influence surgical decision making in the future, reducing unnecessary
      re-interventions. This will also improve our understanding of the intraoperative physiologic
      response to EVAR.

      Our primary research question is in patients receiving elective endovascular repair of
      abdominal aortic aneurysms (EVAR), does the change in intraoperative ultrasound estimated
      aneurysm wall pressure during EVAR correlate with aneurysm sac size reduction 1 year after
      surgery? Secondary objectives are to assess correlation between intraoperative ultrasound
      estimated aneurysm wall pressure and endovascular leaks and aneurysm-related
      re-interventions.

      A prospective, observational, assessor-blinded and surgeon-blinded study will be conducted at
      the TOH Civic Campus in Ottawa, ON in order to satisfy the objectives of the study.

    <description>Measurements of aortic wall pulsatility will be performed using trans-abdominal ultrasound through the non-sterile field of the upper abdomen, while the surgeons operate through the groins. The pulsatilty of the aneurysm will then be measured using transverse views in 'M-Mode' of the ultrasound, and measures the aneurysm wall displacement during a cardiac cycle; the minimum diameter (diastole) and maximum diameter (systole) will be measured. These measurements will occur during surgery:
Prior to EVAR deployment
After EVAR deployment, but before balloon affixation to the aortic wall
After EVAR deployment and after affixation</description>
