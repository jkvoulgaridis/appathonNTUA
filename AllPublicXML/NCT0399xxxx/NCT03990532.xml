  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Esophageal cancer (EC) ranks the seventh most diagnosed malignant tumor (572,000 new cases)
      and the sixth cancer-related mortality (509,000 deaths) worldwide in 2018. The incidence of
      EC is strikingly varying among the regions and sexes. Approximately 70% of EC cases occur in
      men, and there is a 2-fold to 3-fold difference in incidence and mortality rates between
      regions worldwide. According to the latest reported in 2017, esophageal cancer ranks the
      sixth most common cancer and the fourth leading cause of cancer-mortality in China.
      Currently, esophagectomy is considered as the standard treatment for resectable EC patients.
      However, the prognosis of stage IIA-III esophageal cancer after esophagectomy remains poor,
      and local regional lymph node recurrence is the major patterns of recurrence, and mediastinal
      lymph node recurrence is one of the most common sites. Previous retrospective study has found
      that salvage chemoradiotherapy is a effective treatment option for these patients. However,
      the optimal dose remains unknown. In addition, no prospective trials have been conducted to
      investigate the efficacy and toxicities of salvage chemo-radiotherapy by using simultaneous
      integrated boost for the treatment of mediastinal lymph node recurrence after radical surgery
      of esophageal Cancer
