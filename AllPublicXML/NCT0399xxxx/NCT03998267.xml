  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes mobile technology is an emerging and rapidly expanding field that seeks to combine
      cutting edge behavioral insights with best practice in diabetes self management education to
      improve patient empowerment and deliver better patient outcomes.The question that arises is
      whether or not, diabetes mobile applications are effective in improving glycemic control,
      clinical outcomes, quality of life and overall patient satisfaction, in diabetic patients in
      Qatar. To answer this, we plan to enroll 90 diabetic patients into a custom-made diabetes app
      for Qatar (Droobi) (as intervention group) in comparison with 90 diabetic patients followed
      in the current standard care, matched in characteristics (as control group). We have the
      hypothesis that with utilization of the mobile application, patients will have improved
      glycemic control, improved self management and patient empowerment; together with improved
      patient-educator/doctor interaction.

    <description>Within subject changes in perceptions of diabetes self-management as assessed by diabetes self-management questionnaire (DSMQ) scores subsection glucose management and overall rating. DSM-Q is a 16 item questionnaire to assess self-care activities associated with glycemic control. Four subscales, 'Glucose Management' (GM), 'Dietary Control' (DC), 'Physical Activity' (PA), and 'Health-Care Use' (HU), as well as a 'Sum Scale' (SS) as a global measure of self-care. Scale scores are calculated as sums of item scores and then transformed to a scale ranging from 0 to 10 (raw score / theoretical maximum score * 10. A transformed score of ten thus represents the highest self-rating of the assessed behavior</description>

A mean item score 2.0-2.9 is considered moderate distress and a mean score of more than or equal to 3 is considered high stress.</description>

    <description>Increased mobile application usability by the system usability scale (SUS) at 6 months. It consists of a 10 item questionnaire with five response options for respondents; from Strongly agree to Strongly disagree. The participant's scores for each question are converted to a new number, added together and then multiplied by 2.5 to convert the original scores of 0-40 to 0-100. An SUS score above a 68 would be considered above average and anything below 68 is below average, however the best way to interpret the results involves &quot;normalizing&quot; the scores to produce a percentile ranking</description>

Educate/train patients on app usage
Patients will be subscribed to the app and their profile on the app will be created
Subjects will log in their blood sugar readings and communicate with the mobile app team (educators and physician) via the app
Additionally patients will be placed on a diet and lifestyle plan as agreed upon by the patient and health care provider team, best suited towards the patient's needs
Throughout the study, patient will receive notifications and advice on how to follow diet and lifestyle changes
Throughout the study; patient interaction and app usage will be tracked
Patients will additionally be interviewed by the research team together with Droobi to capture app experience at 3 months and 6 months</description>
