      This research seeks to develop an internet-based programme to help teenagers manage pain at
      home using a variety of techniques that mirror clinical practice. This includes content from
      medicine, physiotherapy, nursing and psychological techniques, such as relaxation.

      The study will use interviews (one semi-structured interview and one 'think-aloud' interview
      per participant) to explore the question: What content and features do young people with
      chronic pain, and their parents want to see in an online pain management intervention?

      The study seeks to recruit a group of teenagers from Great Ormond Street Hospital, as well as
      a group of parents. After the first round of interviews, participants have the option to be
      contacted about the second round.

      Recruitment for the first round of interviews will continue up until the point where no
      additional insights are found by adding new data to the analysis ('point of saturation'). We
      anticipate 30 teenagers and 30 parents will be sufficient. We hope to recruit young people
      with a mixture of ages and sexes, as well as a mixture of different pain diagnoses, and
      parents with varying backgrounds and sexes where possible.

      The insights gathered from this study will help develop a new program for managing chronic
      pain in teenagers, which we aim to make available through the NHS. The internet-based
      intervention hopes to contribute to successful chronic pain management at home, and may be
      used as an adjunct to clinical services, such as the Pain Control Service at Great Ormond
      Street Hospital.

    <description>Patient-reported outcome collected from semi-structured interviews (dynamic measure). A pre-piloted interview schedule was developed for this specific study. The schedule contains questions about online pain management interventions for adolescents. There are 8 core questions, as well as a warm-up at the start and a debrief at the end.</description>

    <description>Semi-structured interviews followed by 'think-aloud' procedure in part two. Semi-structured interviews may last up to 1 hour and are audio-recorded. A pre-piloted interview schedule has been developed and will guide the conversation. 'Think-aloud' procedure involves showing participants some of the online content that has been developed on a computer screen, and asking them to say aloud their commentary on any aspects. Participants will be audio-recorded during the task, and it is not anticipated the task will take longer than 1 hour to complete. Each participant may only take part in one interview and one think-aloud procedure.</description>

    <intervention_name>Online Chronic Pain Management Intervention for Teenagers</intervention_name>
    <description>The intervention itself is currently under development. This development study is used to gather patient (teenager) insights, as well as insights from parents of these patients, which will inform the content and structure of the proposed intervention. This is done using qualitative-only techniques. Initial ideas for the intervention design mirror current clinical practices in paediatric chronic pain management. There are likely to be several different online modules, which include psychological techniques, medicine (advice), nursing (advice and guidance on non-pharmacological physical pain management), and physiotherapy (guidance for pacing and physiotherapy exercises). The intervention is intended to help teenagers employ a vast range of self-management techniques from these disciplines. Exact content is not yet refined as this is a development study.</description>
