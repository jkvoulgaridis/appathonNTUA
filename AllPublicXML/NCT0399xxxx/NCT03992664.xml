  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main adverse reaction of EGFR seen in patients is rash. EGFR treated patients have a
      24-95% incidence of rash depending on the type of treatment they receive. Skin toxicity may
      occur in more than 80% of patients treated with cetuximab.

      If a severe rash (Grade 3 or 4) occurs, a dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment may
      be required. Also, infections are the main secondary side effect caused by the rash.

      The aim of the study is through a randomized clinical trial feasibility study to investigate
      the effectiveness of an educational intervention in patients receiving EGFRI therapy.

      It will be randomly selected which patients will belong to the intervention group and who in
      the control group. The type of program involves educational intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, EGFRI (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Inhibitor) have evolved as effective
      anti-cancer drugs. They are distinguished in monoclonal antibodies (cetuximab and
      panitumumab) and EGFR (TKIs) kinase inhibitors gefitinib, erlotinib and lapatinib, where they
      are used in the treatment of colon, rectal, head and neck, lung, pancreas and of breast.

      According to studies, the usual treatment for the prevention and treatment of skin rash
      refers to the use of antibiotics such as doxycycline, tetracycline and cortisone products
      such as hydrocortisone. It is also recommended to use moisturizing cream.

      The study of Carmine P. et al., 2011 mentions the need to investigate educational measures
      for the rash due to EGFR treatment.
