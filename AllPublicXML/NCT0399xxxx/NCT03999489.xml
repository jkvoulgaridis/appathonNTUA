    <textblock>
      The general main objective of our study is to investigate the psychometric properties, the
      levels and determinants of the extent of SF- 6D utility in patients followed for recent back
      pain inflammatory disease.

      The specific objectives are :

        -  Study the feasibility of the tool considering missing data, distribution, construct
           validity, reproducibility, sensitivity to change or clinically different groups
           (discriminative ability) the extent of SF -6D utility .

        -  Study the impact of socio-demographic characteristics, disease characteristics and
           quality of life, comorbidities at baseline on the measurement of utility and sensitivity
           to change.

    <measure>Level of utility measured by the SF-6D</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline (0 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-6D derives from 11 questions of the SF36 using the algorithm of Brazier et al which then provides a unique score. It has 6 dimensions: Physical Function, Role Limitation, Social Function, Pain, Mental Health and Vitality with 4 to 6 levels of responses depending on the dimension. SF-6D thus makes it possible to describe 18,000 health conditions. The utility score obtained with SF-6D varies between 0.29 and 1.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient should be given free and informed consent and signed the consent

               -  The patient must be affiliated or beneficiary of a health insurance plan

               -  patients aged 18 years and under 50

               -  inflammatory back pain (buttocks , lumbar or thoracic spine )

               -  fulfilling the criteria of Calin or Berlin (30,31)

               -  duration of symptoms than three months and less than three years

               -  symptoms suggestive of spondyloarthritis as assessed by the local investigator (
                  score≥5 on a numerical scale from 0 to 10 where 0 = no evocative and 10 = very
                  suggestive of spondyloarthritis ) .

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Another clearly defined spinal disease (eg discarthrose )

               -  history of treatment with biotherapy

               -  taking glucocorticoids allowed only in low dose of less than 10mg of prednisone
                  daily and stable for at least four weeks before inclusion

               -  Current or history anomalies that could interfere with the validity of informed
                  consent and / or prevent a patient's optimal adhesion to the cohort (eg ,
                  alcoholism , mental illness) .
