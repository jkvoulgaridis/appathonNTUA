  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) are the most common complication following
      thoracic surgery. PPCs are associated with prolonged hospital stay, increased morbidity,
      mortality, ICU admission, and healthcare costs (Azhar, 2015). Current preoperative
      optimization in this patient group includes smoking cessation and management of Chronic
      Obstructive Pulmonary Disease with inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled steroids as indicated.
      There have been studies using preoperative incentive spirometry in patients undergoing
      laparotomy with conflicting results, but scant data on its use in patients undergoing
      one-lung ventilation (Tyson, et al., 2015; Cattano, et al., 2010). A study from 2013
      investigated the effectiveness of incentive spirometry in patients following thoracotomy and
      found conflicting results, without significant improvement in lung function or reduction in
      PPCs, but a larger difference in frequency of PPC was noted, indicating possible benefit to
      intervention and a need for further study (Agostini, et al., 2013). Volume-based incentive
      spirometry pre- and postoperatively has also been found to improve pulmonary function and
      diaphragm excursion in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery (Alaparthi, et al., 2016).

      Patients customarily receive an incentive spirometer for use postoperatively in the PACU.
      There is scant data in the thoracic surgery population concerning prehabilitation by
      dispensing the incentive spirometer at the PACT evaluation.
