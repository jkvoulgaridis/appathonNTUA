  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective study will compare incidence rates of complete hard-to-heal diabetic foot
      ulcer healing in Medicare beneficiaries following application of the 3C Patch® plus usual
      care, tested against a historical control group of similar patients that received usual care
      during a randomized controlled trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, observational, longitudinal, claims-based study with a historical
      control group. Data will be collected via claim forms and will be extracted directly from the
      Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) Medicare Research Identifiable Files (RIFs),
      which contain all medical claims for 100% of Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in the Medicare
      fee-for-service program. The study will be conducted in accordance with relevant guidelines
      of a central institutional review board (IRB), relevant informed consent regulations, and all
      other applicable regulatory requirements.

    <description>Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes and hard-to-heal non-healing ulcers of the foot will receive usual care (i.e., care consistent with the IWGDF guidance on use of interventions to enhance the healing of chronic ulcers of the foot in diabetes) supplemented by the application of the 3C Patch (A platelet-rich plasma gel patch comprised of distinct fibrin, platelet, and leukocyte substantially parallel layers, prepared without the use of any added reagents through a two-step centrifugation process)</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Medicare beneficiaries diagnosed with diabetic foot ulcer and receiving at least one
             treatment with the 3C Patch® System.

          -  Eligible ulcers will be hard-to-heal, meaning that the cross-sectional area will
             decrease by less than 50% during a four week period prior to the first application of
             the 3C Patch® (percentage change in cross-sectional area determined clinically by the
             treating physician by estimation at examination).

          -  Eligible ulcer's cross-sectional area will increase by less than 25% during a 4-week
             period prior to the first application of the 3C Patch® (percentage change determined
             clinically by treating physician by estimation at examination)

          -  The cross-sectional area of the index ulcer will be ≥50 and ≤1000 mm2 at the end of
             the 4 week period prior to the first application of the 3C Patch® (size determined
             clinically by the treating physician by estimation at examination).

          -  Participants will have the capacity to understand study procedures, and will be able
             to provide written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of sickle-cell anemia, hemophilia, thrombocytopenia (&lt;100x109/L) or other
             clinically significant blood dyscrasia

          -  Known potential infectivity of blood products, including known HIV and hepatitis

          -  Patient in dialysis

          -  Clinical signs of infection of the index ulcer or reason to suspect that infection is
             present

          -  Revascularization procedure in the affected limb planned, or undertaken within the 4
             weeks prior to the first application of the 3C Patch®

          -  Current treatment with cytotoxic drugs or with systemically administered
             glucocorticoids or other immunosuppressants

          -  Treatment of foot ulcers with growth factors, stem cells or equivalent preparation
             within the 8 weeks prior to the first application of the 3C Patch®

          -  The need for continued use of negative pressure wound therapy

          -  Likely inability to comply with the need for follow up visits because of planned
             activity

          -  Participation in another interventional clinical foot ulcer-healing trial within the 4
             weeks prior to the first application of the 3C Patch®

          -  Prior enrollment in this study

          -  Judgement by the investigator that the patient does not have the capacity to
             understand the study procedures or provide written informed consent
