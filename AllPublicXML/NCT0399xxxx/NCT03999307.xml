  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long time needed for orthodontic treatment is considered one of the biggest obstacles
      that make patients refuse to undergo orthodontic treatment. It also has many disadvantages
      including higher caries rates, gingivitis, and root resorption. Therefore, the purpose of
      this study is to evaluate the efficiency of two new noninvasive methods (Low-Level Laser
      Therapy and Corticopuncture) in accelerating orthodontic tooth movement for the implant
      supported En-Masse retraction of the six maxillary anterior teeth.

      This study will be a randomized controlled trial with a 1:1:1 allocation ratio. Sample size
      was calculated using Minitab version 15. 36 Participants recruited from patients attending
      the Department of Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics at Damascus University with class
      II division 1 malocclusion that indicates the extraction of first maxillary premolars will be
      randomly assigned into one of three groups: Low-Level Laser Therapy (LLLT) group, flapless
      corticopuncture group, or control group. Titanium mini-implants (1.6 mm diameter and 7 mm
      length) will be inserted between the maxillary second premolar and first molar at
      approximately 8-10 mm height above the archwires below the mucogingival junction. After
      complete leveling and alignment of the maxillary dental arch, which will be defined by
      passive insertion of 19*25 inch S.S. archwire, the retraction stage of the six maxillary
      anterior teeth will begin.
