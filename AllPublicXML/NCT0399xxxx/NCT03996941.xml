  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) is a biomedical strategy consisting of the use of
      antiretroviral therapy by HIV-seronegative people at high risk of acquiring HIV, to prevent
      the infection. Many controlled and randomized clinical trials, as well as implementation
      projects have shown that the use of tenofovir disoproxil (TDF) and emtricitabine (FTC) is
      both safe and effective in the prevention of HIV infection.

      However, the administrative situation of PrEP in Spain is anomalous. Unlike in some European
      countries, PrEP is not available within the National Health System (SNS), although being
      available for the treatment of HIV infection. In Spain the fixed-dose combination of FTC /
      TDF is for hospital use only, which requires prescription by HIV specialists exclusively and
      restricts its dispensation to pharmacy services within the hospital.

      This limitation in access and the knowledge of its prevention capacity of PrEP by vulnerable
      population has led them to obtain &quot;generic FTC / TDF&quot; outside the standardized health care
      system. According to a survey conducted in Europe to characterize MSM users of PrEP carried
      out in 2016, 5% of PrEP users had acquired it on their own. Of these 70% stated they were not
      included in any regular follow-up program while using the medication. Despite the growing
      demand, there are no health programs (including information, counseling, systematic screening
      for sexually transmissible infection (STI), etc.) aimed at meeting the health care needs of
      those who already use or wish to use PrEP, neither by public nor private healthcare
      providers. This type of service is especially necessary when considering that, among PrEP
      users, one may have already an established HIV infection, theoretical increase of other STI
      and a lack of monitoring kidney functions..

      BCN Checkpoint is a community center since 2006 for the detection of HIV and other STI aimed
      at gay men, other men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women (TGW), which has
      shown high efficiency in HIV screening and fast referral to standard HIV care and treatment..
      In 2017 the organization opened BCN PrEP·Point, a community centre with the goal to provide
      information, to conduct clinical trials and clinical monitoring of informal PrEP use.

      For this reason, it is presented here the protocol of the SeguiPrEP study, prospective,
      longitudinal study of health care in the community environment, to MSM and TGW, users of
      informal PrEP, based on point-of-care testing technology.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Catalonia 62% of new HIV diagnoses were reported in MSM in 2017. In the decade 2007-2016
      in this population group an increase in the number of HIV cases of approximately 44%. The
      knowledge, interest and willingness to use PrEP is high among MSM at higher risk of HIV
      acquisition. BCN Checkpoint was accountable for the detection of one third of all new HIV
      cases in MSM and TGW in Catalonia.

      Research hypothesis is that offering a risk reduction program, including the provision of
      health monitoring, in a community setting for informal PrEP users is justified and feasible,
      and will afford these users the possibility of using it safely. It is expected that the use
      of informal PrEP, along with HIV and other STIs screening, STI treatment, and immediate HIV
      referral to care and treatment will contribute significantly to a reduction of HIV incidence.

      This study aims to contribute to increase the body of evidence on the incidence and of
      context specific HIV management and inform policy makers on potential preventive strategies
      against the epidemic.

      AIMS

      The primary aim of the study is:

      To describe the incidence of HIV and other STIs during the study period.

      The specific aims of the study are:

      To provide harm reduction through clinical follow-up for informal PrEP users. To describe the
      conditions of informal use and acquisition of PrEP. To evaluate the effectiveness and safety
      of informal PrEP. To describe the demographic, clinical, risk factors for HIV and other STIs
      of informal PrEP users.
