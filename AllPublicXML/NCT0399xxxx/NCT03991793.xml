      Background: Survival in Granzyme A gene (gzmA) knocked-out mice was significantly longer than
      in wild-type mice in a murine peritonitis model (cecal ligation puncture).

      Hypothesis: GZM A has a pathogenic role in sepsis in humans and gzmA polymorphisms can help
      to predict the risk of sepsis among patients with systemic infections (E. coli bacteremic
      urinary tract infections).

      Objectives:

        1. To assess the correlation between GZM A serum levels and systemic inflammatory response
           in a human model of infection/sepsis (E. coli bacteremic UTI)

        2. To characterize gzmA polymorphisms among patients with E. coli bacteremic UTI

        3. To determine GZM A serum kinetics among patients with E. coli bacteremic UTI

        4. To characterize E. coli strains causing bacteremic UTI: antimicrobial phenotype and
           virulence factors (&quot;virulome&quot;).

      Methods:

        -  Design and setting: Prospective nested case-control study

        -  Study population: consecutive adult patients with bacteremic urinary tract infections
           (UTIs) caused by E. coli

        -  Exclusion criteria: Patients with conditions that significantly compromise immune status
           or patients exposed to urologic procedures

        -  Estimated sample size: 50 patients with a sepsis/ non sepsis 1:1 ratio. Septic and non
           septic patients will be matched on gender, age (+/- 10 years), comorbidity (Charlson
           score +/-1), time symptom onset to blood culture (+/- 24h)

        -  Measurements: GZM A serum levels will be determined on day 0, day 2-3, day 30. GZM A
           kinetics, gzmA polymorphisms (whole exome sequencing).Whole genome sequencing of E. coli
           isolates retrieved from blood cultures will be performed.

        -  Analysis: Association between GZM A levels and gzmA polymorphisms and sepsis will be
           analyzed adjusting for patient, infection and microorganism-related factors
           (multivariate analysis).

      1. Research hypothesis

      The research team has explored the role of GZM A

        1. Conceptual hypothesis:

             -  Granzyme A is a pathogenic sepsis mediator.

             -  Granzyme A gene polymorphisms determine the serum concentration of GZM A in
                patients with systemic infections.

             -  Granzyme A gene polymorphisms determine the risk of sepsis among patients with
                systemic infections.

        2. Operational hypothesis:

             -  Among patients with bacteremic (E. coli) urinary tract infections (UTIs), GZM A
                levels are significantly higher in those patients who develop sepsis as compared
                with those who do not develop sepsis.

             -  There are significant differences in the GZM A gene polymorphism profile of
                patients with bacteremic (E. coli) UTIs who develop sepsis as compared with those
                who do not develop sepsis.

                2. Aims and objectives

             -  Aims

                  1. To assess the pathogenic role of GZM A in sepsis in patients with bacteremic
                     (E. coli) UTIs.

                  2. To explore the capability of GZM A polymorphisms to anticipate the risk of
                     developing sepsis in patients with bacteremic (E. coli) UTIs.

                  3. To evaluate the potential usefulness of GZM A as a diagnostic biomarker of
                     sepsis in patients with bacteremic (E. coli) UTIs.

                  4. To characterize E. coli &quot;virulome&quot; among circulating uropathogenic strains.

             -  Objectives

                  1. To evaluate the correlation between serum levels of GZM A and systemic
                     inflammatory response in patients with bacteremic (E. coli) UTIs.

                  2. To characterize GZM A gene polymorphisms among patients with bacteremic (E.
                     coli) UTIs

                  3. To assess GZM A serum kinetics among patients with bacteremic (E. coli) UTIs

                  4. To phenotypically and molecularly characterize E. coli strains causing
                     bacteremic UTIs, including their virulence factors (&quot;virulome&quot;).

                3. Expected outcomes.

                systemic infections

                Cases (sepsis / septic shock):

                - Sepsis or shock septic are defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused
                by a dysregulated host response to infection according to the 2001
                SCCM/ESICM/ACCP/ATS/SIS International Sepsis Definition Conference.

                Controls:

                - Absence of sepsis or septic shock according to the 2001 SCCM/ESICM/ACCP/ATS/SIS
                International Sepsis Definition Conference.

                4.5. Variables

                4.5.1. Patient-related variables:

                  -  Demographical: gender, age.

                  -  Comorbidity: Modified Charlson Index

                  -  Baseline serum creatinine.

                4.5.2. Infection-related variables. - Time from the onset of symptoms to the start
                of antimicrobial treatment.

                - Time from the onset of symptoms to the start of appropriate antimicrobial
                treatment.

                  -  Time form the onset of symptoms to the surgical therapy (if needed).

                  -  Clinical severity at time 0 (blood culture), and day 2- 3 and day 30: sepsis
                     score.

                4.5.3. Inflammation, sepsis mediators and biomarkers. - The following biomarkers
                will be determined during patient enrollment:

                - White blood cell count and differential.

                - Platelet count.

                - Fibrinogen.

                - Prothrombin activity.

                - C reactive protein.

                  -  Procalcitonin.

                  -  GZM A.

                GZM A serum levels will be obtained in all patients during the enrollment visit,
                the 2-3 day and the 30 day visits (GZM A kinetics). GZM A levels will be determined
                by an ELISA commercial assay (Human Granzyme A ELISA development kit{HRP];
                Mabtech).

                GzmA gene polymorphisms, as well as other potentially associated mutations, will be
                screened by Whole Exome Sequencing (WES). To this aim, we will use DNA isolated
                from peripheral blood cells and the AmpliSeq technology kit on the Ion Torrent
                platform following the manufacturer's instructions. This platform is available at
                the Genomics Central Research Unit (CRU) at CIBA from University of Zaragoza/IIS
                Aragon. All kits for isolating and analyzing DNA samples are commercially available
                and optimized by Thermo Scientific. Bioninformatic analysis will be performed by an
                agreement established between Genomics CRU and Micromics SL led by Pedro Gonzalez
                at CRG in Barcelona.

                4.5.4. Microbiological variables

                  -  Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the E. coli isolates retrieved from
                     urine and blood cultures will be determined through automated microdilution
                     panels as routinely performed by the Microbiology Laboratory of participating
                     hospitals.

                  -  Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of the E. coli strains isolated in blood and
                     urine cultures. The presence of E. coli known virulence factors will be
                     analyzed and a virulence score for each strain will be calculated (Mora-Rillo
                     et al., 2015).
