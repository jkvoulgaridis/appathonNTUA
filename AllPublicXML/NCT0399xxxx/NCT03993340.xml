      This study is a prospective, open-label, multi-center, registry study, designed to show that
      rescue stenting is safe and effective for emergency large vessel occlusion (ELVO) patients
      who have mechanical thrombectomy failure. Participants with ELVO will initially underwent
      mechanical thrombectomy usig stent retriever, contact aspiration or both. After failure of
      mechanical thrombectomy, rescue stenting will be performed.

    <description>The subjects will receive endovascular treatment for acute stroke according to standard clinical practice. Specifically, modern endovascular thrombectomy using a stent retriever, contact aspiration thrombectomy, or both are allowed. The number of thrombectomy attempts is at the operator's discretion. After failure of standard thrombectomy procedure, rescue stenting with Solitaire will be done. Additional balloon angioplasty, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor (GPI), or thrombolytic infusions are optional and at the operator's discretion. After successful recanalization with rescue stenting, intravenous maintenance of GPI at least for a 12 hours and then changed to oral antiplatelet are recommended.</description>

          -  8. Failure of mechanical thrombectomy with stent retriever, contact aspiration or both

          -  9. Subjects who received rescue stenting after failure of mechanical thrombectomy

          -  10. Anticipated life expectancy of at least 12 months

          -  11. Signed informed consent for study enrollment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Any contraindication to antiplatelet medication

          -  4. Severe contrast allergy or absolute contraindication to iodinated contrast agent

          -  5. Patient has a severe or fatal combined illness that will prevent improvement of
             follow-up or will render the procedure unlikely to benefit the patient.
