  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The transfer of young people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) to adult care occurs during a
      critical period of life, while many young people with T1D have unsatisfactory glycemic
      control. The preparation to take over responsibility for their health and self-care as well
      as increasing their participation in care are important aspects for strengthening people's
      own ability, an important component of person-centered care. STEPSTONES-DIAB aims to evaluate
      the effectiveness of a person-centred transition program for adolescents with T1D to empower
      them to become active partners in their care. The study is conducted at two hospitals in
      Stockholm, Sweden where 140 patients will be randomized to either a structured,
      person-centered transition program over a 2.5 -year period or to usual care. Outcome measures
      is empowerment, participation and responsibility in care, health status, glycemic control as
      well as the participants' experiences of care during transfer.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is one of the most common chronic diseases in childhood. Each year,
      nearly 86 000 children around the world develop T1D. The annual mean incidence rates varies
      from 0.1-60/100000 with Sweden as one of the &quot;top&quot; incidence countries. Within diabetes care,
      most health care professionals agree that a lack of effective transfer from pediatric to
      adult care may contribute to insufficient continuity of health care and increased risk for
      adverse outcomes in young adults with T1D diabetes. In order to help the adolescent in the
      transitions to adulthood and adult care, transitions programs have been proposed as a complex
      intervention with the objective of maximizing lifelong functioning and potential through
      appropriate healthcare services. Therefore, research on transition and transfer, and on
      interventions that have the potential to improve both these clinical processes, is important.

      Patient empowerment is recognized as an essential element of transition interventions.
      Through the promotion of patient empowerment the adolescents can become active partners in
      their care and have the knowledge and capacity to make decisions that affect their life and
      health status. The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of a transition
      program for adolescents with type 1 diabetes within a randomized controlled trial. During the
      course of the study, participants will be part of a transition program or receive usual care
      before being transferred to adult care. The primary outcome is level of empowerment and
      secondary outcomes include health behavior as well as diabetes specific and transfer specific
      variables.

      The investigators will assess the effectiveness of the transition program by comparing the
      level of empowerment (primary outcome) between the participants who received usual care and
      those who participated in the transition program. A higher level of empowerment from the
      group part of the intervention is expected. The economic evaluation entails an impact budget
      assessment and a cost-effectiveness analysis.

    <description>Gothenburg Young Persons Empowerment Scale (GYPES) will be used to assess the level of empowerment. This scale was developed by the researchers involved in this study and has been tested in a previous cross sectional study in order to determine its psychometric properties in adolescents with congenital heart disease and type 1 diabetes.The five subscales measure: (a) self-perceived level of understanding of their disease (knowledge and understanding); (b) the capacity patients have to handle their disease (personal control); (c) the effect their illness has on their lives and sense of self (identity); (d) the capacity to make decisions along with the healthcare professional (shared decision-making); and (e) the ability to share their experiences and help others who are going through a similar situation (enabling others). The total score ranges from 15 to 75 points, with a higher score reflecting a higher level of empowerment.</description>

    <description>Readiness for transition questionnaire RTQ (adolescent version). These questionnaires examine two aspects. First, the overall transition readiness is assessed, using two items ranging from 1 to 4. The sum of these two items results in a score ranging from 2 to 8. Second, the frequency of adolescent responsibility and parental involvement are reported in 10 different health behaviours, on a ﬁve-point Likert scale. Each variable results in a total score ranging from 10 to 40, and higher scores indicate higher adolescent responsibility or parental involvement, respectively.</description>

    <description>Health Behaviour Scale. Health behaviours are measured with the Health Behavior Scale-CHD. Health behaviours are 'activities a person undertakes to maintain or improve health and prevent diseases'.30 This scale assesses alcohol consumption, tobacco use, dental care and physical activity. The scale has 15 items that help to calculate three summary risk scores: substance use (score 0-100), dental hygiene (score 0-100) and total health risk score (score 0-100). Higher risk scores represent unhealthier behaviours.</description>
