  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Functional recovery after total knee replacement (TKR) is characterized by an incomplete
      muscle strength due to arthrogenic muscle inhibition (AMI) and tendency to estimate the
      functional level. These deficits could be related to alteration of sensory feedback, and
      could influence the ability to modulate patients' motor performance.

      To date, there are not studies investigatin the ability to modulate the motor performance in
      patients with TKR compared to healthy age-matched subjects.

      In this study 20 patients with TKR and 20 healthy will be included . Inclusion criteria are:
      age between 40 and 80 , TKR for primary knee osteoarthritis, knee flexion ≥ 90° and complete
      knee extension, ability to perform a sit to stand on a 46 cm high chair and to walk for at
      least 50 meters without aids. Exclusion criteria: patients undergoing TKR after traumas,
      previous tibial or femoral osteotomy, partial or complete revision surgery. subjects with
      psychiatric and/or cognitive impairments, or with neurological, musculoskeletal or other
      disorders that could influence motor or functional recovery will be also exluded.

      The aim of the study is to investigate the ability in motor performance modulation in
      patients after TKR compared to healthy age-mtched subjects.

      Primary endpoint is to investigate this ability during a leg extension performed in open
      kinetic chain. This ability will be also evaluated during a Sit To Stand and during walking
      (with 10 Meters Walking Test). Secondary endpoint is to investigate pain, rate of perceived
      exertion and perceived load symmetry during the three tests. In both healthy and TKR groups
      these outcomes will be detected two times. In particular, in TKR group, patients will be
      tested the day before surgery and 5 days after surgery.

      This study is aimed at conducting a survey in healthy subjects and in a population of
      subjects undergoing TKR . Participants will undergo an acquisition similar to others already
      described in the literature and without adverse events. Tests will last about 60 minutes and
      during them, will be used the equipment of Motion Analysis Lab of &quot;Humanitas Research
      Hospital&quot;.
