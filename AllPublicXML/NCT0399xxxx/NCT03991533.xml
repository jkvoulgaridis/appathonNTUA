      Background:The locoregional control rates in patients with advanced head and neck cancer
      remain suboptimal. Accurate diagnosis of metastatic cervical lymph nodes remains challenging.
      Technological advances in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) enable to quantify diffusion and
      perfusion of the tumour and its surrounding tissues, which could improve diagnostic
      performance.

      Objectives: The investigators aim to identify specific MRI parameters that could improve
      diagnostic accuracy of metastatic cervical lymph nodes in patients with a squamous cell
      carcinoma in the head and neck region.

      Study design: a retrospective study will be set up to explore the diagnostic performance of
      the selected MRI parameters to differentiate between tumoural and non-tumoural cervical lymph
      nodes in patients with a histologically confirmed head and neck tumour ('affected group') or
      histologically confirmed Whartin tumour or pleomorphic adenoma of the parotid gland, without
      malignant transformation ('control group').

      Patients will be screened for inclusion in the analysis if they had a routine preoperative
      multiparametric MRI, according to a standardised protocol, between the 1st of December 2016
      and the 30th of September 2018. All MR images will be screened by the resident to select
      those patients with one or multiple clearly distinguishable metastatic cervical lymph
      node(s), which can be clearly correlated with the final pathology report. Other strict
      inclusion criteria are described in detail in the protocol.
