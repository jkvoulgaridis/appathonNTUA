  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) is one of the most important treatments for patients with
      end-stage renal failure. Studies have found that insomnia is widespread in MHD patients,
      affecting their quality of life. Auricular acupoint pressing is an effective traditional
      Chinese medicine treatment for insomnia. This study compared the effects of auricular
      acupoint pressing and oral estazolam on insomnia in patients with MHD, and evaluated the
      possibility of auricular acupoint pressing to reduce the incidence of adverse events by
      improving insomnia in patients with MHD, and to explore the insomnia of MHD patients treated
      with TCM characteristics. The role and efficacy provide a basis for the treatment of sleep
      disorders by Chinese medicine.

    <description>Use a hard and smooth pill to adhere to the center of the 0.7×0.7cm tape. Hold the puncture clip on the part of the ear which is selected, and give appropriate pressure (揉) to make the patient have heat, hemp, Swelling and painful feeling; patients with sputum press 3-5 times a day, each time 1-2 minutes per hole, and must be pressed once every 15-30 minutes before going to bed every night. Press the point pressure method (press the ear point with a fingertip and press it loosely, each interval is 0.5 seconds. It is better for the patient to feel the swelling and slightly heavy tingling, and the force should not be too heavy. Generally, each time the hole can be pressed 27 times. Each time one side of the ear is selected, the two ear points are used alternately, staying in the summer for 1-3 days, and staying in the winter for 3-7 days.It is not appropriate to have local inflammation of the auricle, frostbite or surface skin ulceration.</description>

If the patient has drug-induced liver damage and respiratory depression, it is necessary to stop the drug immediately. Hemorrhoids avoid drinking alcohol during medication.</description>
