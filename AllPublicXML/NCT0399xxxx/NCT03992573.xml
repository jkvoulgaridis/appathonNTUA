  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the influence of CGF application into post-operative soft
      tissue and bone defects on post-operative complications and wound healing.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The research was conducted in twenty patients with symmetric single tooth qualified to
      extraction. On one side of dental arch, post-operative region was field with CGF material,
      while on the other side it was left to normal healing. In both cases pain, swelling, alveolar
      osteitis, antibiotics and analgesics intake in post-operative period were evaluated in the
      first, fourth and seventh day after surgery. Wound healing was assessed seven and thirty days
      after extraction.

    <description>In order to evaluate the relationship between intensity of pain after surfery and filling the alveolus with platelet-rich plasma, , NRS (Numeric Rating Scale) pain scale is used.
NRS scale, ranges from 0 to 10; where 0 refers to no pain and 10 refers to most severe pain.</description>
