    <textblock>
      The aim of our study is to investigate the etiological distribution of ILD, epidemiological
      characteristics of ILD cases such as age, gender, geography, smoking, occupation, economic
      status, education, and comorbidities. Another aim is to make the cost calculation from the
      first to the diagnosis in the patients diagnosed. Obtaining the missing data related to the
      ILD of our country is one of our goals.
