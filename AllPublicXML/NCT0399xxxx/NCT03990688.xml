  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AK3280 is being developed to further improve the long-term efficacy and tolerability of
      treatment options for patients with fibrotic disorders.This study will evaluate the effect of
      AK3280 treatment on renal function and safety, and the PK of AK3280 compared with placebo in
      healthy subjects.
