    <textblock>
      The randomized controlled study aims was to investigate the pain control of Battle Field
      Acupuncture as Primary or Adjunctive Treatment in Back Pain (Acute Musculoskeletal pain) in
      the (acute pain setting) Emergency Department vs stand of care pain medications.

  <detailed_description>

      Purpose: To evaluate the effectiveness of Battlefield Acupuncture versus standard care
      (medicinal therapy) in an Emergency Room setting for acute/subacute back pain using the
      Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) to determine changes in pain levels.
      Secondary outcomes will include performance using the back pain functional scale (BPFS),
      satisfaction of treatment, and the need for further pain medication after discharge from the
      emergency department.

      Design and Methods: A prospective, randomized control trial, (un-blinded, non-placebo
      controlled) with convenience sampling based on scheduled clinical shifts in the Emergency
      Department.

      The population consisted of active duty service members and Department of Defense
      beneficiaries (dependents and retirees) at the DoD's sole Level I trauma center, San Antonio
      Military Medical Center Emergency Department with acute/subacute, or acute/subacute on
      chronic back pain as the chief complaint. The participants studied age range was from 18-55
      years old without concern for pathological back pain.

      Subjects were selected based on their chief complaint identified by the triage nurse. A
      randomized convenience sampling method was used while members of the research team were on
      shift. Subjects were informed of the study once they were triaged at the Emergency Department
      treatment area. Members were screened for pathological back pain by history and physical, and
      if negative were offered enrollment into the study. After informed consent and Health
      Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA), demographics were collected as well as
      an initial Visual Analog Score (VAS) score, Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) score, and back pain
      functional scale (BPFS). Participants were randomly assigned to either the treatment or
      control group based on a random number generator. Subjects then received either BFA or the
      standard care, which was a pre-determined medicinal treatment. Participants were reassessed
      at 30-40 minutes post intervention for effectiveness of intervention for both pain and
      satisfaction. After initial pain control was achieved subjects completed a questionnaire on
      their perceived effectiveness of BFA as well as if they would repeat BFA in the future. If
      participants did not feel pain was adequately controlled in the either treatment arm they
      were provided rescue pain medications based on the preference of the treating provider. At
      discharge, participants were given further instructions including a follow-up telephone
      interview between 48-72 hours. In the telephone follow-up, participants were assessed on a
      Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), repeat functionality questionnaire, and if they used any other
      pain medications since discharge to help improve their pain (either pain medications given at
      discharge from the emergency department or their regularly prescribed pain medications).

      Data Analysis: In this study, the independent variables were treatment for musculoskeletal
      pain in the emergency department (standard care, battlefield acupuncture) and time (before
      treatment, 30 to 40 minutes post-treatment and 48 to 72 hours post-treatment). The dependent
      variable is pain measured on a VAS or NRS at 48-72 hours post-treatment. The null hypothesis
      is that there is no statistically significant difference in pain related to treatment or time
      between treatment groups. With 26 subjects per group (52 total), the investigator was able to
      detect a 1.0 standard deviation (SD) difference measured by a 13mm change in the VAS or a 2
      point change in the NRS.

    <description>Battlefield Acupuncture (BFA) has a structured administration sequence that was utilized to limit any variability between investigators administering the treatment. The BFA technique has been suggested that the needles are placed not just in an acupoint but actually &quot;acupoint zones.&quot; BFA utilizes one to ten (maximum five points per ear) ASP semi-permanent gold needles® placed in one or both ears. The ASP Gold needle® is a sterile device which inserts a small 2 mm needle into the auricle. It is comprised in single-needle applicator ensuring ease of insertion combined with excellent precision. The needles remain in the ear and fall out spontaneously as early as two hours and up to seven days. After administration of the BFA, if subjects felt that their pain was not controlled based on verbal response, rescue medication could be administered to control pain to a tolerable level for discharge.</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to the standard care group were treated with one, or a combination of selected medications to include oral Acetaminophen 500mg-1000mg, Diclofenac 50mg-75 mg orally, Diazepam 5mg-10 mg intravenous or oral, Hydrocodone 5mg/325mg-10mg/650mg mg oral, or intramuscular Ketorolac 30mg-60 mg, as deemed appropriate by the treating investigator (medical provider). Standard treatment was administered by the investigators based on the patient's presentation and driving status as many of the medications cannot be administered if the subject would operate a vehicle. No standardized algorithm was specified and the route and dose of medications was administered at the provider's discretion. After administration of the traditional standard care medications, if subjects felt their pain was not controlled based on verbal responses, rescue medication would be given to control pain to a more tolerable level for discharge.</description>
