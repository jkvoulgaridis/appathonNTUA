  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After nerve injury and facial palsy, many patients have permanent muscle and sensory
      dysfunction. Electrical stimulation (ES) of injured nerves may speed up axon growth and
      improve recovery. This study will assess if ES accelerates motor axon regeneration and
      improves muscle recovery in patients undergoing two-staged facial reanimation for facial
      palsy.

      This study of ES in these patients will investigate:

      i) nerve regeneration over long distances;

      ii) direct evidence of changes in nerve regeneration with nerve samples from the second
      procedure; and

      iii) changes in functional outcomes in a patient population with much less variability.

      Our study will provide evidence about the effect of ES in improving outcomes in patients with
      nerve injuries.

    <description>The Facial Clinimetric Evaluation (FaCE) Scale is a patient-report questionnaire assessing facial impairment and disability associated with facial paralysis. The 15-item likert scale questionnaire consists of six domains: i) facial movement, ii) facial comfort, iii) oral function, iv) eye comfort, v) lacrimal control and vi) social function.
Each domain produces its own score, with 1 meaning 'problems all the time' and 5 suggesting 'no problems at all.' The domain scores can then be summed to produce a total score assessing total quality of life with respect to facial paralysis.</description>
