  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Absorption, metabolism and excretion of linerixibat have been studied in previous clinical
      trials. However, no dedicated clinical studies of drug absorption, metabolism, and excretion
      have been conducted for linerixibat. The purpose of this study is to determine the PK,
      balance/excretion, and metabolism of radiolabeled 14 Carbon [14C]-linerixibat following a
      single intravenous (IV) radiolabeled microtracer dose (concomitant with a non-radiolabeled
      oral dose) and a single oral radiolabeled dose. This is a single group, two period, single
      sequence, and mass balance study will enroll 6 healthy male subjects. Each subject will be
      involved in the study for up to 10 weeks which includes screening period, two treatment
      periods (treatment Periods 1 and 2), separated by about 7 days (at least 13 days between oral
      doses), and a follow-up visit 1-2 weeks after the last assessment in treatment Period 2.

    <time_frame>Up to 34 days</time_frame>
    <description>Full 12-lead ECGs were recorded with the participants in a supine position. 12-lead ECGs were obtained using an automated ECG machine that measured PR, QRS, QT and QT duration corrected for heart rate by Fridericia's formula (QTcF) intervals and calculated heart rate. Clinically significant abnormal findings are those which are not associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant's condition. The number of participants with clinically significant abnormal findings for ECG parameters at worst-case post Baseline are presented.</description>

          <description>Participants were administered a single oral dose of 90 milligram (mg) linerixibat (two tablets [tab] of 45 mg each) in fasted state followed by an intravenous (IV) infusion of 100 micrograms (μg) radiolabeled [14C]-linerixibat infused over 3 hours on Day 1 of treatment period 1. Participants received 60 milliliter (mL) of 90 mg [14C]-linerixibat oral solution (sol) in the fasted state on Day 1 of treatment period 2. The treatment periods were separated by a washout period of about 7 days (at least 13 days between oral doses). All participants were followed-up at Day 34.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Worst Case Hematology Results Relative to Normal Range</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected to analyze the following hematology parameters; Basophils, Eosinophils, Erythrocytes mean corpuscular volume (MCV), Erythrocytes mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), Erythrocytes, Hematocrit (HCT), Hemoglobin (Hb), Leukocytes, Lymphocytes, Monocytes, Neutrophils, Platelets, Reticulocytes and Reticulocytes/Erythrocytes. Participants were counted in the worst case category if their value changes to (low, normal or high), unless there was no change in their category. Participants whose laboratory value category was unchanged (e.g. High to High), or whose value became normal, were recorded in the 'To Normal or No Change' category. Participants were counted twice if the participant had values that changed 'To Low' and 'To High', so the percentages may not add to 100%.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Worst Case Chemistry Results Relative to Normal Range</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected to analyze the following clinical chemistry parameters; alanine aminotransferase (ALT), albumin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), bilirubin, calcium, chloride, cholesterol, creatinine, direct bilirubin, globulin, glucose, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, phosphate, potassium, protein, sodium, triglycerides, urate and urea. Participants were counted in the worst case category if their value changes to (low, normal or high), unless there was no change in their category. Participants whose laboratory value category was unchanged (e.g. High to High), or whose value became normal, were recorded in the 'To Normal or No Change' category. Participants were counted twice if the participant had values that changed 'To Low' and 'To High', so the percentages may not add to 100%.</description>

        <description>Urine samples were collected to assess urine glucose, urine protein, urine blood, urine ketones, urine bilirubin, urine urobilinogen, urine nitrite and urine leukocyte esterase by dipstick test. The dipstick test gives results in a semi-quantitative manner, and results for urinalysis parameter can be read as negative (-) and positive (+) indicating proportional concentrations in the urine sample. Number of participants who had abnormal findings in any of these urinalysis parameters are presented.</description>

The dipstick test gives results in a semi-quantitative manner, and results for urinalysis parameter can be read as negative (-) and positive (+) indicating proportional concentrations in the urine sample. Number of participants who had abnormal findings in any of these urinalysis parameters are presented.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Abnormal Findings for Electrocardiogram (ECG) Parameters</title>
        <description>Full 12-lead ECGs were recorded with the participants in a supine position. 12-lead ECGs were obtained using an automated ECG machine that measured PR, QRS, QT and QT duration corrected for heart rate by Fridericia's formula (QTcF) intervals and calculated heart rate. Clinically significant abnormal findings are those which are not associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant's condition. The number of participants with clinically significant abnormal findings for ECG parameters at worst-case post Baseline are presented.</description>
