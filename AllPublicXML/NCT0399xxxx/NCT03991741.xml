  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine whether special tumor fighting cells that is taken from participants' tumors and
      grown in the laboratory and then given back to the participant will fight the participant's
      cancer when their immune system is suppressed from attacking these special tumor fighting
      cells. This is called transfer of autologous (they came from you) tumor infiltrating
      lymphocytes (the cells that have been grown in the laboratory. Participants getting these
      cell infusions will also be treated with interleukin-2 (IL-2).

             at the time of enrollment.

          -  Patient has stable or progressing disease after at least one prior treatment.

          -  Six weeks or more have elapsed since the patient received any prior anti-CTLA4
             antibody therapy

        Exclusion Criteria:

             chemotherapy regimen.

          -  Patient is a female of child-bearing potential who is pregnant or breastfeeding

          -  Patient requires immune suppressive therapy including but not limited to greater than
             physiologic steroid replacement.

          -  Active systemic infections, coagulation disorders or other active major medical
             illnesses of the cardiovascular, respiratory or immune system, as evidenced by a
             positive stress thallium or comparable test, myocardial infarction, cardiac
             arrhythmias, obstructive or restrictive pulmonary disease.
