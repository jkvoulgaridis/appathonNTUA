  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 2013 in France, 29,000 people are reported to be unaware of their HIV status. HIV testing
      is a priority in France where one third of all diagnoses remain late despite 5 million annual
      tests. It is recommended to offer at least one HIV test to the general population, over the
      life course, when seeking care and more frequently to populations at risk. Several
      international and national articles have shown that emergency screening is feasible and well
      accepted. But also that during systematic screening few infections were discovered, and the
      majority of newly diagnosed people belonged to the most exposed groups.

      Our hypothesis is that an electronic alert would identify people who are unaware of their HIV
      status. This alert would be based on two data: social data (French health coverage) and the
      country of birth. This alert is only relevant in high-prevalence regions, as is the case in
      the Ile de France region.

    <description>Period 1: Retrospective period:
Collection of data from the 12 months preceding the start of the research of hospitalized patients:
number of hospitalizations,
number of HIV serologies performed,
number of patients with socio-demographic criteria justifying HIV screening.
Start of research: Implementation of the &quot;POP-UP&quot; electronic alert
Period 2: Prospective period: 18 months POP-UP opens for patient who meet the eligibility criteria.
Six possibility to answer:
Patient accept to participate: patient is include and receive HIV serology during their hospitalization.
Not time to answer to the alert
Patient already has a serology less than 3 months old
Patient followed for a known HIV infection.
Patient who refused the test
Clinical condition of the patient not allowing his no opposition Only choice 1 include patient The response close the electronic alert, but it re-opens when the medical file is re-consulted (2/ and 6/) or new hospitalization.</description>
