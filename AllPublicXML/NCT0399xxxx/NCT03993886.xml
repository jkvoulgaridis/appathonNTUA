      The goal of the study is to demonstrate the validity and reliability of the CorBand across a
      suite of six clinical measures by comparing the measurements to similar outputs of FDA
      cleared devices:

        -  CorBand heart rate and heart rate variability will be compared to an electrocardiogram.

        -  CorBand bioimpedance will be compared to recorded extracted fluid and a bioimpedance
           measurement device.

        -  CorBand respiration rate will be compared to an respiratory rate sensor.

        -  CorBand skin temperature will be compared to a skin temperature monitoring device.

        -  CorBand activity will be compared to an activity monitor.

        -  CorBand outputs will be compared to the outputs of the CardioMEMS system.

      Device safety, comfort, and ease-of-use will also be evaluated as part of this study. Adverse
      events and serious adverse events will be documented throughout the study duration.
