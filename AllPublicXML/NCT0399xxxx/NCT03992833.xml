  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      European lung cancer screening studies using computed tomography (CT) have shown that a
      management protocol based on measuring lung nodule volume and volume doubling time (VDT) is
      more specific for early lung cancer detection than a diameter-based protocol. However,
      whether this also applies to a Chinese population is unclear. The aim of this study is to
      compare the diagnostic performance of a volume-based protocol with a diameter-based protocol
      for lung cancer detection and optimize the nodule management criteria for a Chinese
      population.

      In this population-based study, participants will undergo a low-dose chest CT scan for two
      rounds. At baseline, the first CT scan will be performed in all participants and their data
      will be collected. One-year after the baseline, a second CT scan will be performed and data
      will be collected again. CT images of each participant will be read twice independently by
      two groups of readers after the baseline and 1-year follow-up scans. In the first reading,
      the detected lung nodules are evaluated for diameter and managed according to a routine
      diameter-based protocol. The clinical management of participants are based on the first
      reading. In the second reading, each scan will be interpreted again by radiologists, blinded
      to the first reading. Semi-automated volumetry software will be used. The lung nodules will
      be evaluated for volume and management will be simulated according to a European volume-based
      protocol. Participants will be followed up and any diagnosis of lung cancer and related
      information will be collected at the fourth year through the hospital information system and
      by contacting the participants or their relatives.

    <description>Participants will undergo a chest CT scan in the Department of Radiology at Tianjin Cancer Hospital. All scans will be performed using the same CT system: Definition AS. Two readings of the images will be performed. In the first image reading, the CT images will be read by specially trained Chinese resident radiologist and checked by one of two senior Chinese radiologists. Lung Cancer Screening (version 2. 2018) Guidelines of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) will be used for the management of lung nodules. This guideline recommends management of lung nodules based on diameter. In the second reading, a semi-automated volumetry software will be used to measure the volume and evaluate the other parameters of lung nodules.
At baseline and one year after baseline, data about general characteristics, risk factors of lung cancer, and health status of the participants will be collected.</description>

    <description>In the first reading, according to the NCCN lung cancer screening guideline, participants with a solid nodule≤ 5 mm in diameter will be referred to undergo follow-up CT 1 year after the baseline. Participants with a solid nodule 6-14 mm will be referred to undergo follow-up thorax CT 3-6 months after the baseline. Participants with a solid nodule ≥ 15 mm will be referred to a multidisciplinary team for clinical investigation.
The simulated management will be based on the volume of lung nodule and volume doubling time from the second reading, lung nodules will be reclassified according to the reference values from the European volume-based lung nodule management protocol. According to the European volume-based protocol, the solid and part-solid lung nodules will be reclassified into three groups: nodules with a volume &lt; 100 mm3 (negative), nodules with a volume of 100-300 mm3 (indeterminate), and nodules with a volume &gt; 300 mm3 (positive).</description>
