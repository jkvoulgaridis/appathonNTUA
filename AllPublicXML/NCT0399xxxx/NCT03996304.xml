  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this cohort is to identify environmental, lifestyle and genetic factors that
      modify the human intestinal microbiota development during the first years of life, and to
      identify early microbiota features that associate to child health and well-being with focus
      on the development of allergic diseases and overweight.

      1055 healthy term infants born in 2016-2018 mainly at the capital region of Finland, and
      their parents. Fecal samples collected from infants and their parents. Electronic
      questionnaires on a weekly basis during the first 4 months of life, thereafter less
      frequently. Focus on diet, well-being and health and social manners. At one-year and at
      two-years comprehensive questionnaires including development and cognition. Parental stress
      evaluation included.
