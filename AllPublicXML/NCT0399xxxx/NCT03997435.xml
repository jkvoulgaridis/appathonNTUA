        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Able to provide written informed consent

          -  Age &gt;= 18 years of either sex.

          -  ECOG performance status 0-1

          -  Measurable disease by RECIST 1.1 criteria.

          -  Histologically confirmed rectal adenocarcinoma (defined as either mid- or low rectal
             cancer that is located within 12 cm from the anal verge OR below the peritoneal
             reflection) that is previously untreated.

          -  'High risk' rectal cancer, or rectal cancers that are considered marginally perable
             where there is a significant risk of positive surgical margin:

          -  T3 or T4, and / or

          -  Tumour infiltrating perirectal fat and/ or mesorectal fascia, and / or Involvement of
             pelvic lymph nodes, and/or

          -  Tumour invading surrounding structures or peritoneum or vasculature.

          -  Adequate bone marrow, renal and hepatic function as defined by: absolute neutrophil
             count &gt;= 1.5 x 109/L, hemoglobin &gt;= 9 g/L, platelets &gt;= 100 x 109/L, serum creatinine
             level &lt; 1.5 x ULN (or calculated creatinine clearance &gt;=50 ml/min, whichever is
             worse), total bilirubin &lt;=1.5 x the upper limit of normal, alanine aminotransferase
             (ALT) &lt; 3 upper limit of normal.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known distant metastasis, even if the metastasis has been resected.

          -  History of another invasive malignancy within the last 5 years, except for treated
             basal cell carcinoma of the skin, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, or breast DCIS.

          -  Upper rectal cancer that is located above the peritoneal reflection.

          -  Patients with synchronous colon and rectal cancers are not excluded as long as: (1)
             these tumors are considered as two separate primaries (i.e. not metastasis or a
             contiguous part of a large primary), (2) both tumors are not causing imminent
             obstruction; (3) pelvic radiotherapy is not considered a contraindication.

          -  Primary tumour associated with any one of the following features:Frank intestinal
             obstruction, or

          -  Endoscope unable to pass through the tumour's lumen plus worsening local obstructive
             symptoms. Note: Patients with such features should be assessed by the surgical team
             regarding stomal bypass prior to study enrolment. Such patients can still be
             considered for study enrolment after undergoing stomal bypass.

          -  Known hypersensitivity reaction to the study drugs (i.e. fluoropyrimidine, irinotecan,
             oxaliplatin)

          -  Known peripheral neuropathy of grade 2 or more in severity.\ -Patients who have
             received an experimental anticancer therapy within the last 28 days.

          -  Previous pelvic radiotherapy

          -  Previous oxaliplatin or irinotecan for the treatment of colon or rectal cancer.

          -  Patient with hip prosthesis

          -  Major surgery (i.e. requiring general anaesthetics) within the last 28 days.
             Exception: Any patient who underwent stomal bypass for obstructing primary tumour
             within the last 14 days are still eligible, as long as the patient has sufficiently
             recovered from the surgery at the investigator's discretion.

          -  Known cardiac disease that is symptomatic or poorly controlled, including cardiac
             failure, arrhythmia or ischemic heart disease.

          -  Myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident within the last 12 months.

          -  Intercurrent infections or medical illnesses that are serious/ potentially
             life-threatening and require ongoing treatment.

          -  Patients who are unable to take capecitabine tablets uncrushed by the oral route (e.g.
             enteral feeding). Patients with significantly impaired gastrointestinal integrity and
             absorption are excluded.

          -  Patients with known and untreated bilateral hydronephrosis and/or hydroureters (or
             unilateral hydronephrosis and/or hydroureters in any patient with a single kidney) are
             excluded. The obstruction should be treated with ureteric stent(s) or percutaneous
             nephrostomy(s) prior to study enrolment. Patients with unilateral hydronephrosis
             and/or hydroureters and adequate renal function (i.e. as stated in the eligibility
             criteria: serum creatinine level &lt; 1.5 x ULN, or calculated creatinine clearance &gt;=50
             ml/min - whichever is worse) are not excluded.

          -  Patients on warfarin therapy. Patients on low molecular weight heparin are not
             excluded.

          -  Pregnant or lactating women.

          -  Patients with reproductive potential who are not willing to use barrier method of
             birth control.

          -  Patients who are unable to provide written informed consent, or to comply with study
             requirements as judged by the investigator.

          -  Patients who refuse surgical treatment of the rectal cancer.
