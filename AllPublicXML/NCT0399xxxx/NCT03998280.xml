      PURPOSE:

      To investigate the effect of cervical muscle Fatigue on neck proprioception and postural
      stability during cervical flexion.

      BACKGROUND:

      Postural stability is the ability to maintain the body in equilibrium either at rest or in a
      steady state of motion . Muscle fatigue is the diminished response of muscle to repeated
      stimulus. Cervical proprioceptive inputs provide important somatosensory information
      influencing postural stability. Hence, the investigators performed this study to evaluate the
      effect of experimentally induced fatigue on general cervical musculature on postural
      stability .

      HYPOTHESES:

      This study will hypnotize that:

        1. Cervical flexor muscle fatigue will have a significant effect on neck proprioception

        2. Cervical muscle fatigue will have a significant effect on posture stability

      RESEARCH QUESTION:

      Will fatigue of cervical flexors have an effect on neck proprioception and postural
      stability?

      the research methodology that will be used

      Induction of fatigue using isometric neck flexor muscle endurance test (NET):

      An isometric neck muscle endurance test (NME test) will be performed for the deep neck
      flexors (Rectus Capitus Anterior, Rectus Capitus Lateralis, Longus Capitus, Longus Colli)
      until exhaustion in all participants occurs. With the subject in hook lying position through
      CHIN RETRACTION AND HEAD ELEVATED FROM THE COUCH.

      All the assessment measurements will be done before and just immediately after performing the
      cervical muscle fatigue then after 15 minutes of fatigue induction(fatigue recovery) A.
      Measurement of neck proprioception using cervical joint position error test via OVERHEAD
      LASER POINTER

      B. Measurement of postural stability using :

        1. Biodex balance system(limit of stability) to measure postural stability

        2. Multi-Directional Reach Test

    <description>: A laser pointer will be fixed to a headband or strap. Target paper will be typically 40 cm in diameter that contains concentric circles in 1 cm increments, divided into 4 quadrants intersecting at the zero.</description>

    <measure>Multi-Directional Reach Test</measure>
    <time_frame>six months</time_frame>
    <description>Multi-Directional Reach (MDRT) is an inexpensive screening tool to determine the limits of stability of individuals in 4 directions. It measure how far an individual can voluntarily reach, thereby shifting the COG to the limits of the BOS with the feet stationary. The MDRT is a valid and reliable clinical measure for limits of stability. The test can be used to assess human postural stability in different four direction as follow (Roberta 2001)</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Biodex Balance System for The postural stability test</measure>
    <time_frame>six months</time_frame>
    <description>The postural stability test emphasized on subject's ability to maintain center of balance. The subject's score on this test will assess the deviations from center, thus a lower score is more desirable than a higher score. Platform stability could be varied during this test by selecting (more options) from the Postural Stability Testing screen. It was proved that trial time, number of trials, starting and ending platform stability, rest count-downs or bilateral test could be set (Tropp and Odenrick., 2011).</description>
