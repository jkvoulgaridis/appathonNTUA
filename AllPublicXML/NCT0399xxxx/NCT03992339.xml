  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single arm, and registered study. About 60 patients with
      relapsed/refractory DLBCL plan to be enrolled in about 10 study sites of the study. It is
      planned that at least 50% (~30 patients) will have the GCB subtype of DLBCL. Enrolled
      patients will be treated with a fixed dose, 60 mg of ATG-010, orally, twice weekly, each 4
      week (28-day) a cycle. Patients should remain on the study treatment of ATG-010, until either
      PD or occurrence of unacceptable toxicity.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient must provide informed consent form (ICF) prior to the first screening
             procedure.

          2. Age ≥18 years.

          3. ECOG performance status of ≤ 2.

          4. Patients should have estimated life expectancy of &gt;3 months at study entry.

          5. Previously treated, pathologically confirmed de novo DLBCL, or DLBCL transformed from
             previously diagnosed indolent lymphoma (e.g., follicular lymphoma).

          6. Patients must have received at least 2 but no more than 5 previous systemic regimens
             for the treatment of their de novo or transformed DLBCL.

          7. Documented clinical or radiographic evidence of progressive DLBCL prior to dosing.

          8. Patients must have measurable disease per the revised criteria for response assessment
             of lymphoma (Cheson, 2014). Lymph nodes should be considered abnormal if the long axis
             is &gt; 1.5 cm, regardless of the short axis. If a lymph node has a long axis of 1.1 to
             1.5 cm, it should only be considered abnormal if its short axis is &gt; 1.0. Lymph nodes
             ≤ 1.0 by ≤ 1.0 will not be considered abnormal for relapse or PD.

          9. Patients must not be eligible for high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell
             transplantation rescue.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who are pregnant or lactating.

          2. DLBCL with mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma, composite lymphoma
             (Hodgkin's lymphoma +NHL), or DLBCL transformed from diseases other than indolent NHL
             or Richter's.

          3. Primary mediastinal (thymic) large B-cell lymphoma.

          4. Known central nervous system lymphoma or meningeal involvement.

          5. Patients whose most recent systemic anticancer therapy include radiation,
             chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radio-immunotherapy, or any other anticancer therapy
             other than glucocorticoids &lt; 6 weeks prior to first dose of study drug.

          6. Patients who have not recovered to Grade ≤ 1 clinically significant adverse events, or
             to their baseline, from their most recent systemic anti-DLBCL therapy.

          7. Patients with active graft-versus-host disease after allogeneic stem cell
             transplantation. At least 4 months must have elapsed since completion of allogeneic
             stem cell transplantation.

          8. Major surgery within 2 weeks of first dose of study treatment of ATG-010.

          9. Any life-threatening illness, medical condition or organ system dysfunction which, in
             the Investigator's opinion, could compromise the patient's safety.

         10. Unstable cardiovascular function:

               1. Symptomatic ischemia, or

               2. Uncontrolled clinically significant conduction abnormalities (i.e., ventricular
                  tachycardia on anti-arrhythmia are excluded; First degree atrioventricular block
                  or asymptomatic left anterior fascicular block /right bundle branch block will
                  not be excluded), or

               3. Congestive heart failure of New York Heart Association Class ≥3, or

               4. Myocardial infarction within 3 months.

         11. Uncontrolled (i.e., clinically unstable) infection requiring parenteral antibiotics,
             antivirals, or antifungals within 1 week prior to first dose; however, prophylactic
             use of these agents is acceptable even if parenteral.

         12. Active hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus infection.

         13. Known human immunodeficiency virus infection.

         14. Patients unable to swallow tablets, patients with malabsorption syndrome, or any other
             gastrointestinal disease or gastrointestinal dysfunction that could interfere with
             absorption of study treatment of ATG-010.
