  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this randomized controlled trial will be to show that the use of a novel
      automated system to guide vasopressor administration in brain injury patients will results in
      more time spent with a mean arterial pressure (MAP) within the predefined MAP (+/- 5 mmHg of
      the target MAP) compared to patients managed without any automated system (manually
      management)

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In brain injury patients, the maintenance of MAP within a very narrow range is desired to
      avoid complications related to hypoperfusion (undertreatment) or hypertension (over
      treatment). However, the MAP needed to reach can vary over time based on intracranial
      pressure. Additionally, it is well know that the nurses in the Intensive care unit managed
      multiple patients simultaneously and cannot dedicate 100% of his-her time to adjust drugs
      infusions. Using a novel automated system can overcome this issue and may lead to more time
      in MAP target (+/- 5mmHg) than the traditional management.

      After initial rescuscitation of the patients, patients in both groups will have the same
      baseline maintenance fluid administration of 1-2 ml/kg/h of crystalloid solution and
      additionnal fluid boluses administered following the EV1000 monitoring device. The only
      difference will be the management of vasopressor titration (manual by nurses vs automated via
      a closed-loop system)
