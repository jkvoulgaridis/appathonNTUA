  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal is to design, develop and evaluate a personalized intervention to prevent the
      onset of depression based on Information and Communications Technology (ICTs), risk
      predictive algorithms and decision support systems (DSS) for patients and general
      practitioners (GPs). The specific goals are 1) to design and develop a DSS, called
      e-predictD-DSS, to elaborate personalized plans to prevent depression; 2) to design and
      develop an ICT solution that integrates the DSS on the web, a mobile application (App), the
      risk predictive algorithm, different intervention modules and a monitoring-feedback system;
      3) to evaluate the usability and adherence of primary care patients and their GPs with the
      e-predictD intervention; 4) to evaluate the effectiveness of the e-predictD intervention to
      reduce the incidence of major depression, depression and anxiety symptoms and the probability
      of major depression next year; 5) to evaluate the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of the
      e-predictD intervention to prevent depression.

      Methods: This is a randomized controlled trial with allocation by cluster (GPs), simple
      blind, two parallel arms (e-predictD vs &quot;active m-Health control&quot;) and 1 year follow-up
      including 720 patients (360 in each arm) and 72 GPs (36 in each arm). Patients will be free
      of major depression at baseline and aged between 18 and 55 years old. Primary outcome will be
      the incidence of major depression at 12 months measured by CIDI. As secondary outcomes:
      depressive and anxiety symptomatology measured by PHQ-9 and GAD-7 and the risk probability of
      depression measured by predictD algorithm, as well as cost-effectiveness and cost-utility.
      The e-predictD intervention is multi-component and it is based on a DSS that helps the
      patients to elaborate their own personalized depression prevention plans, which the patient
      approves, and implements, and the system monitors offering feedback to the patient and to the
      GPs. It is an e-Health intervention because it is based on a web and m-Health because it is
      also implemented on the patient's smartphones through an App. In addition, it integrates a
      risk algorithm of depression, which is already validated (the predictD algorithm). It also
      includes an initial GP-patient interview and a specific training for the GP. Finally, a map
      of potentially useful local community resources to prevent depression will be integrated into
      the DSS.

    <description>In this arm, patients will continue receiving the usual care from their GPs.

    <description>The intervention is based on validated risk algorithms to predict depression and includes: 1) Mobile applications as main user's interface; 2) a DSS that helps patients to develop their own personalized plans to prevent (PPP) depression; 3) eight intervention modules (the core of the system) including activities to prevent depression, to be proposed by the DSS and chosen by the patient. The intervention is biopsychosocial and multi-component, including the following modules: physical exercise, improving sleep, expanding relationships, problem solving, improving communication skills, assertiveness training, making decisions and managing thoughts. Patients will implement the recommendations and the tool will monitor these actions, offering feedback to improve their PPP at 3, 6 and 9 months. The intervention also includes an initial and single 15-minute face-to-face GP-patient interview.</description>
