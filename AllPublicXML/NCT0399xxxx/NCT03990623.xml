  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial studies the use of computed tomography (CT) perfusion scans in detecting changes
      in blood flow to the liver after portal vein embolization in patients with liver cancer. CT
      perfusion scans use a standard contrast drug given by vein to measure blood flow to the
      liver. CT perfusion scans may predict the rate and amount of growth of new, healthy tissue on
      one side of the liver after a portal vein embolization and detect change to the size of the
      liver tumor as result of the procedure.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess whether perfusion changes to the liver following portal vein embolization (PVE)
      correlate with hypertrophy of the future liver remnant (FLR).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess perfusion changes to liver tumors following PVE. II. To assess whether PVE may
      affect tumor growth.

      OUTLINE:

      Prior to PVE, patients undergo CT perfusion scan of the liver and liver biopsy over 15
      minutes. Patients undergo a second CT perfusion scan immediately after PVE and a third CT
      perfusion scan 3-6 weeks post PVE.

    <description>Will assess whether perfusion changes to the liver following PVE correlate with hypertrophy of the future liver remnant (FLR). Perfusion and FLR hypertrophy are two continuous variables. Each patient will serve as his/her own control. Perfusion to the liver (1) before PVE, (2) immediately after PVE, and (3) 3-6 weeks following PVE will be measured and compared. The changes in perfusion will be compared with FLR hypertrophy at the 3-6 week time point to assess correlation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes to tumor cellular proliferation following PVE</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 6 weeks post PVE</time_frame>
    <description>Will assess perfusion changes to liver tumors following PVE and whether this may affect tumor growth kinetics. Each patient will serve as his/her own control. Perfusion to the liver tumor(s) (1) before PVE, (2) immediately after PVE, and (3) 3-6 weeks following PVE will be measured and compared. Since a percutaneous biopsy will be performed of a single liver tumor before PVE and the tumor explant will be available following surgical resection, changes to tumor cellular proliferation following PVE can be assessed.</description>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients planned to undergo major liver resection for cancer who need PVE to increase
             the size of the FLR prior to surgery.

          -  Patients who are able to understand and give consent to participate in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or nursing.

          -  Allergy to iodinated contrast which cannot be safely pre-medicated.

          -  History of severe renal dysfunction (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73
             square meters). Patients with a GFR between 30-50 mL/min/1.73 square meters will
             receive the standard contrast-induced nephropathy prophylaxis at our institution (i.e.
             N-acetylcysteine and sodium bicarbonate [150 mEq/L] in D5W intravenous).
