  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A substantial proportion of public safety personnel (PSP) develop service-related
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD is associated with a range of negative outcomes
      and its exact underlying neurophysiological mechanism is still not well understood. Cognitive
      behavioral therapy (CBT) is commonly prescribed to treat PTSD, and recent studies suggest
      that it may be effective in preventing the condition. We have developed a 5-session class
      focused on teaching introductory CBT skills to prevent and manage psychological distress, and
      we are currently in the process of launching a clinical trial to demonstrate its
      effectiveness in preventing PTSD and related conditions in PSP. In the proposed adjunctive
      study to this trial, we will quantitate the brain connectivity signature that is specific to
      the PTSD-resilience, and examine whether the classes increase this resilience-related brain
      mechanism.

      Our ultimate research goal is to develop and validate a preventive strategy for PTSD. We aim
      to 1) demonstrate neurophysiological evidence (using fMRI) of preventive CBTm classes for
      PTSD, and 2) validate the utility of the proposed imaging-based biomarker for PTSD-related
      resiliency. Emerging evidence suggests that a program such as CBTm classes could promote
      resiliency to PTSD in healthy individuals at high risk for trauma exposure. Further, our
      preliminary brain imaging data analysis suggests that we can quantitate the brain
      connectivity pattern that may reflect resilience to PTSD. We thus hypothesize that CBTm will
      increase the PTSD resilience-related brain connectivity pattern expression.

      In this novel pilot imaging study, we will recruit 40 PSP without PTSD or other mental
      disorder from 120 participants participating in our larger clinical trial. Twenty will be
      from each arm (CBTm and wait-list). The effect of CBTm on fMRI-based measures will be
      compared between arms.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must be enrolled in our on-going parallel study - &quot;Cognitive Behaviour Therapy with
             Mindfulness Course for Building Workplace Resilience: A Pilot Randomized Controlled
             Trial&quot;

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  if they have received psychological or medication treatment for a mental disorder in
             the past 6 months or if they score above the clinical cutoff on the following
             self-report symptom measures: Posttraumatic Checklist-5 (PCL-5) score &gt;37; Patient
             Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) score (depression) &gt;10, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7
             (GAD-7) score &gt;7, and the presence of suicidal ideation in the past six months.
             Individuals falling below these cutoff scores will receive further diagnostic
             assessment by a supervised PhD graduate student in Clinical Psychology. Those meeting
             criteria for PTSD or other mental disorder in the past 12 months as assessed by the
             Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) or the Mini International
             Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI v.7.0.2) will also be excluded. Finally, we will
             exclude individuals with any contraindication to MRI (e.g., claustrophobia and metal
             implants).
