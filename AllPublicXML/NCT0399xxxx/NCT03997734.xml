      Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to Treatment goup A, B and C.

      In the experiment group A, 12 subjects with a ratio of 10:2 will receive one patch of AB001
      or placebo batch on Day 1 of period 1, respectively, after a wash-out period of 14 days, 10
      subjects received AB001 patch will be administered with an oral capsule of active ingredient
      on Day 20 of period 2.

      In the experiment group B, 12 subjects with a ratio of 10:2 will receive two patches of AB001
      or two placebo batches on Day 1 respectively, and then two patches daily from Day 8 to Day
      20.

      In the active comparator group C, 10 subjects will receive one patch of positive comparative
      patch on Day 1, and then once patch every two days from Day 8 to Day 20.

      The tolerability, safety and pharmacokinetics of topical AB001 patch will be assessed in this
      study.

             psychiatric, infectious, hepatic, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, endocrine, immunologic
             or renal disease or other conditions known to interfere with the topical absorption,
             distribution, metabolism, or excretion of drugs or place the subjects at increased
             risk as determined by the investigator

          2. History of hypersensitivity to NSAIDs

          3. Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities as judged by the investigator

          4. Known sensitivity to adhesive tape, component of the test products or topically
             applied products

          5. Any active malignancy

          6. Suffering from severe acne, moderate to severe hirsutism or androgenic alopecia

          7. Any chronic skin disorder (e.g., eczema, psoriasis) likely to interfere with
             transdermal drug absorption or assessment of skin tolerability

          8. Skin abnormalities likely to be aggravated by the study medication, such as
             dermatological diseases or infections, rash, skin sensitive to topical preparations or
             adhesive dressings

          9. Pregnant and/or nursing women

         10. Any visible skin disorder or abnormal skin pigmentation which, in the opinion of the

         11. History of alcohol or drug abuse within 18 months

         12. Blood donation or significant blood loss within 60 days of dosing or plasma donation
             within 7 days of dosing

         13. Use of any medication within 4 weeks prior to the first treatment or during the trial,
             which in the opinion of the investigator may influence the trial results or the safety
             of the subjects

         14. Subjects who cannot avoid, throughout the duration of the trial, any swimming, any
             washing of the back, and sauna or any intense physical activity that might result in
             excessive sweating

         15. Any other clinical condition that, in the Investigator's judgment, would potentially
             compromise study compliance or the ability to evaluate safety/efficacy.
