      The therapeutic approach taken by trial SAKK 66/17 is different from those already used in
      clinical practice and possibly offers patients a therapeutic benefit after failure of
      standard chemotherapy and immunotherapy.

      Patients with laser ablation-accessible solid tumors are treated by thermal ablation followed
      immediately by an intratumoral injection of IP-001 (1 % N-dihydro-galacto-chitosan,
      Immunophotonics Inc.) for injection). IP-001 is intended to trigger a tumor-specific systemic
      immune response when exposed to tumor antigens liberated by thermal ablation. There is strong
      preclinical and early clinical evidence that combining thermal ablation with IP-001 might be
      able to turn 'cold' tumors into 'hot' tumors, inducing a systemic immune response. This may
      result in shrinkage of the treated tumor, as well as, long-term response mediated by the
      patient's immunological defense system against any remaining tumor cells (residual primary
      and metastatic tumor cells) including tumor cells outside or distant from the treated area
      (also known as abscopal effect).

      This trial will provide information on the safety and tolerability of thermal ablation
      followed immediately by an intratumoral IP-001 injection (Ablation + IP-001) in patients with
      laser ablation-accessible solid tumors ('all comers', Part 1 - safety run in). Further
      information on safety and tolerability, as well as preliminary antitumor activity, will be
      evaluated in patients with soft tissue sarcoma (Part 2, Cohort1), whereas in melanoma
      patients, anti-tumor activity will be defined as a primary objective (Part 2, Cohort 2).

      The trial treatment consists of an Ablation + IP-001 in 4-week intervals for up to 6
      scheduled treatments. Thermal ablation will be performed according to the instruction of the
      medical device, and IP-001 will be administered in different dose levels according to the
      trial design. All patients will be followed until progression of disease or until the start
      of a subsequent treatment.

    <textblock>
      Despite constant progress in the treatment of patients with advanced solid tumors failing
      standard systemic treatment, there is still a high unmet medical need to develop new active
      anticancer drugs or therapies. Although patients with advanced melanoma have benefitted
      substantially from the new checkpoint inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, etc., those patients
      progressing after such treatment are still in high need of additional treatment options. In
      the field of advanced sarcoma, little to no progress has been made in the last years, and
      chemotherapy is still standard treatment for these patients. The therapeutic approach taken
      by trial SAKK 66/17 is different from those already used in clinical practice and possibly
      offers patients a therapeutic benefit after failure of standard chemotherapy and
      immunotherapy. There is strong preclinical and early clinical evidence that combining thermal
      ablation with IP-001 (1 % N-dihydro-galacto-chitosan, Immunophotonics Inc.) for injection)
      might be able to turn 'cold' tumors into 'hot' tumors, inducing a systemic immune response.
      This may result in shrinkage of the treated tumor, as well as long-term response mediated by
      the patient's immunological defense system against any remaining tumor cells (residual
      primary and metastatic tumor cells), including tumor cells outside or distant from the
      treated area (also known as abscopal effect).

      The primary objective of Part 1 is to determine the safety and tolerability of thermal
      ablation followed immediately by an intratumoral IP-001 injection (Ablation + IP-001) in
      patients with laser ablation-accessible solid tumors ('all comers').

      The primary objective of Part 2 - Cohort 1 (soft tissue sarcoma, STS) is to further determine
      the safety and tolerability of thermal ablation followed immediately by an intratumoral
      IP-001 injection (Ablation + IP-001) in the dose established in Part 1 of the trial.

      The primary objective of Part 2 - Cohort 2 (melanoma) of the trial is to define anti-tumor
      activity of thermal ablation followed immediately by an intratumoral IP-001 injection
      (Ablation + IP-001) utilizing the dose established in Part 1 of the trial.

      The secondary objective of the trial is

        -  to further determine the safety and tolerability of IP-001 (Part 2, Cohort 1 and 2)

        -  to assess the preliminary anti-tumor activity in STS patients (Part 2, Cohort 1)

        -  to observe further signs of clinical preliminary anti-tumor activity in patients with
           melanoma (Part 2, Cohort 2).
