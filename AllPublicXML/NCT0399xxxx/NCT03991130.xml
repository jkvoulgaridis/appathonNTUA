  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this single arm phase 2 trial is to assess the response rate
      [complete response (CR) + partial response (PR)] of combined nivolumab and HD IL-2 in
      subjects with metastatic melanoma and renal cell carcinoma. Response will be performed after
      each course of nivolumab and IL-2 using RECIST 1.1. Patients will be treated for one course
      past best response for a maximum of 3 courses.

      PrimaryObjective Determine the overall response rate (complete response and partial response)
      for patients receiving anti-PD-1 (nivolumab) and high dose IL-2 (HD IL-2) in subjects with
      metastatic melanoma or renal cell carcinoma who have previously progressed on anti-PD-1
      therapy. Response assessment will be performed using revised RECIST guideline (v 1.1).

      Secondary Objectives

        -  Characterize safety, tolerability and adverse effects (AE) profile of nivolumab with HD
           IL-2 in subjects with metastatic malignant melanoma or renal cell carcinoma

        -  Measure Progression-Free Survival (PFS) using RECIST 1.1 after completion of at least
           one course of therapy (2 doses of nivolumab, 2 cycles of HD IL-2) for subjects enrolled
           in the study.

      ExploratoryObjectives

        -  Correlate PD-L1 expression and tumor mutational burden (TMB) in archived diagnostic
           tumor tissue with best clinical response for subjects with metastatic melanoma and renal
           cell carcinoma

        -  Correlate myeloid-derived suppressor cells and T-cell subsets in peripheral blood during
           therapy with best clinical response (RECIST criteria) and treatment outcome in subjects
           with metastatic melanoma or renal cell carcinoma. Data will be collected prior to each
           treatment and after each course of treatment.

    <description>Course length will be 35 days. Subjects will receive 480 mg IV of nivolumab on day 1 of the cycle. The patient will be admitted to UCSD Jacobs Medical center for standard HD IL-2 which will be administered every 8 hrs for up to 14 doses days 8-12 per institutional practice. The patient will be readmitted days 22-28 for HD IL-2 every 8 hrs for up to 14 doses. Nivolumab 480 mg IV will be administered day 35. Scans for response will occur 4 weeks after day 35 nivolumab dose and response will be determined by RECIST 1.1 to determine if the patient will receive the next course.</description>
