  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      General anesthesia is a medically induced state of low reactivity consciousness which is
      similar to natural sleep. Some studies found that general anesthesia as an independent risk
      factor could result in a desynchronization of the circadian time structure and cause
      postoperative sleep disorders characterized by reduced rapid eye movement (REM) and slow wave
      sleep (SWS), which have signiﬁcant deleterious impacts on postoperative outcomes, such as
      postoperative fatigue, severe anxiety and depression, emotional detachment and delirium, and
      even pain sensitivity or postoperative pain of patients.Clinical trials have already proved
      that intraoperative use of dexmedetomidine (DEX) for general anesthesia, a highly selective
      alpha-2 adrenergic agonist, was able to improve sedative and analgesia effects and promote
      sleep quality (by decreasing stage N1 sleep, increasing stage N2 sleep and sleep efficiency).
      However, Wenfei Tan et al reported that with the deeper sedative state provided by DEX in the
      daytime, the elderly male patients undergoing TURP under spinal anesthesia suffered worse
      sleep on the night of surgery. Thus, what the effect of intraoperative using DEX at different
      time periods under general anesthesia on postoperative sleep quality and pain will be needs
      further study.

      patients scheduled for elective laparoscopic abdominal surgeries under general anesthesia
      were enrolled. Patients were randomized to receive operation in the D group (8:00-12:00) and
      the N group (18:00-22:00). The Portable Sleep Monitor (PSM) was performed on the following 3
      nights: the night before surgery (Sleep1), the ﬁrst night after surgery (Sleep 2), and the
      third night after surgery (Sleep 3). Postoperative pain scores using visual analogue scoring
      scale, subjective sleep quality using the Athens Insomnia Scale, total dose of general
      anesthetics and PCA pump press numbers were also recorded.

    <description>Evaluate the VAS score at 1,6,24,48 hours after the surgery.Visual analog scale (VAS) score of 0 was considered painless, and a score of 10 was considered as intense pain. Scores of 4 and below were considered mild pain (pain does not affect sleep), and scores of 5 to 6 were considered moderate pain (pain influences sleep, but the patients can still fall asleep). Scores of 7 and above were considered severe pain (Due to the pain the patient is unable to sleep or wakes up)</description>
