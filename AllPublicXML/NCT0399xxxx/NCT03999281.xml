        Population included ages 18- any age, males 50.5 % and females 49.5%, There was more males
        in the diabetic subset and more females in the venous subset.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Theraskin applied to lower extremity wound during the study period.

          2. Over 18 years of age.

          3. Males and Females.

          4. lower Extremity wound due to diabetic neuropathy or venous insufficiency.

          5. Documented palpable pedal pulse (dorsalis pedis and/or posterior tibialis arteries
             and/or palpable bypass graft), or ankle brachial index (ABI) in the range of &gt; 0.8 to
             &lt; 1.1 or Tcpo2 &gt; 40 mm Hg from the foot at the time of the initial allograft
             applicaton

          6. In subjects with multiple wounds only the largest wound receiving the allograft was
             included and considered the target wound

          7. Initial wound size &gt;1 cm 2

          8. All wound locations within the lower extremity (defined as below the knee) and wound
             durations included

          9. Concomitant Negative pressure wound therapy was allowed as this could have been an
             anchoring technique for the allograft

         10. Concomitant antibiotics ( topical, oral, or intravenous) were allowed as it was not
             possible to determine whether administration of antibiotics was due to a true
             infection at the target wound site.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Wound etiologies other than diabetic neuropathy or nevous such as trauma, burns,
             sickle cell anemia, necrobiosis lipoidica , pyoderma gangrenosum.

          2. Wound not present for at least 30 days and showing lack of progression for at least 30
             days prior to application of Theraskin.

          3. Other ulcer treatments besides study allograft during the study period ( study period
             definition: time of first allograft application up to 20 weeks) were not included in
             this study. These concomitant treatments specifically include hyperbaric oxygen
             treatments, venous ablation procedures, revascularization procedures including lower
             extremity bypass grafts or angioplasties or stents, application of additional growth
             factors, biologic products containing cells or other tissue-derived products, matrix
             components, or enzymatic debriders. Subjects were allowed to receive standard of care
             therapy with the study allograft, which included debridement, moist dressings or
             compression dressings depending on wound etiology, and off-weighting depending on
             wound location.

          4. Patients with revascularization procedures (defined as lower extremity bypass grafts,
             angioplasties, or stents) within 30 days of initial TheraSkin application were
             excluded

          5. Patients with successful surgical correction or intervention aimed at improving venous
             return in the target limb, such as venous ablation procedures, within 30 days of
             initial TheraSkin application were excluded
