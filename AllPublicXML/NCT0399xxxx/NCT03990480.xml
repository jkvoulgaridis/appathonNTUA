      Aim: To evaluate the effects of Valsartan versus Amlodipine on LV deformation in relation to
      plasma adiponectin and leptin levels in hypertensive individuals.

      Methods: LV strain measured by 2 dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography, plasma levels
      of adiponectin and leptin was determined in 30 healthy individuals served as control group
      and in 200 hypertensive patients before and after treatment for three months with either
      Valsartan 160 mg or amlodipine 10 mg.

      Patients and methods Thirty control healthy individuals and 200 patients with uncomplicated,
      essential hypertension were enrolled and followed up for 3 months in a controlled randomized
      study. All subjects' health status was evaluated by a complete medical examination. All BP
      measurements were made with calibrated mercury manometers (Korotkoff I and V). Three separate
      measurements were taken at least 2 min apart and the average of these values was calculated.
      Subjects' height and weight were recorded in the fasting state with the subjects wearing only
      light clothes and without shoes and BMI was calculated using the equation (BMI = weight
      (kg)/height (m)2). Patients, of both sexes with mild to moderate essential hypertension
      (diastolic blood pressure [DBP] &gt;80 and ≤100 mmHg after a 2-week wash-out period, SBP
      systolic blood pressure&gt;120 and 160 mmHg). Patients were randomly assigned into two groups
      using a computer-generated random number: Group I treated with valsartan (160 mg/d, n = 100),
      Group II amlodipine (10 mg/d, n = 100). Another 30 healthy subjects are enrolled as control
      group (Group III). Subjects in group I and II were asked to maintain their usual dietary and
      physical activity habits throughout the study. Treatment tolerability was assessed at each
      follow-up visit.

    <description>Left ventricular mass index (LVMI) is a parameter used in echocardiography cardiac MRI.
LVMI is calculated using the following equations:
LVMI = LVM (left ventricular mass/body surface area left ventricular mass = 0.8{1.04[([LVEDD + IVSd +PWd]3 - LVEDD3)]} + 0.6 Where
LVEDD = LV end-diastolic dimension (mm) IVSd = interventricular septal thickness at end-diastole (mm) PWd = posterior wall thickness at end-diastole (mm)</description>
