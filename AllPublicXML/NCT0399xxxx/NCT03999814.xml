      After obtaining informed consent, the study participants' relevant medical records will be
      collected and reviewed. If needed, a telephone or video conference will be scheduled with the
      patient's family to confirm and clarify information in the medical record. Deceased patients
      may be eligible for inclusion the retrospective registry if medical records are sufficient
      and indicate eligibility. Data will be pooled and presented in aggregate, without
      identification of individual subjects.

    <description>In the questionnaire parents/caregivers are asked to score the child on a scale of 1 to 4 based on how often the child can perform 33 various activities of daily living. The individual scores are then added up to form a composite score of disease severity, with lower scores indicating higher severity and higher score indicating less disease progression.</description>
