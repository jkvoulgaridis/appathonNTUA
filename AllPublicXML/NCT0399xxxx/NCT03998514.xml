      Part A: Part A is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, single ascending dose
      sequential group study evaluating the safety, tolerability, PK, and PD of a single SC dose of
      CB4211 in healthy non obese subjects.

      Part B: Part B is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, multiple ascending dose
      sequential group study evaluating the safety, tolerability, PK, and PD of once daily SC doses
      of CB4211 over 7 days in healthy non obese subjects.

      Part C: Part C is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, multiple dose, parallel
      group study evaluating the safety, tolerability, PK, and PD of once daily SC doses of CB4211
      over 28 days in subjects with NAFLD.

             or postmenopausal (defined as at least 12 continuous months without menses and
             follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH] ≥40 mIU/L and without an alternative medical
             cause).

          2. Body mass index between 18.0 and 30.0 kg/m2 , inclusive, with a minimum body weight of
             50.0 kg at Screening.

          3. In good health, determined by no clinically significant findings from medical history,
             physical examination, 12-lead ECG, vital signs measurements, and clinical laboratory
             evaluations (congenital nonhemolytic hyperbilirubinemia [eg, Gilbert's syndrome] is
             not acceptable) at Screening or Check-in as assessed by the Investigator (or
             designee).

          4. Male subjects who are surgically sterile for at least 90 days will not need to use
             contraception. Male subjects who are not surgically sterile for at least 90 days will
             be required to use a male condom with spermicide when sexually active with female
             partners of childbearing potential from Check-in until 90 days after the last dose of
             study drug. Sexual intercourse with female partners who are pregnant or breastfeeding
             should be avoided unless condoms are used from the time of the first dose until 90
             days after the last dose of study drug. Male subjects are required to refrain from
             donation of sperm from Check-in until 90 days after the last dose of study drug.

          5. Has maintained stable weight (by history) for at least 4 weeks prior to Screening.

          6. Agrees to the following:

             clinically significant.

          8. Able to comprehend and willing to sign an ICF and to abide by the study restrictions.

        Parts A and B Exclusion Criteria:

             subjects with evidence of active infection.

          5. History of significant hypersensitivity, intolerance, or allergy to any drug compound,
             food, or other substance, unless approved by the Investigator (or designee).

          6. History of alcoholism or drug/chemical abuse within 2 years prior to Check-in.

          7. Alcohol consumption of &gt;21 units per week for males and &gt;14 units for females. One
             unit of alcohol equals 12 oz (360 mL) beer, 1½ oz (45 mL) liquor, or 5 oz (150 mL)
             wine.

          8. Positive urine drug screen (confirmed by repeat) at Screening or positive alcohol
             breath or urine test result or positive urine drug screen at Check-in.

          9. Positive hepatitis panel and/or positive human immunodeficiency virus test. Subjects
             with serologic finding of immunity consistent with history of prior hepatitis B
             vaccination may be enrolled.

         10. Participation in a clinical study involving administration of an investigational drug
             (new chemical entity) in the past 30 days prior to dosing or have received a
             biological product within 3 months or 5 elimination half-lives (whichever is longer)

             Vitamin E, herbal supplements, hormonal therapy/replacement, or CYP3A4 substrates,
             inducers and inhibitors within 14 days prior to the first dose of study drug unless,
