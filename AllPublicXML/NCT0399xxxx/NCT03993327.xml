  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies how well an imaging agent called I-124 M5A works in detecting
      CEA-positive colorectal cancer that has spread to the liver. I-124 M5A is a monoclonal
      antibody, called M5A, linked to a radioactive substance called I-124. M5A binds to
      CEA-positive cancer cells and may, through imaging scans, be able to detect liver metastases
      by picking up signals from I-124.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the ability of iodine I 124 monoclonal antibody M5A (124I-labeled M5A
      monoclonal antibody [MAb]) to localize to CEA positive gastrointestinal (GI) metastases
      primarily focused on the liver.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and pharmacokinetics of administration of 124I-labeled M5A MAb.

      II. To correlate the radiographic positron emission tomography (PET) images to the liver
      metastases pathology.

      III. To assess if the I-124 imaging agent detected additional liver and additional
      extra-hepatic liver lesions not appreciated on standard imaging scans.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive iodine I 124 monoclonal antibody M5A intravenously (IV) on day 0 and undergo
      PET scan on days 2 and 6.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up periodically for 1 year.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically confirmed metastatic colorectal cancer with liver
             metastases. NOTE: We are not requiring proof of CEA positive disease because &gt; 95% of
             colorectal cancers are CEA positive

          -  The effects of 124I-M5A on the developing fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of
             child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or
             barrier method of birth control or abstinence) prior to study entry and for six months
             following duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect
             that she is pregnant while participating on the trial, she should inform her treating
             physician immediately

          -  Patients must have at least 2 known sites of metastatic liver disease. Patients should
             have at least one resectable liver metastasis as assessed by hepatobiliary surgical
             oncology

          -  The results of the imaging scans that are performed as part of the standard work up
             should be available and should have been done within 2 months prior to study entry

          -  All subjects must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written
             informed consent

          -  Prior therapy (chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy) must be completed at least 2
             weeks prior to infusion of radiolabeled antibody

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients should not have any uncontrolled illness including ongoing or active
             infection

          -  Patients who have allergy to iodine or iodine contrast agents are not eligible for
             this protocol

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to 124I-M5A

          -  Patients must not have received prior chemotherapy or radiation for &gt;= 2 weeks before
             study enrollment

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because 124I-M5A is an agent with the
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the
             mother with 124I-M5A, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated
             with 124I-M5A

          -  Patients with single (= 1) liver metastasis are not eligible for this protocol

          -  Any patient who has had exposure to mouse, chimeric (human/mouse) or humanized
             immunoglobulin and has antibody to the M5A

          -  Subjects, who in the opinion of the investigator, may not be able to comply with the
             safety monitoring requirements of the study
