  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study represents a quality improvement study of a recently-developed dedicated
      radiation oncology subspecialty clinic with the goal of improving timeliness of palliative
      radiation therapy and improving resident training in palliative care topics. The aim of this
      study is to evaluate the impact of this clinic on time to palliative radiation therapy
      following referral.

      Primary Objective:

      â€¢ Determine whether interval between palliative radiation therapy referral and palliative
      radiation therapy initiation is shorter for participants treated in a dedicated palliative
      radiation oncology clinic compared to the same interval for participants treated in a general
      radiation oncology clinic (historical control). The investigators' hypothesis is that this
      interval will be significantly shorter among the Palliative Radiation Oncology Chief's Clinic
      participants compared to historical control.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  Determine whether each of the three component intervals within the overall interval from
           referral to treatment initiation (i.e., referral to consultation; consultation to
           simulation; simulation to treatment) is shorter for participants treated in a dedicated
           palliative radiation oncology clinic compared to the length of the same intervals for
           participants treated in a general radiation oncology clinic (historical control). The
           investigators' hypothesis is that each of these component intervals will be
           significantly shorter among the Palliative Radiation Oncology Chief's Clinic
           participants compared to historical control.

        -  Describe levels of and changes over time in patient-reported quality of life after
           palliative radiation therapy in the full sample, and in subgroups stratified by various
           radiation regimens. The investigators' hypothesis is that participants who receive a
           shorter course of palliative radiation (one day or five days) will have greater
           improvements in overall quality of life than participants who receive a ten-day course
           of palliative radiation.

        -  Determine median overall survival after palliative radiation therapy.

    <description>Number of days between referral to palliative radiation therapy interval and start of palliative radiation therapy compared to historical control. Mean time from referral to the start of RT (measured in days) will be computed for our sample and compared to the historical control mean of 13.4 days using a two-sided one-sample t-test.</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life Changes</measure>
    <time_frame>1 and 3 months after treatment completion</time_frame>
    <description>Levels of and changes in patient-reported overall quality of life as measured by the EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL (14 questions) at baseline and at 1-month and 3-month intervals after end of palliative radiation therapy. Quality of life score scale consists of 1 = not at all to 4 = very much. The higher the QOL score the greater change in the participant's quality of life.</description>

    <description>Median overall survival (number of days between start of radiation therapy and death from any cause) will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared (with a one-sample logrank test and assuming a Weibull distribution parameter of 1.0) to the median overall survival of n=134 days in our historical control.</description>
