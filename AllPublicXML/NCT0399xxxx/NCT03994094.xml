  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A specialized osteoporosis clinic has existed in our hospital since 2010. The descriptive
      retrospective analysis of patients included in this pathway was the subject of a first study
      on patients included between January 2010 and January 2011 and reported to the Congress of
      the French Society of Rheumatology (SFR) in December 2011, then a second study on patients
      included between January 2012 and December 2016, presented as an e-poster at the SFR Congress
      in December 2017 and in a poster at the American Society of Bone and Mineral Research
      Conference (ASBMR) in October 2018 and published in 2019 in Archives of Osteoporosis.

      The effectiveness specialized osteoporosis clinics is the subject of numerous publications.

      It therefore seems important to evaluate the effectiveness of our management, 3 years from
      the date of inclusion of patients in the osteoporosis clinic of our hospital.
