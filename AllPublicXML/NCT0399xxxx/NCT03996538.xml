  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With aging the immune system gets weaker. This makes older adults more susceptible to
      influenza (flu). Vaccinations help to prevent infection from the flu virus, however the
      immune system of older adults do not respond as well to vaccines compared to young adults and
      thus, aren't as well protected from the complications from the flu. This research is being
      done to determine if Metformin, an FDA-approved diabetes medication, is effective at
      enhancing immune responses to flu vaccine in older men and women. Participants will be
      randomly assigned to either metformin or placebo treatment for a total of 22 weeks.
      Participants will be vaccinated with high-dose flu vaccine after 12 weeks of treatment.
      Immune responses will be evaluated throughout the study at 6 time points.
