      The purpose of the current Study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of Galnobax®
      plus Standard of Care versus only Standard of Care, in treating Diabetic Foot Ulcers (DFU).
      In addition, Study is designed to investigate the safety of Galnobax® vehicle for
      establishing non-deleterious effects of Vehicle on wound healing in the Subjects with DFU.
      The study is being conducted in 350 subjects being recruited in about 30 centers in India.
