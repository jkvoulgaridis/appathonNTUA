  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the long-term safety of LIQ861 in patients
      with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One of the greatest impediments to patient treatment satisfaction with current inhaled
      treprostinil therapy is inconvenience. Currently, PAH patients using inhaled treprostinil may
      require more than 36 breaths per day using a nebulizer requiring daily set up and cleaning.
      The use of a discrete, hand-held dry powder inhaler to deliver treprostinil to the lungs
      could represent a major improvement in convenience and patient satisfaction, thereby
      improving the quality of life for PAH patients. Liquidia is pursuing approval of LIQ861, an
      inhalation dry powder formulation of treprostinil that is produced using Liquidia's PRINT®
      Technology (Particle Replication in Nonwetting Templates), as an alternative to current
      inhaled treprostinil therapy for the treatment of patients with PAH (WHO Group 1).

    <intervention_model_description>The study will evaluate the long-term safety of LIQ861 in PAH (WHO Group 1) patients who have completed a Liquidia LIQ861 clinical study. All patients will be treated on an outpatient basis until regulatory approval of LIQ861 or study is terminated by sponsor. Study enrollment will occur after final assessments from a prior study have been completed.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>LIQ861 inhaled treprostinil at capsule strengths of 25 μg, 50 μg, 75 μg and 100 μg. LIQ861 will be administered using the RS00 Model 8 dry powder inhalation (DPI) device (Plastiape S.p.A.; Osnago, Italy) at dose levels of 25 μg capsule strength to 200 μg capsule strength treprostinil four times a day (QID) in individual patients. Titrating to dose levels beyond 200 μg capsule strength QID, under clinical investigator supervision, requires review and approval from the Medical Monitor.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Evidence of a personally signed and dated informed consent document exists indicating
             that the patient has been informed of all pertinent aspects of the study prior to
             initiation of any study-related procedures.

          2. Patient is willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan,
             laboratory tests, and other study procedures.

          3. Patient has fulfilled all entry criteria at the time of enrollment in original study
             with LIQ861.

          4. Patient has completed the protocol defined end of study procedures or met a
             protocol-defined and adjudicated endpoint in the original LIQ861 study in which they
             were enrolled.

          5. Patient, whether male or female, agrees to use a medically acceptable method of
             contraception throughout the entire study period from informed consent through the
             termination visit, if the possibility of conception exists. Eligible male and female
             patients must also agree not to participate in a conception process (e.g., actively
             attempt to become pregnant or to impregnate, sperm donation, in vitro fertilization)
             during the study and for 30 days after the last dose of LIQ861.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient prematurely discontinued LIQ861 due to a drug-related AE/SAE or tolerability
             issue in the original LIQ861 study in which they were enrolled, or patient did not
             complete protocol defined study procedures at an end of study visit (not Early
             Termination visit) in their original LIQ861 study.

          2. Patient withdrew consent during participation in another LIQ861 study.

          3. Patient is a female who wishes to become pregnant or who has a positive pregnancy test
             on Day 1 (LTI-302 Study Initiation Visit).

          4. Patient has undergone lung or heart/lung transplant or the initiation of parenteral
             (intravenous [IV] infusion or subcutaneous injection) therapy with a prostacyclin
             during the time since participation in their original LIQ861 study.

          5. Any reason exists that, in the opinion of the Investigator or Medical Monitor,
             precludes the patient from participating in the study, e.g., any previous or
             intercurrent medical condition that may increase the risk associated with study
             participation or that would confound study analysis or impair study participation or
             cooperation.
