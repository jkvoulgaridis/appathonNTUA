    <textblock>
      A defect of the immune response has been described in patients with severe liver disease.
      This immune-paresis is partly driven by a compensatory anti-inflammatory response following a
      systemic inflammatory response syndrome and affects the innate immune response. The innate
      immune defect has been described in patients with advanced cirrhosis and more significantly
      in patients with acute liver failure or acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF). The
      monocytes/macrophages pro-inflammatory response and finally the antimicrobial response are
      thus strongly impaired, leading to higher sepsis risk. The monocytes/macrophages phenotype
      associated with these functional alterations has been widely described, with a weaker
      expression of Human Leukocyte Antigen - DR isotype (HLA-DR) on the monocytes surface,
      correlated with poor outcomes. The low monocytic expression of HLA-DR, its functional and
      clinical impact has been widely described in the context of septic shock with similar
      pathophysiological mechanisms.

      Liver transplantation (LT) is often the only therapeutic option for patients with advanced
      liver failure. Post-transplant survival of the most severe patients is similar to the
      survival in the whole population of LT patients, but the complication rate remains higher,
      with a major risk of infection. Currently used immunosuppression protocols do not take into
      account the quality of pre-transplant immune response. Some treatments, such as
      corticosteroids, which are widely used for the induction of post-transplant
      immunosuppression, may affect the innate immune response. However, it has been shown that low
      expression of post-transplant monocyte HLA-DR was associated with a greater risk of septic
      complication.

      The general objective of this study is to focus on the evolution of a robust marker of immune
      dysfunction, HLA-DR monocyte expression, before and following LT, and to analyse its post LT
      expression depending on the level of pre-transplant expression as well as its association
      with post-transplant complications. This study will bring new insights for the design of a
      prospective study on the relevance of adapting post-transplant immunosuppression protocols to
      HLA-DR expression on monocytes surface, which is a robust marker of the innate immune
      response.

      Evaluation of innate immune dysfunction pre-LT by quantification of monocytic HLA-DR
      expression and monitoring of its post-LT kinetics may be relevant for assessing
      post-transplant immune status and adapting immunosuppressive therapy. A descriptive,
      observational study associating clinical and biological data is needed to confirm the
      relevance of HLA-DR expression quantification on the surface of monocytes in a population of
      selected patients, before and after LT. These data will allow setting up a prospective
      interventional study reporting the possible benefit of post-transplant immunosuppressive
      treatment modulation, according to the HLA-DR monocyte dosage and its kinetics evolution.

      The main objective of this study is to describe the association between evolution of
      monocytic HLA-DR expression on monocytes/macrophages surface during the first month after LT
      and the occurrence of one of the 2 following clinical events reflecting a post LT immune
      dysfunction (acute cell rejection and sepsis).

    <description>Primary outcome will be the kinetics of HLA-DR expression on the monocytes / macrophages surface during the first month after LT as a function of pre-LT status (Nadir, normalization delay of HLA-DR expression) and its association with 2 clinical events reflecting post-LT immune dysfunction (acute cell rejection and sepsis).
Expression of HLA-DR is measured by the number of receptors expressed by monocytes and measured by flow cytometry at different times: at inclusion (D0), the day of LT and twice a week for 1 month in post LT.</description>
