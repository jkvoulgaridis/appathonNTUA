  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of modified FOLFIRINOX followed by
      stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in patients with borderline resectable pancreatic
      cancer (BRPC) and locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC). The primary hypothesis will be
      to determine if modified FOLFIRINOX followed by SBRT improves progression free survival (PFS)
      compared to historical controls treated with gemcitabine-based chemotherapy with or without
      standard fractionated radiation.

      The Primary and Secondary are listed below.

      Primary Objective:

      - To evaluate progression free survival after modified FOLFIRINOX and SBRT in borderline
      resectable and locally advanced pancreatic cancer.

      Secondary Objective:

        -  To evaluate the radiographic response to FOLFIRINOX and SBRT by comparing IV contrast CT
           scans before and after therapy.

        -  To determine rates of recurrence (local only, systemic only, and both local and
           systemic), and overall survival.

        -  To determine rates of grade 3 or greater gastrointestinal toxicity, including acute
           toxicities occurring within 3 months of treatment, and late toxicities occurring over 3
           months after completion of radiation.
