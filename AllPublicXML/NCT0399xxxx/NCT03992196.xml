    <measure>Changes from Baseline in International Restless Legs Rating Scale (IRLS) sum score at Visit 9</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to Visit 9 (up to 13 Months)</time_frame>
    <description>The sum score ranges from 0 (no RLS symptoms present) to 40 (maximum severity in all symptoms), which is the maximum score. A score between 31 and 40, indicates very severe RLS. A score between 21 and 30 indicates severe RLS. A score between 11 and 20 indicates moderate RLS. A score between 1 and 10 indicates mild RLS and a score of 0 means no RLS.</description>

    <time_frame>From Baseline to Visit 9 (up to 13 Months)</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Global Impressions Item 1 (Severity of Illness) score ranges from 0 to 7 as follows: 0=not assessed, 1=normal, not ill at all, 2=borderline ill, 3=mildly ill, 4=moderately ill, 5=markedly ill, 6=severely ill, 7=among the most extremely ill. The CGI Item 1 is to be completed during an interview between the subject and the investigator or designee.</description>

    <measure>Changes from Baseline in Restless Legs-6 Rating Scales (RLS-6) at Visit 9</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to Visit 9 (up to 13 Months)</time_frame>
    <description>The RLS-6 Rating Scales is designed to assess the severity of RLS and consists of 6 subscales. The subscales assess severity of symptoms at the following times of the day/evening: falling asleep, during the night, during the day at rest, and during the day when engaged in daytime activities. In addition, the subscales assess satisfaction with sleep and severity of daytime tiredness/sleepiness. Scores for each of the 6 subscales range from 0 (completely satisfied) to 10 (completely dissatisfied).</description>

    <description>Subjects will be initiated on 1 mg/24 h rotigotine and up-titrated to a maximum of 3 mg/24 h rotigotine, with the aim of achieving the individually optimized dosage. Dose adjustment of rotigotine is allowed at any time during the following Maintenance Period up to a maximum dose of 3 mg/24 h. At the end of the Maintenance Period, subjects will be down-titrated.</description>

    <ipd_description>Data from this study may be requested by qualified researchers six months after product approval in the US and/or Europe, or global development is discontinued, and 18 months after trial completion. Investigators may request access to anonymized IPD and redacted study documents which may include: raw datasets, analysis-ready datasets, study protocol, blank case report form, annotated case report form, statistical analysis plan, dataset specifications, and clinical study report. Prior to use of the data, proposals need to be approved by an independent review panel at www.clinicalstudydatarequest.com and a signed data sharing agreement will need to be executed. All documents are available in English only, for a pre-specified time, typically 12 months, on a password protected portal. This plan may change if a determination is made that the data cannot be adequately anonymized.</ipd_description>
