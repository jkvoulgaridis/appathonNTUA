  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of Chronic Post-Surgical Pain (CPSP) after knee replacement, defined as pain
      greater than or equal to 4/10 on the visual analogue scale after the third postoperative
      month, is recognised as high, with an average of 20% (extremes of 7 to 45%).

      These CPSP, when present, cause poor long-term joint functional prognosis and impaired
      quality of life for patients. Many predictive, pre-, per- and post-operative factors of these
      CPSP have been identified in recent years. The most common postoperative risk factor found in
      the literature is the intensity of early pain.

      The treatment protocols for this early post-surgical pain are currently and mainly multimodal
      in nature, combining systemic analgesics (paracetamol, NSAIDs, morphine, gabapentins) and
      local anaesthetics, administered either in the form of peripheral nerve blocks (continuous or
      single injection) or in the form of tissue infiltration (TI) performed by the surgeon during
      the operation.

      Very few of these techniques have been evaluated for their ability to reduce the incidence of
      CPSP. Drugs with antihyperalgesic properties such as ketamine or nefopam have been shown to
      be of no interest, except to reduce the proportion of pain of a neuropathic nature. Only the
      continuous femoral block has shown, to date, an interest in IT to reduce the incidence of
      these CPSP.

      The main objective of this study is to show that a multimodal analgesia protocol based on
      continuous locoregional analgesia by femoral triangle catheterization could reduce the
      incidence of chronic post surgical pain compared to a protocol based on tissue infiltration.
