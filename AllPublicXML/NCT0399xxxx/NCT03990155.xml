  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Around 20% of the patients requiring hospitalization for Acute Exacerbation of Chronic
      Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (AECOPD) develop hypercapnia, which is associated with an
      increased risk of death. Once Non Invasive Ventilation (NIV) has been initiated, a reduction
      in Respiratory Rate (RR) and improvement in pH within 4 h predicts NIV success. If pH &lt;7.25
      and RR &gt;35 breath per minutes persist, NIV failure is likely. Worsening acidosis, after
      initial improvement with NIV, is also associated with a worse prognosis. In addition, it has
      been shown that delaying intubation in patients at high risk for NIV failure has a negative
      impact on patient survival. Hence, assessing the risk of NIV failure is extremely important.
      NIV has some limitations: a) intolerance, discomfort and claustrophobia requiring frequent
      interruptions; b) poor patient-ventilator synchrony, especially in presence of air leaks or
      high ventilatory requirements. Since removing carbon dioxide by means of an artificial lung
      reduces the minute ventilation required to maintain an acceptable arterial partial pressure
      of carbon dioxide (PaCO2), the investigators hypothesize that applying Extra-Corporeal CO2
      Removal (ECCO2R) in high-risk AECOPD patients may reduce the incidence of NIV failure and
      improve patient-ventilator interaction. After the beginning of ECCO2R, NIV could be gradually
      replaced by High Flow Nasal Cannula Oxygen Therapy (HFNCOT), potentially reducing the risk of
      ventilator induced lung injury, improving patient's comfort and probably allowing the
      adoption of a more physiologically &quot;noisy&quot; pattern of spontaneous breathing.
