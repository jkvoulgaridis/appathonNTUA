        The source population for our study consists of individuals with type 2 diabetes, who are
        are defined in our study as individuals who live in Denmark and have ever used oral
        antihyperglycemic drugs or insulin.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        The empagliflozin-exposed population must also meet the following criteria:

          -  Have at least one prescription for empagliflozin or fixed-dose combination of
             empagliflozin with another drug, with or without treatment with another
             glucose-lowering drug

          -  Have no prior prescription/dispensing of SGLT2 inhibitors (including empagliflozin)
             alone or in fixed-dose combination during the 12 months prior to the index date

          -  Have no prior prescription/dispensing of a GLP-1 receptor agonist alone or in
             fixeddose combination during the 12 months prior to the index date

        The population exposed to liraglutide must meet the following criteria:

          -  Have at least one prescription for liraglutide or a fixed-dose combination of
             liraglutide with another drug, with or without treatment with another glucose-lowering
             drug.

          -  Have no prior prescription/dispensing of a GLP-1 receptor agonist alone or in
             fixeddose combination during the 12 months prior to the index date

          -  Have no prior prescription/dispensing of SGLT2 inhibitors (including empagliflozin)
             alone or in fixed-dose combination during the 12 months prior to the index date

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients with type 1 diabetes T1D before the index date will not be included in the study.

        Exclusion criteria by outcome of interest: Different exclusion criteria will be applied to
        generate sets of cohorts for the analysis of the different outcomes of interest.

        In one main analysis, we will assess co-primary and secondary outcomes among all patients,
        regardless of a history of previous outcome events being present or not. In other words, we
        will allow a previous history of CVD events. We will adjust for the history of these events
        in the regression model rather than excluding patients with previous events (e.g. assess
        outcome rates of myocardial infarction in empagliflozine and liraglutide initiators while
        adjusting for previous history of myocardial infarction, unstable angina, or coronary
        revascularization).

        In another main analysis of outcomes, we will exclude patients who had a specific outcome
        previously.

        For example in the analysis of the primary heart failure outcome (heart failure admission
        or loop-diuretics), patients will not be included if a diagnosis of heart failure is
        recorded any time before or at the index date, or if a prescription for loop-diuretics has
        been filled within 12 months before or at the index date. For the secondary outcome of
        acute hospital admission with heart failure, we will include also patients with previous
        prescription for loop-diuretics, but exclude those with previous heart failure admission.

        For analysis of stroke, patients will not be included if a diagnosis of stroke is recorded
        any time before or at the index date.

        For analysis of myocardial infarction, unstable angina, or coronary revascularization,
        patients will not be included if any of these 3 major atherosclerotic cardiovascular events
        are recorded any time before or at the index date.

        In additional analyses, other criteria will apply (To be discussed, RWT). Thus, an
        additional analysis will include also patients with previous outcome events, and adjust for
        the history of these events in the regression model rather than excluding them (e.g. assess
        outcome rates of myocardial infarction in empagliflozine and liraglutide initiators while
        adjusting for previous history of myocardial infarction, unstable angina, or coronary
        revascularization).
