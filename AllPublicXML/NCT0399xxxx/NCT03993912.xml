  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, randomized (study drug assigned by chance), open-label (participants and
      researchers are aware about the treatment, participants are receiving), active-controlled
      (study in which the experimental treatment or procedure is compared to a standard treatment
      or procedure), parallel-group (each group of participants will be treated at the same time),
      and multicenter (when more than one hospital team work on a medical research study) study in
      participants with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (a blood cancer of plasma cells) and who
      are not candidates for high dose chemotherapy (treatment of disease, usually cancer, by
      chemical agents) and autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT). The primary hypothesis of this
      study is that subcutaneous Daratumumab in combination with Lenalidomide will prolong
      progression-free survival and likely induce less toxicity as compared with Lenalidomide and
      dexamethasone, in elderly frail subjects with newly diagnosed Multiple myeloma who are
      ineligible for high dose chemotherapy and ASCT
