  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A 2x2 randomized crossover of single dose malarone at rest and during moderate intensity
      exercise under controlled conditions of heat and humidity in healthy adult participants.
      Statistical analysis of AUC and Cmax will be performed to determine pharmacokinetic changes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A clinical trial under controlled heat exposure and moderate intensity exercise, determined
      by VO2max testing and calibration, to determine if physiologic changes during heat exposure
      and exercise change the pharmacokinetics of malarone to a degree that falls outside the range
      of that which is considered bioequivalent or 80-125% concentration using AUC and Cmax for
      rate and extent of exposure. Participants will be randomized to order of rest and exercise
      components. Single dose malarone will be used during both arms. Single dose malarone
      pharmacokinetics will give insight into risk of toxicity or risk of under treatment during
      prophylaxis administration.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Healthy adult female and male ages 18-44 weighing greater than 40kg with BMI less than 30.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        17 years old or younger, 45 years old or older, unable to speak and read English, unable to
        perform exercise tests safely, and/or unable to consent to participate. Unwilling to
        undergo blood draws. Have known allergy to sunflower butter or are unwilling or unable to
        consume 2 tbsp or have an allergy to any component of malarone. Also non abstinent females
        at risk of becoming pregnant or in a heterosexual sexual relationships must be willing to
        use there chosen and available form of contraception defined as barrier protection,
        implantable device or hormones, or oral contraceptive pills during time of study up to 2
        months after or abstinence unless previously sterile with tubal ligation 1 year or greater
        prior to screening or hysterectomy.

        Those with any of the following conditions will also be excluded from the study: history of
        any of the following: rhabdomyolysis or heat stroke, heart disease, pulmonary disease,
        chronic kidney disease, single kidney, chronic hepatitis, diabetes, seizure disorders,
        multiple sclerosis, COPD, asthma, sickle cell trait or disease, thalassemia, thyroid
        disease, cancer, chronic infections such as history of HIV, HEP B or HEP C, or
        rheumatologic disorder; current pregnancy or lactation, systolic blood pressure over 140 mm
        Hg or diastolic pressure over 90 mm Hg; anemia (hematocrit lower than 36% for women and 38%
        for men and hemoglobin below 11g/dL for women and 12g/dL for men); diabetes (blood glucose
        above 110 mg/dL); use of any medications for chronic medical conditions (such as
        glucose-lowering drugs, prednisone, or beta blockers); or any condition that leads to
        inability to run safely on a treadmill. Non systemic drugs for skin condition or seasonal
        allergies will not be a disqualifier. Any volunteers identified during the cardiac risk
        assessment as above low risk will also be excluded from the study. The ACSM guidelines for
        exclusion criteria identify low-risk individuals as younger than 45, without history of
        CVD, and with no more than one risk factor according to the ACSM Risk Stratification
        Questionnaire for stratification. Risk factors include family history of heart disease,
        smoking status, hypertension with a blood pressure above 140/90, hypercholesterolemia with
        cholesterol over 200 mg/dL, fasting glucose over 110 mg/dL, obesity with a percent body fat
        &gt;25% for men or &gt; 30% for women, and (be consistent throughout including ICD) sedentary
        lifestyle. The monitoring physician can also exclude a volunteer based on his or her
        medical opinion given the results of a physical exam and/or EKG results.

        Initial screening for history will be performed by phone interview with requested waived
        consent. Those not able to achieve 80% pass on ICD test in 2 tries or less.
