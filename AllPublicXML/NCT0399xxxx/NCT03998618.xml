  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial tests telephone-based Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), a type of
      psychotherapy, to reduce fatigue interference with activities, mood, and cognition in
      metastatic breast cancer (MBC) cancer patients. ACT includes mindfulness exercises (e.g.,
      meditations, performing activities with greater awareness), identifying personal values
      (e.g., family, work), and engaging in activities consistent with these values. A total of 250
      patients will be randomly assigned in equal numbers to either the ACT intervention or an
      education/support condition. Patients in both conditions will participate in six weekly
      50-minute telephone sessions. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 2 weeks
      post-intervention, and 3 and 6 months post-intervention. The investigators hypothesize that
      ACT will lead to improved primary and secondary outcomes as compared to education/support. A
      demonstration of ACT's efficacy will lead to dissemination of the intervention and ultimately
      fulfill an unmet need in the comprehensive care of MBC patients.

      This trial tests the effect of telephone-based Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) on
      fatigue interference in metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients (Aim 1) as well as secondary
      outcomes (Aim 2). This trial also examines increases in psychological flexibility as a
      hypothesized mediator of ACT's effect on fatigue interference (Aim 3). Finally, two core
      aspects of psychological flexibility (i.e., mindfulness/acceptance and commitment/behavior
      change processes) are examined as exploratory mediators of ACT's effect on fatigue
      interference. The study team will recruit MBC patients receiving care through Eskenazi Health
      or Indiana University (IU) Health. Potentially eligible patients will be mailed an
      introductory letter signed by their oncologist and the PI along with a consent form. The
      letter will have a number to call if they do not wish to be contacted further. A research
      assistant (RA) will call all prospective participants who do not opt out approximately 1 to 2
      weeks after the letter is mailed. The RA will describe the study as outlined in the consent
      form and answer any questions. Then the RA will administer an eligibility screening to those
      who consent to participate. Eligible and consenting patients will complete a 35-minute
      baseline phone assessment. Following baseline assessments, MBC patients (N = 250) will be
      randomly assigned in equal numbers to ACT or education/support using a stratified block
      randomization scheme to balance the groups by age (&lt;65 yrs. vs. 65+ yrs.) and performance
      status (patient-reported Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] scores 0 or 1 vs. 2).
      Patients in both study conditions will complete six weekly 50-minute telephone sessions with
      the first session occurring one week after baseline. For ACT participants, adherence to home
      practice during the past week will be assessed and recorded during each session. Blind
      interviewers will assess outcomes and potential mediators during 30-minute follow-up phone
      assessments at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months post-intervention.

    <time_frame>2 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Seven items are rated on 11-point scales (0=no interference to 10=extreme interference) that assess the extent to which fatigue in the past week interfered with general level of activity, ability to bathe and dress, normal work activity (including housework), ability to concentrate, relations with others, enjoyment of life, and mood. Higher scores indicate greater fatigue interference.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>PROMIS Sleep-related Impairment</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>This 8-item measure assesses the perceived interference of sleep problems with activities, mood, and cognition (e.g., difficulty concentrating or completing tasks). Each item is rated on a scale from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very much) with higher scores indicating greater sleep-related impairment.</description>

    <measure>PROMIS Ability to Participate in Social Roles and Activities</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>This 6-item measure assesses participants' ability to participate in social roles and activities. The items measure difficulty engaging in social and recreational activities as well as usual work (including housework). Each item is rated on a scale from 1 (never) to 5 (always) and is reverse coded such that a higher score indicates greater ability to participate in activities.</description>

    <measure>Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General</measure>

    <description>This 27-item quality of life measure consists of four subscales: Physical Well-Being, Social/Family Well-Being, Emotional Well-Being, and Functional Well-Being. Each item is rated on a scale from 0 = not at all to 4 = very much. An overall score is computed to represent general quality of life, with higher scores indicating better quality of life.</description>

    <description>Across six weekly 50-minute sessions, patients in the education/support condition will discuss their concerns, including symptoms and other cancer-related stressors, with a therapist providing psychological support. The therapist will direct patients to resources for practical and health information and contact information for psychosocial services. Sessions will include an orientation to the patient's medical center, education regarding common cancer-related symptoms and quality-of-life concerns, and an overview of resources for addressing these concerns. The therapist will also describe resources for addressing financial concerns and methods of evaluating health information available via the Internet and other modalities. Participants will receive handouts on session topics and will be asked to review them as homework.</description>
