  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Iron deficiency is one of the most common nutritional problems observed in patients with
      obesity and after bariatric surgery. From a therapeutic point of view, iron deficiency can
      lead to iron deficiency anemia. Iron supplementation carries the risk of exacerbating
      infections, altering the gut microbiome and iron overload. Therefore, it would be beneficial
      to use iron supplementation only in truly iron deficient patients. To date, different studies
      have observed that hepcidin could be a possible indicator of iron status and absorption in
      different patient populations. Furthermore, it could be used to distinguish anemia due to
      iron deficiency from inflammation and globin disorder related anemia. How hepcidin
      concentrations variate in patients with obesity and after bariatric surgery remains unsure.

      During the visit in the obesity clinic, eligible patients will be approached for
      participation by the sub-investigator. Interested patients will receive information regarding
      the study and receive the information sheet containing the informed consent form. After
      signing the informed consent form, general information will be collected regarding medical
      and demographic data using a short questionnaire. Additional questionnaires regarding
      demographics and menstrual cycle will be collected. Anthropometric measurements will be
      collected for the determination of the length, weight, hip circumference, waist circumference
      and body composition. Finally, blood samples will be collected for the determination of iron
      and inflammation related markers.
