      This is a first-in-human, open-label, multi-centre, phase I/IIa study to characterize the
      safety and clinical activity of ATL001, autologous clonal neoantigen reactive T cells (cNeT)
      administered intravenously in adults with metastatic or recurrent melanoma.

      This is a first-in-human, open-label, multi-centre, phase I/IIa study to characterize the
      safety and clinical activity autologous clonal neoantigen reactive T cells (cNeT)
      administered intravenously in adults with metastatic or recurrent melanoma.

      Patients will be screened for eligibility and consented to the study. Following donation and
      subsequent manufacture of ATL001, the product will be given back to eligible patients
      following lymphodepletion. Patients will be followed up for a period of 24 months post ATL001
      infusion. After 2 years each patient will continue to be followed for a further 5 years as
      part of separate Long Term Follow-Up protocol.
