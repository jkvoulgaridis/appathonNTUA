    <textblock>
      This study divide patients into two groups, one will be given lidocaine; another group was
      given placebo . to observe two groups of patients blood pressure, body movement, and propofol
      dosage , and the difference in operator satisfaction, and how many people need to give
      fentanyl again; and two groups of patients after the operation of the reaction, if there are
      dizziness, nausea, and other adverse reactions; finally, the differences of these two schemes
      in different populations were analyzed, and the rationalization and individualized medication
      will be put forward.
