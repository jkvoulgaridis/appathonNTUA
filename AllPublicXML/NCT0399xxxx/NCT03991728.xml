  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective data will be collected in approximately 200 patients treated with an TMJ
      replacement. Patients will be followed up according to the standard (routine) for up to 5
      years after the treatment. Data collection will include underlying disease, treatment
      details, functional and patient reported outcomes (PRO)s and anticipated or procedure-related
      adverse events (i.e. complications).

      This registry is designed to be able to assess the number of patients who refuse alloplastic
      total TMJ replacement. Therefore, the participating sites are asked to register all cases of
      refused TMJ replacements too.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      More in detail this registry has the following objectives:

        -  To describe clinical indications for TMJ replacement, and treatment patterns (including
           differences among regions if feasible)

        -  To describe the clinical evolution and outcomes of patients treated with a TMJ
           replacement

        -  To explore the relationship(s) between treatment, outcome(s) and quality of life (QoL).

        -  To identify predictive factors for favorable outcomes (pain reduction, range of motion
           (ROM), occlusal status, QoL) in patients treated with TMJ replacement.

        -  To describe the reasons of patients who refused TMJ replacements

    <description>Concomitant diseases will be assessed using the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). This score assesses the comorbidity level by considering both the number and severity of pre-defined comorbid conditions.

    <description>The dysfunction of the mandible will be evaluated by means of the Helkimo index. The Helkimo index is based on the assessment of five different symptoms.</description>

    <time_frame>from the pre-operative assessment until 60 months after surgery (10 days / 3 months / 6 months / 12 months / 24 months / 60 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The Pain NRS is an 11-point scale where the end points are the extremes of no pain (0 points), to worst imaginable pain (10 points). It measures subjective intensity of pain and the patient rates his/her overall or average daily pain.
Will be assessed independently for each site.</description>

    <description>The jaw function NRS is an 11-point scale where the end points are the extremes of normal jaw movement (0 points), to no jaw movement (10 points). It measures subjective jaw function.</description>

    <measure>Patient Reported Outcomes - EuroQoL five dimension (EQ-5D-5L)</measure>
    <time_frame>from the pre-operative assessment until 60 months after surgery (10 days / 3 months / 6 months / 12 months / 24 months / 60 months</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L descriptive system comprises the following five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results into a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Reported Outcomes - Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP) - 14</measure>
    <time_frame>from the pre-operative assessment until 60 months after surgery (10 days / 3 months / 6 months / 12 months / 24 months / 60 months</time_frame>
    <description>The OHIP is concerned with impairment and three functional status dimensions (social, psychological and physical) which represent four of the seven quality of life dimensions proposed by Patrick and Bergner. Hence, it excludes perceptions of satisfaction with oral health, changes in oral health, prognosis or self-reported diagnoses. Furthermore, the OHIP aims to capture impacts that are related to oral conditions in general, rather than impacts that may be attributed to specific oral disorders or syndromes. All impacts in the OHIP are conceptualized as adverse outcomes, and therefore the instrument does not measure any positive aspects of oral health. The OHIP consists of 14 items evaluated using a 5-point Likert from &quot;Never&quot; to &quot;Very often &quot; in which higher scores indicated worse outcomes. It has validated translations to Swedish, Spanish, German, Hindi and further more.</description>

    <measure>Anticipated treatment or condition-related adverse events (i.e. complications)</measure>
    <time_frame>from the pre-operative assessment until 60 months after surgery (10 days / 3 months / 6 months / 12 months / 24 months / 60 months)</time_frame>
    <description>In this registry, only anticipated condition, treatment-, or implant-related adverse events (i.e. complications) will be documented in the electronic case report form (eCRF) from the time of consent onwards.
In the context of the registry, these events are considered as events of scientific interest, i.e. events that can clearly be connected to the treatment(s) or the medical condition under investigation. These events do not require immediate reporting unless they occur at a higher frequency and/or severity to that cited in the literature</description>

    <measure>Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>10 days / 3 months / 6 months / 12 months / 24 months / 60 months</time_frame>
    <description>Follow up (FU) visits will be scheduled and performed according to the local standard of care and at each scheduled visit the patient's survival will be documented. In case a patient misses a scheduled visit, it will be assessed if the patient is still alive, which can be done via phone call.</description>
