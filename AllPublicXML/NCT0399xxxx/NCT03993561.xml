  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to establish the highest level of evidence to evaluate treatment
      summary and survivorship care plans (TSSPs) by piloting the TSSPs on patients with HNC.

      Hypothesis: HNC patients who receive the intervention of the TSSP will have an increased rate
      of implementation of recommendations for their needs, greater adherence with follow-up
      schedules, improved quality of life and improved satisfaction with post-treatment care.

      Aim 1 (Validation of TSSP): To validate a treatment summary and survivorship care plan (TSSP)
      intervention specifically tailored to the needs of HNC patients based on the best available
      evidence.

      Approach: In the first phase of the project the investigators will pilot the London Heath
      Sciences Centre TSSP with head and neck cancer survivors and then have the TSSP extensively
      reviewed and modified by our multidisciplinary head and neck oncology treatment team.

      Aim 2 (Evaluation of TSSP): To evaluate the implementation of a TSSP in survivors of head and
      neck cancer compared to usual treatment in a randomized fashion to determine whether TSSPs
      result in improved implementation of recommendations for HNC survivors and improved quality
      of life and satisfaction.

      Approach: In the second phase of the project the investigators will conduct a randomized
      controlled trial to compare patient reported outcomes in HNC patients who have received the
      TSSP to patients who have not received the TSSP.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Validation of TSSP: The investigators have performed an extensive literature review to create
      a comprehensive draft TSSP specifically tailored for HNC patients. The investigators will
      pilot this study among 20 head and neck cancer survivors. Once the investigators have the
      feedback from the pilot patients, the investigators will conduct a focus group with the
      members of our head and neck multidisciplinary group to gain input on the TSSP.

      Evaluation of TSSP: The investigators will recruit head and neck cancer survivors with
      curable stage I-IVA head and neck mucosal cancer at a tertiary level cancer center in
      Ontario. Patients will receive a survivorship care plan (TSSPs) intervention. The
      intervention will consist of a survivorship care nurse or radiation therapist counseling
      session coupled with the provision of individualized TSSPs to patients and their health care
      providers. After a baseline telephone or in-person interview, eligible participants will be
      provide with the TSSP.

      The primary outcome will be physician implementation of TSSP care recommendations over the
      course of 12 months, assessed by quarterly patient interviews. Secondary outcomes will
      include adherence to recommended follow-up schedules, quality of life using validated
      measures and patient satisfaction with care.

    <time_frame>baseline and 12 months post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>8-item questionnaire measuring patient level of satisfaction with follow-up care since head and neck cancer treatment ended; 4 questions are ranked using a 6-point Likert scale (1 = Never and 6 = Always), 1 item uses a 5-point likert scale (1 = Definitely yes; 5 = Definitely not); 2 items use a scale of 0-10 (0 = not at all satisfied and 10 = very satisfied); and one item utilized a Yes or No response format. Total scores range from 5 to 50;</description>
