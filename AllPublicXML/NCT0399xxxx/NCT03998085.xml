  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on the need of clinical practice of maintenance therapy for advanced NSCLC and the
      reliable data of third-line treatment for non-small cell lung cancer, the investigators
      designed a clinical study of anlotinib in maintenance therapy for advanced NSCLC to
      prospectively evaluate the efficacy of anlotinib in maintenance therapy for advanced NSCLC.
      Value, to provide a scientific basis for prolonging the survival time of patients with
      advanced NSCLC, improving the quality of life of patients in the course of treatment, and
      optimizing treatment strategies to a greater extent.
