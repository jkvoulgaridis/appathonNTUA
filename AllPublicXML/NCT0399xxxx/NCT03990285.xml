  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with histologically proven glioblastoma (GBM) who are suspected to have progression
      and are candidates for a surgical resection according to standard of care may be eligible for
      this study. Subjects may participate in this study if they are at least 18 years of age.

      Positron emission tomography (PET/CT) imaging will be used to evaluate fluciclovine uptake at
      sites of suspected progression before planned surgery. In addition, clinical brain MRI with
      and without contrast will be used to evaluate the tumor pre-operatively. This is a
      non-therapeutic trial in that imaging will not be used to direct treatment decisions.

      Investigators anticipate enrolling up to 30 subjects who will undergo a clinical brain MRI
      examination with and without contrast and a research 18F-Fluciclovine PET/CT scan of the
      brain prior to surgery. They will also have a blood draw preoperatively to collect samples
      for cfDNA analysis. PET/CT imaging sessions will include an injection of approximately 5 mCi
      (range for most studies is anticipated to be 5 mCi +/- 20%) of 18F-Fluciclovine.

      This is a pilot study in subjects with a histologically proven diagnosis of glioblastoma (GB)
      who have completed chemoradiation and now have new contrast enhancing lesions or lesions
      showing increased enhancement ( 25% increase) who are recommended for a clinical surgical
      resection. Subjects may participate in this study if they are at least 18 years of age, most
      participants will be receiving care at the clinical practices of the University of
      Pennsylvania. Subjects who come to the University of Pennsylvania for diagnosis and/or
      treatment of GB and who meet the study inclusion criteria may be approached by study
      personnel for recruitment into this study. Subjects will be approached about study
      participation regardless of race or ethnic background. Investigators anticipate enrolling up
      to 30 participants. Subjects who consent but do not complete the study imaging will be
      considered not evaluable and will be replaced. Accrual will likely occur over approximately
      1-2 years. After undergoing screening assessments and verifying eligibility for study
      participation subjects will undergo a research 18FFluciclovine PET/CT scan of the brain and a
      clinical brain MRI with and without gadolinium contrast, all baseline imaging will be done
      prior to (within 1 week) of the surgical procedure. The PET-CT and MRI can be performed in
      any order.

    <description>Axumin is a positron emitting radiopharmaceutical that has been studied in vivo in humans in a number of tumor types with positron emission tomography (PET/CT). 18F-Fluciclovine is a fluorine-18 labeled synthetic amino acid analog that is FDA approved as a PET imaging agent for prostate cancer recurrence, however, it has also been tested in other tumors. Investigators will use a typical dose of 18F-fluciclovine that is used for clinical studies in glioblastoma. This will be 5 mCi (approximate range for most studies is anticipated to be 5 mCi +/- 20%), but a lesser dose may be injected if, in the opinion of a Nuclear Medicine Authorized User, complete imaging data could be generated.</description>
