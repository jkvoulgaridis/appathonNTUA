  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, observational study designed to evaluate the long-term safety of
      RGX-314. Eligible participants are those who were previously enrolled in a clinical study in
      which they received a single subretinal administration of RGX-314. Enrollment of each
      participant in the current study should occur after the participant has completed either the
      end of study or early termination visit in the previous (parent) clinical study. Participants
      will be followed for up to 5 years post-RGX-314 administration (inclusive of the parent
      study). After enrollment and a 6-month follow-up visit, participants will attend at least
      annual study visits through the end of the 5-year post-RGX-314 administration follow-up
      period. The timing for all visits is based on the date the participant completes or
      discontinues participation in the parent study.
