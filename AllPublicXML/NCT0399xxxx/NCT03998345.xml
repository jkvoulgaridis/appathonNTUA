    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human (FIH), open-label, phase 1 dose-escalation study of 609A in China, a
      recombinant monoclonal anti-PD-1 antibody product, in subjects with Locally
      advanced/Metastatic Solid Tumors, who must have failed standard treatment (disease
      progression or intolerance) or lack of standard treatment. If there is a driver gene variant,
      the subjects must have failed the standard treatment for the driver gene, and there is no
      other standard treatment.
