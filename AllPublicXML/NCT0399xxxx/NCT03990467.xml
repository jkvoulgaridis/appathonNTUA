  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pharmacokinetics of antimicrobials is profoundly modified in Intensive care unit (ICU)
      patients. To adapt the treatment, it is recommended to measure blood levels of antibiotics.
      Some antibiotics, such as amikacin, are easy to monitor, while for other molecules, such as
      piperacillin/tazobactam, the drug monitoring is more difficult to obtain. These two molecules
      have similar physicochemical characteristics (hydrophilicity) and therefore have closed
      pharmacokinetic properties. OPTIMA is a study aiming at criteria will be used to judge
      whether the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of amikacin are predictive of those of
      piperacillin and tazobactam.
