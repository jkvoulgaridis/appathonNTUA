  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is evidence that a folate deficiency - and as the biological consequence of the latter
      - higher homocysteine plasma levels are associated with an increased risk of vascular
      associated diseases. For the eye, it has been shown that higher intake of folate reduces the
      risk of vascular related diseases such as age related macular degeneration. Further studies
      suggest that decreased serum levels of folate and vitamin B12 may be an independent risk
      factor for diabetic retinopathy. The reason for the association of low folate levels and the
      increased risk for vascular-associated ocular diseases is not entirely clear but may be at
      least partially related to an impairment of local blood flow regulation in these patients.

      Whether supplementation with folate may improve vascular regulation has not yet been
      sufficiently investigated. However, given that the potential effect size of a folate
      substitution on blood flow and systemic blood parameters is unclear, a proper statistical
      design for a large, controlled, randomized study is difficult. Thus, the present pilot study
      should (1) provide information about the homocysteine lowering potential of the formulation
      under study and (2) identify potential vascular related outcome parameters for further,
      larger, placebo-controlled studies and provide sufficient data to allow for a proper
      statistical planning for such a study.

      Consequently, the current study seeks to investigate the effect of a 3-month supplementation
      with folate on systemic homocysteine plasma levels. Further, ocular blood flow and
      endothelial function in the ocular microcirculation will be assessed. For this purpose, a
      group of 25 patients with diabetes mellitus will be included in the study. Outcome parameters
      will be assessed at baseline and after a 3-month supplementation with folate.
