  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are 2 phases in this study: Phase 1 (dose escalation) and Phase 2 (dose expansion).

      The goal of Phase 1 of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of
      HA121-28 tablets that can be given to patients with advanced cancer. The goal of Phase 2 of
      this study is to learn if the dose of HA121-28 tablets found in Phase 1 can help to control
      advanced cancer.

      The safety of HA121-28 tablets will be studied in both phases of the study.

      If participants are found to be eligible to take part in this study, they will be assigned to
      a study group based on when they join this study. Up to 8 groups of up to 20 participants
      will be enrolled in Phase 1 of the study, and up to 3 groups of up to 24 participants will be
      enrolled in Phase 2.

      If participant is enrolled in Phase 1, the dose of HA121-28 tablets they receive will depend
      on when they join this study. The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose
      level of HA121-28 tablets. Each new group will receive a higher dose of HA121-28 tablets than
      the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until the
      highest tolerable dose of HA121-28 tablets is found. If participant is enrolled in Phase 2,
      they will receive HA121-28 tablets at the low, medium and high doses to select the
      recommended dose for phase Ⅱ clinical trials.
