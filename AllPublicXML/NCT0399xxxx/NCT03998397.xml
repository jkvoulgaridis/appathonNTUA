  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many patients presenting in Emergency Department (ED) present alcohol acute intoxication.
      Some previous studies in general population found that young people under- or over-estimated
      of blood alcohol concentration (BAC). The hypothesis of the study is that self-estimation of
      BAC by the patient is under-estimated. Moreover, comparing self-estimation of BAC and
      objective measure of BAC, which is routinely performed in ED, could increase in patients the
      awareness of the disorders, increase motivation to change of the patient, and increase the
      rates of seeking-treatment six months after the first evaluation, in particular in patients
      with alcohol use disorders.

      To the investigators knowledge, there is no study investigating self-estimation, compared to
      objective measurement of blood alcohol concentration in patients with alcohol intoxication
      presenting to an Emergency Department (ED). The study will assess blood alcohol concentration
      and self-estimates of BAC, using the Subjective Effects of Alcohol Scale for Measuring
      Subjective Response to Alcohol in 100 patients with or without alcohol use disorders
      according to DSM-5 classification (using MINI scale and Alcohol Use Disorders Identification
      Test (AUDIT)
