  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to test whether an individualized carbohydrate intake based on
      weight and pre physical activity glucose level is more effective than usual camp care to
      improve glucose control in children and adolescents engaging in team sports (basketball,
      soccer, hockey) during a summer camp.

      At the enrollment interview, in addition to collecting patient's information (age, sex,
      diabetes duration, recent A1c, type of treatment, insulin doses body weight, concomitant
      diseases, diabetes complications and history of severe hypoglycemia), a continuous glucose
      monitoring system (FreeStyle Libre) will be installed by a nurse. At least, eight sports
      sessions per participant are planned for this study. In a randomized order, the
      individualized carbohydrate intake will be applied during at least 4 interventions sport
      sessions while at least 4 with matching types of sports will be used as control sessions. Two
      sport sessions are routinely scheduled at the camp each day; from 9h:30 to 10h:30 and from
      11h:00 to 12h:00. For intervention sessions that involve individualized carbohydrate intake,
      the FreeStyle Libre will be scanned 0-10 minutes before the start of the team sport.
      Carbohydrates will then be given in the amount of 0.5g/kg for glucose levels between 4.5 to
      7.0 mmol/L and 0.25g/kg for glucose levels between 7.1 to 10.0 mmol/L and none will be given
      if glucose levels are between 10.1 and 15.0 mmol/L. When glucose levels are below 4.5 mmol/L
      or above 15.0 mmol/L, the camp staff will take care of hypoglycemia/hyperglycemia treatment.
      During control sessions, as per camp routine care, there will be no measurement of glucose
      levels before the start of physical activity.
