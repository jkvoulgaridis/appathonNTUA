  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pilot study design that operationalizes the multimodal manner of care while evaluating
      changes in depression symptoms, dysmetria, and balance for medication non-responders. This
      research will provide an initial first step towards answering the following three research
      questions:

        1. Does a multimodal chiropractic applied clinical neuroscience approach to care affect
           self-reported symptoms of depression?

        2. Does a multimodal chiropractic applied clinical neuroscience approach to care affect
           dysmetria and balance control in a clinically depressed population?

        3. Are changes in dysmetria and balance control correlated with a change in depressive
           symptoms.

    <description>Limits of stability test: For the limits of stability test the participant will be asked to lean forward, backward, left, and right. The participant will lean slowly in each direction at a self-determined speed and to a point where he or she feels is the maximum leaning distance without falling. The tests should take about 2 minutes but will vary based on the participant.</description>

    <description>Chiropractic Applied Clinical Neuroscience makes use of chiropractic care in addition to application of therapies designed to stimulate multisensory reintegration and cerebellar coordination. The multisensory reintegration and cerebellar therapies make use of the body's own sensory receptors as a target, with the purpose of realigning the brain's interpretation of different afferent signals. Observation of motor and autonomic output patterns during and after sensory stimulation afford the clinician real-time feedback, providing for adaptation of the sensory based protocol.</description>
