    <textblock>
      Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a term that defines a chronic disease characterized by
      inflammation of the intestine. It includes ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD).
      The objective of the study was to administer a treatment based on a group adaptation of the
      BMGIM in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and assess its impact on state of
      mind, quality of life, anxiety, depression, immunocompetence as a marker of well-being, and
      levels of acute and chronic stress.

      To achieve the objectives a quasi-experimental, quantitative, qualitative, analytical, and
      prospective study was performed. 41 patients with IBD divided into a test group (24
      patients), who received 8 sessions over 8 weeks, and a control group (17 patients). A saliva
      sample was taken from each patient before and after each session to determine cortisol levels
      (acute stress) and IgA (immunocompetence) using ELISA. A series of questionnaires were
      completed as follows: HADS (perceived anxiety), MOOD (state of mind), and CCVEII (quality of
      life). Similarly, a hair sample was taken before the first and after the last session to
      determine the cumulative cortisol level (chronic stress) using ELISA.

    <time_frame>Baseline up to 8 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>14 items. 7 items for Anxiety and 7 for Depression. The score for the items is evaluated on a Likert scale ranging from 0 to 3 points, where 0 represents never or almost never, 1 a little or from time to time, 2 somewhat less than before or not as intense, and 3 maximum or almost always. Lastly, it is worth mentioning that these scales are interpreted based on the sum of each dimension, with 21 as the maximum, both for depression and for anxiety. Higher values represent a worse outcome. Observing change comparing pre and post intervention</description>

    <measure>Change in the MOOD questionnaire (PRE and POST Measures).</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 8 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The scale evaluates the frequency of the different states of mind (happiness, anger, sadness, and fear) based on 20 items (4 dimensions of 5 items each). The responses for the items were measured using a 3-point Likert scale (1=never, 2=sometimes, 3=often). Each dimension range from 1 to 3. There is not a total of all dimensions together. a lower score corresponds to high level fo that mood (lower values= a betwer outcome on anger, sadness, and fear and worst outcome on hapiness).
