  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study was a 12 weeks, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled human trial. 46
      subjects were randomly divided into Hydrolysed Red Ginseng extract 10ml or placebo group. The
      investigators measured Ocular Surface Disease Index, tear break-up time, Visual analog scale,
      Schirmer's test, meibomian gland test and Fluorescein staining.

    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A questionnaire which is Ocular Surface Disease Index consisted of 12 questions each of which included visual symptoms, visual work status, and environmental factors.
The Ocular Surface Disease Index scores are ranged from 0 to 100, and the high score is the more severe the symptoms. The Ocular Surface Disease Index score is calculated as follows.
: (Sum of all items answered × 25) / total number of questions answered</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes of tear break-up time</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The tear break-up time test measures the time in seconds. The time is from the last blinking to the point of tear layer defect or streak-like defect after blinking the eye with 1% of fluorescein.
10 seconds or more as normal, between 5 and 10 seconds as mild dry eye syndrome, and 5 seconds or less as severe dry eye syndrome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes of Visual analog scale</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Visual Analog Scale(VAS) score is 0 point for no symptom, 10 points for the most severe symptom, and the patient is asked to mark the degree of subjective pain symptoms as an integer.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes of Schirmer's test</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Schirmer's test determines whether the eye produces enough tears to keep it moist. This test is used when a person experiences very dry eyes or excessive watering of the eyes. It poses no risk to the subject. A negative (more than 10 mm of moisture on the filter paper in 5 minutes) test result is normal. Both eyes normally secrete the same amount of tears.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes of meibomian gland test</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Meibomian gland test evaluate 8 Meibum of the upper middle eyelid or lower middle eyelid. The Meibum quality score and the Meibum expressibility score are evaluated as follows.
Meibum quality score 0 = clear fluid
= cloudy fluid
= cloudy particulate fluid(with debris)
= inspissated (opaque),like toothpaste
Meibum expressibility score 0 = all glands expressible
= three to four glands expressible
= one to two glands expressible
= no glands expressible</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes of Fluorescein staining</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Fluorescein staining was evaluated by staining with 1% fluorescein (1% sodium fluorescein 1 μL volume), and then assessed for damage after corneal and conjunctival staining. The degree of staining of the cornea is divided into 5 sections according to the NEI scale, and each section is judged as 0 ~ 3 scores. It is judgement the degree of severity from 0 to 15 scores per eye. The degree of conjunctival staining is divided into six sections per eye, and each section is scored 0 to 3 scores total 0 ~ 18 scores.</description>
