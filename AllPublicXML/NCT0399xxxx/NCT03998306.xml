      The purpose of this study is to determine if probiotic lozenges taken once a day before
      bedtime for twelve weeks can decrease the numbers of Streptococcus mutans

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Streptococcus salivarius is one of the commensal bacteria of the mouth and the main component
      of biofilm. Research indicates that some microorganisms present in plaque, which until
      recently were considered not to cause caries, including Streptococcus salivarius, present in
      the supragingival microbiome, can also cause tooth decay.

    <measure>Changing the amount of carcinogenic bacteria Streptococcus mutans in intervention group based on bacterial test counting number of Colony Forming Units</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>During control test saliva will be applied to the medium for identification and detailed quantification of Streptococcus mutans bacteria. After the incubation, the number of bacteria will be expressed - taking into account the degree of saliva dilution - as the number of colony-forming unit (CFU) in 1 ml of saliva. colony forming unit CFU in intervention and control groups. Bacterial tests will be used to assess this outcome measure. We expect decrement of amount of cariogenic bacteria in intervention group</description>
