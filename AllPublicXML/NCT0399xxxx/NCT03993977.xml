  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Need for perioperative blood transfusion is still high in certain types of oncological
      abdominal surgery. Allogeneic blood transfusion may be detrimental in cancer patients
      undergoing a potentially curative resection of malignant tumor, although the detailed
      mechanism of this effect is still under debate. We plan to evaluate whether a new, rotational
      thromboelastography-guided algorithm (ROTEM) to guide hemostatic resuscitation
      intra-operatively decreases the use of allogeneic blood products, the total amount of
      bleeding, transfusion related side effects, thromboembolic complications and costs. Its
      effect on each patient's post-operative hemostatic profile is also measured. 60 patients
      having a potentially curative pancreaticoduodenectomy (or resection of cauda of pancreas),
      total removal or partial resection of kidney and open radical cystectomy are recruited when
      an active blood loss of more than 1500 ml is estimated and/or measured and are randomized
      into two groups: one will be treated conventionally, ie. using massive transfusion protocol
      (MTP) if necessary, clinical judgement and conventional coagulation tests, the other treated
      using a ROTEM-based algorithm.

    <intervention_model_description>60 patients having a potentially curative abdomino-oncological surgery and reaching an active blood loss of more than 1500 ml are randomized into two groups. One will be treated conventionally, ie. using MTP if necessary, clinical judgement and conventional coagulation tests, the other treated using a ROTEM-based algorithm. Randomization (ratio 1:1 in blocks of 10) between the two groups will be done beforehand. Each paper containing the treatment protocol in question will be put into a closed envelope. The envelopes are numbered from 1 to 60 and are placed in a box in the operative department.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Participants do not know which group he/she is randomized into. They are under general anaesthesia, thus not knowing which protocol is used. When assessing outcomes, two groups are labeled only by number: the assessor does not know which arm is number 1 or 2 until whole data is analyzed.</masking_description>
