  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical exercise is an important tool to tackle the deleterious effect of aging. However,
      which is the best exercise intervention is still unknown. Moreover, many exercise
      interventions are complicated to implement, particularly in nursing homes. In contrast,
      walking is a simple, natural, and familiar mode of exercise that is well tolerated by older
      adults. Thus, the objective was to assess and compare the effects of an individualized
      multicomponent exercise program and an individualized and progressive walking intervention on
      LTNH residents´ physical and cognitive performance, habitual physical activity,
      psycho-affective status and quality of life.

      The objective was to assess and compare the effects of an individualized multicomponent
      exercise program and an individualized and progressive walking intervention on LTNH
      residents´ physical and cognitive performance, habitual physical activity, psycho-affective
      status and quality of life.

      Design: single-blind randomized controlled trial. 81 men and women were randomly assigned to
      a multicomponent (MG) or a walking (WG) group after baseline measurements. Participants in
      the MG underwent a twice a week individualised and progressive multicomponent exercise
      program composed of strength and balance exercises. The walking group was also individualised
      and walked progressively to up to 20 minutes per day for the 3-month intervention.

      The primary outcome was the score on the Short Physical Performance Battery (lower limb
      strength (time needed to perform five chair stands), static balance (standing with feet
      together, semi-tandem and tandem positions) and usual gait speed (4m), assessed at baseline
      and after the intervention. Secondary outcomes included other relevant physical performance
      tests (Senior Fitness Test, the Berg Balance Scale, handgrip strength, usual gait speed (4m)
      the instrumented Timed Up and Go test), habitual physical activity (using accelerometers
      during 7 days), cognitive performance (Montreal Cognitive Assessment test and the Rey
      Auditory Verbal Learning Test), psycho-affective status (Anxiety and Depression Goldberg
      Scale, and loneliness using the Jong Gierveld loneliness scale) and quality of life (the
      Quality of Life Alzheimer´s disease scale). Also frailty and the number of falls and deaths
      will be registered.

      Descriptive statistics were computed and baseline (between group differences) and time
      effects (within group differences) were checked using Student´s-t test (quantitative
      variables) or Chi square test (qualitative variables). Intervention effects between groups
      were assessed by 2-way analysis of variance for repeated measures (group by time
      interactions). Partial η2 and Cohen´s d was calculated. All the analysis performed under the
      intention-to-treat principle and significance was set at p &lt; 0.05.

    <description>The Short Physical Performance Battery test (SPPB). It assesses Lower extremity function: static balance, gait speed and getting in and out of a chair. The participant undertakes different tests: Side-by-side, semi-tandem and tandem stands (10 seconds); 4 meters walk test at comfortable speed and 5 quickly sit to stand from a chair without upper extremity assistance. The outcome is a score 0-12 points. A higher score means better performance

    <description>The multicomponent exercise program consisted of strength and balance exercises performed on two non-consecutive days per week and lasting approximately an hour per session. Strength exercises were mainly focused on lower limb strengthening. A gradual and progressive intensity starting at 40% 1-RM and up 70% 1-RM was used. As for balance exercises, the first weeks consisted of mainly less complex static balance exercises and progressed to more complex and dynamic balance exercises. These exercises included standing with their feet together, semi-tandem, tandem and one-legged stand positions and moving on to dynamic exercises (circuits, stepping and so on). Difficulty was increased by reducing arm and base support and by varying the type and complexity of exercises. An individualized progression was applied to each participant based on their progress throughout the intervention.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants assigned to the walking group walked with the research staff two days per week; additionally, they walked partially supervised by LTNH staff, family members or caregivers the rest of the week. Daily walking goals were set follows: walking between 5 to 10 minutes on the first month, up to 15 minutes on the second, and finally 20 minutes per day on the third month. The final goal was to get as close as possible to the recommendations of engaging in 150 minutes of aerobic exercise per week from the World Health Organization (WHO). Participants were asked to walk as fast as they could and rest was allowed whenever needed. Walking goals were achieved in one or multiple sessions, depending on each participant´s capacities. Those participants that met the walking goals without any rest were encouraged to walk at a faster pace.</description>

    <description>Strength exercises were focused on lower limb strengthening. Individual bilateral intensities were calculated to estimate one repetition maximum (1-RM) for the leg and arm. This test was performed on the 2nd and 7th weeks of the intervention. A gradual and progressive intensity starting at 40% 1-RM and up 70% 1-RM was used. No external loads were applied to the rest of the exercises due to their complex execution technique and subsequent risk of adverse events. In these cases, training progression was achieved through volume (number of repetitions) and execution velocity increments.
Balance exercises included standing with their feet together, semi-tandem, tandem and one-legged stand positions and moving on to dynamic exercises (circuits, stepping and so on). Difficulty was increased by reducing arm and base support and by varying the type and complexity of exercises. An individualized progression was applied to each participant based on their progress throughout the intervention.</description>

    <intervention_name>Walking intervention</intervention_name>
    <description>To comply with the walking goals, walking distance was calculated based on each participant´s performance on the 6-minute walking test and using a rule of thumb. Therefore, every participant had an itinerary to follow to comply with the minimum walking time each week. Distance rather than time was used with participants for practical reasons and the inability of most of them to measure time. Moreover, time and distance were individually adapted according to each participant´s performance on the previous week.
To ensure that participants complied with the walking goals, each of them (if they were cognitively able) was given a record sheet in which they had to write down their everyday walking routines. In addition, the caregivers were also informed about the walking routines and ensured that those participants who needed close supervision had someone to walk with and filled the sheet of those that were unable to do so.</description>
