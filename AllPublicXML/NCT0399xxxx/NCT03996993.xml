      This project seeks to use advanced imaging (specifically, positron emission
      tomography/computed tomography [PET/CT]) to detect, locate, and characterize recurrent
      disease in the setting of patients with prostate cancer.

      This protocol details the study design for patients with prostate cancer (PCa) who have
      failed primary treatment with radical prostatectomy, and now have rising PSA as indicated by
      a recent PSA blood draw value &gt; 0.1 ng/ml. Patients fitting our inclusion criteria for the
      study, will receive an Axumin scan as part of their standard of care (SOC) treatment. If the
      SOC scan is positive, patients under this protocol will either subsequently receive hormone
      therapy OR salvage radiation therapy (not both concurrently). Patient response to therapy
      will be assessed with serial Axumin scans identifying additional lesions present at 3 months,
      6 months, and 12 months (1 year) post-therapy, with the latter time point being our endpoint
      of the study.

      The study aims are as follows:

        1. The investigators would like to understand the hormonal therapy response based on Axumin
           scans administered over a time course of 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months post-hormone
           therapy treatment.

        2. The investigators would like to understand the salvage radiotherapy response based on
           Axumin scan results incorporated into radiation treatment planning over a time course of
           3 months, 6 months, and 12 months post-salvage radiation treatment.

    <description>Post-radical prostatectomy patients fitting our inclusion criteria, including rising PSA &gt; 0.1 ng/ml, a positive SOC Axumin scan, and a patients not having received hormonal therapy for a minimum of 3 months, will receive hormonal therapy in the form of Casodex for 2 weeks, followed by Lupron indefinitely. Patients will then receive serial Axumin scans up to 1 year post-therapy.</description>

    <description>Post-radical prostatectomy patients fitting our inclusion criteria, including rising PSA &gt; 0.1 ng/ml, not concurrently on androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and/or received ADT in the past 3 months, and a positive SOC Axumin scan, will receive salvage radiation therapy according to the following protocol. External beam radiation therapy will be delivered in the form of high-dose intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). A total prescribed dose of 72 Gy will be delivered in 40 fractions over 8 weeks. For the first 25 fractions, the clinical target volume (CTV) is defined as the residual prostatic bed, plus internal/external iliac nodes. For the subsequent 15 fractions the CTV is defined as the residual prostatic bed plus margin. As part of SOC, the radiation fields will incorporate the Axumin positive areas into treatment planning objectives. Patients will then receive serial Axumin scans up to 1 year post-therapy.</description>
