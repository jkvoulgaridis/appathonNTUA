      This study evaluates the frailty and the health adverse events in the population of the
      Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging. It will be used the Centre of Excellence
      Self-Administered questionnaire (CESAM) which assesses frailty of older adults by providing a
      score and a of frailty in 4 levels.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Age is broadly recognized to confer a risk for health adverse outcomes, but it is an
      insensitive and non-specific measure for use in individual decision-making. Frailty has been
      emerging to take its rightful place as a better measure for over past decades. Despite
      general consensus that the concept of frailty is clinically useful, the lack of agreement on
      its definition and the challenge of its measurement by front-line health providers mean that
      frailty remains only 'their apparent' to chronological age as a criterion to select older
      persons at risk.

    <description>The algorithm is a three- step process involving administration of the neuropsychological battery to develop composite score in the three domains-memory, executive function, and psychomotor speed.
The primary outcome of the study will be to determine the number of participants to whom the memory, the executive function, and the psychomotor speed are affected.</description>

    <description>In the maintaining contact interview, one question will be asked of all participants in relation to prescription medication use in the preceding month. A second question asks about the frequency of prescription drug use during this month.
The secondary outcome of the study will be to determine the number of the medication that the participant take during a period of time.</description>
