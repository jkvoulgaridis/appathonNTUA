  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if an eye tracking impairment sensor can detect
      cannabis-induced impairment after using cannabis.The overall objective is to correlate
      measures collected from the eye tracking sensor with measures related to cannabis impairment
      (e.g., plasma THC levels, self-reported cannabis subjective effects, cognitive effects).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed project is a single-visit clinical laboratory study to evaluate the initial
      efficacy of an eye tracking sensor to detect cannabis-related impairment.

      Participants will be experienced but not frequent cannabis users without evidence of heavy
      alcohol or illicit drug use or other physical or mental health illness. Participants will
      come in for one screening visit, and those who consent, are eligible, and enroll will
      complete one experimental laboratory session involving smoking of 50% of 1 active
      (approximately 4.0% THC) cannabis cigarette. Assessments will be collected after-cannabis
      smoking up to 4 hours. Participants will be sent home from the laboratory via taxi.
