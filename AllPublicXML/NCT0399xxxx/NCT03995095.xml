      This work aims to study the benefits that the therapeutic interview Kibo in palliative care
      patients can have for spirituality.

      A parallel randomized controlled trial of two groups was performed. Information was collected
      on 60 palliative care patients during the moments before and after the intervention.

    <measure>Change in the dimension of spirituality (PRE and POST measures)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This variable was assessed with the Spirituality questionnaire from the Spanish Society of Palliative Care (SECPAL). This questionnaire contains 8 items, and it provides scores from 0 to 32, where higher values represent a better outcome.
In order to observe the change in the dimension of spirituality, it was measured at in two time points:
First measurement: PRE. Once the participant had signed the informed consent, the initial score for this outcome was assessed.
Second measurement: POST. Up to 4 weeks after the first measurement, the second measurement of the same variable was carried out.
Between first and second measurement, the control group received the usual psychological attention, whereas the intervention group received usual psychological attention plus attention of spiritual needs following the Kibo protocol (intervention).</description>
