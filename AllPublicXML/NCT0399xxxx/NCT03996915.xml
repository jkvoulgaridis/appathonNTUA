  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this randomized, controlled clinical trial was to treat oral halitosis in healthy
      adults with photodynamic therapy associated with periodontal treatment and follow them up for
      3 months. The participants with halitosis will be randomized into two groups: G1-treatment
      with photodynamic therapy or G2-cleaning of the tongue with a tongue scraper . Halitosis were
      evaluated measuring volatile sulfur compounds using gas chromatography After the treatments,
      a second evaluation will be performed, along with a microbiological analysis (qPCR) for the
      identification of the bacteria T. denticola

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Halitosis is an unpleasant odor that emanating from the mouth. A recent metanalysis shows
      worldwide trend towards a rise in halitosis prevalence. Studies show halitosis returns in a
      week after treatment with photodynamic therapy (PDT). Probably, bacteria residing in the
      periodontal sulcus could recolonize the dorsum of the tongue. To date, there are no study in
      adult population that associate halitosis and periodontal treatment with follow-up
      evaluation. The aim of this randomized, controlled clinical trial was to treat oral halitosis
      in healthy adults with photodynamic therapy associated with periodontal treatment and follow
      them up for 3 months. The participants (n=40) with halitosis will be randomized into two
      groups: G1-treatment with photodynamic therapy (n = 20) or G2-cleaning of the tongue with a
      tongue scraper (n = 20). Halitosis were evaluated measuring volatile sulfur compounds using
      gas chromatography After the treatments, a second evaluation will be performed, along with a
      microbiological analysis (qPCR) for the identification of the bacteria T. denticola. The
      evaluation of halitosis and the microbiological analysis will be repeated. After that,
      patients will receive periodontal treatment. The participants will return after 1 week and
      three months for an additional evaluation. Quality of life will be measured by Oral Health
      Impact Profile (OHIP-14) Comparisons will be made with ANOVA test, with the level of
      significance of 5 %. This protocol will determine the effectiveness of phototherapy regarding
      the reduction of halitosis in adults.

    <description>The portable Oral Chroma will be used for the assessment of halitosis. Oral air collection will follow the manufactured guide lines (Oral Chroma Manual Instruction). A syringe will be placed in the patient's mouth with the plunger completely inserted and the participant will breathe through the nose with the mouth closed for one minute.The plunger will then be withdrawn to fill the chamber with air. This procedure will be repeated. The gas injection needle will be placed on the syringe and the plunger will be adjusted to 0.5 ml. This air will be injected into the input of the device in a single motion. This procedure will be done before, immediately after PDT or scraper and after periodontal treatment.</description>
