  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis is life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to
      infection. It is the most expensive healthcare condition to treat in United States and has a
      mortality rate of nearly 30%. It is widely known that exaggerated inflammation and imbalance
      between sympathetic and parasympathetic arms of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) contribute
      to progression and adverse outcomes in sepsis. The role of unchecked inflammation and
      unregulated ANS as a potential treatment target is an important gap in our knowledge that
      should be explored.

      Cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP) is an intricate network where the ANS senses
      inflammation by vagus nerve afferents and tries to regulate it by vagus nerve efferents to
      the reticuloendothelial system. The central hypothesis of this pilot clinical trial is that
      transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (TVNS) at tragus of the external ear can activate the
      CAP to suppress inflammation and improve autonomic imbalance as measured by inflammatory
      cytokine levels and heart rate variability (HRV) analysis. The investigators plan to
      randomize patients with septic shock into active and sham stimulation groups and study the
      effects of vagal stimulation on inflammatory cytokines, HRV and a clinical severity score of
      sepsis. Both groups will continue to receive the standard of care treatment for sepsis
      irrespective of group assignments. The investigators hypothesize that 4 hours of TVNS will
      suppress inflammatory markers and improve the balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic
      arms of ANS as measured by HRV, resulting in improved Sequential Organ Failure Assessment
      Score (SOFA). The preliminary data generated from this pilot study will lay the foundation
      for a larger clinical trial.
