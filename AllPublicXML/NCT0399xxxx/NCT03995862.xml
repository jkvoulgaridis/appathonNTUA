  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the implementation of a national strategy to prevent the transmission of the human
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) combining prevention campaigns, condom use, early detection of
      HIV infections and recommendations for treatment as soon as possible, the number of new
      HIV-infected patients per year in France does not decrease.

      New HIV prevention strategies are therefore clearly needed. Since 2009, several studies have
      shown that tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine (TDF/FTC), an antiretroviral
      therapy combining two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors used for the treatment of
      patients seropositive for HIV, has preventive activity on HIV transmission. These results
      enabled the TDF/FTC to obtain in France an extension of the marketing authorization in March
      2017 for preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) of HIV transmission among patients at high risk of
      contamination.

      Since the approval, many studies around the world investigate the use of PrEP in routine
      practice, highlighting its effectiveness in real life. These studies describe the population
      of patients who benefit from PrEP in order to adapt their multidisciplinary care but also
      track the transmission of other sexually transmitted infections to prevent their emergence,
      given the observed decline in condom use. However, these studies are limited to big cities
      while PrEP is accessible in all territories.

      The Rhône-Alpes region is one of the three French regions that has been the most involved in
      the implementation of PrEP, one year after the FTC/TDF approval in France. Given the
      geographical position of the investigators, both in province and close to Switzerland, where
      the FTC/TDF is not authorized for PrEP, and the non-university nature of five of the six
      involved hospitals, the investigators would like to determine the profile of patients
      consulting in this region to benefit from PrEP. This analysis will also determine if the
      population at risk of the &quot;Alpine Arc&quot; region is similar to that observed in the other
      cohorts in order to adapt patient care.
