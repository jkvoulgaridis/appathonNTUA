    <textblock>
      The North American ACS Reflective III Pilot is an observational, Quality Enhancement Research
      Initiative (QuERI), knowledge translation program designed to give feedback to physicians on
      their post-ACS lipid-lowering management in an effort to support their decision-making and
      choice of therapies and thereby better achieve evidence-based, guideline-recommended
      management of post-ACS patients. The ACS Reflective III Pilot follows the completed ACS
      Registries I, II, and III, ACS Reflective I, and the ongoing ACS Reflective II programs.

      The main objectives are:

        1. To identify and describe post-ACS patients who do not achieve guideline-recommended
           LDL-C &quot;target&quot; (&lt;1.8 mmol/L in Canada, &gt;50% LDL-C lowering on high-intensity statin in
           the U.S.);

        2. To identify opportunities where PCSK9 inhibitor therapy may be of potential benefit in
           the management of post-ACS patients to achieve guideline-recommended LDL-C goal by 1
           year follow-up; and,

        3. To determine reasons why physicians are not prescribing guideline-recommended LDL-C
           lowering therapies and/or patients are not achieving guideline-recommended LDL-C goals.

        Patients age 18 years or older, 1-12 months post-ACS, with LDL-C ≥1.81 mmol/L (70 mg/dL)
        despite maximally tolerated statin ± ezetimibe therapy (including patients who are
        intolerant of ≥2 statins).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients ≥18 years of age;

          2. ACS 1-12 months prior to enrolment defined by symptoms of myocardial ischemia with an
             unstable pattern, occurring at rest or with minimal exertion, within 72 hours of an
             unscheduled hospital admission due to presumed or proven obstructive coronary disease
             and at least one of the following:

               1. Elevated cardiac biomarkers (e.g., troponin) = myocardial infarction (MI); or,

               2. Resting ECG changes consistent with ischemia, plus additional evidence of
                  obstructive coronary disease from regional wall motion or perfusion abnormality,
                  70% or greater epicardial coronary stenosis by angiography, or need for coronary
                  revascularization procedure = unstable angina (UA); and,

          3. LDL-C ≥1.81 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) despite maximally tolerated statin ± ezetimibe therapy
             (including patients who are intolerant of ≥2 statins).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Participating in a research study where the lipid-modifying therapy is unknown,
             randomly assigned (i.e., choice not determined by the physician), or not approved for
             clinical use; or

          2. Follow-up or life expectancy &lt;1 year.
