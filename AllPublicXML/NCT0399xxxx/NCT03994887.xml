  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      General anesthesia (GA) is a state of loss of consciousness induced by anesthetic products.
      In a GA, two classes of products are usually used: on the one hand, hypnotics that are
      responsible for the sleep component (hypnosis) and memory loss (amnesia), and on the other
      hand opioids that have an analgesic role.

      The doses of hypnotic and morphine necessary to achieve this state of loss of consciousness
      and lack of response to painful stimulation vary from subject to subject, and during surgery
      depending on the intensity of the stimulus, requiring permanent adaptation to avoid overdose
      or underdosing, responsible for morbidity.

      Several monitors of the hypnotic component have been developed in recent years, which can now
      be used routinely, such as the Bispectral Index (BIS) or Spectral Entropy.

      However, there is currently no clinically validated technique for monitoring pain or the
      effect of opioids in the operating room.

      Spectral analysis of the electroencephalogram (EEG) revealed a significant decrease (-30%) in
      alpha spectral power, observed specifically in painful experimental conditions in healthy
      awake subjects. On the other hand, a painful experience is accompanied by transient changes
      in various parameters under vegetative control, whether cardiovascular, cutaneous or
      pupillary, essentially underpinned by the activation of the sympathetic system.

      The investigators hypothesize that a real-time dynamic analysis of the spectral power of EEG
      combined with that of cardiovascular vegetative parameters, cutaneous conductance and
      pupillary diameter is likely to be a marker of nociception under GA.
