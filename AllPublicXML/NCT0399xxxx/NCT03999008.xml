    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to perform a multicentre, prospective, randomized, placebo
      controlled, double-blinded study to demonstrate the potential and beneficial effects of OVB
      in the prevention of recurrence of anastomotic stricture in children operated for esophageal
      atresia with an anastomotic stricture.

    <description>The subjects will be included at time of the first dilation for an anastomotic stricture.
Basal physical exam and clinical evaluation (weight and height, dysphagia score, gastroesophageal reflux, feeding problems, respiratory symptoms, other symptoms).
Randomization will be conducted by centre. Because long gap esophageal atresia, high tension anastomosis and history of anastomotic leak are reported as risk factors for occurrence of anastomotic strictures, a stratification at randomization will be performed according to these criteria in each centre.
OVB or placebo will be given by the parents and started the day of the dilation at the first meal after recovering of the dilation and anesthesia.
Parents will be asked to bring the empty caps which will be counted for assessment of compliance.</description>
