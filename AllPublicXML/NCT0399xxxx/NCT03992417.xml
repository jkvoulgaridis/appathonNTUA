      Primary Objective:

      To characterize the patients who receive Dupixent® (dupilumab) for AD in a real-world
      setting, with respect to their medical history, socio-demographic and disease
      characteristics, and prior and concomitant treatments of AD

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To characterize real-world use patterns of Dupixent® for AD (eg, used regimens, reason
           for initiation of new treatments, concomitant therapies, treatment durations and reasons
           for discontinuation and/or switching)

        -  To assess the long-term effectiveness of Dupixent® in adult AD patients in a real-world
           setting

        -  To assess comorbid atopic conditions and effects of treatment in comorbid atopic
           conditions in adult patients who receive Dupixent® for AD

        -  To collect safety data on study participants

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Initiating treatment with Dupixent® for AD according to the country-specific
             prescribing information. Note: Participants may be eligible if they have already
             initiated treatment with Dupixent® for AD within 6 months before their enrollment in
             the registry, provided that all core baseline data required (Eczema Area and Severity
             Index [EASI], Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis [SCORAD], body surface area [of AD
             involvement] [BSA], Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure [POEM], and Dermatology Life
             Quality Index [DLQI]) by the registry protocol were captured at the time of initiating
             Dupixent® treatment and are available for entry in the registry database

          -  Able to understand and complete study-related questionnaires

          -  Provide signed informed consent

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Participants who have a contraindication to the drug according to the country-specific
             prescribing information label

          -  Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, may interfere with patient's
             ability to participate in the study, such as short life expectancy, substance abuse,
             severe cognitive impairment, or other co-morbidities that can predictably prevent the
             participant patient from adequately completing the schedule of visits and assessments

          -  Patients currently participating in any interventional clinical trial which modifies
             patient care

        The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's
        potential participation in a clinical trial.
