    <textblock>
      An open study to evaluate the ability of VagiVital in reducing the severity of moderate to
      severe symptoms of vaginal atrophy for women under treatment on adjuvant aromatase inhibitor
      therapy. Vaginal pH and a self-assessment of the symptoms will be assessed. The treatment
      consists of administration of intravaginal gel from an applicator filled from a tube, once
      daily for 12 weeks. All participants will self- administer the intravaginal gel once daily
      for 12 weeks.

    <textblock>
      Management of breast cancer involves systematic therapies including chemotherapy and
      endocrine therapy which can lead to vaginal atrophy (VA), caused by decreased levels of
      circulating estrogen to urinary and vaginal receptors. Due to the reduced estrogen
      production, less vaginal fluid is produced within the vagina and the mucosa becomes thinner
      and more fragile. This group of patients can not use estrogen treatment to reduce the
      symptoms of vaginal atrophy.

      A previous study showed a significant reduction in the severity of the most bothersome VA
      symptoms and vaginal pH was improved (decreased) as well as increased percentage of
      superficial cells over a 12 week treatment period with Vagivital.

      In this study all participants will self- administer the intravaginal gel once daily for 12
      weeks.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        To participate in the investigation, a subject must:

          1. Be a female, 18 years or older, who is willing to participate in the study as
             indicated by signing the informed consent.

          2. Women over the age of 18 who have been diagnosed with cancer and are currently taking
             adjuvant AI therapy who also complain of vaginal atrophy symptoms including vaginal
             dryness, vaginal itching, frequent urinary tract infections, or dyspareunia are
             candidates for this study. They also have to be sexually active or wanted to be so,
             but couldn´t because of problems with vaginal atrophy.

          3. Have one moderate to severe VA symptom (vaginal irritation and itching, vaginal
             dryness, dysuria, dyspareunia or presence of vaginal bleeding associated with sexual
             activity) that has been identified by the subject as being the most bothersome to her
             according to the scale presented in APPENDIX B.

          4. Be judged by the Principal Investigator as being in otherwise good health based on the
             medical evaluation performed at baseline. The medical evaluation findings must
             include:

               1. A normal or clinically non-significant finding at physical examination, including
                  vital signs (blood pressure and heart rate).

               2. A normal or clinically non-significant finding at gynecological examination.

               3. A normal or clinically non-significant finding at clinical breast examination. An
                  acceptable breast examination is defined as an examination in which no masses or
                  other findings are identified which are suspected of being malignant.

               4. Urine analysis test results within reference limits or with non-significant
                  deviations from reference values.

               5. A sitting systolic blood pressure ≤ 150 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure ≤ 90
                  mmHg at screening. Hypertensive subjects controlled with stable medications, who
                  have a blood pressure ≤ 150 (systolic) and ≤ 90 (diastolic) mmHg are suitable for
                  inclusion

          5. Be willing to abstain from sexual activity and the use of vaginal douching within 24
             hours prior to vaginal pH measurements at screening and at Visits 2 and 3.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        To participate in the investigation, a subject must not:

          1. Be currently hospitalized.

          2. Have a history of ongoing cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, pulmonary, hematologic,
             gastrointestinal, endocrine, immunologic, dermatologic, neurologic, psychological, or
             musculoskeletal disease or disorder that is clinically significant in the opinion of
             the Principal Investigator or Sub-Investigator.

          3. Have a history of undiagnosed vaginal bleeding.

          4. Have an ongoing urogenital infection at the screening visit.

          5. Any contraindication to the gel (VagiVital) therapy and allergy to the use of any
             components of the investigational device.

          6. Have a history of drug and/or alcohol abuse within one year of start of study.

          7. Have used any prescription or OTC medications including phytoestrogens, herbal
             medicinal products or hormonal intra-uterine device with known estrogenic effects
             within 12 weeks prior to screening procedures.

          8. Have used any type of vaginal lubricants and moisturizers within 24 hours prior to
             screening procedures.

          9. Have used estrogen alone or estrogen/progestin for any of the following time periods:

               1. Vaginal hormonal products (rings, creams, gels, vaginal suppositories) within 12
                  weeks prior to Screening procedures;

               2. Transdermal estrogen alone or estrogen/progestin products including percutaneous

             subject from safely participating in the study or complying with protocol
             requirements.

         11. Have participated in another clinical trial within 90 days prior to screening, have
             received an investigational drug within the three months prior to the initial dose of
             study medication, or be likely to participate in another clinical trial or receive
             another investigational medication during the study.

         12. Have contraindication to any planned study procedure.

         13. Fulfils any other reason for exclusion as stated by the Declaration of Helsinki.
