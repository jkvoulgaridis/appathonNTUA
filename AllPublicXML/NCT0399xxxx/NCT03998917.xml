  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The evolution of chronic kidney disease (CKD) causes a systemic upheaval on the body and a
      deep fatigue is very often described by patients (50-70% of the patients) even before the
      start of dialysis (pre-dialysis). This fatigue has many origins, and one of them probably
      stems from a deterioration of neuromuscular abilities. Very few studies have examined the
      physiological aspects of neuromuscular fatigue in pre-dialysis patients, and shedding light
      on potential deficits at this level would allow safe and efficient implementation of adapted
      physical activity programs.

      Our study aims to characterize the pathophysiology of neuromuscular capabilities in chronic
      advanced renal failure in pre-dialysis patients.

    <description>The Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI) is a 20 question self-report instrument designed to measure fatigue. It covers the following dimensions: General Fatigue, Physical Fatigue, Mental Fatigue, Reduced Motivation and Reduced Activity. Each question is graded from 1 (&quot;Yes, that is true&quot;) to 5 (&quot;No, that is not true&quot;). Higher scores indicate a higher level of fatigue.</description>
