  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endometriosis is a condition affecting about 10% of childbearing age women. It can begin a
      few months to a few years after puberty. It causes abdominal and pelvic pain that can be
      extremely debilitating, affecting the quality of patients life by affecting sexuality and
      fertility. Psychological repercussions are very important and underestimated. Patient care
      focuses most often on the &quot;organ pathology treatment &quot;.

      This study proposes to evaluate a multidisciplinary patient care by insisting on
      anatomo-physiological pain management, psychological and bodily, in the perioperative phase.

      The main objective is to evaluate benefit of psychological and corporal group management on
      the overall quality of life of patients with severe endometriosis in terms of endometriotic
      damage and/or functional and painful repercussions, requiring surgery, before or after this
      study

    <measure>Evolution of Physical Component Score (PCS) assessed by the Medical Outcome Study Short Form -36 (MOS SF 36) scale</measure>
    <time_frame>at 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Physical Composite Score (PCS) is based on four physical dimensions of quality of life and involves 8 components (Physical Functioning, Role Physical, Bodily Pain,General Health, Vitality, Social Functioning,Mental Health and Emotional Role). The evolution of the PCS is measured between T0, start of care, and the end of care (at T0 + 3 months).
The PCS score ranges from 0 to 100, a higher score being associated with a better quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Evolution of pain: Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>at 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Evolution of pain assessed by the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) between the beginning (T0) and the end of patient care (T0 + 3 months), in different body areas (back - abdomen - pelvic area - others) The VAS allows patients to rate their pain in an objective and comparable measure. This allows a quantitative evaluation of intensity of pain and trace evolution of the symptomatology in the same subject.
The VAS ranges from 0 to 10, 0 for no pain, 10 for maximum pain.</description>
