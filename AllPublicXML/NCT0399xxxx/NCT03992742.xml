  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study will examine (1) effectiveness of a combined intervention of AWARD advice,
      active referral, instant messaging and optional cocktail intervention to increase abstinence
      using a sequential multiple assignment randomised trial (SMART) and (2) explore the use of
      CBPR model to build capacity and to engage community partners in taking on this important
      public health issue for sustainability in the community. In addition, a process evaluation
      will be conducted to assess the effectiveness of the recruitment activity and how it is
      linked with the overall program outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although smoking prevalence is decreasing in Hong Kong, there are still 615,000 daily
      cigarette smokers in Hong Kong in 2017 and half will be killed by smoking which accounts for
      over 7,000 deaths per year. Smoking also accounts for a large amount of medical cost,
      long-term care and productivity loss of US$688 million (0.6% Hong Kong GDP). Smoking is a
      highly addictive behavior and it is difficult for smokers with strong nicotine dependence to
      quit without assistance. On the other hand, reaching and helping the many smokers who have no
      intention to quit is a challenge, because they are unlikely to seek professional help from
      smoking cessation services.

      The Quit and Win programme provides an opportunity to reach and encourage a large group of
      smokers to make quit attempt and maintain abstinence. The Quit and Win model posits that
      smokers participating in the contest will have higher motivation to quit with incentives and
      better social support. Studies have found that such quitting contests or incentive programs
      appeared to reach a large number of smokers and demonstrated a significantly higher quit rate
      for the quit and win group than for the control group.

      We propose to use adaptive design for the QTW 2019 specifically a two-phase adaptive design,
      i.e., a sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial (SMART) design. Optional cocktail
      cessation supports will be provided based on smokers' smoking status and preference. The
      supports, including multimedia messages, active referral plus financial incentive, phone
      counseling, social support and medications, are empirically evidence-supported and most have
      been used in our previous QTW interventions.

      Therefore, the present study will examine (1) effectiveness of a combined intervention of
      AWARD advice, active referral, instant messaging and optional cocktail intervention to
      increase abstinence using a SMART design and (2) explore the use of CBPR model to build
      capacity and to engage community partners in taking on this important public health issue for
      sustainability in the community. In addition, a process evaluation will be conducted to
      assess the effectiveness of the recruitment activity and how it is linked with the overall
      program outcomes.

    <description>intervention Group participants will receive three months of personalized interaction through IM Apps (e.g. WhatsApp, WeChat). Our counsellors will trigger the conversation and encourage the participants to set a quit day. A total of pre-set 26 messages will be sent with the schedule of once daily for 1 week (the week across the quit date), 3 times a week for 4 weeks (2 weeks each before and after the week with quit date) and once a week for remaining 7 weeks. These messages covered generic information about the benefits of quitting, methods to avoid/ manage craving or withdrawal symptoms, and encouragement to quit and use SC services.
At the end of the initial phase (1-month), complete responders (quitters) will continue to receive PIM (subgroup C). Incomplete responders (smokers) will be randomized to continue PIM (subgroup B) or receive OCI (subgroup A).</description>

    <description>For incomplete respondents (subgroup A) randomized to OCI, the available intervention options include multi-media messages, active referral plus financial incentive, phone counseling, family/peer support and medications (NRT). Participants will be guided by cessation counsellors at 1-month follow-up telephone survey to choose any combination of OCI based on their preference. If OCI participants cannot be followed up at 1-month, they will receive multi-media messages by default.</description>

    <description>Participants enrolled in the Control Group will receive regular messages via IM services (e.g. WhatsApp, WeChat) since initial contact and until 3-month after baseline with a tapering schedule: 1) Baseline to 4-week (1-month): 2 times/ week (8 in total); 2) 4-week to 12-week (2- &amp; 3-month): 1 time/week (8 in total).
SC messages will generally include benefits of SC, encouragement on abstinence and use of SC services, tips on avoiding/ handling craving and reminder of participating in telephone follow-up. A reminder to participate in the telephone follow-up will also be sent at 1-, 2-, 3- and 6-month, making up a total of 20 messages.
At the end of the initial phase (1-month), complete responders (quitters) will continue to receive RIM (subgroup F). Incomplete responders (smokers) will be second randomized to continue RIM (subgroup E) or receive PIM (subgroup D). Those who are unable to follow up at 1-month will be considered as nonresponsive to the intervention.</description>
