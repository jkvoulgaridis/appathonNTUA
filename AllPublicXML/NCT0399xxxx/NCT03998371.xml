  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chromosomal instability (CIN) refers to ongoing chromosome segregation errors throughout
      consecutive cell divisions. CIN is a hallmark of human cancer, and it is associated with poor
      prognosis, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance. Analyzing CIN of the DNA extracted from
      urothelial cells in urine samples seems a promising method for diagnosing, monitoring, and
      predicting the prognosis of bladder cancer patients. CIN can be assessed using experimental
      techniques such as bulk DNA sequencing, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), or
      conventional karyotyping. However, these techniques are either time-consuming or
      non-specific. We here intend to study whether a new method named Ultrasensitive Chromosomal
      Aneuploidy Detection (UCAD), which is based on low-coverage whole-genome sequencing, can be
      used to analyze CIN thus help diagnosing and treating bladder cancer patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CIN results from errors in chromosome segregation during mitosis, leading to structural and
      numerical chromosomal abnormalities. It will generate genomic heterogeneity that acts as a
      substrate for natural selection. Furthermore, it is proved that tumors with aneuploidies and
      polyploidy resulting from whole-genome doubling are related with metastasis, treatment
      resistance, and decreased overall survival. It is estimated that 60%-80% of human tumors
      exhibit chromosomal abnormalities suggestive of CIN. CIN positively correlates with tumor
      stage and is enriched in relapsed as well as metastatic tumor specimens. Due to the ubiquity
      of CIN in cancer cells, it is a potentially non-invasive way to detect CIN in the urothelial
      cells from the urine sample for diagnosing and monitoring bladder cancer patients. UCAD is a
      new method to detecting CIN in the DNA sample from patients, including extracting DNA from
      urine, analyzing DNA by low-coverage whole-genome sequencing, processing the data by
      bio-information techniques, and finally optimizing the management of bladder cancer patients.

      The investigators intended to conduct a prospective study by analyzing urine samples from
      bladder cancer patients and control groups that without any tumor in the urinary system or
      other organs to compare the specificity and sensitivity of UCAD test for diagnosing
      urothelial carcinoma to other modalities, such as urine cytology or fluorescence in situ
      hybridization (FISH).
