  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the association between low muscle mass (myopenia) at diagnosis and
      chemotherapy toxicity in older adults with newly diagnosed advanced colorectal cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective cohort study that examines the impact of myopenia on chemotherapy
      toxicity in overall survival (OS) in older adults with newly diagnosed metastatic colorectal
      cancer (CRC) receiving 5-Fluouracil (5FU)systemic chemotherapy. The study also explores the
      mediating influence of genetic variation in the association between myopenia and chemotherapy
      toxicity.

    <ipd_description>Wake Forest NCORP Research Base is committed to following the NIH Statement on Sharing Research Data (http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-03-032.html). As of July 2018, the WF NCORP RB signed an agreement with NCI to contribute de-identified data and data dictionaries from clinical trials conducted through our RB to the NCI NCTN/NCORP data archive within 6 months of primary and non-primary publications of phase II/III and phase III trials to https://nctn-data-archive.nci.nih.gov/. This will become the primary means for sharing raw data, and we will adhere to the guidelines spelled out in the NCTN/NCORP Data Archive Usage Guide. De-identified data from studies not covered by the agreement (e.g., phase II and observational studies) will be made available upon request. All data files will be de-identified. De-identification procedures will meet the HIPAA criteria as detailed in the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 45, Section 164.514.</ipd_description>
