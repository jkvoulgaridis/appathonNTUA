  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compares the effects of Packed Red Blood Cells (PRBCs) prepared in two different
      ways on the transfusion indices in beta(ß)-Thalassemia transfusion-dependent patients. The
      two blood components types derive from the whole blood. In one case, the whole blood is
      leukoreduced with subsequent plasma removal. In the other case, plasma, buffy coat, and red
      blood cells (RBCs) are first separated and subsequently, the RBCs leukoreduced. Each type of
      blood components will be subsequently given to one-half of the patients for a 6-month period
      and to the other half for other 6-month at the randomization phase, for a total of 12 months
      of crossed-treatment per patient.

    <textblock>
      At Day Hospital Talassemia ed Emoglobinopatie of Ferrara, two different PRBCs are available.
      The two types of blood components are obtained from whole blood, pre-storage leukoreduced and
      suspended in saline-adenine-glucose-mannitol (SAGM). One method of preparation consists of
      the whole blood leukoreduction with subsequent plasma removal. The other method first
      separates plasma, buffy coat, and RBCs, and then the RBCs are leukoreduced. The two methods
      mainly differ in the final haemoglobin (Hb) content: the Hb level is lower (-13%,
      approximately) in the second method that also shows the advantage to produce platelets from
      the buffy coat. A PRBCs unit is not as strictly defined as a therapeutic medication dose
      (pill or vial): individual PRBCs units may substantially differ in their Hb content, much
      more than the average difference between the two types of preparations. The aim of this study
      is to document the extent of the average difference between the two types of preparations,
      and its impacts on the transfusion indices of ß-Thalassaemia transfusion-dependent patients.
      All patients will receive each blood component for a period of 6 months (crossover design),
      for a total of 12 months of transfusion treatment per patient.
