      notification and brief mindfulness intervention.

      This study will test the feasibility of using a smartband to detect and track smoking and
      deliver brief smoking cessation interventions by smartphone app in real time. Smokers will
      wear a smartband to detect and notify them of smoking for 21 days and obtain individual
      smoking profiles; detected smoking will then trigger a &quot;mindful smoking&quot; exercise for the
      next 7 days leading up to their quit date at 30 days; after which another mindfulness
      exercise (&quot;RAIN&quot;: recognize, accept, investigate and note cravings rather than smoke) will be
      delivered prior to each predicted smoking episode according to their individual smoking
      profile for 30 days post-quit.
