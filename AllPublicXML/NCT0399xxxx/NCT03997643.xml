  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this randomized treatment study is to formally compare quality of life in
      patients with at least one pN0 hemi-neck after resection of a squamous cell carcinoma of the
      oral cavity treated with a primary radiation therapy versus a secondary targeted radiation
      therapy approach, to provide a high level of evidence to guide the selection of treatment
      options.

      The goal of this randomized treatment study is to formally compare quality of life in
      patients with at least one pN0 hemi-neck after resection of a squamous cell carcinoma of the
      oral cavity treated with a primary radiation therapy versus a secondary targeted radiation
      therapy approach, to provide a high level of evidence to guide the selection of treatment
      options.

      The study will require a sample size of 90 patients randomized in a 2:3 between the two arms.
      Arm 1 (standard radiation therapy to tumor location and surrounding area) and Arm 2 (targeted
      radiation therapy to tumor location).

      Patients will be followed for a total of 5 years.
