      The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of music, visual art, or creative
      writing on quality of life measures for epilepsy patients.

    <textblock>
      Qualifying patients admitted to Epilepsy Monitoring Unit will be approached for participation
      in the study. Patients who consent will be randomly assigned to work with one of three
      creative artists (visual artist, creative writer, or therapeutic musician. The assigned
      artist will provide 1 intervention while the patient is admitted and 4 follow-up
      interventions after discharge from the hospital. Follow-up sessions will be conducted
      remotely, either by phone or over the internet.

      Subjects will be asked to complete study questionnaires before and after the first art
      intervention, and again after the last follow-up session. The study seeks to measure the
      impact of arts interventions on quality of life. Secondary objectives include the effects of
      the interventions on seizure frequency and EEG spike generation, as well as the impact of
      creative arts interventions on patients diagnosed with non-epileptic events during
      hospitalization.*

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in participant Quality of Life (QOLIE-10) scores before and after the interventions.</measure>
    <time_frame>Each participant will be assessed at baseline (Day 1) and after the inpatient intervention (approximately Day 3 - 21) and at baseline (Day 1) and after the follow-up remote interventions (approximately 8 weeks after discharge).</time_frame>
    <description>Change in quality of life will be calculated using the QOLIE-10 questionnaire responses.The QOLIE-10 includes 10 questions with a total score range of 10 - 51. The score will be calculated by the sum of scores for all questions divided by the number of items answered. Thus, if a patient skipped an item, it is not reflected in the total score. A lower score indicates a higher quality of life, and a higher score indicates a lower quality of life.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in participant Distress scores before and after the interventions.</measure>
    <time_frame>Each participant will be assessed at baseline (Day 1) and after the inpatient intervention (approximately Day 3 - 21) and at baseline (Day 1) and after the follow-up remote interventions (approximately 8 weeks after discharge).</time_frame>
    <description>Change in distress will be calculated using the Distress scale. The Distress scale asks patients to rate their distress on a scale from 0 - 10, with 0 meaning &quot;no distress&quot; and 10 meaning &quot;extreme distress.&quot; Lower scores indicate less distress.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in participant Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) scores before and after interventions.</measure>
    <time_frame>Each participant will be assessed at baseline (Day 1) and after the inpatient intervention (approximately Day 3 - 21) and at baseline (Day 1) and after the follow-up remote interventions (approximately 8 weeks after discharge).</time_frame>
    <description>Change in health status will be calculated using the PHQ-9 questionnaire. The PHQ-9 is a 9-item questionnaire with scores ranging from 0 to 27. Lower scores indicate better health scores and higher scores represent worse health status. Scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represent cutoffs for mild, moderate, moderately severe and severe depression, respectively.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in participant Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scores before and after interventions.</measure>
    <time_frame>Each participant will be assessed at baseline (Day 1) and after the inpatient intervention (approximately Day 3 - 21) and at baseline (Day 1) and after the follow-up remote interventions (approximately 8 weeks after discharge).</time_frame>
    <description>Change in anxiety level will be calculated using the GAD-7 questionnaire responses. The GAD-7 is a 7-items questionnaire with scores ranging from 0 to 21. Scores of 5, 10, and 15 represent cut-offs for mild, moderate, and severe anxiety, respectively.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in EEG spike frequency before, during, and after the intervention while participant is admitted to the DHMC epilepsy inpatient service.</measure>
    <time_frame>Each participant will be assessed at baseline (Day 1) and after the inpatient intervention (approximately Day 3 - 21) and at baseline (Day 1) and after the follow-up remote interventions (approximately 8 weeks after discharge).</time_frame>
    <description>EEG spike frequency will be determined by automated spike detection software</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in seizure frequency from baseline to end of follow-up</measure>
    <time_frame>Each participant will be assessed at baseline (Day 1) and after the inpatient intervention (approximately Day 3 - 21) and at baseline (Day 1) and after the follow-up remote interventions (approximately 8 weeks after discharge).</time_frame>
    <description>Comparison of seizure data at baseline and post-interventions based on patient report of baseline and seizure calendar reporting</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Qualitative analysis to identify themes in the creative writing and visual art subject matter.</measure>
    <time_frame>After the inpatient intervention (approximately Day 3 - 21) and after each follow-up remote intervention (approximately 8 weeks after discharge).</time_frame>
    <description>Participants assigned to either the creative writer or to the visual artist will supply their creations for analysis. The creative writing subject matter will be analyzed using N-Vivo software. Visual art subject matter will be coded for thematic content manually.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in quality of life measures for participants ultimately diagnosed with non-epileptic seizures compared to those diagnosed with epileptic seizures.</measure>
    <time_frame>Each participant will be assessed at baseline (Day 1) and after the inpatient intervention (approximately Day 3 - 21) and at baseline (Day 1) and after the follow-up remote interventions (approximately 8 weeks after discharge).</time_frame>
    <description>Change in quality of life for patients with non-epileptic seizures will be calculated using the QOLIE-10 questionnaire responses.The QOLIE-10 includes 10 questions. The score is calculated by the sum of scores for all questions divided by the number of items answered. Thus, if a patient skipped an item, it is not reflected in the total score. A lower score indicates a higher quality of life, and a higher score indicates a lower quality of life.</description>

    <description>The musician will either offer music that can either be played for the participant or an instrument so they can experience playing themselves. The duration of the intervention will be determined by participant interest and tolerance, but not to exceed 60 minutes. The outpatient music intervention will consist of providing a recording of similar music for the participant to listen to for at least 30 minutes per week, along a with telephone call session with the music therapist.</description>

    <description>The creative visual artist will assess interest in spending time using the materials provided. Participants will be offered watercolor painting, drawing, or adult coloring. There will be a guided activity based on their art making preference. A standardized prompt will be utilized for both writing and visual art sessions. The duration of the intervention will be determined by participant interest and tolerance, but not to exceed 60 minutes. For remote follow-up sessions, participants will be supplied with a small art kit to use at home.</description>
