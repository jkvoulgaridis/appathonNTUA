  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At least one quarter of the 18 million persons in the US with intellectual and developmental
      disabilities engage in self-injurious behavior (SIB), which can result in injuries,
      disfigurement, and loss of function (e.g., blindness). SIB that persists in the absence of
      social reinforcement has been referred to as automatically maintained SIB (ASIB). Research
      has shown that the sensitivity of ASIB to disruption by alternative reinforcement is
      identifiable in a standardized assessment, predicts response to treatment, and provides a
      quantifiable basis for subtyping ASIB. This research has also identified two subtypes that
      are highly resistant to behavioral treatment using reinforcement alone, necessitating the use
      of protective equipment and other procedures to minimize injury. The proposed study is a
      clinical trial that will allow systematic comparison of the effectiveness of two behavioral
      treatments targeting treatment-resistant subtypes of ASIB.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Research shows that automatically maintained self-injurious behavior (ASIB) is comprised of
      treatment-responsive (Subtype 1) and treatment-resistant subtypes (Subtypes 2 and 3). The
      primary objective of the clinical trial is to compare two behavioral treatments for the
      treatment-resistant subtypes of ASIB: Subtypes 2 and 3. Noncontingent Reinforcement (NCR)
      with competing stimuli (toys that reduce occurrence of SIB) is widely used, but its outcomes
      are not optimal for most cases with Subtype-2 and -3 ASIB. Noncontingent reinforcement (NCR)
      includes two phases: 1) Pre-Treatment Assessment to identify competing stimuli and 2) NCR
      Treatment. Combination Treatment (CT) is based on the same principles as NCR (reinforcer
      competition), but increases the amount and varies the sources of alternative reinforcement to
      more effectively reduce ASIB and self-restraint. CT involves the use of competing stimuli,
      competing tasks (activities that reduce SIB), and self-control training to reduce
      self-restraint or teach alternative, more adaptive forms of self-control. CT includes three
      phases: 1) Pre-Treatment Assessments, 2) Intensive Training, and 3) Combination Treatment.
      Pre-Treatment Assessments will identify competing stimuli, tasks, and self-control equipment;
      and Intensive Training will strengthen skills needed to fully access available reinforcement
      to compete with ASIB, and establish self-control skills to replace debilitating
      self-restraint. Following the Intensive Training phase, CT combines noncontingent access to
      competing stimuli with differential reinforcement of alternative behavior (DRA) to reinforce
      engagement with competing tasks, and use of alternative self-control equipment.

      Each study participant will be randomly assigned to first receive either NCR or CT using
      randomly permuted block randomization, stratified by subtype. Each approach includes more
      than one phase, but both end with a treatment phase. If the first treatment applied is
      ineffective, based on defined criteria (including the level of improvement and number of
      treatment sessions), a 3-day washout period will follow where no treatment is applied, and
      then the second approach will be initiated culminating in the application of that treatment
      (either NCR or CT).

      Following a demonstration of treatment efficacy (for either the first or second treatment
      that is applied), any additional non-reinforcement treatment components that were added will
      be withdrawn to determine whether those components remain necessary. If a strong treatment
      effect does not maintain, the additional components will be reapplied. Treatment
      generalization will be initiated, and if the effects are maintained the trial will end.

      If the first treatment that is applied is effective, that treatment will continue to be
      applied and generalization will be conducted (and the participant will not crossover to the
      other treatment approach).

    <measure>Self-Injury Trauma Scale (SITS)</measure>
    <time_frame>At enrollment; repeated at completion of treatment, anticipated to be between 57 and 92 days from enrollment.</time_frame>
    <description>The Self-Injury Trauma Scale (SITS) measures surface tissue damage. In Section 1: Measurement of Surface Trauma, the number of injuries at each body location is scored (0=no wounds, 1=1 wound, 2=2-4, and 3=5 or more), type of injury (AL = abrasion/laceration, and CT = contusion), and severity of injury (1 = red, irritated, local swelling or discoloration; 2 = superficial break in skin or extensive swelling; 3 = extensive break in skin, avulsion present, chronic wound, disfigurement or tissue rupture). For Section 2: Topography, each type of self-injury the participant exhibits is recorded. For Section 3: Scoring Summary, a Number Index is obtained for the number of injuries across all body locations (0=no injuries, 1=1-4, 2=5-8, 3=9-12, 4=13-16, and 5=17 or more); a Severity Index provides a composite of severity scores (0= no injuries; 1=all 1s; 2=one 2, no 3s, 3 = two or more 2s; 4 = one 3; 5 = two or more 3s); Estimate of Current Risk is recorded as Low, Moderate, or High.</description>

    <description>This treatment for ASIB is based on reinforcer competition. Noncontingent Reinforcement (NCR) will consist of first conducting a competing stimulus assessment (CSA) to identify stimuli (toys, massagers, etc.) associated with reductions in ASIB and high levels of engagement. Treatment then involves NCR in which alternative sources of reinforcement are made freely available to compete with reinforcement maintaining ASIB. Providing additional sources of reinforcement is thought to decrease ASIB by producing a shift in the allocation of responding toward accessing the newly available reinforcement. Additional, more restrictive components may be added if the competing stimuli (CS) are ineffective in reducing ASIB. These additional components are applied in accordance to the least-restrictive treatment model and include response blocking, response reduction procedures, protective equipment, or mechanical restraint.</description>

    <description>Combination Treatment is based on the same principles as NCR, but differs in three ways: 1) It includes three pre-treatment assessments that seek to establish competing stimuli, tasks, and self-control equipment through prompting and reinforcement; ; 2) Intensive training in each of these components is conducted to strengthen skills needed to fully access available reinforcement to compete with ASIB; and 3) Combination treatment is assessed, which includes the noncontingent delivery of competing stimuli and differential reinforcement of alternative behavior to reinforce engagement with competing tasks, and use of alternative self-control equipment. This will increase the amount and vary the sources of alternative reinforcement to more effectively reduce ASIB and self-restraint. Restrictive components may be applied as described for the NCR treatment.</description>
