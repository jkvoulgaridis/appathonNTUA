  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Identification of T cell inhibitory signals, including PD-1/PD-L1, has prompted the
      development of a new class of cancer immunotherapy that could restore an adequate
      immunosurveillance against the neoplasm and enhance T-cell-mediated anticancer immune
      responses. However, elimination of cancer by T cells is only one step in the Cancer-Immunity
      Cycle, which enable providing several therapeutic targets and tailoring of combinations of
      immune therapies. Manganese has been confirmed to activate antigen-presenting cells and
      function as mucosal immunoadjuvants in pre-clinical studies. This study is a first-in-man,
      Phase I, 3 + 3 dose escalation study of a combined regimen of Manganese and anti-PD-1
      antibody with or without chemotherapies in subjects with unresectable/ metastatic solid
      tumors or lymphomas. This study is designed to assess the safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetic profile (PK profile), mode of delivery and Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of
      this regimen.
