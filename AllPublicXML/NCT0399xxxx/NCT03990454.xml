  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SLC-391 is a novel, potent and specific small molecule inhibitor of receptor tyrosine kinase
      AXL with desirable potency and pharmaceutical properties. It has demonstrated
      antiproliferative activity against different tumour cell lines in vitro and efficacy in
      different animal models including nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), chronic myeloid leukemia
      (CML) and (acute myeloid leukemia (AML) models. It has also exhibited strong synergy with
      other approved targeted therapies in different animal models.

      This is the first clinical study with SLC-391. The goals of this study are to evaluate the
      safety, pharmacokinetic (PK), and pharmacodynamic profile of SLC-391, and then to identify a
      safe and pharmacologically active dose for evaluation in subsequent cohorts or clinical
      studies. In addition, change from baseline of possible blood biomarkers (soluble AXL and Gas
      6) may be evaluated.

      This is an open-label, multicentre, phase 1, dose-escalation, dose-expansion, first in human
      study to evaluate the safety of SLC-391 administered orally (once-daily) in 21-day cycles to
      subjects with advanced solid tumours.

    <intervention_model_description>The study will employ a 3+3 dose-escalation design. Cohorts (same dose level) of 3 to 6 evaluable subjects will participate in a dose-escalation scheme in which the dose of SLC-391 will be increased in each consecutive cohort. Evaluation of a cohort of ≥ 3 subjects that have completed a 21-day cycle (cycle 1) is required prior to defining a new SLC-391 dose and schedule for the next cohort. Dose-escalation decisions by the Data Review Committee will take into account all available data including PK/pharmacodynamic data and the safety profile of prior cohorts. Based on all available emerging data, alternative dosing schedules, frequency, or dose reductions may be considered.
Subjects with certain tumour types (eg, nonsmall cell lung cancer, ovarian) may be enrolled in expansion cohorts (≤ 12 subjects) at doses less than or equal to Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) in order to better characterise the antitumour activity and safety of SLC-391 and to define the Recommended Phase 2 Dose dose.</intervention_model_description>

A subject may continue treatment with SLC-391 in 21-day cycles until the treatment discontinuation criteria are met.
