  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to assess the safety and feasibility of an oral fecal microbiota
      transplant (FMT) intervention for Alzheimer's disease (AD).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Studies suggests that microbes, including those derived from the gut, may play a role in the
      development or progression of AD. Gut microbiome composition among individuals with the
      Alzheimer's clinical syndrome is reduced in microbial diversity and shows compositional
      differences relative to control groups. Further, genera identified as more abundant in AD are
      associated with greater AD pathology while genera identified as less abundant in AD are
      associated with less AD pathology, as shown using CSF biomarkers.

      The goal of this study is to assess the safety and feasibility of an oral fecal microbiota
      transplant (FMT) intervention.

        -  Primary Objective: To assess the safety and feasibility (recruitment, eligibility,
           enrollment, completion, and follow-up) of an oral FMT intervention in people with and
           without the Alzheimer's clinical syndrome.

        -  Secondary Objective: To demonstrate the effects of FMT on the composition and function
           of the gut microbiota. To collect preliminary data in order to estimate sample size and
           other parameters for a larger study.

    <measure>Change in gut composition: Engraftment of fecal microbial transplant as assessed by 16S rRNA sequencing of recipient stool sample</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 8 weeks, 24 weeks, 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>In order to determine efficacy of fecal transplant, change in composition, i.e. microbial engraftment will be assessed by testing for newly detected operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in the gut microbiome of a participant post-FMT (which were present in the donor but undetected in the participant pre-FMT). This will be assessed via 16S rRNA seq of recipient stool samples pre- and post- FMT.</description>

    <description>The Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status consists of twelve subtests which give five scores, one for each of the five domains tested (immediate memory, visuospatial/constructional, language, attention, delayed memory). Raw scores on each domain are scaled to account for a person's age. Scaled scores are converted to percentiles which are used to determine a range of performance (impaired, borderline impaired, expected score, high average, superior) and overall cognitive status (impaired/not impaired).</description>

    <description>The Trail Making Test is a neuropsychological test of visual attention and task switching. It consists of two parts, A and B. Participant is instructed to connect a set of 25 dots as quickly as possible while still maintaining accuracy. The test can provide information about visual search speed, scanning, speed of processing, mental flexibility, as well as executive functioning.
Results for both TMT A and B are reported as the number of seconds required to complete the task; therefore, higher scores reveal greater impairment.</description>
