  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a validation study to evaluate the acceptability, feasibility and impact of
      WASABI (Wiring Adolescents With Social Anxiety via Behavioral Interventions), a mobile
      application employing a closed-loop technology in adolescents with a Social Anxiety and to
      prepare for a large-scale efficacy trial in this population. The goal of this study is to
      evaluate WASABI—a clinician-assisted, adjunct to treatment, mobile application designed to
      augment the efficacy of psychological Evidence Based Treatments through a closed-loop
      technology.

      This study will employ an innovative and evidence-based mobile intervention that includes
      Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMAs) data collected from mobile devices, the WASABI
      closed-loop algorithm to detect exacerbation of social anxiety, and 1:1 and group-based
      videoconferencing and Instant Messaging with peers and providers. This study will test WASABI
      as an adjunct to digital Cognitive Behavioral Group Therapy (dCBGT) in adolescents with
      Social Anxiety (SA), in a parallel arm, double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial
      to assess feasibility and initial efficacy, to investigate the generalization of trained
      cognitive skills in the natural environment and improving anxiety and social functioning, and
      to prepare for a large-scale efficacy trials in adults with adolescents with Social Anxiety.
