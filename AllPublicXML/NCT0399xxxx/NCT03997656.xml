  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The modern world revolves around technology; unsurprisingly companies are leveraging the
      expertise of the digital tech industry to aid in the prevention of chronic diseases. Among
      one of the most common chronic diseases in Malaysia is diabetes. Prevalence of diabetes in
      Malaysia has increased by more than two folds over the past two decades. Despite a growing
      number of tech products developments on diabetes prevention, a recent meta-analysis has found
      almost no evidence on digital therapy outside the developed world. Therefore, this study is
      needed to demonstrate the potential of digital therapy in preventing diabetes in Malaysia.
      The study design is a randomized controlled trial study conducted in Kuala Terengganu,
      Malaysia. The study will be conducted in two phases. The first phase will involve preparation
      of intervention modules and development of intervention mobile app. The second phase will
      involve validation and utilization of the digital therapy. We hope that this digital therapy
      program can make a significant difference in health outcomes, especially for diabetes. By
      giving precise regimes and daily monitoring, digital therapeutics can offer mountains of data
      that can potentially provide doctors unprecedented insights into patient behavior and create
      feedback or optimization loops for individual patients. Enabling patients to take greater
      control over managing their chronic illnesses and preventing disease progression could save
      billions of ringgits throughout the entire Malaysia healthcare system. By that, we hope this
      approach can be considered as a scalable solution to address national diabetes prevention
      efforts to target of improvement on diabetes prevalence to not more than 15% by 2025 and
      serve as a model for applying such services to other chronic diseases.

      Digital therapy is a new field that has emerged as the evidence-based treatments from the
      field of behavioural medicine that are delivered online. It is considered as a scalable
      method to reach a large number of at-risk population, convenient and accessible. Furthermore,
      it frees participants from the requirement of travelling to a specific location and more
      flexible with the time to participate. The aim of this study therefore to determine the
      feasibility and efficacy of a lifestyle intervention for type 2 diabetes prevention in adults
      at risk of developing diabetes, an assessor-blinded, parallel-group, randomised controlled
      trial using the MyDiPP (Malaysia Diabetes Prevention Programme) app. Eligible participants
      were stratified (age, BMI) and then randomised in a 1:1 ratio to either the 12-month MyDiPP
      intervention or receive standard health education from primary care providers in the clinic.
      The study will be conducted in two phases. The first phase will involve preparation of
      intervention modules, development of intervention mobile app, training and recruitment of
      participants. The second phase of the study will involve implementation of the intervention,
      data collection, follow up and data analyses. The study will be conducted in individuals aged
      18- to 65-years old, living, working or studying in Kuala Terengganu who is at risk
      developing diabetes but currently does not have diabetes recruited through online
      advertisement. The target population is adult residents that lived, worked or studied in
      Kuala Terengganu who is identified as being at high risk of type 2 diabetes. One hundred
      participants will be recruited for this study. They will be identified by a two-stage
      screening process. In the first stage, patients at high risk of type 2 diabetes will be
      identified via the CDC Diabetes Risk Test that will be distributed via Google Form. The
      researcher will invite those who scored ≥5 for second stage screening test via the HbA1c
      test. In the second stage, patients attending a screening for eligibility who have a current
      HbA1c in the range 38-44 mmol/mol or 5.6-6.2% will be invited to volunteer.

    <description>HbA1c level will be tested using A1CNow+ test kit from a finger-stick blood samples collected in a capillary tube according to the manufacturer's procedure guidelines. To measure HbA1c with A1cNow+ test kit, the finger will be cleaned with alcohol swab, allowed to dry and then lanced with sterile lancet to obtain a drop of blood. A 5µl capillary blood sample will be collected and added to the sample dilution buffer. The diluted sample will be mixed and added to the monitoring using transfer pipette. Once the sample was applied, the monitor will begin the analyses. Digital results will be displayed in the display window after 5 minutes. The test result will be recorded for each participant.</description>

    <measure>physical activity level</measure>
    <time_frame>6-months and 12-months</time_frame>
    <description>Physical activity (PA) will be assessed using translated and validated version of short-form International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ short form). It comprises of seven items that identify frequency and time spent on three specific types of physical activity (walking, moderate intensity activity, and vigorous intensity activity) during the past seven days. The Metabolic Equivalent (MET) values will be measured. The subjects' total physical activity (MET-minutes/week) will be calculated by summing up the walking, moderate and vigorous intensity activity scores. Subjects will be categorised as &quot;active&quot; if they achieved ≥600 MET-minutes/week, &quot;moderately active&quot; if they achieved ≥150 MET-minutes/week and &quot;inactive&quot; if they achieved &lt;150 MET-minutes/week.</description>

    <description>The dietary intake status of the participants will be assessed from their food diary record from the app and the diary for intervention and control participants respectively. Participants will be asked to record their dietary intake for three days (two weekdays and one weekend) and the average measurement will be taken.

It comprises of 36 items which measure eight health domains which are physical functioning (PF), role-physical (RP), bodily pain (BP), general health (GH), vitality (VT), social functioning (SF), role-emotion (RE) and mental health (MH). The eight domains will be scored from 0 to 100 indicating worst to best possible health. All the scores will be further summarised into the Physical Component Summary score (PCS) and the Mental Component Summary score (MCS).</description>
