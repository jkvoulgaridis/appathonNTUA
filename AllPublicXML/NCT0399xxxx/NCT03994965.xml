  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is a severe, often chronic mental disorder, characterized by positive and
      negative symptoms and cognitive deficits. The serotonin hypothesis of schizophrenia was
      proposed in the 1950s, but only recently, pimavanserin, the first antipsychotic medication
      with selective affinity for the serotonin 2A receptor was approved.

      The aim of this translational proposal is to test the clinical validity of the serotonin
      hypothesis of schizophrenia and to guide development of operational, objective criteria for
      stratification of first-episode schizophrenia spectrum patients before antipsychotic
      treatment.

      Our previous data have strongly suggested, that a subgroup of antipsychotic-naïve patients
      will respond to serotonin 2A receptor (2AR) blockade. This treatment will cause minimal
      side-effects compared with conventional dopamine D2/3 receptor blockade.

      In this Danish, investigator-initiated trial, we will establish a cohort of 40
      antipsychotic-free, first-episode schizophrenia spectrum patients and enrol them in a 6-week
      open label, one-armed trial with selective serotonin 2AR blockade (pimavanserin).

      Before initiation of pimavanserin patients will undergo: positron emission tomography (PET)
      imaging of the serotonin 2AR binding potential using the radioligand [¹¹C]Cimbi-36; magnetic
      resonance spectroscopy (MRS) of cerebral glutamate levels; structural Magnetic Resonance
      imaging (MRI), including Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI); cognitive and psychopathological
      examinations; Electrocardiography (ECG), and blood sampling for genetic- and metabolic
      analyses.

      Matched healthy controls will undergo parallel examinations, but not medical treatment and
      PET .

      ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc. provides the study medication (pimavanserin). ACADIA had no
      influence on study design and will not take part in data processing or publication of the
      results of the study.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Reduction in positive symptoms - Clinical response in patients after 6 weeks of treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Reduction in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) positive subscale score [PANSS positive baseline - PANSS positive week 6].
To assess a patient using PANSS, an approximately 45-minute clinical interview is conducted. The patient is rated from 1 to 7 on 30 different symptoms based on the interview as well as reports of family members or primary care hospital workers.[4]
Positive scale 7 Items, (minimum score = 7, maximum score = 49)
Negative scale 7 Items, (minimum score = 7, maximum score = 49)
General Psychopathology scale 16 Items, (minimum score = 16, maximum score = 112)
For the primary outcome only the chance in PANSS positive scores will be reported.</description>

    <measure>Reduction in positive symptoms after week 2 and 4 - Secondary clinical endpoints</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>

    <measure>Reduction in negative symptoms after 6 weeks of treatment, measured with the Brief Negative Symptom Scale (BNSS).</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Secondary clinical endpoints, negative symptoms
Negative symptoms will be assessed by Brief Negative Symptom Scale (BNSS). Measures 5 domains: blunted affect, alogia, asociality, anhedonia, and avolition.
The BNSS includes a manual, score sheet, and workbook, and has 13 items organized into 6 subscales. The manual defines the terms used in the scale, provides anchors for each item, and gives instructions for a semistructured interview, including suggested questions. The workbook extracts the suggested questions and the anchors and is designed for the rater's reference during administration. All the items in the BNSS are rated on a 7-point (0-6) scale, with anchor points generally ranging from the symptom's being absent (0) to severe (6).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Reduction in obsessive symptoms after 6 weeks of treatment, measured with The Brief Obsessive Compulsive Scale (BOCS).</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Secondary clinical endpoints, obsessive symptoms
Measured by The Brief Obsessive Compulsive Scale (BOCS). The BOCS consists of a 15-item Symptom Checklist including three items (hoarding, dysmorphophobia and self-harm) related to the The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) category &quot;Obsessive-compulsive related disorders&quot;, accompanied by a single six-item Severity Scale for obsessions and compulsions combined.
Total severity scale (questions 1-6) score range from: 0-24. Endorsement of 2 or more items in the checklist or a mean score of 1.5 or above on the severity scale suggests an Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
Higher mean scores on the severity scale (questions 1-6) starting on page 4 indicate higher severity.</description>

    <measure>Characterization of para-clinical parameters in patients using both genetic high-density-snip-arrays and clinical blood markers.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To exclude other clinical diseases than schizophrenia and as a safety-measure, blood-samples are taken for somatic screening including haemoglobin, hematocrit, ferritin, white blood cells, platelet count, sodium, potassium, creatinine, carbamide, albumin, C-reactive protein (CRP), HbA1c and fasting glucose, fasting lipids, thyroid stimulating hormone, alanine and aspartate amino transferase, bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase and alkaline phosphatase.
The genetic-blood samples will be analysed with an array designed for population based genetic studies. We will use a high-density-snip-array of approximately 1 million snips (SNP/snip: single nucleotide polymorphism). The array will be applied to the genome in full, but genome sequencing will not be performed neither of individual genes nor the full genome. The genetic data will be used to identify a genetic risk score compared to the background population.</description>
