  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All current FDA approved medications to treat endometriosis pain including danazol, GnRH
      agonists (Lupron, Zoladex and Synarel), GnRH antagonist (elagolix) and depo-provera prevent
      or contradict pregnancy. Therefore women suffering from endometriosis and trying to conceive
      have no medical options apart from pain meds. The purpose of this pilot study is to determine
      whether the anti-inflammatory, IL-1 inhibitor (anakinra) reduces pelvic pain due to
      endometriosis without altering menstrual cycles, which is an indicator of ovulatory function.
      Anakinra is an FDA approved injectable medication for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis
      that is pregnancy category B.

    <textblock>
      Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory disease1 that affects 5 -10% of reproductive aged
      women1,2. It is characterized by the presence of uterine endometrium outside the uterus. The
      condition causes health distress through pelvic pain and decreased QOL. Current therapies to
      temporarily control symptoms include surgery as well as medical options that prevent
      pregnancy and have significant side-effects.3,4 The most common symptoms with endometriosis
      include dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia and NMPP. Ultimately these lead to a decrease in QOL. All
      current medical therapies to treat endometriosis pain prevent or contradict pregnancy.

      Inflammation is a well-established central figure in the pathophysiology of endometriosis(1).
      Increasingly, data is suggesting that IL-1 is a mediator of inflammation in endometriosis (2,
      3). In addition, there are data that single nucleotide polymorphisms at the IL-1A gene locus
      are associated with endometriosis risk (4). Hence, it is rational to assess anakinra, an IL-1
      antagonist, in the control of symptoms and inflammation due to endometriosis. Therefore, we
      propose this pilot study testing an FDA approved medication (anakinra) to reduce IL-1 and on
      dysmenorrhea due to endometriosis without stopping periods (a sign of ovulation).

      Anakinra is a self-administered subcutaneous injectable medication that is FDA approved for
      the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. As an IL-1 antagonist, it works by decreasing
      inflammation and is administered daily by the patient. Because Anakinra interferes with the
      immune system functioning, the major concern with the use of Anakinra is reduced resistance
      to infection. Others include injection site reactions such as redness, itching, rash, and
      pain. Bruising or bleeding also can occur, but it is rare. These effects usually stop after
      one - two weeks. Headaches and low white blood cell counts can also occur, but these are very
      rare. Anakinra should be used with caution in those with chronic kidney disease.

      Anakinra is not specifically FDA approved for endometriosis. Although no data on its use in
      women with endometriosis have been published, there is no reason to expect women with
      endometriosis would be at any particular or increased risk than those in the general
      population.

      This study is a randomized, double blinded, placebo controlled, cross-over clinical pilot
      study of 20 women. Patients diagnosed with laparoscopically proven endometriosis within the
      last 5 years will be randomized to either treatment with an FDA approved medication
      (Anakinra) or a placebo. This is an investigator initiated single center study sponsored by
      the Swedish Orphan Biovitrum (SOBI). SOBI will provide the study drug and placebo.

    <time_frame>Subjects will complete the baseline questionnaire at Visit 1. Subjects will fill out monthly questionnaires after the administration of either anakinra or placebo during 6 menstrual periods.</time_frame>
    <description>The primary pain outcome measure is to determine the impact of anakinra on dysmenorrhea due to endometriosis, using the modified Biberoglu and Behrman scale. The modified Biberoglu and Behrman scale consists of three patient-reported symptoms (dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and non-menstrual pelvic pain). Each of these is separately graded on a scale from 0 to 3, with a max of 9 and higher numbers indicating more severe symptoms. Changes in dysmenorrhea is the primary endpoint.</description>

    <measure>Comparison of the impact of anakinra versus placebo on the quality of life using the Endometriosis Health Profile 30 questionnaire (EHP-30), conducted after each course of study medication administration.</measure>
    <time_frame>Subjects will complete the baseline questionnaire at Visit 1. Subjects will fill out monthly questionnaires after the administration of either anakinra or placebo during 6 menstrual periods.</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary outcome measure is to determine the impact of anakinra on the quality of life due to endometriosis, using the Endometriosis Health Profile 30 (EHP-30) questionnaire. The EHP-30 consists of a 30 item instrument that assesses pain, control and powerlessness, social support, emotional well-being, and self image. Each scale is standardized on a scale of 0 - 100, where 0 indicates the best health status through to 100 worst health status.</description>

    <measure>Comparison of serum inflammatory markers before and after anakinra administration.</measure>
    <time_frame>There will be blood tests at the start and end of each of of the subject's next 6 menstrual periods for a total of 12 blood draws.</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary outcome is to evaluate the effect of anakinra on serum inflammatory markers that are elevated in women with endometriosis. Relevant inflammatory markers of endometriosis include CRP, CA125, IL-1, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, BDNF, Glycodelin, and ZAG. There will be blood tests at the start and end of each of of the subject's next 6 menstrual periods: At the time of each blood draw, we will collect 20 mL (approximately 4 teaspoons) of blood. This will be needed for each of the 6 study menstrual periods for a total of 12 blood draws. There will be a total of 240 ml of blood or approximately 16 tablespoons of blood collected throughout the entire study.</description>
