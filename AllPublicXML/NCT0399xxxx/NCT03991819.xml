  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/Ib study whose purpose is to find out if combining an experimental drug
      called binimetinib with pembrolizumab is beneficial in people who have advanced non-small
      cell lung cancer. This study may also see if the combination is safe and may also find the
      best dose of binimetinib that should be added to pembrolizumab.

      This study will have two parts:

      Phase I - During this part, also called the dose de-escalation part, an initial group of 6
      participants will receive a certain planned dose of binimetinib in addition to a standard
      dose of pembrolizumab. If this combination is found to be safe during the first 28 days of
      receiving the study drugs, this will be considered the most appropriate dose of the study
      drug combination (the highest dose of binimetinib that can be given with pembrolizumab
      without causing serious side effects).

      Phase Ib - Once the appropriate dose of binimetinib is confirmed in Phase I (as described
      above), additional participants will be enrolled in the Phase Ib to further test how safe,
      tolerable, and effective the study drugs at that dose level. Phase Ib will also evaluate the
      anti-tumour activity of binimetinib and pembrolizumab in participants with advanced non-small
      cell lung cancer.

    <description>Binimetinib is a drug that, inside the cell, blocks an important series of chemical reactions called a molecular pathway. Binimetinib blocks the MEK1/2 pathway from working. In some types of cancers, this pathway becomes too active, which can cause tumor cell growth. Blocking the MEK1/2 pathway from working is thought to slow or stop tumor cell growth.</description>

    <intervention_name>Pembrolizumab</intervention_name>
    <description>Pembrolizumab is an immunotherapy drug that is approved by Health Canada for the treatment of patients with PD-L1 positive non-small cell lung cancer as a first treatment. PD-1 is a type of protein that binds to another type of protein known as PD-L1. When these proteins bind together, it helps prevent cells from killing each other, including cancer cells. Some drugs, like pembrolizumab, are used to block PD-1 from binding to PD-L1. When the protein is blocked, the body's immune system can kill more cells.</description>
