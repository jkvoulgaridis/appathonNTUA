      This phase II trial studies how well retreatment with panitumumab works compared to standard
      of care regorafenib or trifluridine and tipiracil hydrochloride (TAS-102) in treating
      patients with colorectal cancer that is negative for RAS wild-type colorectal cancer has
      spread to other places in the body, and/or cannot be removed by surgery, and is negative for
      resistance mutations in blood. Treatment with panitumumab may interfere with the ability of
      tumor cells to grow and spread. Some tumors need growth factors to keep growing. Growth
      factor antagonists, such as regorafenib, may interfere with the growth factor and stop the
      tumor from growing. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as TAS-102, work in different ways to
      stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing,
      or by stopping them from spreading. Giving panitumumab may work better in treating patients
      with colorectal cancer than with the usual treatment of regorafenib or TAS-102.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the overall survival (OS) in molecularly selected patients with metastatic
      colorectal cancer (CRC) receiving panitumumab rechallenge versus standard therapy (TAS-102 or
      regorafenib).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the progression free survival (PFS) in molecularly selected patients with
      metastatic CRC receiving panitumumab rechallenge versus standard therapy (TAS-102 or
      regorafenib).

      II. To define the objective response rate (ORR) in patients receiving panitumumab rechallenge
      versus standard therapy (TAS-102 or regorafenib).

      III. To define the clinical benefit rate (CBR = complete response + partial response + stable
      disease &gt;= 6 months) in patients receiving panitumumab rechallenge versus standard therapy
      (TAS-102 or regorafenib).

      IV. To compare the safety and tolerability of panitumumab rechallenge versus standard therapy
      (TAS-102 or regorafenib).

      V. Compare quality of life (QOL) between panitumumab rechallenge versus standard therapy
      (TAS-102 or regorafenib) as measured by the linear analogue self-assessment (LASA)
      questionnaires.

      CORRELATIVE RESEARCH:

      I. To assess plasma pharmacodynamics biomarkers of response and resistance to therapy.

      II. To explore any correlation between tissue and blood based biomarkers and clinical
      outcomes.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive panitumumab intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for a maximum of 24 cycles in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B: Patients receive trifluridine and tipiracil hydrochloride orally (PO) twice daily
      (BID) on days 1-5 and 8-12, or regorafenib PO once daily (QD) on days 1-21, at the discretion
      of the treating physician. Treatment repeats every 28 days for a maximum of 24 cycles in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3
      months for up to 3 years after randomization.
