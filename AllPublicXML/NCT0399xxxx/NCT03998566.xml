        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age ≥18 years old

          2. Biopsy-confirmed localized pancreatic cancer in the head or neck of the pancreas as
             defined by the NCCN guidelines

          3. Tumor is clearly delineable from duodenum and no clear evidence of invasion of the
             duodenum is seen at time of EUS performed for either diagnosis or fiducial placement.

          4. Subject is able to comply with motion management guidelines.

          5. Radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy for treatment of the disease is indicated.

          6. In Investigator's opinion, medically fit to undergo endoscopy for fiducial marker
             implantation and TraceIT administration.

          8. Zubrod Performance Status 0-2

          9. Subject or authorized representative, has been informed of the nature of the study and
             has provided written informed consent, approved by the appropriate Institutional
             Review Board (IRB) of the respective clinical site.

         10. Life expectancy of at least 9 months

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients for whom radiotherapy is contraindicated

          2. Previous thoracic or abdominal radiotherapy

          3. Any GI abnormality that would interfere with the ability to access the injection site

          4. Presence of tumor invasion of the duodenum detected on EUS at time of biopsy

          5. Previous Whipple procedure or other resection of pancreatic tumor prior to screening

          6. Active gastroduodenal ulcer or uncontrolled watery diarrhea

             cannot be medically managed, fasting blood glucose level above 300 mg/dL, and/or
             frequent swings between hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia)

          9. Currently enrolled in another investigational drug or device trial that clinically
             interferes with this study.

         10. Unable to comply with the study requirements or follow-up schedule.

         11. Any condition or comorbidity that the Investigator believes would interfere with the
             intent of the study or would make participation not in the best interest of the
             subject.
