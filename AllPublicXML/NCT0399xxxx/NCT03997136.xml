  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective randomized controlled clinical trials (single arm study) of surgical treatment
      modalities for supratentorial high grade gliomas within the next two years.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Supratentorial high grade gliomas are for surgical resection in any case according to many
      factors.

      Investigators will compare the outcomes/survival rate and clinical outcome of the different
      resection types (Total, near total, subtotal/debulking) of supratentorial high grade gliomas
      according to the clinical condition and comorbidities of the patient, the location and
      morphology of the lesion, the grading of lesions, and the clinical experience of the
      neurosurgeon.

    <description>The changes in clinical condition of the patients will be assessed using Modified Rankin's Scale (mRS) before and after treatment.
The scale runs from 0-6, running from perfect health without symptoms to death. 0 - No symptoms.
- No significant disability. Able to carry out all usual activities, despite some symptoms.
- Slight disability. Able to look after own affairs without assistance, but unable to carry out all previous activities.
- Moderate disability. Requires some help, but able to walk unassisted.
- Moderately severe disability. Unable to attend to own bodily needs without assistance, and unable to walk unassisted.
- Severe disability. Requires constant nursing care and attention, bedridden, incontinent.
- Dead.</description>

        All cases of patients of supratentorial high grade gliomas that fullfill the selection
        criteria that will be admitted in the department of neurosurgery in Assuit university
        hospital. (Non propability sample size) with expected size of 28 patients starting from
        01/07/2019 to 15/06/2021.

        Patients whose follow-ups will be lost due to any other cause will be excluded from this
        study (expected to be 25%). Additionally, the competence of follow-up will be approved by
        imaging and medical records.
