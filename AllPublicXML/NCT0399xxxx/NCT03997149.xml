  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study was to examine the glucocorticoid and behavioral responses to a
      psychological stressor in obese African-American and non-Latino white adolescents.
      Participants were exposed to the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) and a control condition on
      separate days. Immediately following each condition, participants were provided with snacks
      to eat at their leisure. Reactivity was assessed via salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase area
      under the curve (AUC), and adolescents were categorized as high or low reactors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the United States, pediatric obesity has more than tripled in the last 30 years,
      particularly among certain racial/ethnic groups including African-Americans. This disparity
      is partially attributable to greater exposure to psychological stress reported in this group
      (relative to non-Latino whites). Chronic psychological stress leads to weight gain directly
      through prolonged exposure to biological stress mediators such as cortisol and indirectly
      through behavioral pathways involving cortisol-induced increases in food consumption. An
      exciting arena of scientific advancements is focusing on identifying the specific pathways
      through which chronic stress influences eating behavior with emerging evidence to suggest
      that food intake, which is commonly increased during periods of stress, may serve as one key
      mechanism linking stress and obesity, particularly in African-American youth who are
      disproportionately exposed to chronic stress and have greater access to, and consumption of,
      energy-dense palatable foods. It is critical to advance understanding of the interplay
      between stress and food intake in understanding racial/ethnic disparities in pediatric
      obesity because stress eating represents a modifiable health behavior. That is, increased
      food intake during periods of elevated stress can be targeted for intervention in ways that
      may ameliorate the deleterious effects of stress on obesity risk. This project investigated
      the role of stress eating as a pathway linking chronic stress and obesity in African-American
      and non-Latino white adolescents.

    <description>During the control and stress conditions, saliva samples were taken at times 10, 25, 58, 88 and 118 minutes after arrival to analyze cortisol responses to the TSST. Area under the curve was calculated from the initial cortisol sample collected to the final cortisol sample collected: [AUC=(x2+x1)/(t2-t1) + (x3+x2)/(t3-t2) + (xk+xj)/(tk-tj)].</description>

    <description>The stress condition involved the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), a standardized laboratory stressor designed to elicit psychological stress and cortisol responses. Following the TSST, participants were brought to a separate room, instructed to rest and given the option to eat at their leisure. Books and magazines were included in the room for the participant to utilize.</description>
