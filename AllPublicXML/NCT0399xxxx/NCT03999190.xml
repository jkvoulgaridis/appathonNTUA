  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goals of this study is to determine (1) if differences in D2/3 receptor affinity states
      exist between medication-free subjects with SCH (MF-S) compared with healthy controls (HC),
      (2) the degree to which pre- and post-synaptic factors contribute to increased striatal
      dopamine (DA) signaling in MF-S and (3) to test the hypotheses that optimal DA transmission
      in the dorsal caudate (DCA) is necessary for normal working memory (WM) function.

      An antagonist ([11C]raclopride) and agonist ([11C]NPA) radiotracer will be used sequentially,
      in a counterbalanced design, to measure binding potential (BPND) under baseline conditions
      and 3-hours following oral administration of 0.5 mg/kg amphetamine in the same 30 MF-S and 30
      HC. The main outcome measures will be baseline BPND and the percent change in BPND induced by
      amphetamine, denoted ∆BPND, in the subdivisions of the striatum. In addition, all subjects
      will undergo fMRI while performing a WM task concurrent with both the initial pre- and
      initial post-amphetamine PET scans to explore the relationship between DCA DA transmission
      and fMRI BOLD response in the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) during a WM task.
