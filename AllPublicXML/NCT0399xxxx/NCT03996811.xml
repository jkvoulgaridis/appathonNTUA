  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the effectiveness of a rehabilitation program in improving
      physical functioning, cardiovascular health index, negative emotions, and quality of life in
      patients with hemodialysis in Taiwan.

      Hypothesis:

        1. The quality of life in exercise group is significant improving than usual-care group at
           3rd, 6th, 12th, and 24th month.

        2. The negative emotions in exercise group is significant improving than usual-care group
           at 3rd, 6th, 12th, and 24th month.

        3. The cardiovascular health index in exercise group is significant improving than
           usual-care group at 3rd, 6th, 12th, and 24th month.

        4. The Physical Functioning in exercise group is significant improving than usual-care
           group at 3rd, 6th, 12th, and 24th month.

    <description>exercise education: A 12-week regimen of home-based walking exercises, include moderate intensity for 40 min, three times a week on non-dialysis days. We explained the participants how to perform the exercises, according to an instruction manual for the exercise regimen. Participants were instructed that the exercises would be effective only if they reached 40%-60% of the target heart rate, as determined by the Karvonen method, and 12-13 on the RPE.</description>
