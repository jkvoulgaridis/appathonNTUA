  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study has a double-blind, placebo-controlled Randomized Period and an Open-Label
      extension Period. The primary objective of the Randomized Period is to demonstrate the
      efficacy of mavorixafor in participants with WHIM syndrome as assessed by increasing levels
      of circulating neutrophils compared with placebo, and relative to a clinically meaningful
      threshold. The primary objective of the Open-Label Period is to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of mavorixafor in participants with WHIM syndrome. Participants are allowed to
      continue treatment in the Open-Label extension Period, if regionally applicable, until
      mavorixafor becomes commercially available, or until the study is terminated by the Sponsor.

             parental/legal guardian consent.

          -  Have a genotype-confirmed mutation of chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4 (CXCR4)
             consistent with WHIM phenotype.

          -  Agree to use a highly effective form of contraception.

          -  Be willing and able to comply with the protocol.

          -  Have confirmed ANC ≤400 cells/µL during screening.

          -  Completed the Randomized Period; or

          -  Granted Early Release from the Randomized Period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has known systemic hypersensitivity to the mavorixafor drug substance, its inactive
             ingredients, or the placebo.

          -  Is pregnant or nursing.

          -  Has any medical or personal condition, which in the opinion of the Investigator may
             potentially compromise the safety or compliance of the participant or may preclude the
             participant's successful completion of the clinical study.

        Exclusion Criteria for the Open-Label Period:

          -  Participants who experience any treatment-limiting toxicity (TLT) will be excluded
             from participating in the Open-Label Period.
