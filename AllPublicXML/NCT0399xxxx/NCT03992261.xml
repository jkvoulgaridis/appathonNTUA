  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate Halobetasol Propionate (HBP) foam, 0.05% in subjects
      aged 12 through less than 18 years with plaque psoriasis in order to check the safety, the
      potential to suppress the adrenal glands and the degree to which the drug is absorbed into
      the bloodstream.

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is male or non-pregnant female and is 12 to less than 18 years of age

             legal guardian at the time of assent/consent signing

          -  Subject has a clinical diagnosis of stable plaque psoriasis involving a minimum of 10%
             Body Surface Area (BSA)

          -  Subject has an Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score of at least three (3 =
             moderate) at the Baseline Visit

          -  Subject has guttate, pustular, erythrodermic or other non-plaque forms of psoriasis

          -  Subject has a physical condition which, in the investigator's opinion, might impair
             evaluation of plaque psoriasis, adrenal axis function or which exposes the subject to
             an unacceptable risk by study participation

          -  Subject has had prolonged exposure to natural or artificial sources of ultraviolet
             radiation

          -  Subject is pregnant, lactating, or is planning to become pregnant during the study
