  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect synchronous use of nivolumab in
      addition to chemoradiotherapy in patients withnon-metastatic MIBC who are not candidates for
      radical cystectomy
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The initial hypothesis is that addition of nivolumab will increase 2-year locoregional
      control rate from 55% (control arm) to 75% (immunotherapy arm)

      There is a 24 month accrual period during which 78 patients will be randomized in a control
      group (standard chemo-radiotherapy) and the treatment group (chemo-radiotherapy + Nivolumab)

      The primary objective would be to compare locoregional control rate at 2-years between
      patients with MIBC receiving or not receiving nivolumab in addition to chemoradiotherapy.

      The secondary objectives are

        1. To study the safety of the addition of nivolumab to chemoradiotherapy in patients with
           MIBC

        2. To compare 2-year bladder cancer failure-free (BCFF) rates, defined as distant
           metastasis free survival (MFS) AND/OR locoregional failure (defined as in primary
           objective)

        3. To compare median overall survival (OS) in patients with MIBC receiving or not receiving
           nivolumab in addition to chemoradiotherapy

        4. Assess the effect of combined treatment on the quality of life

      Correlative studies of outcomes with PD-L1expression and with lymphocytic populations in the
      environment of the tumor
