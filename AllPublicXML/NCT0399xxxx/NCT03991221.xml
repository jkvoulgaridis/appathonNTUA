  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dental occlusion is the reciprocal confrontation of the two dental arches. The child has two
      set of temporary and permanent teeth and passes through different stages of dentition during
      which dental, skeletal or functional abnormalities may appear.

      Dental malocclusion is defined as an incorrect position of the teeth in the bone base, as
      well as the incoordination of the teeth of the opposite arches or the displacement of the
      maxillary and mandibular skeletal bases.

      When a malocclusion is detected during clinical examination, patients are referred to an
      orthodontic specialist. The interception in orthodontics is carried out during a growing
      period; it consists of correcting or reducing malocclusions in evolution and eliminating the
      functional causes to prevent aggravation of skeletal and dental abnormalities.

      An epidemiological study conducted in France on 789 children showed that 37.4% had at least
      one type of dental malocclusion. In 2010, a study of 5988 French children showed that 14% of
      them had received orthodontic treatment. These studies reveal a discrepancy between treatment
      needs and treatments conducted. In addition, certain dental malocclusions and skeletal
      disorders, such as lateral and anterior crossbite, require early orthodontic treatment in
      order to avoid aggravation of the occlusion disorder and induction of craniofacial growth
      disorders. Unfortunately these discrepancies are not always detected by the caregivers
      (pediatrician, general dentist, pediatric dentist).

      A schematic representation of malocclusions in temporary and mixed dentition requiring
      orthodontic interception has been developed by the investigator's team to provide a simple
      visual means of identifying these dental and skeletal disorders in order to improve early
      screening by practitioners involved in the mandatory medical follow-up of children.

      intervention is critical for specific dental malocclusions and skeletal disorders, such as
      lateral and anterior crossbite in order to avoid aggravation of the occlusion disorder and
      induction of craniofacial growth disorders. Unfortunately these discrepancies are not always
      detected by the caregivers (pediatrician, general dentist, pediatric dentist).
