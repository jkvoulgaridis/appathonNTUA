  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In vitro sperm selection for ICSI is important as it has a direct influence on the paternal
      contribution of preimplantation embryogenesis. Various laboratory tests were developed to
      assess the functions of the spermatozoa. Among them, only the tests for sperm DNA
      fragmentation, hyperactivation of the spermatozoa and the hyaluronan-binding ability are
      simple and fast.

      In vitro sperm selection for ICSI is important as it has a direct influence on the paternal
      contribution of preimplantation embryogenesis. Men with oligozoospermia who require ICSI
      often demonstrate compromised DNA integrity and increased chromosomal aberrations of the
      sperms in their semen. Studies have shown that embryos resulting from ICSI in those men have
      higher risk of sex chromosome disomies, chromosomal aneuploidies, de novo numerical
      chromosomal aberrations and cytogenetically detectable structural chromosomal aberrations.
      Although the main candidates for ICSI are oligozoospermic men, there is an increase in the
      use of ICSI, therefore, more couples are potentially exposed to those potential risks.

      Various laboratory tests were developed to assess the functions of the spermatozoa. Among
      them, only the tests for sperm DNA fragmentation (Halosperm), hyperactivation of the
      spermatozoa and the hyaluronan-binding ability (HBA) are simple and fast enough to allow the
      same semen sample tested to be used for oocytes' insemination. Spermatozoa that are fail to
      bind to hyaluronan have many aspects of immaturity. They retain histones in the sperm
      nucleus, cytoplasm on the sperm neck, and have higher aberrant sperm head morphology, in
      addition to, lower genomic integrity. It has also been shown that sperm DNA fragmentation is
      associated with male factor of infertility, correlating with the morphology and motility of
      spermatozoa.

      The aim of the present study is to carry out a comparative analysis between two groups:
      Hyaluronan binding system for sperm selection for ICSI procedures and another group of
      conventional morphology sperm selection (ICSI-PVP), both in cycles with only male infertility
      factor. The evaluated parameters were semen quality, fertilization and cleavage rates,
      chemical and clinical pregnancy, and miscarriage rates.

    <description>PICSI procedure: PICSI dishes are conventional plastic culture dishes pre-prepared with 3 microdots of powdered. The powdered HA is re-hydrated by adding 5 μL droplets of fresh culture medium to each of the three microdots. A 2 μL droplet with suspension of treated spermatozoa is then connected with a pipette tip to these culture medium droplets. The PICSI dish is incubated under oil; within 5 minutes the bound spermatozoa are attached by their head to the surface of the HA-microdots and are spinning around their head. An ICSI injecting pipette is used to pick the best motile HA-bound sperm up and inject them one by one into an oocyte. The ICSI injecting pipette can be previously loaded with viscous medium (PVP or Sperm Slow) to facilitate sperm micromanipulation.</description>

    <description>ICSI procedure: following sperm preparation as described before, samples were incubated until time of injection. Each oocyte was injected with a single morphologically abnormal and immobilized in polyvinyl Pyrolidone (PVP) spermatozoon. Individual sperm subjected to ICSI was examined and evaluated. The injection procedure was carried out in a sterilized dish using holding pipette and injection needle. Intra cytoplasmic sperm injection was performed according to the protocol of Van Steirteghem.</description>
