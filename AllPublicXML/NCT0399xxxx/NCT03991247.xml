  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Persistant insomnia is a common sleep disorder that affects approximately 20% of the French
      population. The standard treatment for chronic insomnia is Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy
      (CBT).

      Behavioral measures can be difficult to implement for the patient alone at home.

      Spa therapy with psychosomatic orientation allows to implement hygiene rules and structure
      rhythms of life. In addition, recent studies have shown that spa treatment, including
      crenotherapy, is effective in somatic complaints related to anxiety and benzodiazepine
      withdrawal.

      The spa treatment could therefore provide ideal conditions for the implementation of
      behavioral measures for insomnia management.

      The objective of SOMNOTHERM study is to measure efficiency on insomnia complaints at 8 weeks
      of a the implementation of a Behavioral therapy program for insomnia delivered by an internet
      software combined to a spa treatment compared to implementation of the same program at home
      (standard care).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Persistant insomnia is a common sleep disorder that affects approximately 20% of the French
      population.

      The standard treatment for chronic insomnia is Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT). This
      therapy is based on 4 components: sleep restriction, stimulus control, cognitive therapy and
      sleep hygiene education. Unfortunately, there are an insufficient number of trained CBT
      experts especially in France.

      Online programs based on CBT principles (e-CBT) have been proved to be effective in improving
      the sleep and daytime functioning in this population. Thus e-CBT can be an effective
      alternative to conventional CBT.

      Behavioral measures, however, remains difficult for patients to implement alone at home.

      Spa therapy with psychosomatic orientation allows to implement hygiene rules and structure
      rhythms of life. In addition, recent studies have shown that spa treatment, including
      crenotherapy, is effective in somatic complaints related to anxiety and benzodiazepine
      withdrawal.

      In this context, spa treatment with psychosomatic orientation appears conducive to implement
      hygiene rules and structure rhythms of life. The spa treatment could therefore provide ideal
      conditions for the implementation of behavioral measures of insomnia management (sleep
      hygiene, stimulus control and time in bed restriction) and could have a very beneficial
      effect on persistent insomnia disorder.

      This non-pharmacological therapy could also reduce hypnotics consumption (especially
      benzodiazepine).

      The main hypothesis of the study is that behavioral measures of insomnia management delivered
      by an internet software program combined to a spa treatment will be more effective on
      insomnia complaints (evaluated at 8 weeks) than the same program implemented at home.

      Patients will be followed during 6 months after the beginning of the program. Subjects'
      recruitment will be carried out from the list of patients registered for a spa treatment in
      one of the five spa centers participating in the study (Les Thermes de Saujon, Les Grands
      Thermes de Bagnères de Bigorre, Les Thermes de Divonne-les-Bains, Les thermes de
      Néris-les-Bains, Les Thermes d'Ussat-les-Bains).

      Study visits will be conducted by the coordinating center (CHU Bordeaux) by telephone
      interviews or video calls with participants.

    <description>The online program consists in restriction of time in bed and stimulus control instructions.
First, patient will complete an on-line sleep diary during 2 weeks. The personalized program is then activated by a practitioner (phone interview) who both assesses restriction of time in bed and delivers instructions of stimulus control. Then, restriction of time in bed is administered by the internet-delivered self-help program. The participant still completes his on-line sleep diary every day. Every 7 days, according mean sleep efficiency, a new sleep schedule recommendation is given to the participant. In addition, the program delivers everyday a set of instructions (stimulus control) designed to re-associate the bed/bedroom with sleep and to re-establish a consistent sleep wake schedule. The duration of restriction of time in bed program is 3 weeks (during spa treatment or at home depending on the allocated arm).</description>
