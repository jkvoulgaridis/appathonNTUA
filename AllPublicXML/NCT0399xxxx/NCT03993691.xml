  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trauma to the extremities such wrist, ankle, limb is very common and affects all population
      groups. It constitutes a significant public health issue. Standard radiography remains the
      basic imaging tool. However, as a 2-dimensional (2D) imaging modality it lacks sensitivity
      and specificity. Misdiagnosis rates are known to be high, especially for non-displaced
      fractures of the scaphoid and talus as well as erosions due to rheumatoid arthritis.
      Misdiagnosis leads to over treatment and unnecessary loss of productivity and quality of life
      including 6-12 weeks in a cast. Missed fractures can result in a chronic, non-healing
      fracture that may require surgical fixation and early arthritis of the joint. From a
      physician perspective, a missed diagnosis can result in a lawsuit and an expensive
      settlement/penalty.

      Computed tomography (CT) offers high resolution and excellent visualization of bone and joint
      morphology, and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) delivers soft tissue and cartilage
      visibility. However, cost, space and workflow related issues make them prohibitive for small
      orthopedic clinics. Although the radiation dose of a CT scan has been reduced considerably in
      recent years, it is still significantly higher than a regular radiograph. The whole-body
      scanners also have difficulties in imaging patients in portable and weight-bearing
      conditions. Dedicated extremity CT scanners have been commercialized recently in an attempt
      to address the current deficiency. They still suffer from higher cost and at such have a
      limited installation base.

      The aim of this one-year study is to demonstrate Tomo-E's clinical utility for diagnosis of
      wrist fractures. Tomo-E is a compact and stationary device that utilizes a distributed carbon
      nanotube (CNT) x-ray source array that will be specially designed for extremity imaging to
      collect all the projection views without any mechanical motion.
