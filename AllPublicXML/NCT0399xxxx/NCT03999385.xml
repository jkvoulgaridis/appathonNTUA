  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The transition from pediatric to adult care is particularly difficult for individuals with
      Type 1 diabetes. It is hypothesized that a mindfulness-based intervention for individuals
      making this transition will contribute to personal psychological well-being, superior
      participation in health care, and more tightly controlled blood sugar levels. Young adults
      with Type I diabetes will complete an eight-week training program in Mindful Self-Compassion.
      Intervention effectiveness will be assessed with both self-report and physiological measures.
      Assessments will occur at the start of the training program, end of the program, and
      three-months post-program.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research will evaluate the consequences of an eight-week Mindful Self-Compassion (MSC)
      intervention on the psychological and physical well-being of 18 to 25 year-old individuals
      with Type 1 diabetes who are at an age of established risk. Participants will be randomly
      assigned to either an immediate intervention group or wait-list control group. All
      participants will be tested before and after the intervention on a battery of self-report
      measures designed to assess various aspects of self-care and psychological functioning. Blood
      samples will also be taken before and after the intervention to determine HbA1C levels.
      Participants will also receive a followup assessment three-months post-intervention to assess
      the durability of the effects. We expect MSC training to induce positive change in
      participants' diabetes management and personal well-being.
