          2. Clinical signs consistent with acute ischemic stroke

          3. Subject is able to be treated within 8 hours of stroke symptom onset and within 1.5
             hours (90 min) from screening CT / MRI to groin puncture.

          4. Pre-stroke modified Rankin Score of 0 or 1

          5. NIHSS ≥6 at the time of enrolment

          6. If tPA is indicated, initiation of IV tPA should be administered as soon as possible
             and no later than 3.0 hours of onset of stroke symptoms (onset time is defined as the
             last time when the patient was witnessed to be at baseline neurologic status), with
             investigator verification that the subject has received/is receiving the correct IV
             tPA dose (0.9mg/kg) for the estimated weight.

          7. Expanded Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (eTICI) 0-1 flow confirmed by angiography
             that is accessible to the mechanical thrombectomy device in the following locations:

               1. Intracranial internal carotid

               2. M1 and/or M2 segment of the MCA

               3. Carotid terminus

               4. Vertebral artery

               5. Basilar artery

             Note: M1 segment of the MCA is defined as the arterial trunk from its origin at the
             ICA to the first bifurcation or trifurcation into major branches neglecting the small
             temporo-polar branch.

          8. Imaging scores as follows:

             · ASPECTS score must be 6-10 on NCCT or DWI-MRI.

             If automated core volume assessment software is used:

               -  MR diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) ≤50cc

               -  Computed tomography perfusion (CTP) core ≤50 cc

          9. Subject is willing to conduct protocol-required follow-up visits.

         10. A valid completed informed consent by participant or LAR (Legally Authorized
             Representative)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject who has received IA-tPA prior to enrolment in the study

          2. Female who is pregnant or lactating or has a positive pregnancy test at time of

          6. Current participation in another investigation drug or device treatment study

          7. Known hereditary or acquired hemorrhagic diathesis, coagulation factor deficiency. (A
             subject without history or suspicion of coagulopathy does not require INR or
             prothrombin time lab results to be available prior to enrolment.)

          8. Renal failure as defined by a serum creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dl (or 176.8 μmol/l) or
             glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &lt; 30.

          9. Subject who requires hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, or who has a
             contraindication to an angiogram for whatever reason.

         10. Life expectancy of less than 90 days

             scan is normal

         12. Suspicion of aortic dissection

         13. Subject with a comorbid disease or condition that would confound the neurological and

             assessments.

         14. Subject currently uses or has a recent history of illicit drug(s) or abuses alcohol
             (defined as regular or daily consumption of more than four alcoholic drinks per day).

         15. Known arterial condition (e.g., proximal vessel stenosis or pre-existing stent) that
             would prevent the device from reaching the target vessel and/or preclude safe recovery
             of the device

         16. Subject who has undergone balloon angioplasty or stenting of the carotid artery

         17. Angiographic evidence of carotid dissection

             Imaging exclusion criteria:

         18. CT or MRI evidence of hemorrhage on presentation

         21. CT or MRI-DWI showing ASPECTS 0-5. Alternatively, if automated core volume assessment
             software is used, MRI-DWI or CTP core &gt; 50cc.

         22. CT/MRI shows evidence of carotid dissection or complete cervical carotid occlusion
             requiring a stent

         23. Any imaging evidence that suggests, in the opinion of the investigator, the subject is
             not appropriate for mechanical thrombectomy intervention (e.g. inability to navigate
             to target lesion, moderate/large infarct with poor collateral circulation, etc.).

         24. Occlusions in multiple vascular territories (e.g., bilateral anterior circulation, or
             anterior/posterior circulation) as confirmed by angiography, or clinical evidence of
             bilateral strokes or strokes in multiple territories
