    <textblock>
      Investigating the effects of non-invasive transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS)
      on patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), and to determine specific ways that tACS
      may affect symptoms in depression, specifically sleep, hedonic tendencies, and cognition.

      Central Hypothesis: Non-invasive brain stimulation that suppresses alpha oscillation reduces
      cortical hyperactivity and causes a clinical improvement.

      Aim 1: To investigate the physiological changes in patients with MDD over the course of a
      5-day, 40 minute stimulation protocol, specifically changes in alpha oscillation power from
      resting state EEG recordings over the course of the intervention (baseline to Day 5 of
      stimulation, to both follow-up visits).

      Aim 2: To elucidate the relationship between changes in EEG and changes in depressive
      symptoms, by comparing the changes in clinical assessments (e.g., MADRS) and the change in
      alpha oscillation power over the course of the intervention (baseline to day 5 of
      stimulation, to both follow-up visits).

    <measure>Correlation Coefficient (r) Between Changes in Resting State EEG and Changes in Depressive Symptoms From Baseline to Day 5 Simulation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) to Day 5 of Stimulation</time_frame>
    <description>Correlation Coefficient (r) will be used to determine if there is a relationship between the change in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) scores and change in alpha power before stimulation on Day 1 and Day 5 of stimulation. The MADRS is a clinician-rated measure of depression severity with a total score ranging from 0 to 60, where higher scores indicate greater depression severity. The change in MADRS score will be calculated by taking the difference between MADRS scores before stimulation on Day 1 and Day 5. This change score will be correlated with the change in EEG power within the alpha (8-12 Hz) band. The change in alpha EEG power will be calculated by taking the mean decibel (dB) change between Day 1 and Day 5 before stimulation.</description>
