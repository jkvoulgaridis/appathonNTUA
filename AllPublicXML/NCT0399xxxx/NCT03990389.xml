      The goal of this research is to bridge a significant &quot;effectiveness&quot; gap in the treatment of
      depression. The investigators have developed a chatbot which will assist in performing
      measurement-based care (MBC) via Facebook Messenger. Participants will be randomized to
      either Usual Care or Usual Care with additional Chatbot Care.

      The goal of this research is to bridge a significant &quot;effectiveness&quot; gap in the treatment of
      depression. The investigators will be looking specifically at depressed women soon after they
      give birth, otherwise known as known as perinatal depression. Measurement-based care (MBC)
      which involves the use of quantitative assessments for depression screening, diagnosis, and
      symptom monitoring is recognized as one of the keys to depression management. MBC can be
      difficult to implement within the clinical setting due to the administrative overhead and
      close follow-up required. It is reasonable to hypothesize that low rates of MBC adoption are
      responsible for low rates of adequate depression care.

      The investigators have developed an automated conversational agent or &quot;chatbot&quot; (CB) for
      delivering MBC via Facebook Messenger. The investigators hypothesize that the use of CB-MBC,
      which combines a conversational interface with state-of-the-art quantitative assessments,
      will improve depression symptom severity for patients with perinatal depression. If
      successful, this project will provide primary care physicians with a new and inexpensive
      method for delivering better and safer care to their patients with depression. This study
      works to determine the impact of the chatbot in improving depression outcomes for patients
      under treatment for perinatal depression.

    <description>Subjects will undergo screening including Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM-R) and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and a few additional questions.
Eligible subjects randomized to usual care will receive monthly reminder phone calls from a research coordinator. Subjects will receive an email with a link to surveys for the purpose of collecting information on depression severity, medication adherence, self-efficacy, side-effect burden, and maternal functioning.
All participants will be asked to participate in a semi-structured debrief interview upon study completion.</description>

Eligible subjects randomized to chatbot care will receive monthly reminder phone calls from a research coordinator. Subjects will receive an email with a link to surveys for the purpose of collecting information on depression severity, medication adherence, self-efficacy, side-effect burden, and maternal functioning.
In addition to the above procedures, eligible subjects randomized to chatbot care will receive weekly messages from the chatbot asking them to complete a depression severity measure and side-effect burden assessments. Within week 1 subjects will receive a check-in call from a study coordinator to answer any questions regarding use of the chatbot.
All participants will be asked to participate in a semi-structured debrief interview upon study completion.</description>
