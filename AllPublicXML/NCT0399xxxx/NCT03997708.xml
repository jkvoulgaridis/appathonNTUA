  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a common functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized
      by absence of any organic cause. The vast majority of patients associate their symptoms with
      specific food consumption, creating the need for developing a new therapeutic approach based
      on altering the dietary habits. The aim of the study focuses in the comparison of the
      efficacy of two dietary patterns, the adjusted to the Mediterranean Diet Low FODMAP Diet
      (MED-LFD) and the nutritional guidelines of the British National Institute for Health and
      Care Excellence (mNICE) Managing IBS.

    <textblock>
      Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal disorder. Patients associate
      their symptoms with specific foods consumption, creating the need for developing a new
      therapeutic approach based on altering the dietary intake of these patients. Low FODMAP Diet
      is often used as a first-line treatment based on observations showing that short-chain
      carbohydrates are not adequatetly absorbed in the small intestine and exacerbate the symptoms
      of IBS. Additionally, the Mediterranean diet is a cultural heritage representative of all the
      countries surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea, described as a diet rich in herbal foods
      (cereals, fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, olives), with olive oil as the main consumption
      of fats, high to moderate consumption of fish and seafood, moderate consumption of eggs,
      poultry, dairy products and alcohol and low consumption of red meat. On the other hand, the
      nutritional recommendations of British National Institute for Health and Care Excellence
      (mNICE) managing IBS were created on the grounds of systematic reviews and are based on
      dietary and lifestyle modifications about caffeine, alcohol, fizzy drinks, fibre, resistant
      starch, fruits, sorbitol, oat and linseed consumption, meal patterns, probiotics and physical
      activity.

      The direct aim of the study is to compare the efficacy of two dietary patterns, the MED-LFD
      and the nutritional recommendations of mNICE managing IBS. Efficacy will be assessed based on
      the severity of symptoms. Additionally, possible improvements in quality of life and relief
      of symptoms post intervention between the two groups will be evaluated.

      The sample was calculated to 108 participants with prespecified statistical power 80%, level
      of significance α=0.05 and 10% adjustment for non-compliance in each group to detect an
      increase in the primary outcome measure from 59 in the mNICE group to 100 in the MED-LFD
      group (standard deviation of outcome=60). The above hypothesis of the means was based in the
      meta-analysis of Peter Varju, et al. 2017. Patients will be recruited by the Department of
      Clinical Nutrition, Attikon University General Hospital, where the nutritional intervention
      will be carried out.

    <time_frame>6 - 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>IBS- SSS contains 5 specific questions with instructions on how to score them. Each of the five questions (pain severity, pain frequency, abdominal distension severity, bowel movement satisfaction, quality of life) ranges from 0 to a maximum score of 100 using a visual analog scale (VAS) with total scores ranging from 0 to 500, with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms. Subjects can be categorized as having mild (75-175), moderate (175-300), or severe (&gt;300) IBS. A decrease of 50 points is associated with a clinically meaningful improvement.</description>

    <measure>Assessment of IBS related quality of life with a specialized questionnaire pre and post intervention between groups.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 - 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>IBS-QOL - a measure that assesses the degree to which IBS interfered with quality of life over the past 30 days. It is a self-report quality of life measure, which includes domains such as dysphoria, interference with activity, body image, health worry, food avoidance, social relation, sexual and relationship issues. Each of them is rated based on the Likert scale from 1 to 5, the higher the score the lower the quality of life is. The overall score ranges between 34 - 170. A decrease of 10 points or more is a significant improvement.</description>

    <description>12-Item Short Form Survey (SF-12) is a 12-item questionnaire used to assess generic health outcomes from the patient's perspective, covering the eight domains of health outcomes: physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional &amp; mental health. The items are weighted and summed to provide physical and mental health scores (PCS and MCS). The two composite scores are computed using the scores on the questions that range from 0 to 100, with higher score indicating better health.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adequate relief of symptoms after the intervention.</measure>
    <time_frame>Once per week</time_frame>
    <description>Adequate relief (IBS-AR) is a single item questionnaire of pain and discomfort. It poses the question &quot;Over the past week have you had adequate relief of your IBS symptoms?&quot;, with a positive or negative answer. Adequate relief is defined as 50% positive answers within the study period, for the purposes of the trial.</description>

    <description>The GSRS questionnaire was originally developed for dyspeptic patients but was later validated in patients with IBS. The GSRS is a 15-item questionnaire designed to assess common gastrointestinal symptoms. The questionnaire has five subscales, reflux, diarrhea, constipation, indigestion, and abdominal pain, with subscale scores ranging from 1 (no discomfort) to 7 (severe discomfort). Higher scores represent higher symptom burden.</description>
