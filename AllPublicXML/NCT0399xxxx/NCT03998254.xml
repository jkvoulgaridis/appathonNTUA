    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy, immunogenicity and safety of 9-valent human
      papillomavirus (9vHPV; V503) vaccine in Chinese women 20 to 45 years of age. The primary
      hypotheses are: 9vHPV vaccine reduces the incidence of HPV 31-, 33-, 45-, 52-, and 58-related
      12-month persistent infection at least 1 month post Dose 3, compared with quadrivalent HPV
      (qHPV) vaccine in women 20 to 45 years of age who are seronegative at Day 1 and polymerase
      chain reaction (PCR) negative Day 1 through Month 7 to the relevant HPV type; and 9vHPV
      vaccine induces non-inferior competitive luminex immunoassay (cLIA) geometric mean titers
      (GMTs) for each of HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 one month post Dose 3, compared with qHPV vaccine in
      women 20 to 45 years of age who are seronegative at Day 1 and PCR negative Day 1 through
      Month 7 to the relevant HPV type.

      This study has two stages with the Stage I expected from Day 1 through Month 30, and the
      Stage II expected post-Month 30 to Month 90. The Stage I study is a case-driven study which
      aims to accrue at least 20 cases of HPV 31/33/45/52/58-related 12-month persistent infection
      and at least 39 cases of HPV 31/33/45/52/58-related 6-month persistent infection by
      completion of Month 30 visit. The Stage II study is a case-driven study which aims to accrue
      at least 12 cases of HPV 31/33/45/52/58-related cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or
      3 (CIN 2/3), cervical adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS), and cervical cancer observed in both
      Stage I and Stage II, by completion of Month 90 visit.
