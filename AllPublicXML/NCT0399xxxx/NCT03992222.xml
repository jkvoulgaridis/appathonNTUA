  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical exercise program (PEP) have demonstrated their benefit to the health of older
      people. They are effective in functional performance and in the incidence and severity of
      falls.

      We hypothesize that intervention with targeted Physical exercise programs PEP on appropriate
      muscle strengthening devices allows, through its action on the muscle, to slow down the loss
      of autonomy in the elderly living in the home. Our main objective is to evaluate the impact
      of a PEP, targeted on adapted muscle strengthening devices, on the loss of autonomy for the
      acts of daily life in the person aged over 70 living at home.

      The elderly will be identified during their call in the home centers of the town halls to get
      a housekeeper. After information, inclusion and randomization into two groups in the
      consultation site, the intervention group volunteers will follow the PEP for 24 weeks; the
      control group volunteers will receive a counseling booklet. Both groups will be followed at
      week 24 and 52.
