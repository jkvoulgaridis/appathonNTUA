  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Moderate to severe postoperative pain often influence patients quality of recovery after
      hepatectomy. Systemic opioids given with patient-controlled analgesia has been used after
      hepatectomy in many medical center, but the analgesic effect can be limited and undesirable
      side effects may bring about negative effects on patients recovery. Regional block has been
      proved to improve patients postoperative recovery in many kinds of surgeries.

      The investigators therefore designed a prospective, randomized, subject and assessor blinded,
      parallel-group, placebo controlled study to test the hypothesis that continuous right
      thoracic paravertebral block increase patients quality of recovery score on the 7th
      postoperative day after hepatectomy in patients receiving i.v. patient-controlled analgesia
      (PCA) with morphine.

    <description>The postoperative recovery quality is evaluated with QoR-15 questionnaire. The QoR-15 is a 15-item questionnaire intended to measure QoR after anesthesia and surgery. It comprises five subscales: pain (2 items), physical comfort (5 items), physical independence (2 items), psychological support (2 items), and emotional state (4 items) [2 Stark PA, Myles PS, Burke JA. Development and psychometric evaluation of a postoperative quality of recovery score: the QoR- 15. Anesthesiology. 2013;118(6):1332.]. Each item is scored from 0 to 10, and the possible total score ranges from 0(extremely poor quality of recovery) to 150 (excellent quality of re covery).</description>
