  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of twice-daily (BID) oral CR845 1.0 mg in patients with PBC with
      moderate-to-severe pruritus. The study includes a 16-week Treatment Period.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will consist of a Screening Visit, a 7-day Run-in Period, a 16-week Treatment
      Period, and a Follow-up Visit (approximately 7-10 days after the last dose of study drug).
      Informed consent will be obtained prior to performing any study-specific procedures.

      The Screening Visit will occur within 7 to 28 days prior to randomization to assess
      eligibility.

      Day 1 of the Treatment Period will be defined as the day of the administration of the first
      dose of study drug. If patients continue to meet all inclusion and no exclusion criteria at
      the end of the 7-day Run-in Period, they will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either
      placebo or CR845 tablets at a dose of 1.0 mg orally BID for 16 weeks.

    <description>Intensity of itch will be measured using an NRS used to indicate the intensity of the worst itching over the past 24 hours using a 0 to 10 numeric rating scale, where &quot;0&quot; represents &quot;no itching&quot; and &quot;10&quot; represents &quot;worst itching imaginable&quot;.</description>

    <description>The Skindex-10 Scale is a multidimensional questionnaire which assesses itch-related quality of life over the past week. The questions cover 3 domains: disease, mood/emotional distress, and social functioning domain. A lower total score represents better quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Improvement in itch-related quality of life as assessed by the change from baseline to Week 16 in 5-D Itch Scale score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The 5-D Itch Scale is a multidimensional questionnaire which assesses itch-related quality of life over the past 2 weeks. The questions cover five dimensions of itch including the degree, duration of itch/day, direction (improvement/worsening), disability (impact on activities such as work), and body distribution of itch. A lower total score represents better quality of life.</description>

    <description>Intensity of itch will be measured using an NRS used to indicate the intensity of the worst itching over the past 24 hours using a 0 to 10 numeric rating scale, where &quot;0&quot; represents &quot;no itching&quot; and &quot;10&quot; represents &quot;worst itching imaginable&quot;.</description>
