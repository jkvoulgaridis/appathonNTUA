  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-center, non-randomized phase 2, first-in-iliac artery study, to
      evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the WRAPSODY Stent Graft for the treatment of
      peripheral arterial occlusive disease in symptomatic subjects with de novo or restenotic
      lesions in the common iliac artery (CIA) and/or external iliac artery (EIA), including
      lesions at the aortic bifurcation.

      Approximately 30 subjects will be enrolled. Post study procedure subjects will have planned
      follow-up visits at 4 weeks, 24, 36 and 52 weeks, and unscheduled visits as medically
      necessary,

      The primary study safety endpoint is the proportion of subjects free from a composite of
      device- or procedure-related death, myocardial infarction, or amputation above the
      metatarsals in the treated leg resulting from a vascular event, or device- or
      procedure-related serious adverse events within 4 weeks of the index procedure. The primary
      clinical effectiveness endpoint is the proportion of subjects with a composite improvement of
      at least 1 Rutherford category and patency as evaluated by duplex ultrasound at 4 weeks after
      index procedure.
