  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of durvalumab
      and tremelimumab with platinum-pemetrexed in patients with metastatic NSCLC (T790+ve or
      T790M-ve) following progression on EGFR Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors..

      Study population:

      Individuals may be eligible to enrol in this trial if aged 18 or over and have been diagnosed
      with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (T790+ve or T790M-ve) following progression on EGFR
      Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors.

      Study details:

      All participants enrolled in this trial will begin with induction therapy which involves 4
      cycles of durvalumab 1500mg and tremelimumab 75mg with cisplatin 75mg/m2 or carboplatin AUC
      5, and pemetrexed 500mg/m2 intravenously every 3 weeks.

      Participants will then move into a maintenance phase of durvalumab 1500mg and pemetrexed
      500mg/m2 once every 4 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable side effects.

      All patients will be reviewed every three to four weeks by blood samples, CT scans and side
      effect assessments.

      It is hoped that the findings from this trial will provide information on whether treatment
      with durvalumab and tremelimumab with platinum-pemetrexed is feasible, safe and effective for
      the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (T790+ve or T790M-ve).
