      The main purposes of this study are to determine:

        1. To assess the safety and tolerability of a single subcutaneous injection of different
           doses of TG103 in healthy Chinese adult subjects.

        2. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of a single subcutaneous
           injection of different doses of TG103 in healthy Chinese adult subjects were assessed.
