  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since February 2016, with the objective of improving the quality of life and the autonomy of
      residents, the Le Mans General Hospital uses an interactive &quot;emotional&quot; robot within its
      geriatric wards.

      This emotional robot, Paro, is equipped with a dozen sensors, 3 microphones and interacts
      with its user: it reacts to touch, voice and heat making small sounds and moves its head,
      fins and tail. The algorithm that governs Paro's behavior allows him to offer a behavioral
      answer adapted to the user's stimuli. Thus, Paro is able to communicate beneficial emotions
      to patients.

      To this day however there is no published study exploring the effect of such a robot on team
      dynamics among caregivers in hospital units.

      Our research aims at highlighting the benefits that a healthcare team perceives when working
      with this tool among patients suffering from dementia.

    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Semidirective interviews of the caregivers about their feelings at work, before the introduction of Paro and after 1 month of use. We will use textual analysis software to reveal speech classes to avoid analysis bias and interpretation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Impact of PARO on the caregivers perception of their own health.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Use of the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP). The NHP consists of two parts. The first part focuses on health and comprises 38 items which deal with pain, energy, sleep, mobility, emotional reaction and social isolation. The second part focuses on life areas affected and consists of 7 items which deal with problems regarding occupation, housework, social life, family life, sexual function, hobbies and holidays. All questions have only yes/no answer options and each section score is weighted. The higher the score, the greater the number and severity of problems. The highest score in any section is 100.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Impact of PARO on the caregivers perception of their own stress at work.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Measure of the level of stress using the Perceived Stress Scale: 10 item questionnaire, with responses ranging from 0 to 4 for each item, with a range from 0 to 40, 0 being no perceived stress ans 40 the maximum perceived stress.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Impact of PARO on the caregivers perception of their own anxiety at work.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Measure of the perceived anxiety through the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS, a 14 item questionnaire, each item on the questionnaire is scored from 0-3 and this means that a person can score between 0 and 21 for either anxiety or depression, 0 being no perceived anxiety and 21 the maximum perceived anxiety).</description>
