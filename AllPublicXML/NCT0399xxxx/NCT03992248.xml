  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Modern life is characterized by a 24-hour lifestyle in which food intake is no longer
      restricted to daytime. As a result, we tend to eat throughout the day. When we eat we both
      use energy and store it for later use. Eating for a prolonged period of time makes it
      unnecessary for the body to use this energy storage. We hypothesize that the decreased use of
      energy stores has detrimental effects on our sugar balance, mainly on insulin sensitivity.
      Conversely, we think that eating within a limited period during the day can improve insulin
      sensitivity in people with type 2 diabetes by an increased use of energy reserves,
      specifically liver sugar stores. Therefore, this study examines the effect of eating within a
      limited time frame during the day on insulin sensitivity and liver sugar stores of people
      with type 2 diabetes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Modern life is characterized by a 24-hour lifestyle in which food intake is no longer
      restricted to daytime. Interestingly, the majority of people spread their food intake over
      ~15 hours per day. This implies that most people experience a relatively short
      post-absorptive (fasting) state during night time. Normally, the body relies heavily on
      hepatic glycogen content to provide glucose and energy during the night, and glycogen stores
      will therefore decrease over night. In the morning, ingested carbohydrates will be taken up
      rapidly to replenish glycogen stores. We hypothesize that in people with type 2 diabetes
      mellitus (T2DM) hepatic glycogen stores may not fully deplete overnight and that restricting
      food to a shorter period of time during the day will lead to a reduction of hepatic glycogen
      stores, and thereby improve whole-body insulin sensitivity at the beginning of the day.
      Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate if time restricted feeding (TRF) leads to
      a reduction in overnight-fasted hepatic glycogen stores and improvement in insulin
      sensitivity in adults with T2DM.

    <masking_description>Due to the nature of this study, it is not possible to mask the intervention effect for the investigator or the participant. During randomisation, the intervention arms will be coded with A and B and the independent researcher will be unaware which intervention is assigned to which letter. With this approach, concealed allocation will be guaranteed. Additionally, the person in charge with the data quality check and the data analyses will be blinded for the interventions using this same randomisation codes to generate unbiased results.</masking_description>
