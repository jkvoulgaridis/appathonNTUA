  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several drugs and chemotherapies seem to have an impact on the immune system. This study
      investigates reports of immune toxicities such as antiphospholipid syndrome, including the
      International classification of disease ICD-10 for treatments in the World Health
      Organization (WHO) global Individual Case Safety Report (ICSR) database (VigiBase).

    <textblock>
      Several drugs and chemotherapies seem to have an impact on the immune system and are
      responsible of a wide range of immune side effects such as antiphospholipid syndrome. Those
      are poorly described, due to the modificationof the pharmacopeia, and the recent recognition
      of several of these adverseevents.

      This study investigates the main characteristics of patients affected by immune side effects
      imputed to drugs in particular antiphospholipid syndrome.

      A causality assessment according to the WHO-UMC (World Health Organization - Uppsala
      Monitoring Center) is systematically applied.
