      Objective: The investigators aim to compare the licensed Brainlab IplanÂ® software, considered
      the gold standard, to the 3D slicers and Blender freeware for the segmentation of the
      unilateral cleft defect, as well as the creation of individual 3D template for development of
      the bone graft.

      Study design Retrospective, pilot study Patients presenting at the division of maxillofacial
      surgery at the AZ Sint-Jan Brugge-Oostende av (Belgium) or the 1st department of pediatrics
      at the USemmelweis (Hungary) for bone graft surgery of the unilateral cleft receive a
      complete routine work-up, including a cone-beam CT (CBCT). A single surgeon will run all the
      virtual planning steps with both the licensed software and the freeware. Timing of the four
      major steps will be measured with a digital chronometer
      (http://www.online-stopwatch.com/download-stopwatch/).

      Ten children, 5 Belgian patients and 5 Hungarian patients, that already had a work-up and
      surgery for a unilateral cleft requiring a bone graft, will be planned. This based on the
      preoperative CBCT that is already present, by using both the licensed software and free
      software. The investigator will register patients' age, gender and cleft size and register
      the required time to complete the different planning steps, as well as list the number of
      actions to complete the planning, and the occurrence of software bugs. In addition, the
      learning effect will be examined through comparison of the different cases planned by the
      same surgeon. All patients will be planned twice with an interval of two weeks in order to
      measure intra-observer reliability. Moreover, a second surgeon will also plan the 10 cases to
      measure inter-observer reliability.

      Main study endpoints The investigators hypothesize that the licensed software is more
      user-friendly, ensuring a significant shorter overall treatment planning time to create a
      model for accurate bone transfer from the iliac crest to the jawbone.
