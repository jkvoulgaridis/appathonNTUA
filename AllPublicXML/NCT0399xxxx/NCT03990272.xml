  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a common disease of nasal mucosa, affecting 10% to 40% of the
      population globally. Allergen specific immunotherapy (AIT) is the only etiological treatment
      available for AR.Traditionally, AIT is divided into subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) and
      sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT). Artemisia annua is one of the most important allergen that
      is responsible for seasonal AR in China during July and October.

      The trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentred, phase III trial.
      702 subjects with allergic rhinitis caused by Artemisia pollen were recruited and randomized
      to the immunotherapy group and placebo group.

    <measure>daily combined scores of medication and rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms (CSMRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>at the peak pollen season(The start was defined as the first of 3 consecutive days with a pollen count of 50 pollen/m3 or greater each day. The end was defined as the last occurrence of 3 consecutive days with ≥50 pollen/m3 each day)</time_frame>
    <description>the daily combined scores of medication and rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms (CSMRS) (ranging from 0 to 6); which was calculated as the combined score of daily average scores of 6 rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms (rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, nasal itching, sneezing, ocular pruritus, and watery eyes) and the daily rescue medication score</description>

    <description>dTNSS was the sum of four nasal symptom scores for nasal congestion, discharge, itching and sneezing (ranging from 0 to 12). Nasal symptoms during the pollen season were rated on a 4-point scale, while 0 = no symptoms, 1 = mild symptoms (sign/symptom clearly present, but minimal awareness; easily tolerated), 2 = moderate symptoms (definite awareness of sign/symptom that is bothersome but tolerable), and 3 = severe symptoms (sign/symptom that is hard to tolerate; causes interference with activities of daily living and/or sleeping)</description>

    <measure>daily Rescue Medication Scores (dRMS)</measure>

    <description>dRMS is the rescue medication score in each day during the peak pollen season (ranging from 0 to 3). 0 = no rescue medication uses, 1 = Oral and/or topical non-sedative H1 antihistamines, 2 = Intranasal corticosteroids (Rhinocort) with/without H1 antihistamines, and 3 = Oral corticosteroids with/without intranasal corticosteroids, with/without H1 antihistamines.</description>
