  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intradialytic hypotension is a common complication of hemodialysis sessions in patients with
      chronic renal failure, with an estimated prevalence of 10 to 30%. This hypotensopn is
      classically defined by a decrease in systolic blood pressure greater than 30 mmHg associated
      with clinical signs (cramps, abdominal pain, unconsciousness, convulsions). Its repetition is
      correlated with cardiovascular events, neurological events and excess mortality. Several
      clinical factors have been proposed to predict the risk of intradialytic hypotension such as
      age, certain comorbidities (diabetes, ischemic heart disease...), dialysis modalities
      (hemodialysis), ultrafiltration, conductivity but also alterations of the autonomic nervous
      system (especially the sympathetic system).

      In recent years, the study of vegetative functions has been facilitated by the use of
      SUDOSCAN® (Impeto, Paris, France) which is a simple, non-invasive tool that allows the study
      of Chlorine conductance directly reflecting the activity of small non-myelinated C fibers
      that innervate the sweat glands. SUDOSCAN® has shown good sensitivity and specificity in the
      diagnosis of vegetative damage in diabetic patients and also a good correlation with cardiac
      autonomic neuropathy. More recently, SUDOSCAN® has shown good sensitivity in the detection of
      neuropathies small fibers especially in diabetic patients. This sensitivity is comparable to
      QST-type quantitative tests and the correlation with cardiovascular dysautonomia tests is
      good. This test, simple and fast realization, does not require the active participation of
      the patient. There is a good correlation between the results of SUDOSCAN® and the reduction
      of intra-dermal fiber density at cutaneous biopsy.

      Hemodialysis patients are at risk of peripheral neurological involvement not only because of
      an increasing incidence of diabetes (30-40%) but also because of the abnormal production and
      elimination of certain uremic toxins. Few studies exist on the anomalies of the vegetative
      system in hemodialysis. A recent publication has suggested a difference in nerve excitability
      depending on the type of hemodialysis suggesting nerve changes secondary to ionic changes.
      The identification of patients at risk of intradialytic hypotension during dialysis sessions
      could be useful for adapting hemodialysis protocols.

      Patients will be classified into 2 groups according to the occurrence of intradialytic
      hypotension. Group 1 corresponds to patients with intradialytic hypotension and group 2
      corresponds to patients without intradialytic hypotension.

Group 1 corresponds to patients with intradialytic hypotension and group 2 corresponds to patients without intradialytic hypotension. This study aims to measure the cutaneous conductance to chlorine by SUDOSCAN® in all dialysis patients and to seek a link between the results of this examination and the occurrence of discomfort during hemodialysis sessions.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The additional examination, related to this research protocol, corresponds to a record of cutaneous conductance with chlorine. This recording of 2 min 30 is done thanks to SUDOSCAN® within 30 minutes before the dialysis session (before the &quot;connection&quot; to the dialysis machine) and within 30 minutes after the end of the dialysis with a measurement of the tension blood pressure and heart rate immediately before SUDOSCAN®.</description>
