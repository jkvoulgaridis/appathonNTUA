  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      sEphB-HSA may prevent tumor cells from multiplying and blocks several compounds that promote
      the growth of blood vessels that bring nutrients to the tumor. The purpose of this study is
      to learn if sEphB4-HSA will decrease the number or size of Kaposi sarcoma lesions in people.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      sEphB4-HSA will be given through an intravenous infusion (into a vein). Each cycle of
      sEphB4-HSA will be 28 days (4 weeks). Each cycle of the study drug includes administration of
      2 doses of sEphB4-HSA given on Days 1 and 15 of each cycle.

      Participants may continue on study protocol as long as their KS is continuing to respond or
      is clinically stable on study medication.

      Patients may come off treatment for the following reasons:

        -  Disease progression.

        -  Need for more than 2 dose reductions for toxicity.

        -  Dose delay more than 28 days.

        -  Patient withdraws consent.

        -  Study termination by the Sponsor.

        -  Participants who are noncompliant with respect to taking drugs, keeping appointments, or
           having tests required for the evaluation of drug safety and efficacy.

        -  Participant's condition renders them unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment
           of the investigator.

    <time_frame>Every 4 weeks until study completion (average 6 months).</time_frame>
    <description>The observed proportions of participants experiencing clinical response and unacceptable toxicity will be calculated with 95% confidence intervals. For clinical response, the Kaplan-Meier method will be used to estimate the distribution for time to death assessed for up to 1 month after treatment completion; for time to progression assessed from chemotherapy initiation to first documented progression up to 1 month after treatment completion; and for time to response assessed from the first dose until first documented response up to 1 month after completion of treatment. The Kaplan-Meier method will then be used to estimate the distribution of time to response, time to relapse, and time to death. Adverse events will be tabulated according to type and severity.</description>

                  federally approved, licensed HIV rapid test within 4 weeks prior to study
                  enrollment will suffice. If the initial rapid test is positive, further approved
                  confirmatory test results must be present to document the subject's HIV status.

               -  If participant is HIV positive, participant must be on a stable antiretroviral

          -  There should be no evidence for improvement in Kaposi Sarcoma in the 3 months prior to
             study enrollment, unless there is evidence for progression of Kaposi Sarcoma in the 4
             weeks immediately prior to study enrollment.

          -  Participants must, in the opinion of the investigator, be capable of complying with
             the protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability to understand and inability to provide informed consent.

          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Participants who have had anti-neoplastic treatment for KS (including chemotherapy,
             radiotherapy, local treatment including topical 5-FU, biological therapy or
             investigational therapy) within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C)
             prior to entering the study OR those who have not recovered from adverse events due to
             agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          -  Participants with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to sEphB4-HSA or other agents used in study.

          -  Concurrent, acute, active infection, or treatment for infection, other than oral
             thrush or genital herpes, within 14 days of enrollment. Mycobacterium avium complex
             (MAC) that is undergoing treatment is allowed.

          -  Participants for whom front-line cytotoxic therapy is indicated (i.e. symptomatic
             visceral or pulmonary Kaposi Sarcoma or symptomatic Kaposi Sarcoma impairing

          -  Previous local therapy of any KS-indicator lesion unless the lesion has clearly
             progressed since that local treatment. Any prior local treatment to indicator lesions
             regardless of the elapsed time should not be allowed unless there is evidence of
             clear-cut progression of said lesion.

          -  Female participants who are pregnant, lactating, or breast-feeding.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because sEphB4-HSA has not been tested in
             pregnant women and it could have potential teratogenic or abortifacient effects.
             Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants
             secondary to treatment of the mother with sEphB4-HSA, breastfeeding should be
             discontinued if the mother is treated with sEphB4-HSA.

             diastolic blood pressure &gt; 90, even mm Hg, with or without use of anti-hypertensive
             medications. (participants may not enroll onto the study until BP is ‚â§ 140/90 mm Hg
             with or without antihypertensives).

          -  Participants with a recent history (&lt; 6 months) of a major bleed which will be defined
             as a symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ, such as intracranial,
