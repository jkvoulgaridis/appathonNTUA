  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants from 14 different countries received a single session of biofield therapy (Okada
      Purifying Therapy) lasting 30 minutes or longer from the volunteer practitioners. Before and
      after the therapy, they reported the severity of physical pain, anxiety/depression,
      dizziness/palpitation, and overall symptoms. The team compared the effectiveness/safety of
      biofield therapy between countries and analyzed the factors associated with the outcomes.

      Participants aged 16 or older from 14 different countries (Japan, USA, Argentina, Brazil,
      Chile, Mexico, Peru, Taiwan, Thai, South Korea, Belgium, France, Portugal, and Spain)
      received a single session of biofield therapy (Okada Purifying Therapy) lasting 30 minutes or
      longer from the volunteer practitioners in their country of residence. Before and after the
      intervention, they reported each severity level of physical pain, anxiety/depression,
      dizziness/palpitation, and overall symptoms. The team compared the improvement/exacerbation
      rate of a single session of biofield therapy between the countries, and examined the adjusted
      odds ratio of the variables associated with the changes in each category of symptoms in a
      real-world setting.

    <description>The practitioner raises his/her hand forward towards the recipient with the palm directed toward the recipient. The practitioner uses his/her hands alternately during the administration of Okada Purifying Therapy. The distance between the palm and the body is usually 1-2 feet, with each session typically lasting 30 to 60 minutes.</description>
