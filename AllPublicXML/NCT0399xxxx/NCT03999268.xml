  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the I-START study is to evaluate an educational phone application (app)
      designed to support patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) by reinforcing the necessary skills
      needed for insulin administration as part of diabetes self-management.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite advances in technology and delivery systems, patients with T2DM continue to be
      reluctant to begin and adhere to insulin therapy for a variety of reasons. Introducing
      insulin therapy is particularly problematic during a hospitalization or a brief routine
      outpatient visit given time and resource constraints. Teaching people to administer an
      insulin injection requires time and ongoing support. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate
      an educational phone application designed to support patients with T2DM by reinforcing skills
      and self-management behaviors needed for insulin administration. Patients with T2DM who are
      starting insulin or need updated instruction on insulin will be invited to participate in
      this study to examine the effect of the phone app on psychological barriers to insulin as
      well as patient and provider satisfaction with and usability of the phone app in both
      outpatient and hospital settings.

    <measure>Change from baseline in psychological insulin resistance at 2 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Psychological insulin resistance will be assessed using the Barriers to Insulin Treatment Questionnaire (BIT), a short instrument that is easy to administer and may be used by both clinicians and researchers (Petrak et al, 2007). The BIT Questionnaire includes 14 items, a total sum score, and the following five subscales: fear of injection and self-testing, expectations regarding positive insulin related outcomes, expected hardship from insulin treatment, stigmatization by insulin injection, and fear of hypoglycemia. Each item is scored on a scale from 1 to 10, which are summed and averaged for total scores; the higher the score, the greater the level of concern.</description>

    <intervention_name>I-START</intervention_name>
    <description>Designed as a supplementary educational tool for patients on insulin therapy, I-START includes an injection plan to reinforce the knowledge and behaviors that users have been taught by their health care provider. This is done through eight modules created for the benefit of new and experienced insulin users, and those using pens or vial/syringes. The modules address a variety of topics pertinent to insulin therapy, including overcoming psychosocial barriers, injection techniques and best practices, managing hypo- and hyperglycemic events, monitoring blood glucose and troubleshooting and problem solving. At the end of each module, users can self-evaluate their confidence in mastering the information presented. This gives them the ability to move forward into the next module, repeat material already presented and/or save features of the modules that they would like to revisit at another time.</description>

    <description>Standard best practices for training patients to administer insulin therapy include 1) a thorough patient assessment prior to therapy initiation to address barriers, including evaluation for diminished cognitive capacity or other problem that may impair safe insulin self-administration, and assessment of health literacy and numeracy skills; 2) observation of a patient's injection practice, with re-education provided as needed; 3) use of appropriate language is necessary when teaching injection technique; 4) dose preparation, which includes inspecting the insulin dose for accuracy (following manufacturer instructions); and 5) review of signs, symptoms and treatment of hypoglycemia must be included as a critical component of the training.</description>
