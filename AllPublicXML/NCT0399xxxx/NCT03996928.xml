  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is more and more evidence of the importance of the role of kinesitherapy in the
      management of epicondylitis, specifically (but not exclusively) of eccentric exercise. Since
      eccentric kinesitherapy, when applied in a systematic way by a physiotherapist, consumes time
      and human resources in a significant way, and in the case of such a prevalent pathology, it
      is frequent that strategies of training the patient are addressed so that this is who perform
      the exercises after learning them. However, it is not proven that the efficacy and safety of
      this approach is equivalent to treatment applied by a physiotherapist.

      A randomized single-blind controlled trial is conducted that compares both treatment
      approaches for epicondylitis (eccentric exercises applied directly by a physiotherapist for
      10 sessions, and eccentric exercises applied by the patient during the same time) in terms of
      efficacy against pain, functionality and patient satisfaction, all this within the framework
      of the public health system.

      The main objective of this study is:

      To compare the efficacy of an eccentric exercise program applied to patients with
      epicondylosis by a structured manual program in ten sessions and by an illustrated booklet.

      The specific objectives of this study are:

      Compare the effectiveness of the above-cited approaches in terms of pain Compare the
      effectiveness of the above-cited approaches in terms of function Compare the effectiveness of
      the above-cited approaches in terms of satisfaction

INDEPENDENT VARIABLES
Age, Sex, Work activity (referred to a superior member): intense -including, among other kind of activities, keyboards users and housewives-light.
Basal pain according to visual analogue scale (VAS) of 100 mm. Baseline disability according to the DASH questionnaire (Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand), which is self-administered.
DEPENDENT VARIABLES
Pain according to the aforementioned scale just after treatment (2 weeks) and at 3 months.
Disability according to the aforementioned questionnaire just after the treatment (2 weeks) and at three months.
Satisfaction with the treatment right after it (2 weeks) and at three months. A Likert scale of five points ( very satisfied, satisfied, neither satisfied nor unsatisfied, very unsatisfied) will be used.
Co-interventions (Systemic and/or topical route drugs, physiotherapy modalities received outside the system, use of orthoses).</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) quantifies of pain described by the patient with maximum reproducibility among observers. It consists of a 10-centimeter horizontal line, at the ends of which the extreme expressions of a symptom are marked: no pain on the left wiht a score 0, and the highest possible pain on the right wiht a score 10. The patient is asked to mark the point that indicates the intensity in the line and is measured with a millimeter ruler. The intensity is expressed in centimeters or millimeters.
A value lower than 4 in the VAS means mild or mild-moderate pain, a value between 4 and 6 implies the presence of moderate-severe pain, and a value greater than 6 implies the presence of very intense pain.</description>
