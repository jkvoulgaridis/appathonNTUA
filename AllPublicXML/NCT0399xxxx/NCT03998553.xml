  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In vitro maturation (IVM) is a technique for obtaining potentially fertilizable oocytes from
      immature oocytes. An oocyte must be mature both nuclearly and cytoplasmically in order to be
      competent in the reproductive process. Nuclear maturation involves an oocyte in metaphase II
      stage and is easily evaluated for its morphology. However, cytoplasmic maturation can only be
      evaluated by in vitro fertilization of that oocyte A mature nuclear and cytoplasmic oocyte is
      one capable of producing a viable embryo. This study aims to fine-tune the in vitro
      maturation (IVM) technique to achieve nuclear mature oocytes, i.e., to mature the oocytes up
      to the metaphase II stage. In addition, an artificial oocyte activation (AOA) will be carried
      out to check the cytoplasmic maturation of the oocytes, avoiding the generation of
      potentially viable embryos.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the response to the strategy stimulation with highly
      purified human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG-HP) administered for three days, in association
      with a standard methodology of in vitro oocyte maturation (IVM), to be performed on oocyte
      donors.

      The correct functioning of this IVM technique would mean a reduction in the costs of ovarian
      stimulation treatments, as lower doses and shorter stimulation times are required, which
      implies lower risks for women derived from the medication and less stress for them.
