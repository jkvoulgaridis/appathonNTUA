    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled clinical trial to compare the pregnancy outcomes of
      infertile women with recurrent implantation failure. The study population consisted of
      infertile women with a history of recurrent implantation failure who had failed to achieve a
      clinical pregnancy which at least four good quality embryos transfers and are now candidate
      for IVF-ICSI or freeze embryo transfer cycles with and without intra uterine infusion of
      platelet rich plasma in Reproductive Biomedicine Research Center, Royan institute, Tehran
      Iran.

    <textblock>
      Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) is a blood product with a high platelet and a normal plasma
      fibrinogen level. Given the effective factors of RPR in repairing damaged tissues, its
      application in the field of regenerative medicine has widely been interested over the last
      three decades. According to the literature, PRP is an effective and safe treatment in the
      fields of orthopaedics, dermatology, ophthalmology, and repair of neurological, vascular, and
      connective tissue damage, but its application in the field of infertility is limited to a few
      pilot studies in which the effects of PRP on endometrium and recurrent implantation failure
      (RIF) were investigated. Given the importance of endometrial compliance and according to
      molecular studies, which indicate that endometrial growth factors in women with a history of
      RIF are lower than normal fertile women, PRP, along with other existing strategies, can be
      used to improve endometrial compliance in patients with a history of RIF. The present
      randomized, controlled clinical trial is proposed to determine the efficacy of PRP in the
      treatment of patients with RIF in the cycles of IVF-ICSI and frozen embryo transfer at Royan
      Institute.

    <description>In IVF-ICSI cycles, ovulation will be stimulated through the standard protocol using a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist for all patients. 48 hours after the oocyte retrieval and ensuring that at least 3 good quality embryos are formed, patients will be randomized into two groups of with and without PRP intrauterine injection. For all patients, 2 embryos in the blastocyst stage with excellent or good quality will be transferred. One milliliter PRP will be injected into the patients' uterine cavity using an embryo transfer catheter (Labotect Gmbh, Labor-Technik-Gottingen Kampweg 12, 37124 Rosdorf, Germany) 48 hours before embryo transfer. In order to eliminate the effects of catheter insertion, the same catheter will be applied to the patients in the control group 48 hours before the embryo transfer without any injections.</description>
