    <measure>Number Of Participants Who Experienced Severe Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (postdose) through Day 30</time_frame>
    <description>TEAEs were defined as any adverse event (AE) with a start date on or after administration of the study drug (on Day 1). A severe AE was defined as an AE that was incapacitating and required medical intervention. The number of participants who experienced 1 or more severe TEAEs after dosing on Day 1 through the Follow-up Visit (Day 30) is presented. A summary of serious and all other non-serious AEs regardless of causality is located in the Reported Adverse Events module.</description>

    <measure>Percentage Of Participants Who Had Treatment Success Following A Single Instillation Of Study Drug With A Dwell Time Up To 90 Minutes</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (up to 90 mins postdose)</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment success is defined as the restoration of CVAD functionality, measured as the ability to withdraw 3 mL of blood and infuse 5 mL of saline. For this assessment, dwell time was up to 90 minutes. The percentage was calculated as the number of participants who had treatment success divided by the total number of participants in the group, multiplied by 100%.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. CVAD dysfunction, defined as the inability to withdraw 3 mL of blood.

          2. All types of single or multi-lumen CVADs, implanted ports and peripherally inserted
             central catheters in place for &gt;24 hours;

          3. Ability to designate one dysfunctional lumen of a multi-lumen catheter to be used
             throughout the study for both study drug instillation and assessment of CVAD function;

          4. Male and non-pregnant female participants from all racial and ethnic groups, 12 years
             of age and older;

          5. Able to have fluids infused at the volume necessary to instill study drug into the
             CVAD (i.e., up to 2 mL);

          6. Informed consent form signed and dated indicating that the participant (or a legally
             acceptable representative) has been informed of and agreed with all pertinent aspects
             of the study, and is willing to comply with all study requirements and procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. CVAD (any type) used for hemodialysis;

          2. Able to have 3 mL of blood withdrawn from the selected study catheter, following
             repositioning and/or saline flushes (if necessary);

          3. CVAD known to be dysfunctional for more than 48 hours;

          4. Evidence of mechanical or non-thrombotic occlusion in the selected study catheter
             (e.g., catheter malposition or migration, sutures, kinks, or precipitates causing
             obstruction);

          5. Known or suspected catheter related bloodstream infection;

          6. Use of a systemic fibrinolytic agent or anticoagulant (e.g., alteplase, tenecteplase,
             reteplase, urokinase or heparin) within 24 hours prior to the beginning of the
             treatment period (first instillation of study drug);

          7. Known to be at high risk for bleeding events or embolic complications in the opinion
             of the Investigator, or has a known condition for which bleeding constitutes a
             significant hazard (e.g recent stroke, recent intracranial or intraspinal surgery or
             serious head trauma, intracranial neoplasm, arteriovenous malformation or aneurysm,
             known bleeding diathesis);

          8. Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic BP ≥ 160 or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 110
             millimeters of mercury) at screening;

          9. Clinically unstable in the opinion of the site Investigator;

         10. Known to be pregnant or breastfeeding at screening;

         11. Previously treated in this study (READY 2) or in Study READY 1;

         12. History of allergic reaction to reteplase or vial ingredients (excipients or
             diluents);

         13. Use of any investigational drug (defined as any drug that is not US Food and Drug
             Administration approved) within 28 days prior to treatment;

         14. Not mentally, socially, or otherwise able to complete the trial assessment or not
             likely to survive beyond 7 days.
