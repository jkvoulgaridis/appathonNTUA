      legal definitions (Law 378/2007 Sb.).The primary objective of this study is to describe and
      evaluate the changes of depression level within 12 months from the start of tofacitinib
      therapy in patients with RA and at least minimal level of depression. Primary goal is to find
      out if treatment by tofacitinib reduces the depression by at least 10% during 12 months.
