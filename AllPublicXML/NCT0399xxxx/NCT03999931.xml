  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia (Schizophrenia,Sc), biphasic affective disorder (Bipolar disorder,BPD), major
      depression (major depressive disorder,MDD), anxiety disorder (Anxiety disorder,An) and other
      mental disorders have obvious family aggregation, with heritability of 60 -90%. This kind of
      common mental illness seriously affects the psychosomatic health and quality of life of
      patients, and places a great mental and economic burden on the society and family. At
      present, the diagnosis of mental illness is mainly based on clinical symptoms. With the
      development of molecular biology, genomics has become a new way to study mental illness.
      MicroRNA (miRNA) is a class of eukaryotic endogenously non-coding single-stranded RNA, which
      can regulate gene expression by binding to specific mRNA or regulating the protein
      translation process of specific mRNA. MiRNA widely exists in plasma and serum, and the type
      and quantity of miRNA in plasma and serum change with different physiological and disease
      conditions. It is reported that the expression profile of miRNA in brain tissue of
      schizophrenia is significantly different from that of normal subjects. In addition, the study
      found that the specific miRNA detected in peripheral blood can directly reflect the condition
      of the disease, which may use miRNA in peripheral blood as a clinical biological marker. In
      order to detect the expression of various miRNA in plasma, high throughput miRNA chip
      detection has become the first choice for primary screening. In this study, the investigators
      intend to detect the difference of miRNA expression in peripheral blood of different types of
      schizophrenia by high throughput miRNA chip, and analyze the correlation between them. It is
      hoped to provide the basis for the diagnosis and occurrence and development of clinical
      psychotic patients.
