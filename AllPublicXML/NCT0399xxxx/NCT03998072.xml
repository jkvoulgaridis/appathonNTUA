  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Five session CAT (Cognitive Analytic Therapy) consultancy was developed for patients whom
      services 'struggle to help', such as those with diagnoses of personality disorder. Five
      session CAT consultancy works with both patients and care coordinators, utilising key
      elements of CAT including reciprocal roles and reformulation to inform care planning and case
      management. The proposed study expands on the existing evidence base by utilising a
      comparator; a treatment as usual condition. The proposed mixed methods feasibility study will
      compare outcomes for both patients and care coordinators to assess the effectiveness of the
      intervention compared to controls in a community mental health team.
