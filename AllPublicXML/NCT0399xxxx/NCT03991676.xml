  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than 160 million American adults are overweight or obese. Existing weight loss
      interventions from self-help to gold standard behavioral treatments, while often effective,
      do not sufficiently maintain motivation to adhere to dietary goals in the face of powerful
      biological and environmental influences to consume highly palatable foods. Clarification and
      awareness of values, a staple of acceptance-based treatments drawn from Acceptance and
      Commitment Therapy, are thought to enhance autonomous motivation to engage in behaviors
      consistent with one's personal life values (e.g., health) in the presence of countervailing
      forces (e.g., hunger, deprivation). However, the independent efficacy of values clarification
      and awareness in facilitating weight control has never been tested. This pilot study seeks to
      investigate the feasibility and acceptability of a series of three weight loss workshops
      (based off the gold standard) infused with values clarification and awareness techniques to
      promote weight control. Participants will be asked to follow a reduced-calorie dietary
      prescription while holding their values in mind in moments of dietary decision-making over
      the course of one month. The primary aims of this study are to: 1) develop the series of
      values-infused workshops, using participant feedback to iterate and improve the treatment
      manual; and 2) evaluate treatment acceptability. Secondary aims are: 1) to evaluate whether
      clinically meaningful changes in measures of values clarification and values awareness occur;
      2) to evaluate whether the intervention will lead participants to experience clinically
      meaningful changes in values-congruent weight control behaviors; 3) to evaluate whether the
      intervention will lead participants to experience clinically meaningful changes in weight;
      and 4) to evaluate theorized mechanisms of action in the intervention.

    <measure>Participant acceptability and satisfaction with the intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at post-treatment (1 month).</time_frame>
    <description>Participant acceptability and satisfaction with the intervention will be assessed using an idiosyncratic self-report Acceptability Questionnaire, developed for the present study. Questions include items assessing how satisfied participants were with the intervention, how helpful they found it, and how likely they would be to recommend it to others. Scores range from 1 to 5 for each item, where higher values represent greater satisfaction and acceptability.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Values clarity</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at baseline and post-treatment (1 month) assessments.</time_frame>
    <description>Values clarity will be measured with the Values Clarity and Awareness Interview (VCAI), an unstructured clinical interview adapted from a previous self-report measure of values clarity constructed by Forman and colleagues. The VCAI was chosen because it is the only existing measure of values clarity. Scores range from 0 to 3 for each value described, where higher values represent greater values clarity. Scores for each value described are then averaged to compute an overall clarity score.</description>

    <description>Values awareness will be measured with the Values Clarity and Awareness Interview (VCAI), an unstructured clinical interview adapted from a previous self-report measure of values clarity constructed by Forman and colleagues. The VCAI was chosen because it is the only existing measure of values awareness. Scores range from 0 to 4, where higher values represent greater values awareness.</description>

    <measure>Values-congruent weight control behavior</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at baseline and post-treatment (1 month) assessments.</time_frame>
    <description>The consistency with which individuals enact weight control behaviors in accordance with their values will be measured using an adapted Valued Living Questionnaire (VLQ) that assesses valued living as it relates to weight control in particular. Scores range from 1-10 for each of 10 valued domains of living, where higher scores represent greater personal importance and consistency with one's values.</description>

    <measure>Weight</measure>

    <measure>Autonomous motivation</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at baseline and post-treatment (1 month) assessments.</time_frame>
    <description>Autonomous motivation to enact health behaviors will be measured using the Autonomous Motivation subscale of an adapted Treatment Self-Regulation Questionnaire (TSRQ) for weight loss. Scores range from 1-7, where higher scores represent greater autonomous motivation.</description>
