  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exercise has been the cornerstone of diabetes management. However, many diabetic patients
      have ADL disabilities and experience substantial difficulty in performing usual exercises,
      such as brisk walking and upright cycling. There is an urgent need to provide alternative
      exercise modalities for diabetic patients with ADL disabilities. In this study, investigators
      will investigate the effects on the glucose of three exercise modalities, including
      motor-assisted cycling (i.e., cycling on a motor-driven bike) and functional electrical
      stimulation (FES) cycling, during which the investigators will use electrical current to
      facilitate cycling movements.

    <description>Participants will perform the motor-assisted cycling exercise using a physical therapy bike (RECK; Betzenweiler, Germany). Participants will perform 3×10-min bouts of motor-assisted cycling at the highest tolerable cadence. Before each bout, participants will perform 1-2 minutes of motor-assisted cycling at 5-10 rpm as a warm-up.</description>

    <description>The testing procedures will be identical to that in the motor-assisted cycling visit except for the exercise type. Participants will wear FES cuffs on the upper and lower legs, bilaterally.
. The FES cycling will be performed on the motor-assisted bike using the wearable FES equipment. The purpose of motor-assisted cycling is to provide constant cadence. The Bioness L300 Plus system (Bioness, Valencia, CA) will be worn on the upper and lower legs to stimulates the quadriceps and dorsiflexors muscles during the motor-driven cycling exercise. An embedded gyroscope of the cuff can detect the motion of the lower leg so that the electrical stimulations will be generated at appropriate timing to activate leg muscles during the cycling exercise.</description>
