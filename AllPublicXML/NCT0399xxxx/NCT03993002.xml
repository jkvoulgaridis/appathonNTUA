  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The mortality burden of trauma in the United States is substantial, and is currently the
      leading cause of death in warfare and in civilians below age 45. Infection and sepsis are
      leading causes of morbidity and death in early survivors. Pneumonia (PNA) occurs in 17-36% of
      ventilated trauma patients; far more than non-trauma patients. The long held dogmatic notion
      of a mechanical predisposition to development of pneumonia in trauma has lacked robust
      support. However, there is evidence of the innate immune response to injury plays a major
      role in increasing susceptibility to infection.

      This application is for support of a Focused Program Award addressing the role that &quot;danger
      signaling&quot; due to &quot;danger associated molecular patterns&quot; (or DAMPs) derived from somatic
      tissue injuries play in altering innate immune signaling in the lung in ways that predisposes
      to PNA. This innate immune response plays a pivotal role in the development and progression
      of lung inflammation. The organization of the Focused Program Award is into six Projects with
      collaborators from the Departments of Surgery, Medicine and Anesthesiology at Beth Israel
      Deaconess Medical Center; the Department of Surgery at Brigham and Women's Hospital and the
      Departments of Biology and Biological Engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

      The human subjects interaction portion of this project is covered in the Human Subjects &amp;
      Samples Project of the Award, although the information and tissues obtained from this Project
      will be shared with the other Projects, and the activities planned for those Projects are
      outlined in this application.

      The purpose of the interventional group is to address Aim 3 of this research study. Aim 3
      will be accomplished by randomizing eligible patients to normoxic or hyperoxic conditions
      with normocarbic or hypercarbic blood concentrations through ventilator adjustments per the
      factorial design. All four groups are considered within the bounds of standard practice for
      many mechanically ventilated patients. Investigators will exclude patients in whom these
      settings could be detrimental. The patient will be on the study settings by hour 60 of
      mechanical ventilation, and these settings will be held for 48 hours from achieving the
      target partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) levels. Upon enrollment, an arterial line will be
      placed if there is not already one in place, and an arterial blood gas (ABG) will be drawn if
      no ABG has been drawn in the prior 12 hours to enrollment. Over 1-3 hours following
      ventilator adjustments, several ABGs will be drawn in order to determine the need for
      additional ventilator adjustments. Foreseeable adjustments include changes to FiO2,
      respiratory rate, and tidal volume. Once the desired PaO2 level is achieved (&quot;time 0&quot;),
      investigators will obtain an ABG q12 hours throughout the 48 hour interventional period.
      After maintaining the ventilator settings for 48 hours, ventilator management will revert to
      the clinical team. Blood and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) will be collected from the patient
      at time of enrollment.
