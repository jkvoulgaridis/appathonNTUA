    <textblock>
      External Counterpulsation Therapy (ECP) is a therapeutic procedure that performed on patients
      with angina or heart failure to relieve the ischaemic symptoms, improve functional capacity,
      and quality of life. In recent studies, ECP has already proved to reduce angina symptoms,
      decrease degree of ischemic in heart train test. External Counterpulsation Therapy (ECP)
      therapy is a non-invasive technique for sequentially pressuring calf, lower thighs, and upper
      thighs through developed cuffs at pressure above systolic blood pressure when diastole, then
      deflated at systole.

      This study aims to evaluate the effect of ECP therapy on cardiovascular hemodynamic, coronary
      perfusion, endothelial function, angiogenesis and artery genesis of the coronary blood vessel
      to refractory angina pectoris patients Refractory angina pectoris patients in Harapan Kita
      hospitals who do not respond to drugs adequately will be divided by 2 groups, control &amp;
      treatment. Inclusion criteria include age 21 - 80 years, Refractory angina CCS III-IV whom
      are not candidate for Re-revascularization with proven data of: have stenosis on left main
      more than 50%, stenosis on main coronary right artery more than 70% or stenosis more than 70%
      on others vessels, conducted in coronary surgery conference with conservative decision
      (optimal medications).

      Exclusion criteria include aorta aneurysm, abdominal aneurysm, acute coronary syndrome, acute
      heart failure, heavy aortic regurgitation, malignant arrhythmia, blood pressure above
      180/100mmHg, acute limb ischemia, DVT, active thrombophlebitis, and pregnancy.

      the investigator conducts a double-blind randomized control trial. The participants will get
      35 hours ECP treatment, initial treatment pressure is 300 mmHg. whilst control groups will
      get 75mmHg. At the end of treatment, the investigator compare the hemodynamic effect on
      coronary perfusion, endothelial function, angiogenesis, and coronary blood vessel
      arteriogenesis. Quality of Life Improvement based on WHO-5 between groups

    <measure>MiRNA 92a concentration</measure>
    <time_frame>7 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>microRNAs (miRNAs) are short (20-24 nt) non-coding RNAs that are involved in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in multicellular organisms by affecting both the stability and translation of mRNAs. miRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II as part of capped and polyadenylated primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs) that can be either protein-coding or non-coding. The primary transcript is cleaved by the Drosha ribonuclease III enzyme to produce an approximately 70-nt stem-loop precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA), which is further cleaved by the cytoplasmic Dicer ribonuclease to generate the mature miRNA and antisense miRNA star (miRNA*) products. The mature miRNA is incorporated into a RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which recognizes target mRNAs through imperfect base pairing with the miRNA and most commonly results in translational inhibition or destabilization of the target mRNA. inhibition of MiRNA 92a prevents endothelial dysfunction.</description>

    <measure>NT pro BNP concentration</measure>
    <time_frame>7 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Marker of heart failure. NTpro BNP will be measured pre and post external counterpulsation. BNP is actually produced primarily by the left ventricle of the heart (the heart's main pumping chamber). It is associated with blood volume and pressure and with the work that the heart must do in pumping blood throughout the body. Small amounts of a precursor protein, pro-BNP, are continuously produced by the heart. Pro-BNP is then cleaved by the enzyme called corin to release the active hormone BNP and an inactive fragment, NT-proBNP, into the blood.When the left ventricle of the heart is stretched, the concentrations of BNP and NT-proBNP produced can increase markedly. This situation indicates that the heart is working harder and having more trouble meeting the body's demands. This may occur with heart failure as well as with other diseases that affect the heart and circulatory system.</description>
