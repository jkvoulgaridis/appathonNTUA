  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe antibody persistence for each of the 4 dengue
      serotypes for up to 36 months after the first vaccination in the primary vaccination series
      in the parent trials DEN-304 (NCT03423173) and DEN-315 (NCT03341637) (Month 15 in the current
      trial) and to describe the impact of a tetravalent dengue vaccine (TDV) booster dose vs
      placebo on antibody response for each of the 4 dengue serotypes at 1 month and 6 months post
      administration of the TDV booster or placebo (Month 16 and Month 21 respectively in the
      current trial).

      The vaccine tested in this study is Takeda's Tetravalent Dengue Vaccine Candidate (TDV). This
      study will look at the long-term antibody persistence and safety of Takeda's TDV in healthy
      adolescents and adults and will assess the impact of a booster dose.

      The study has enrolled 365 healthy participants. Participants who previously received TDV in
      two parent trials (DEN-304 [NCT03423173] and DEN-315 [NCT03341637]), will be invited to
      participate in this follow-up trial. Participants will be assessed for antibody persistence
      and safety from Baseline (Month 0) through Month 15. At Month 15, eligible participants will
      be randomized in 1:1 ratio to one of two trial groups to receive TDV or placebo:

      Group 1- TDV 0.5 mL subcutaneous (SC) injection at Month 15 Group 2- Takeda's tetravalent
      dengue placebo (dummy SC injection - this is a liquid that looks like the study drug but has
      no active ingredient), 0.5 mL, subcutaneous injection at Month 15

      This multi-centre trial will be conducted in United States and Mexico. The overall time to
      participate in this study is up to 21 months. Participants will make 7 visits to the clinic
      including a final visit 6 months after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available for all interventional studies after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received (or program is completely terminated), an opportunity for the primary publication of the research and final report development has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>
