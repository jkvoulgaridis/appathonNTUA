  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is poor research supporting the benefits of Early Active Controlled Motion (EACM)
      protocols post operative scaphoid fixation. Advances in surgical fixation technique for
      scaphoid fractures should allow for start of earlier mobilization, however there is little
      evidence in the literature that supports the use of these protocols within the early phases
      of healing. The study uses a pre-experimental design with purposeful sample population
      recruitment.
