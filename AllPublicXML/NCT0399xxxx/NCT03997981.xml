  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective natural history study of CIPN in approximately 200 participants
      receiving taxanes (paclitaxel, docetaxel) for breast cancer or vincristine for lymphoma.
      Participants will be enrolled over approximately 1-year. Demographic data, medical history,
      electronic PROs, ClinROs and NF-L will be assessed at Baseline. The Observation Period will
      initiate with the first dose of chemotherapy and conclude with the last dose of chemotherapy.
      During the Observation Period, participants will be evaluated for the development of CIPN
      using PROs and ClinROs. NF-L will be measured at various timepoints corresponding with
      treatment regimen schedules throughout the Observation Period. The Post Chemotherapy
      Follow-up Period will begin with the first visit after the last dose of chemotherapy and
      conclude 6 months after the last dose of chemotherapy. During the Post Chemotherapy Follow-up
      Period, participants will be evaluated for CIPN using PROs and ClinROs. NF-L will also be
      measured at the beginning and at the end of the Post-Chemotherapy Follow-up Period. PROs will
      be assessed electronically on a monthly basis.

        The study will enroll approximately 200 participants from a total of approximately 10 sites
        in the United States. Each participant will participate for a duration of up to 1 year
        after the first dose of chemotherapy. Approximately 130 breast cancer participants will be
        enrolled (approximately 65 participants receiving paclitaxel and 65 receiving docetaxel).
        Approximately 65 participants with lymphoma receiving vincristine will be enrolled
