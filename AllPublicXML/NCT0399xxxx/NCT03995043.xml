  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PREVENT Project is a multifaceted, adolescent friendly, culturally competent program
      aimed to address the issues surrounding unplanned pregnancies and lack of access and uptake
      of contraceptive services among adolescent girls. The intervention uses a mobile platform
      that provides educational SMS (Short Message Service) messaging, interactive voice response,
      and connects adolescent girls to community based AFSRH (Adolescent Friendly Sexual
      Reproductive Health) counselling services, as well as discreet contraceptive access points
      headed by female entrepreneurs. The program will be piloted for 12 months in various wards
      and villages in rural and urban Kilimanjaro, Tanzania.The acceptability and practicality of
      the intervention will be assessed using mixed methods. Questionnaires and focus groups will
      be conducted with the study participants, as well as the medical and non-medical volunteers
      at the start and end of the pilot. The study will be heavily supported by all-female
      non-medical social entrepreneurs and sexual reproductive health community mentors
      (volunteers), and, all-female medical reproductive health team. Recruitment will also take
      place in hair saloons (local hair braiding and styling establishments) and other female run
      business such as tailors and female clothing stores that have enlisted to become
      contraceptive access points in the study. There will be 2 intervention groups, control and
      case group. Both groups will receive educational SMS (text) messages on SRH (Sexual
      Reproductive Health) and access individually tailored educational resources through
      interactive voice response (IVR) services/system via PREVENT mobile platform. In addition to
      personal support to be able to contact with a SRH community peer mentor in the community for
      AFSRH counselling and support. The case group will then have access to contraception provided
      with detailed and discreet information on accessing PREVENT contraceptive access points in
      all communities included in the study.

      The PREVENT study seeks to impact knowledge, perceptions, and behavioural changes regarding
      SRH among adolescent girls. As a result, the data collected in the PREVENT study will be
      grouped into two main themes: SRH knowledge and attitudes, as well as family planning
      (pregnancy avoidance) and contraceptive services uptake and outcomes. All data collected
      during the study will be directly entered and stored into the secure PREVENT mobile platform
      and related secure storage functions within the platform.
