  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness of concurrent transcranial direct
      current stimulation (tDCS) and fluency training in adults with developmental stuttering. We
      examine the severity of stuttering to investigate the effect of treatnment. In the control
      group the anodal tDCS and DAF will applied on six consecutive days (1 milliampere [mA] for 20
      mins per day), and the control group will received the sham stimulation and DAF for the same
      time. The severity of stuttering measured by means of tasks and questionnaires before and
      after treatment sessions and 6 weeks after intervention.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline percentage of Stuttered Syllables produced in the speech sample</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1-week post-treatment, 6-weeks post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Researcher will calculate the Percentage of Stuttered Syllables (SS %) in the speech sample. Lower percentage of Stuttered Syllables represents better outcomes.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline on the Stuttering Severity Instrument version 4 (SSI-4)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline,1-week post-treatment, 6-weeks post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The Stuttering Severity Instrument (SSI-4) is a standardized measure of stuttering severity consist of of 3 subscales (frequency, duration and physical concomitants) which are summed to give a total score. The maximum total score of the SSI-4 is 56, which corresponds to the highest stuttering severity. So, lower score represents better outcomes.</description>

    <measure>3. Change from baseline on the Overall Assessment of Speakers Experience of Stuttering (OASES)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline,1-week post-treatment, 6-weeks post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The OASES is a standardized assessment to measure the effect of stuttering on a person's life that consists of 4 subscales (general information about speech, your reactions to stuttering, communication in daily situations, quality of life). Each sub-test has a score from 1 to 5 in which the number 1 indicates the least negative impact and number 5 shows the most negative impact. These are combined to give a total impact score between 1 and 5, with 5 representing the highest negative impact on person's life. So, higher score represents better outcomes.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive one anodal tDCS at 1 mA intensity over the left superior temporal gyrus (T3 in 10-20 international system) and the cathode tDCS over the right orbitofrontal area (Fp2 in 10-20 international system). tDCS will be delivered for 20 minutes during fluency intervention for six consecutive days.</description>
