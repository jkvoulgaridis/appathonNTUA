    <textblock>
      This repeatability study of the ProLung Test enrolled sixty subjects, 30 male and 30 female,
      half of each sex with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or more, and half with a BMI of 28 or
      less. Each subject was scanned twice on Day One and twice on Day Two. All scans were done by
      the same operator on the same device. Fifty-nine subjects produced evaluable data. Four
      models (algorithms) were tested.
