  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety of autologous human Schwann cell (ahSC)
      augmentation of nerve autograft repair in participants with severe peripheral nerve injury
      (PNI). For humans with acute severe PNI, the hypothesis is that augmentation of nerve
      autograft repair with ahSCs can potentially enhance axonal regeneration and myelin repair and
      thus improve functional recovery.
