  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the impact of community pharmacists' educational training on the nature
      and adequacy of counseling provided to patients on warfarin, an oral anticoagulant. Half of
      the community pharmacists participating in the study will receive a two-week educational
      training on how to adequately counsel patients on warfarin while the other half of community
      pharmacists will receive the same training after the study. A mystery patient model will be
      used in this intervention study where six different trained and standardized individuals will
      act as patients. Each of these mystery patients will supposedly have pulmonary embolism, deep
      vein thrombosis, or atrial fibrillation. The mystery patient will visit each pharmacy to buy
      warfarin or complain about adverse drug reaction been experienced. It is expected that
      pharmacists will provide relevant information and counseling to these patients on the use of
      the medication warfarin and how to handle the adverse drug reactions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although direct oral anticoagulants also have their limitations (such as the risk of
      gastrointestinal bleeding) they are not as prominent as that of warfarin but still important
      to consider before prescribing to patients. These limitations associated with the use of oral
      anticoagulants prove that there is need for special counseling of patients placed on oral
      anticoagulants. Counseling, as an important aspect of drug therapy management, is somewhat
      technical and requires a peculiar way of providing vital information on drug therapy within
      the shortest possible time. Pharmacists, who are key members of the healthcare team, are
      tasked with this role more than others and as such this area is of optimum importance.

      Proper and adequate counseling on oral anticoagulants is essential for optimal use of the
      drug and to reduce the number of incidence of adverse drug reactions. Adequate counseling
      cannot be achieved without proper training. This aspect is seen to be lacking due to the
      suboptimal performance discovered in research among healthcare professionals including
      pharmacists with regards to counseling of patients on oral anticoagulant use Mystery patients
      in pharmacy practice research are a very reliable means of obtaining unbiased data on
      pharmacists with regards to counseling. This study, therefore, is aimed at providing
      counseling training to community pharmacists and evaluating the impact of the training on
      patients indirectly using the mystery patient model.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the level of oral anticoagulant counseling</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at 2-weeks post intervention training</time_frame>
    <description>Level of counseling is determined by the mnemonic WARFARINISED median score. W - When to take warfarin, A - Alcohol consumption effect, R - Risk of bleeding explanation, F - Follow-up appointments, A - Aspirin and other drugs affect the action of warfarin, R - Reason for taking warfarin, I - Interactions with food and drinks, N - Notify health professional of the medication, I - International Normalised Ration measurement, S - Skipped doses, what to do, E - End of treatment, D - Dose of warfarin
Each of the counseling points will be scored 1 point. The minimum score will be 0 point and the maximum will be 12 points.
Higher values indicate better counseling provided by the pharmacist while lower value indicate poor counseling .</description>
