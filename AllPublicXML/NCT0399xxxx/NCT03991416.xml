  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Understanding Your Baby first-time parents receive research-based knowledge on how to
      interpret their infants' socioemotional needs based on their behavior, and how to meet their
      infants' socioemotional needs in accordance with their developmental stage. This information
      is delivered to parents at routine home visits by public health nurses, who are trained in
      the research base behind the program, and using cue cards and short video clips, which
      concretely exemplify how infants signal their socioemotional needs and inspire to positive
      activities between parents and their infants.

      The aim of Understanding Your Baby is to support infant socioemotional development by
      increasing parents' abilities at perceiving, understanding, and responding to their infant's
      socioemotional signals. Evaluation is based on a parallel group study, with half of the
      participants receiving care as usual and half of the participants receiving care as usual and
      Understanding Your Baby. The primary outcome is parental sense of competence and secondary
      outcomes are parental stress and child socioemotional development.
