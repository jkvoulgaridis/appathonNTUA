      The Purpose of the study is to test the hypothesis that administration of an S-nitrosylating
      (SNO) agent can improve tissue oxygenation during transfusion of packed red blood cells
      (RBCs).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transfusion is the most common therapeutic intervention employed to maintain and/or improve
      tissue and end-organ oxygen delivery. Despite the conceptual simplicity of this treatment
      recent studies indicate that RBC infusion often produces little clinical benefit and may
      actually harm the recipient by exacerbating rather than correcting anemia-induced tissue
      hypoxia.

      The main driver/regulator of tissue oxygenation is blood flow not blood oxygen content. In
      turn flow into the microvasculature is controlled by small molecules called S-nitrosothiols
      (SNOs), the most important of which is S-nitrosylated hemoglobin (SNO-Hb).

      The investigators determined that storage of human blood leads to rapid losses in SNO-Hb that
      are precisely paralleled by losses in the ability of stored RBCs to dilate blood vessels and
      thereby deliver oxygen. The investigators have now recently completed an autologous human
      blood transfusion that confirms the pre-clinical findings in that administration of 1 unit of
      packed RBCs to young healthy subjects did not improve tissue oxygenation and reduced
      circulating SNO-Hb levels.

      This novel mechanism for the loss of physiological activity in banked blood and, more
      importantly, a putative intervention for its correction, raise the possibility that
      restoration of NO bioactivity could correct the deficit in oxygen delivery. As such, The
      Investigators plan to repeat our transfusion study with the addition of administering an
      S-nitrosylating agent during RBC infusion.

    <time_frame>pre infusion and post infusion (every 3 to 6 hours, for 24 hours)</time_frame>
    <description>tested by arterial blood oxygen content difference - arterial blood gas (ABG)
An ABG is a blood test that measures the acidity, or potential of hydrogen (pH), and the levels of oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) from an artery. The test is used to check the function of the patient's lungs and how well they are able to move oxygen and remove carbon dioxide.
The aforementioned five components all have different normal values and represent different aspects of the blood gas. According to the National Institute of Health, typical normal values are:
pH: 7.35-7.45 Partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2): 75 to 100 mmHg Partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2): 35-45 mmHg Bicarbonate (HCO3): 22-26 milliequivalent/Liter (mEqL) Oxygen saturation (O2 Sat): 94-100%</description>

        individuals are familiar with the routines for blood withdrawal and re-infusion.

        Exclusion Criteria

        The exclusion criteria is derived from the American Red Cross(ARC) Standard Operating

        new drug application (IND).

          1. Individuals who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or are unwilling to avoid pregnancy
             during the study.

          2. Individuals with an anatomic anomaly that would increase the risks associated with
             placement of the vascular catheters.

          3. Individuals who report chronic diseases requiring medication of the heart, lungs,
             kidney, liver, etc or afflicted with any acute or chronic pathology that in the

        endurance training. The study physician will be consulted for evaluation.

        11. Individuals with an inherited or acquired blood coagulation disorder, congenital
        methemoglobinemia, or a familial hemoglobinopathy that impacts oxygen delivery (e.g. sickle
        cell).

        12. Individuals with any illness that may increase the risks associated with the study.

        13. Individuals who previously received blood products to treat an acute condition will be
        evaluated on a case by case basis.

        14. Individuals who report an acute or chronic disease state that may impact oxygen
        delivery.
