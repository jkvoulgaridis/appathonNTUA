      CMR GUIDE DCM is a randomized controlled trial with a registry for non-randomized patients.

      Patients enrolled will have non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM) with mild to severe Left
      Ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction with replacement fibrosis identified on Cardiac
      Magnetic Resonance (CMR).

      954 patients will be randomised from 50 sites across 4-6 countries worldwide to receive an
      implantable defibrillator (ICD) or implantable loop recorder (ILR).

      Device and clinical follow-up will be performed at 3, 6, 12, 24, 36 months and at end of
      study.

      The planned research will have two components: A prospective, blocked, randomized, controlled
      trial of primary prophylaxis ICD therapy or ILR insertion in patients with LVEF &lt;45% and Late
      Gadolinium Enhancement (LGE) on CMR and

      A prospective observational registry of patients with LVEF &lt;45% and no LGE on CMR. Registry
      patients will not have an intervention but will have the same follow up frequency as the
      randomized patients.

      The Primary objective is to determine if routine CMR guided management strategy of
      implantable defibrillator (ICD) insertion reduces total mortality compared to a conservative
      strategy of implantable loop recorder (ILR) insertion and standard care.

      The secondary objectives include:

        -  To determine if routine CMR guided management strategy of ICD insertion reduces sudden
           cardiac death (SCD) compared to a conservative strategy of ILR insertion and standard
           care.

        -  To ascertain the rate of SCD in patients with DCM and LGE scar across a wide range of
           left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).

      Statistical analysis will be performed on an intention-to-treat basis. The main analysis of
      time to death from any cause will be performed using a log- rank test.

    <description>The Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire is a 23-item, self-administered instrument that quantifies physical function, symptoms (frequency, severity and recent change), social function, self-efficacy and knowledge, and quality of life. An overall summary score can be derived from the above 23 items which will be between 0-100. A higher score reflects a better health status.</description>
