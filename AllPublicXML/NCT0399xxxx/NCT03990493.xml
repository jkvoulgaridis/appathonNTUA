  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this arm of the study is to evaluate the safety of PV-001-DC (autologous
      monocyte-derived dendritic cells pulsed with tumor lysate) when given in combination with
      PV-001-DV (Dengue Virus-1 strain #45AZ5) at the dose levels that were identified in the prior
      2 arms and to determine if the combination can treat advanced melanoma.

      Patients will have a prescribed amount of PV-001-DV injected into one of their melanoma
      tumors. Patients will go to the clinic and have a needle placed in a vein. The PV-001-DC
      product will be infused into the patient's vein. Approximately every 3 weeks, for a total of
      4 treatments, patients will receive additional infusions of PV-001-DC Patients will be at the
      clinic for at least 1 hour following the end of each PV-001-DC infusion and if they feel
      fine, they may go home.

      Approximately 49 days after the first infusion, patients will have a scan to see if their
      tumors have changed in size. Other scans may be performed during the study at different
      times. Patients will also have their blood and small samples of tumors tested for changes to
      the immune system. After 365 days, the trial will be completed for that patient.
