      Obtained 19 lead EEG data from 50 chronic pain patients along with their clinical history and
      self-reported pain scored. Machine learning was used to analyze the EEG data and derive a
      chronic pain biomarker.

        Fifty (50) male and female pain patients with symptoms in excess of 3 months duration (per
        the IASP definition of Chronic Pain) between the ages of 18-85 years were enrolled.
        Subjects who met the inclusion/exclusion criteria were asked to volunteer for the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female chronic pain patients

          -  Patients between the ages of 18-85 years

          -  Patients exhibiting the presence of symptoms in excess of 3 months duration

          -  Patients suffering from neuropathic (e.g., lower back pain), osteoarthritis, or
             muscular skeletal pain

          -  Patients with evidence of pathology related to the painful condition on which
             diagnosis was made (e.g., results of imaging or diagnostic pain code)

          -  Patients with NRS pain scores across the full range (1-10) at the time of testing

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with medically diagnosed psychotic illness

          -  Patients with medically diagnosed drug or alcohol dependence in the past 12 months

          -  Patients with a medical history of head injury with loss of consciousness and amnesia
             (within the last 2 years)

          -  Patients with skull abnormalities that preclude the proper placement of the electrodes
             for the EEG data acquisition

          -  Patients who have a spinal cord stimulator, or other implantable devices

          -  Patients for whom the source of pain at the time of the evaluation is associated with:
             neurological disorders (multiple sclerosis, Parkinson, dementia), diabetes, migraines,
             or those with reflex / sympathetic dystrophy disorder/complex regional pain syndrome,
             fibromyalgia, or visceral pain

          -  Patients with cancer

          -  Patients on workers compensation or disability

          -  Patient on anticonvulsant medication

          -  Patients who have a history of seizures
