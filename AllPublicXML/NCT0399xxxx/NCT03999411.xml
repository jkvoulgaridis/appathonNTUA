Participants who scores 95 and higher will provide blood samples for confirmation. Participant's plasma HIV-1 Ribonucleic Acid Viral Load (RNA VL) must be &lt; 40 copies/ml to confirm ART adherence.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Usability of intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The usability of the Crave-to Quit and Emocha apps will be assessed via a questionnaire with scores ranging from 0-10 with the higher score indicating increased comfortability with using the app.</description>
