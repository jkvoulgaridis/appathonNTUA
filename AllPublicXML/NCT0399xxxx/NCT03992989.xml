  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phonak Hearing Systems pass through different development and study stages. At an early
      stage, feasibility studies are conducted to investigate new algorithms, features and
      functions in an isolated manner. If the benefit is proven, their performance is then
      investigated regarding interdependency between all available algorithms, features and
      functions running in parallel in a hearing aid (pivotal/pre-validation studies) and, as a
      result, they get optimized. Afterwards, and prior to product launch, the Phonak Hearing
      Systems undergo a final quality control in terms of clinical trials. This is a pre-validation
      study, investigating optimized algorithms, features, functions and wearing comfort. This will
      be a clinical evaluation which will be conducted mono centric at Sonova AG Headquarters based
      in Stäfa (Switzerland).

      In this study one CE-labeled Phonak Behind-the-ear (BTE) devices is investigated including
      CE-labeled compatible accessories. The experimental device will be investigated regarding its
      performance of speech understanding in noise with and without an accessory existing of an
      external microphone to pick sound at a certain target. A secondary objective of this study is
      the investigation of the Overall system stability in daily life situations. The experimental
      device contains direct connectivity functionality. Another objective of this study is the
      investigation of the subjective occlusion effect of different acoustic couplings. This will
      be a clinical evaluation which will be conducted mono centric at Sonova AG Headquarters based
      in Stäfa (Switzerland).

    <description>The primary objective of this study is to investigate the speech intelligibility in noise of the investigational device alone versus the active comparator. Speech understanding in noise will be evaluated with an objective and validated test procedure, the Outcome measure will be the value of speech intelligibility in percentage at a certain signal to noise ratio.</description>

    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary objective of this study is to investigate the overall sound quality perception of the investigational device for daily real life situations. The sound quality perception will be measured with a subjective satisfaction rating scale ranging from 0% to 100%.</description>

    <description>Another objective of this study is to investigate the subjectively perceived occlusion effect of the own voice by the use of the investigational device. The subjective occlusion effect will be investigated with subjective ratings scales for the dimensions 'dullness of own voice' and 'naturalness of own voice'</description>
