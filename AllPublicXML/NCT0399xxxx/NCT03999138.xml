  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers are testing a more accurate way to measure how much fluid is in the lungs (also
      called pulmonary edema, or &quot;increased lung water&quot;) in people with Heart Failure (HF) using
      MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging). There is little known about the exact level of lung water
      in patients with AHF or how these levels change from the time of hospital admission to
      discharge. The purpose of this research study is to measure the lung water in patients
      hospitalized for HF, to determine the change in lung water over the course of hospitalization
      and treatment, and to find out if lung water levels can predict if patients are higher or
      lower risk for returning to the hospital or dying from heart failure.

    <textblock>
      Heart failure is a condition where the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the
      body's needs and Acute Heart Failure is a sudden worsening of this condition. It is
      associated with many symptoms but most commonly includes shortness of breath due to pulmonary
      edema (or increased &quot;lung water&quot;).

      A physical exam and chest x-ray are commonly used to diagnose AHF and estimate the amount of
      increased lung water in patients with AHF. This study will use images from MRI (Magnetic
      Resonance Imaging) scans to obtain a more accurate measurement of the increased lung water in
      AHF patients. Lung water will be measured via MRI at hospital admission and discharge to find
      out the change in lung water over the course of hospitalization and treatment. The
      investigators will collect NT-proBNP and perform a chest x-ray upon hospital admission and
      again upon discharge, if not already done as part of usual care. The investigators will
      follow medical records for one year after hospitalization to see if the accurate lung water
      measurements obtained in hospital can predict long term outcomes. This is a single-centre
      project and a total of 300 patients will be recruited to participate.
