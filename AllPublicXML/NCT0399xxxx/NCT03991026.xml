  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will study a program that delivers weekly community-supported agriculture
      shares to patients of East Baltimore Medical Center in order to increase access to healthy
      foods. The investigators will provide adult patients with uncontrolled diabetes with healthy
      foods including fresh vegetables and shelf-stable pantry items (e.g., canned beans) every
      week over the course of 6 weeks. The investigators will also collect demographic data and
      food insecurity status of participants via survey. This program will also conduct weekly
      cooking and nutrition classes at East Baltimore Medical Center. The investigators will
      conduct a survey of participants' experiences each time participants pick up a vegetable bag
      and at the end of the cooking classes. In addition, a focus group of participants will be
      held to gather qualitative data regarding the vegetable initiative.

    <description>At consent, participant will complete the baseline survey. Baseline survey will collect information like vegetable consumption, healthy eating attitudes, and demographics. Every week for 6 weeks, participants will pick-up a healthy food bag (e.g. fresh vegetables) for a $3 co-pay and attend an hour-long education classes at East Baltimore Medical Center. All participants will complete a survey at healthy food bag pick-up or an education class. Surveys at bag pick-up will ascertain outcomes like vegetable consumption. Surveys at education classes will ascertain outcomes like healthy eating attitudes. At 6 weeks, all participants will complete a follow-up survey equivalent to the baseline survey. The follow-up survey will be completed again at 10 weeks, 18 weeks, and 30 weeks. Participants will also be weighed at each bag pick-up (participants may decline) and relevant health information like blood pressure will be obtained from the EMR from an associated office visit.</description>

    <description>At consent, participant will complete the baseline survey. Baseline survey will collect information like vegetable consumption, cooking habits, food security, healthy eating attitudes, and demographics. As a control group, participants will not partake in the healthy food bag pick-ups or cooking classes therefore they will not fill out those associated surveys. After the 6 weeks of the intervention, control participants will be given the follow-up survey equivalent to the baseline survey. The follow-up survey will be completed again after 10 weeks, 18 weeks, and 30 weeks. Participants will also be weighed at each bag pick-up (participants may decline) and relevant health information like blood pressure will be obtained from the EMR from an associated office visit.</description>
