      A randomized controlled study to assess the safety and efficacy and overall benefit of FCR001
      cell therapy in de novo living donor renal transplantation.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized (2:1) controlled study is to assess the safety, efficacy and
      overall benefit of FCR001 cell therapy in de novo living donor renal transplantation relative
      to a standard-of-care control immunosuppression regimen of antibody induction, tacrolimus,
      mycophenolate, and corticosteroids.

      FCR001 is a cryopreserved allogeneic stem cell therapy derived from mobilized peripheral
      blood of the kidney donor that is delivered as a single dose in kidney transplant recipients
      who received a non-myeloablative conditioning regimen. FCR001 contains the donor's CD34+
      cells, facilitating cells, and αβ T cells. This therapy induces or restores patients' immune
      tolerance by establishing stable donor chimerism in the transplant recipient without the need
      for life-long immunosuppression.

    <description>The 36-Item Short Form Health Survey is a patient-reported outcome measure which assesses overall physical function, general health and social/psychological factors. The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.</description>

             conditioning; or history of recurrent infection (eg, polycystic liver/kidney disease,
             unless native kidneys removed at time of transplant).

          7. Recipient with any baseline condition requiring or anticipated will require chronic or
             intermittent use of systemic steroids or other IS (eg, autoimmune disease, asthma)
             throughout the course of the study.

          8. Recipient who had a live attenuated vaccine administered within 2 months of planned
             transplant surgery.

          9. Recipient with a BMI &lt; 18 or &gt; 35 kg/m2.

         10. Recipient requiring systemic anticoagulation, (eg, for hyper-coagulation disorders,
             deep vein thrombosis, atrial fibrillation) that cannot be temporarily interrupted
             which would preclude renal biopsy.

         11. Recipient with contraindication to total body irradiation (TBI) according to local
             radiologist, eg, previous radiation therapy at a dose which would preclude TBI,
             inadequate pulmonary function.

         12. Recipient with autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic progenitor cell transplant prior
             to signing informed consent.

         13. All recipient women of childbearing potential (WOCBP), defined as all women
             physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, who do not agree to using highly
             effective methods of contraception during dosing of study treatment.

         14. Sexually active male control recipient must use a condom during intercourse throughout
             the study and should not father a child in this period. A condom is required to be
             used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent delivery of drugs via seminal fluid.
             FRC001 recipient this requirement may be lifted at 6 weeks after MMF and tacrolimus
             have been discontinued.

        Donor-only Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Biologically unrelated female donor transplant to male recipient.

          2. Donor tested positive for Zika virus (ZIKV) infection. Zika infection is excluded by
             negative nucleic acid testing result on either serum or urine PLUS a negative Zika
             IgM. Only donors with the following risk factors must be tested:

               1. Medical diagnosis of ZIKV in the past 6 months.

               2. Residence in, or travel to, an area with an increased risk for ZIKV transmission
                  within the past 6 months.

               3. Sex within the past 6 months with a person who has either of the risk factors
                  listed in items (a) or (b), above.
