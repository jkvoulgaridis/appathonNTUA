      The goal of this study is to develop and pilot test a brief intervention to increase
      motivation to quit and smoking cessation treatment engagement among smokers with chronic
      pain.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pain and tobacco smoking are both critical national health problems, and there is mounting
      evidence that smokers in pain may represent an important and large subgroup who experience
      unique barriers and greater difficulty quitting. Smoking has been identified as a risk factor
      in the onset and exacerbation of chronic pain, and smokers experience greater levels of pain
      intensity and disability, relative to non-smokers. Initial evidence indicates that quitting
      smoking may improve pain outcomes (e.g., lower pain intensity) and supports the notion that
      smoking cessation may be an essential behavior change for smokers in pain. However, the vast
      majority of smokers are not yet ready to engage a serious quit attempt, and evidence-based
      treatments for smoking cessation remain dramatically underutilized. Therefore, the goal of
      this study is to develop and pilot test a brief intervention that will address smoking in the
      context of pain in order to increase motivation to quit smoking and engagement of available
      smoking cessation treatment. Participants will be randomized to either the adapted brief
      motivational intervention or an intervention consistent with standard clinical practice

    <measure>Motivation to Quit Smoking</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by the Contemplation Ladder and Motivation Rulers. The contemplation ladder is a measure of motivation to quit smoking on an 11 point Visual Analogue Scale. Motivation rulers for smoking cessation consist of three separate NRSs that asses importance of quitting, readiness to quit smoking in the next month, and confidence that &quot;you will quit smoking&quot; in the next month.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Motivation to engage cessation treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed with a single item that asked &quot;would you like to learn about options for treatment to help you quit smoking. If participants answered yes they were then asked whether they were interested and planned to enroll in the following types of treatment in the next 30 days: medication/primary care, Quitline, behavioral health, or none of the above.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Knowledge of pain-smoking interrelations</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Using the Pain and Smoking Questionnaire (PSQ) which is a 25 total item questionnaire to asses knowledge of interrelations between pain and tobacco smoking. 17 items assess knowledge of associations between smoking and multiple health conditions. 8 Separate items assess specific knowledge of pain-smoking interrelations such as pain related impairment, whether smoking can cause chronic pain, reduce effectiveness of prescription pain medications, provide analgesic effects, or help to distract from pain.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Smoking behavior</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were asked the following questions at the one month follow up: &quot;Do you now smoke cigarettes?&quot; &quot;Over the last week, how many cigarettes did you smoke per day on average?&quot; &quot;In the Past month, have you cut down on your smoking?&quot; &quot;In the past month, did you quit smoking for at least 24 hours?&quot; &quot;In the past month, did you talk to your doctor about your smoking?&quot; &quot;In the past month, did you start using a medication to help you quit smoking? (check all that apply: no, Over the Counter NRT (Patch, gum, lozenge) Prescription NRT (Inhaler, spray) Non-NRT Prescription (Chantix/Zyban))&quot; &quot;In the Past month, did you see a behavioral health provider about your smoking?&quot; &quot;In the past month, did you call Quitline?&quot;</description>
