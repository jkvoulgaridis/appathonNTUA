    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Male and female subjects with CD22+ B cell malignancies in patients who have no available
        curative treatment options except stem cell transplantation, with limited prognosis
        (several months to &lt; 2 year survival) and no available treatment option to achieve complete
        remission prior to transplant. Some patients who have enrolled to other CD22-CAR-T cell
        therapy trials may be eligible if their CD22-CAR-T cells cannot be produced successfully
        because they have insufficient T cells to allow the CD22-CAR-T cells to be made; their T
        cells are inefficiently transduced with CAR viruses; or their CAR-T cell expansion is
        failed. All of those patients must meet the following criteria:

          1. Eligible diseases: Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), Chronic lymphocytic leukemia
             (CLL), Follicular lymphoma, Mantle cell lymphoma, B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, and
             diffuse large cell lymphoma, previously identified as CD22+.

          2. Patients 3 years of age or older, and must have a life expectancy &gt; 12 weeks.

          3. Eastern cooperative oncology group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2 or karnofsky
             performance status (KPS) score is higher than 60.

          4. Females of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test and all
             subjects must agree to use an effective method of contraception for up to two weeks
             after the last infusion of CAR CD22 cells.

          5. Adequate bone marrow, liver and renal function as assessed by the following laboratory
             requirements: White blood cell count (WBC) ≥ 2500c/ml, Platelets ≥ 50×10^9/L, Hb ≥
             9.0g/dL, lymphocyte (LY) ≥ 0.7×10^9/L, LY% ≥ 15%, Alb ≥ 2.8g/dL, serum lipase and
             amylase &lt; 1.5×upper limit of normal, serum creatinine ≤ 2.5mg/dL, aspartate
             aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 5×upper limit of normal,
             serum total bilirubin ≤ 2.0mg/dL. These tests must be conducted within 7 days prior to
             registration.

          6. Ability to give informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) involvement.

          2. Pregnant or nursing women may not participate.

          3. Known HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.

          4. Serious illness or medical condition which would not permit the patient to be managed
             according to the protocol, including active uncontrolled infection, major
             cardiovascular, coagulation disorders, respiratory or immune system, myocardial
             infarction, cardiac arrhythmias, obstructive/restrictive pulmonary disease, or
             psychiatric or emotional disorders.

          5. Concurrent use of systemic steroids. Recent or current use of inhaled steroids is not
             exclusionary.

          6. Previously treatment with any gene therapy products.

          7. The existence of unstable or active ulcers or gastrointestinal bleeding.

          8. Patients with a history of organ transplantation or are waiting for organ
             transplantation.

          9. Patients need anticoagulant therapy (such as warfarin or heparin).

         10. Patients need long-term antiplatelet therapy (aspirin at a dose &gt; 300mg/d; clopidogrel
             at a dose &gt; 75mg/d).
