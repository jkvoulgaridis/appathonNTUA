  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lacto-N-tetraose (LNT) is a human milk oligosaccharide (HMO) present in human colostrum and
      milk. HMOs are largely undigestable and have no direct nutritive benefit to the infant, but
      act as a prebiotic substrate for beneficial bacteria (bifidobacteria, in particular) in the
      infant gut. Exclusively formula-fed infants lack HMOs in their diet in the absence of
      naturally occurring HMOs from breast milk. The proposed clinical study will evaluate the
      ability of a prebiotic supplement (LNT) to initiate intestinal colonization of a probiotic
      strain (B. infantis EVC001) in exclusively formula-fed infants. B. infantis EVC001 has been
      shown to be well-tolerated and safely consumed in breastfed infants. This study also aims to
      evaluate the safety and tolerability of LNT in different doses when consumed daily with B.
      infantis EVC001.

      This study is a single-center, prospective, randomized, open-label study of an infant
      probiotic (B. infantis EVC001) and a prebiotic supplement (LNT) in exclusively formula-fed
      infants. Nine subjects will be enrolled into three treatment arms:

        -  Group 1: 8 x 10^9 CFU B. infantis + LNT (3 g/L then 8 g/L)

        -  Group 2: 8 x 10^9 CFU B. infantis + LNT (6 g/L then 12 g/L)

        -  Group 3: 8 x 10^9 CFU B. infantis alone Study staff will be unblinded to the treatment
           assignments. Infants in all groups will receive a once-daily oral feeding of B. infantis
           EVC001 (8.0 x 10^9 CFU) mixed with infant formula for 28 consecutive days. Two of the
           treatment groups (Group 1 &amp; Group 2) will also receive two dose-escalated concentrations
           of the prebiotic supplement (LNT) mixed with their daily infant formula: Group 1 will
           receive a concentration of 3 g/L for 2 weeks followed by 8 g/L for the next 2 weeks.
           Group 2 will receive a concentration of 6 g/L for 2 weeks followed by 12 g/L for the
           next 2 weeks. Infants consuming the LNT will cross over to the higher dose without a
           washout period in between. All infants will be evaluated for an additional 2 weeks after
           cessation of the supplement(s). The total duration of the study will be approximately 7
           weeks.
