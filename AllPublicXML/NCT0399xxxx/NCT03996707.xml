  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether immediate weight-bearing
      following foot and ankle surgery provides similar or superior results to the traditional
      non-weight-bearing post-operative course, while reducing the disuse atrophy and length of
      rehabilitation necessary to recover during the transition to weight-bearing following an
      extended course of non-weight-bearing. This will be done by way of clinical follow-up, serial
      radiographs and/or other appropriate imaging modalities, and patient reported outcomes by way
      of AOFAS and SF-36 surveys.

      The study is a randomized 1:1, controlled trial, prospective in nature, where participants
      undergoing foot and ankle surgery will be randomly placed into one of two groups; an
      immediate weight-bearing group or a non-weight-bearing group. The patients will be randomly
      placed into the study group and control group if they meet all eligibility criteria.

      This study will be conducted at 5 investigative clinic sites; West Penn Hospital, Forbes
      Regional Hospital, Jefferson Regional Hospital, Bethel Park Surgery Center, and Monroeville
      Surgery. Recruitment will stop when a minimum of 230 subjects are consented.

      The study duration will require 7 visits to the clinic plus a surgery day therefore will
      require a pre-surgical visit/screening, surgery procedural day and six outpatient
      post-operative visits to the clinics. The entire follow up period will occur over 2 years.
