  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The left atrial performance is affected by the preload as well as the afterload. The LA
      active pumping is increased by stretching of the LA but within limits, after which the active
      pumping declines. The LV stiffness acts as the LA afterload. Whenever the LV stiffness
      increases, the overall emptying fraction becomes more pumpdependent

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The echocardiographic assessment of the LA was frequently overlooked. While left atrial
      performance reflects both systolic and diastolic functions of the LV, it looks like more
      studies are being conducted to detect the effect of different interventions on the left
      atrial size and function. Other studies focus on the prognostic value and the ability to risk
      stratify different cohorts of patients, based on the early recognition of deranged LA
      performance.

      Many studies were conducted on the effect of inhalational anesthetics on the left atrial
      function. Yet the results are inconclusive and sometimes contradictory. In a study on dogs,
      Gare Meir and his colleagues proved that desflurane, sevoflurane, and isoflurane depress left
      atrial contractility, delay relaxation, reduce chamber stiffness, preserve reservoir and
      conduit function, and impair left atrial-left ventricular coupling in vivo. Volatile
      anesthetics may cause impairment of both left atrial (LA) and left ventricular (LV)
      contractility. The mechanisms suggested were a decrease in the influx of calcium via voltage
      gated calcium channels as well as a decrease in calcium availability from sarcoplasmic
      reticulum.Echocardiographic assessment of the LA volumetric measures is comparable to that of
      Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (CMR) with clinically irrelevant difference. This makes
      echocardiographic assessment of LA volumes reliable, cheaperand easier to obtain.
