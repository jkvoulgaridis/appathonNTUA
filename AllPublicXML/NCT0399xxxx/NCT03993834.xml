  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transradial access (TRA) is commonly used in different medical fields due to the superficial
      position of the radial artery and related advantages. Despite its popularity, the incidence
      and importance of related complications, in particular, radial artery occlusion (RAO) remains
      unclear. Further, the only known independent predictors of the radial artery occlusion are
      the periprocedural anticoagulation as well as the catheter size. The effect of a variable
      arterial anatomy has so far not been evaluated.

      In this context, most institutions prefer to evaluate the collateral circulation of the hand,
      i.e., the arterial palmar arch and forearm circulation before TRA. The most commonly employed
      tests are the modified Allen test (MAT) or the combination of pulse oximetry and
      plethysmography according to Barbeau.In addition, there are more precise, but still
      semi-quantitative non-invasive methods for palmar arterial collateral function testing.

      Despite the wealth of these variably accurate and practical tests, invasive and direct
      hemodynamic measurement of the arterial forearm circulation and its components is lacking.
      Thus, the human physiologic circulatory reference at this site has been unknown so far.
      Further, the need of pre-procedural testing itself can be questioned in light of the
      reported, widely varying prevalence of RAO (1-38%) or critical ischemia (0-0.09%) after TRA.

      The present study investigated in a first step the invasively obtained, pressure-derived
      hemodynamic function, i.e., the physiology of the human arterial palmar arch and forearm
      collateral circulation and in a second step the clinical consequences of the variable palmar
      arterial anatomy.
