      This proposal will investigate the wound condition between different drainage methods of the
      stoma closure wound. Anastomotic leakage is a major complication after colorectal surgery.
      The protective stoma will decrease the anastomosis leakage rate and severity1. Stoma closure
      is often performed after the condition of the previous protecting site improved. Wound
      infection is not a rare complication after stoma closure, with a reported infectious rate
      from 3% to 43%. Wound infection will result in wound dehiscence, incisional herniation, ileus
      and the length of hospital stay. Lots of the stoma wound closure technique have been
      developed, including subcutaneous antibiotic material implantation, wound irrigation with
      iodine, closure wound with a drain tube, secondary closure, delayed primary closure and
      pursestring closure. But there still is in a debate about the best skin closure test. In
      Division of Colorectal Surgery Shuang Ho Hospital, two current stoma wound closure methods
      were subcutaneous Jackson-Pratt drainage and cutaneous Penrose drainage insertion.

      In the project, clinical outcomes of these two drainage methods will be compared. The
      subcutaneous. Jackson-Pratt drainage is used to create negative pressure in subcutaneous
      closure wound. The negative pressure will extract actively the tissue debris and fluid,
      avoiding the seroma and pus accumulation. The cutaneous Penrose drainage is used to create
      delayed skin healing, and the tissue debris and fluid will drainage passive by capillary
      phenomenon. Two groups will be distributed randomly. The demographic characters like age,
      gender, BMI, nutritional status, under chemotherapy, diabetes and past medication history
      will be reviewed. Perioperative clinical data like the method of the anastomosis, operation
      time, postoperative hospital day, surgical site infection, prolonged ileus, anastomosis
      leakage, and incisional hernia will be collected.

      From this study, these two stoma wound closure methods will be evaluated and analyze the risk
      factors of complication for the stoma wound closure.
