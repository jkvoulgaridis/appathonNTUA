  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many persons with epilepsy have seizures which remain uncontrolled by anti-epilepsy
      medications and are unsuitable for or unwilling to undergo surgical treatments for their
      epilepsy, or have undergone such treatments and continue to have seizures. Dietary treatments
      for epilepsy have been shown to be effective in children, and are probably effective in
      adults, but compliance with the classic ketogenic diet (KD) and to some degree also the
      modified Atkins diet (MAD) seems difficult for many adults.

      The LGI diet may be easier and in children appears to be of comparable efficacy to other
      dietary treatments (KD and MAD), but has been little studied in adults.

      This is a randomised study of immediate versus deferred LGI diet in adults with seizures
      incompletely controlled by anti-epilepsy medications. 12 weeks of dietary treatment in those
      randomised to LGI will be followed by the opportunity for the control group to undertake 12
      weeks of the LGI diet.

    <description>Adherence to the diet will be assessed by patients scores on a self report likert scale, ranging from 1 (follow the diet all the time) to 5 (follow the diet none of the time), at 12 weeks and 52 weeks after beginning the diet.</description>

    <description>Acceptability of the diet will be assessed by patients scores on a self report likert scale, ranging from 1 (the diet is acceptable all of the time) to 5 (the diet is acceptable none of the time), at 12 weeks and 52 weeks after beginning the diet.</description>

    <measure>Proportion of patients showing a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Seizure frequency will be assessed through patient completion of seizure diaries throughout the study. This will be assessed at baseline and 12 weeks, 24 weeks and 52 weeks after beginning the diet.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in QOLIE-31 score</measure>
    <time_frame>52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Epilepsy related quality of life will be measured using the Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory-31 (QOLIE-31), a self report questionnaire comprising two factors (emotional and psychological effects, and medical and social effects), eight sub-scales, and 39 items. Items are measured on 4- to 6- point Likert scales, with a maximum total score of 100. Higher scores indicate a better QoL. Change in QOLIE-31 score from baseline to 12 week and 52 weeks after beginning the diet will be assessed.</description>
