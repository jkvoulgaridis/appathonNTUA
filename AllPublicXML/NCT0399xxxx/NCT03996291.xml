    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Participants must have completed treatment in the DRI15928 study

          -  Female participants must continue to use a double contraception method including a
             highly effective method of birth control from inclusion and until after the last study
             dose, except if she has undergone sterilization at least 3 months earlier or is
             postmenopausal. Menopause is defined as being amenorrheic for â‰¥12 months with plasma
             follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level &gt;30 UI/L.

          -  The participant must have given written informed consent prior to undertaking any
             study related procedure.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  The participant has a confirmed concomitant laboratory or ECG abnormality or medical
             condition deemed by the investigator incompatible with continuation of SAR442168
             treatment.

          -  The participant has received any live (attenuated) vaccine (including but not limited
             to varicella zoster, oral polio, and nasal influenza) between the last DRI15928 visit
             and the first treatment visit in the LTS16004 study.

          -  The participant has received a non-study MS disease modifying treatment between the
             last IMP treatment in Study DRI15928 and inclusion in Study LTS16004, which by
             judgement of the Investigator may add unjustified risk to switching back and
             continuing treatment with SAR442168. Washout periods after treatment with non-study
             DMTs should be respected except for interferons or glatiramer acetate treatment.

          -  The participant is receiving strong inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A or CYP2C8 hepatic
             enzymes. Note: Such drugs need to be stopped at least 5 half-lives before study drug
             administration.

          -  The participant is receiving anticoagulant/antiplatelet therapies, including:

               -  Acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) (if more than 81 mg/day)

               -  Antiplatelet drugs (eg, clopidogrel)

               -  Warfarin (vitamin K antagonist)

               -  Heparin, including low molecular weight heparin (antithrombin agents)

               -  Dabigatran (direct thrombin inhibitor)

               -  Apixaban, edoxaban, rivaroxaban (direct factor Xa inhibitors)

        Note: All above drugs need to be stopped at least 5 half-lives before study drug
        administration except for aspirin, which needs to be stopped at least 8 days beforehand.

          -  Prior/concurrent clinical study experience. The participant is taking part in another
             interventional clinical trial of another drug substance.

          -  Uncooperative behavior or any condition that could make the participant potentially
             non-adherent with the study procedures

          -  The participant is pregnant or is a breastfeeding woman.

        The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's
        potential participation in a clinical trial.
