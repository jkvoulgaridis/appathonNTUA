  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the effects of a 12 week hot yoga intervention on vascular health in
      adults between the ages of 20 and 65. The investigators are seeking individuals with slightly
      elevated blood pressure and stage I hypertension who are not currently taking blood pressure
      medications or exercising regularly. Participants will receive 12 weeks of free yoga for
      their participation.

      This study will examine the effects of a 12 week hot yoga intervention on vascular health by
      assessing changes of pre-intervention and post-intervention measurements in ambulatory blood
      pressure, endothelial function, and arterial stiffness in adults between the ages of 20 and
      65. The investigators are seeking individuals with elevated blood pressure and stage I
      hypertension who are not currently taking blood pressure medications or exercising regularly.
      Participants will receive 12 weeks of free yoga for their participation.

    <measure>Perceived stress</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>&quot;Perceived Stress Scale&quot; questionnaire will be filled out by participant before and after the intervention in order to asses current perception of stress of daily living. 10 total questions, scaled from 0 to 4, 4 being the most often a participant felt stress and carries a weight of 5 and 0 holds a weight of 1. Question 4, 5, 7, and 8 have reversed values where 0 is the most heavily weighted and 4 is the least. The total is added up upon completion of each test and can be compared to before and after values.</description>

    <measure>Brachial artery endothelial function</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Ultrasound imaging of the upper arm before and after 5 minutes of lower arm cuff inflation (this cuff similar to a blood pressure cuff but smaller) before and after the intervention. Arterial diameter images will be analyzed for baseline and post-cuff release diameters and flow-mediated dilation will be quantified as the percentage change in arterial diameter from baseline.</description>

    <measure>Arterial Stiffness</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Tonometry readings of the carotid and femoral artery pulses assessing pulse wave velocity before and after the intervention. Pulse wave velocity will be determined by dividing the distance traveled in millimeters by the time delay between the initiations of the carotid and femoral pulse waveforms in seconds.</description>
