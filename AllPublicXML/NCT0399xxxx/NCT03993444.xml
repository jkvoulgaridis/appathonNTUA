  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Problems with stress and pain are common reasons for long-term sick-leave, and need
      preventive interventions. This RCT builds on a successful previous project (see reference
      section), where a program involving the work place, the individual and occupational health
      care resulted in decreased sick-leave and healthcare visits and a higher quality of life as
      compared to TAU for individuals with musculoskeletal pain. This study will replicate and
      evaluate the mechanisms behind the involvement from the work place. According to the
      transdiagnostic model, problems with stress and pain are maintained by similar processes.
      Consequently, the study will be extended to include both problems, and it will be explored
      how a refined version of the program affects sick leave and work ability in the employees.

      Compared to the earlier study, this RCT will include:

        1. A focused program targeting supervisors and employees

        2. An active control group

        3. An evaluation of the effects on both supervisor and employee

        4. Knowledge on the mechanisms involved

        5. Replication and extension of earlier findings

      The project will produce knowledge about:

      A procedure for identifying individuals at risk for sick-leave. The effects of a program
      targeting both workplace and individual to prevent problems with stress and pain.

      The role of the supervisor in preventing sick-leave. Mechanisms linked to decreased levels of
      sick-leave.
