  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, topical antihistamines and corticosteroids are mainly used for itching relief.
      However, the over the counter antihistamines are not effective on all itch conditions.
      Acetaminophen is a popular and widely used OTC drug for pain relief. Although its mode of
      action is still unknown, recent studies have shown that acetaminophen indirectly activates
      cannabinoid CB1 receptors. Recent studies have shown that topical cannabinoid agonists are
      effective for itch relief, the efficacy of topical acetaminophen will be tested for
      non-histaminergic itch relief.

      This will be a single-blinded, vehicle-controlled randomized study in healthy controls to
      test the efficacy of the topical gel formulation with three differing concentrations of
      acetaminophen (APAP) for itch relief. To detect medium effects of the treatments with a given
      Î± of 0.5 and an error probability of 0.05, with a power of 0.95, the number of participants
      needed is 36 (10 within post hoc pairwise comparisons).

    <intervention_model_description>The antipruritic effect of 3 topical treatments of varying doses and 1 vehicle treatment will be explored in each subject. One study visit will consist of testing all topical formulations on histaminergic induced itch, and second study visit will test all topical formulations on non-histaminergic induced itch.</intervention_model_description>

The gel will be applied to the test area and will be allowed 30 minutes to adsorb. Following this pre-treatment, residual gel will be removed and itch induction/sensory testing will commence, strictly within the pre-treated area.</description>
