  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to confirm efficacy and safety of KW-136, an investigational anti-hepatitis
      C virus (HCV) drug, combined with sofosbuvir for treatment of naive and experienced adults
      chronically infected with HCV. Three hundred and sixty (360) non-cirrhotic and cirrhotic
      subjects were medicated with KW-136 60 mg daily and sofosbuvir 400 mg daily. The treatment
      course lasted 12 successive weeks; thereafter all the study participants entered into a
      12-week treatment-free follow-up period and an additional 12-week extension treatment-free
      follow-up period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is estimated that China has a population of over 10 million infected with HCV and also a
      highly variable HCV genotype geographic distribution. A simple, universal,
      non-genotype-specific treatment regimen is preferred for anti-HCV treatment in clinical
      practice and public health. KW-136 and sofosbuvir are potent anti-HCV agents targeting at
      different HCV proteins, namely, nonstructural protein 5A and 5B, respectively. The
      combination regimen of KW-136 and sofosbuvir is expected to completely suppress HCV
      replication in subjects chronically infected with HCV and achieve a sustained virologic
      response (SVR12), namely, HCV not detected or below a predefined limit in plasma, 12 or 24
      weeks after cessation of treatment.

      In a previous phase 2 exploratory study, an all-oral, ribavirin-free regiment of KW-136, an
      investigational HCV NS5A inhibitor, combined with sofosbuvir, demonstrated a ~99% SVR12 in
      treatment-naive adult subjects chronically infected with major genotypes of HCV found in
      China, including those with compensatory cirrhosis. This phase 3 study aimed to confirm the
      efficacy and safety of this combined regimen in a large scale of target patient population,
      including interferon-experienced subjects. This simple, uniform regimen is expected to be the
      solution to HCV eradication in China from the perspective of public health.
