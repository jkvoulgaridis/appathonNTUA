  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Excessive foot pronation has been recognized as being linked to chronic low back pain (CLBP).
      The use of compensating custom-made foot orthoses has not been entirely explored as an
      effective therapy for CLBP Objective: to investigate the effects of wearing custom made foot
      orthoses compared to placebo orthoses in patients with pronated feet and chronic low back
      pain (CLBP).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Excessive foot pronation has been recognized as being linked to CLBP. Foot hyperpronation may
      cause malalignment of the lower extremity.There is a wide variety of treatments for CLBP, and
      it is suggested that excessive pronation of the foot has been linked to CLBP.The use of
      compensating custom-made foot orthoses has not been entirely explored as an effective therapy
      for CLBP.

      Customized foot orthoses alter the position of the foot during weight-bearing. The goal is to
      eliminate compensation of the foot due to structural deformity or misalignment and
      redistribute abnormal plantar pressures.Custom-made foot orthoses may contribute to improving
      chronic low back pain. This question represents an important benefit for patients and for the
      public health system by reducing expensive treatments, such as surgery or long periods of
      rehabilitation

    <description>Oswestry Disability Index Questionnaire (ODI) .Interpretation of scores 0% to 20%: minimal disability: The patient can cope with most living activities. Usually no treatment is indicated apart from advice on lifting sitting and exercise. 21%-40%: moderate disability: The patient experiences more pain and difficulty with sitting, lifting and standing. Travel and social life are more difficult and they may be disabled from work. Personal care, sexual activity and sleeping are not grossly affected and the patient can usually be managed by conservative means. 41%-60%: severe disability: Pain remains the main problem in this group but activities of daily living are affected. These patients require a detailed investigation. 61%-80%: crippled: Back pain impinges on all aspects of the patient's life. Positive intervention is required. 81%-100%: These patients are either bed-bound or exaggerating their symptoms.</description>
