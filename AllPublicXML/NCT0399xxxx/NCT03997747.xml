      RATIONALE: Studying samples of tumor tissue from patients with advanced osteosarcoma
      refractory to chemotherapy in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that
      occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to osteosarcma treatment combining
      anti-angiogenesis tyrosine kinase inhibitors and anti-PD-1 antibody.

      PURPOSE: This research study is looking at the cancer genome using tumor samples from
      patients with advanced stage osteosarcoma treated on clinical trial SHR1020-SHR-1210-II-OS.

      OBJECTIVES:

      To investigate the clinical relevance of conducting comprehensive molecular analyses on
      clinically annotated high-quality tumor specimens from patients with advanced stage
      osteosarcoma.

      OUTLINE: This is a single-center study.

      Biological specimens are collected from participating clinical site and analyzed by
      transcription profiling of RNA and microRNA; detection of DNA copy number changes and
      chromosomal rearrangements; epigenetic modifications analyses; and sequencing of genomic
      segments, genes, and regulatory regions to assess sequence variation. Clinical information
      associated with each specimen donor is also collected.

      <textblock>
        All patients have histologically proven metastatic or locally advanced osteosarcoma,
        reviewed by the Pathology Committee of Peking University People's Hospital, and are not
        amenable to curative-intent surgery. Previous systemic chemotherapy had failed to prevent
        the exacerbation of disease, including high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX), doxorubicin (ADM),
        cisplatin (DDP) with/without ifosfamide (IFO). Tumors have to be measurable with computed
        tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging, per RECIST, version 1.1. Patients undergo
        collection of tissue samples for genomic analysis via mass spectrometry, PCR, and
        microarray.

             clinical outcome of the patient

          -  Serious medical illness including but not limited to uncontrolled congestive heart
             failure, uncontrolled angina, myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular event with 6
