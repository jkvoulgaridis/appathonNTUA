  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple dose study to
      assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of multiple doses of orally
      administered LHF-535 in 24 to 32 healthy adult participants. Three successive escalating
      cohorts, each containing 8 participants, are planned. Within each cohort, 6 participants will
      be randomized to receive an oral dose of LHF-535 once daily for 14 days, and 2 will be
      randomized to receive an oral dose of placebo once daily for 14 days. After a screening
      period of up to 28 days, all participants will be confined to the study center from 1 day
      prior to dosing until at least 24 hours after the 14th day of dosing. Participants will
      return for follow-up evaluations on Day 17 and Day 21 (72 and 168 hours after last dose,
      respectively) and on Day 42. After each cohort, safety data through Day 17 and PK data
      through Day 7 will be reviewed by a blinded Safety Committee prior to dosing of the next
      cohort. The Safety Committee is charged with making one of the following three
      recommendations: (1) proceed with dose escalation as planned, (2) continue the study with
      modification (e.g., proceed with the next cohort at a lower dose level than planned), or (3)
      suspend the study. An additional cohort of 8 participants may be added to evaluate dosing for
      future studies, at the discretion of the Sponsor, in consultation with the Safety Committee.

             diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or cardiovascular disease) as
             determined by the Investigator; participants with mild allergies or benign conditions
             such as Gilbert's disease may be enrolled at the discretion of the Investigator
