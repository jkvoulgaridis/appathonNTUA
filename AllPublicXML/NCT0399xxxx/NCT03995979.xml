  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is strong scientific data that supports that short-term protein restrictive diets
      reduce surgical stress responses. The investigators are hoping to use the information
      collected from the blood serum and muscle tissue of healthy subjects to help understand the
      baseline and early changes in muscle energetic and cell-mediated inflammation. The study team
      hopes to use the data collected in this pilot study to compare with patients undergoing open
      abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair in a future study

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Modulation of a patient's diet, specifically via short-term dietary protein restriction, can
      impact changes in cell energetics and dampen the normal subclinical inflammatory state. These
      changes can provide benchmarks for future research focused on using nutritional interventions
      aimed at improving the probability of a successful outcome following open aortic aneurysm
      surgery. The investigators will conduct a short term dietary restriction protocol to
      characterize these changes in a normal control cohort to be compared to patients which
      undergo surgery, to identify the optimal time points for sampling in the surgical population.
      These changes will be characterized by looking at inflammatory cells in the blood, proteins
      excreted in the urine, changes in microbiome signature identified by stool sample and oral
      swab, as well as changes in muscle energetics in small muscle biopsies.

    <description>Subjects will follow a 4 day protein restricted diet using Scandishake® mixed with almond milk which will be provided. They may also drink water. No food, other beverages, or alcohol may be consumed. The amount of diet to be consumed will be calculated for each patient based upon resting energy expenditures plus additional energy needs. These will be consumed by the study subjects at home in an unrestricted manner, in that they may be consumed at any point of time in the day.</description>
