  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to establish whether an opioid-sparing Enhanced Recovery After
      Surgery (ERAS) program in ambulatory anorectal surgery can be safely introduced at a single
      tertiary referral center without an increase in postoperative pain or negative impact on the
      patient experience. A single-center, single-blinded randomized control trial is proposed,
      where patients will be assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either usual care, which includes extended
      opioids (control group) or the enhanced recovery group (experimental), which includes
      preemptive pain control, targeted education, and multimodal opioid-sparing pain management
      during the intraoperative and postoperative periods. The expected outcome is that the
      enhanced recovery program will significantly reduce opioid utilization with comparable pain
      scores and patient satisfaction after anorectal surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is an opioid epidemic in the United States, and the epidemic continues to worsen. The
      rate of opioids prescribed, distributed, and deaths from opioid overdoses continue to
      increase steadily. Opioids also have the costs of abuse, dependence, diversion of unused
      medication, and can serve as a gateway to other illegal substances. Opioid use often begins
      with treatment of acute postoperative pain, and the surgical episode can be a 'gateway' to
      the opioid crisis. Opioids remain ubiquitous in patients undergoing surgical procedures.
      Among opioid-na√Øve patients, persistent use after surgery occurs in 6-10%.

      Ambulatory surgery cases are rarely mentioned in the context of this public health crisis,
      but are a major contributor to the problem. Opioids are ubiquitous after ambulatory anorectal
      surgery and prescribed in large quantities, often several times more than what is needed or
      taken by patients. As patients take a fraction of the opioids prescribed, this adds to issues
      of opioid diversion. In colorectal surgery, ambulatory anorectal procedures are common and
      frequent procedures, with the potential to impact a large number of patients when
      implementing quality improvement. Thus, study into ERAS and ways to reduce opioids after
      ambulatory anorectal surgery is warranted.

      This application challenges the notion that inpatient surgery should be the only target for
      enhanced recovery and opioid interventions. It seeks to shift the clinical practice paradigm
      that extended opioids are necessary after ambulatory anorectal surgery. This new application
      of ERAS to ambulatory anorectal surgery could address a critical barrier to progress in
      reducing opioids in procedures that are common but underrepresented in current research.

    <intervention_model_description>After providing written informed consent, patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either the control group, which uses physician preference for pain control, and generally relies on extended opioids or the experimental group, which includes preemptive pain control, targeted education, and multimodal opioid-sparing pain management during the intraoperative and postoperative periods.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Double (Care Provider, Investigator)</masking>
    <masking_description>Randomization will be conducted by means of a secure website (Sealed Envelope), with block randomization to help balance the groups by the procedures performed within each arm. The patients, post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) staff, and study investigators performing follow up assessments, collecting, and analyzing the data will be unaware of the treatment assignments. It is not feasible to blind the operating team or site enrolment personnel as different preoperative and discharge information, medication and patient education will be given to the experimental and control groups. A numbered, sealed envelope, corresponding to the patient's assigned study number, will be opened, and the research coordinator will alert the surgeon to the patient's group assignment. Using the assumption that patients do not know the difference between enhanced recovery and usual care, the patient will not be informed of which arm they are assigned to.</masking_description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Score on the Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 30 days post surgery</time_frame>
    <description>A tool used to help a person rate the intensity of certain sensations and feelings, such as pain. The visual analog scale for pain is a straight line with one end meaning no pain (score of 0) and the other end meaning the worst pain imaginable (score of 100). Using a ruler, the score is determined by measuring the distance (mm) on the 10-cm line between the &quot;no pain&quot; anchor and the patient's mark, providing a range of scores from 0-100. A higher score indicates greater pain intensity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Score on the Functional Pain Scale (FPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 30 days post surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The Functional Pain Scale (FPS) was developed in 2001 to evaluate the effect of pain on patient function for various different types of pain. The scale ranges from 0-5 and the participants score will fall within this range 0-5 range based a combination of their subjective rating of pain and their objective opinion about how that pain interferes with daily activities. A lower score is linked to lower levels of pain and reduced interference from pain on daily activities.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Score on the EQ-5D-3L</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 30 days post surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-3L queries across five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has levels ranging from no problems (score of 1) to extreme problems (score of 5). The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results into a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state. The final &quot;score&quot; is coded based on the 5 responses.</description>
