  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease is the most common cause of chronic liver diseases. The
      benign non-alcoholic fatty liver, characterized by excessive fat accumulation, can evolve
      into non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and liver cancer.

      The recommendation nowadays is a lifestyle change with physical exercise and diet to reduce
      liver fat and improve inflammation. Besides this, a leaky gut and dysbiosis have an impact on
      the liver, and exercise ameliorates the diversity of gut microbiota and permeability of the
      intestine.

      The aim of this study is to find out a link between exercise and the gut-liver axis regarding
      the stage of liver adiposity and define exercise-responsive gut microbiome in NAFLD patients

      For this 12-week randomised controlled intervention 60 subjects between 18 and 70 years old,
      diagnosed with NAFLD and body mass index under 35 kg/m2 will be recruited. They will be
      randomly assigned in a high-intensity aerobic interval training (n=30) and a control group
      with a sedentary lifestyle (n=30). The intervention group follows a supervised high-intensity
      aerobic interval training two times per week and additionally, an individualised home workout
      program to have 3 hours of aerobic training per week. Blood samples, adipose tissue biopsy,
      24h-urine and faecal samples will be collected at the baseline, midway (only stool) and at
      the end of the study. Dietary intake will be analysed at weeks 0, 6, 12.
