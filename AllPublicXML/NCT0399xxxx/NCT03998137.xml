  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this long-term study is to evaluate the long-term effectiveness and safety
      of AUGMENT® Injectable Bone Graft vs. autologous bone graft. The study involves evaluation of
      subjects originally treated under protocol BMTI-2009-01 or BMTI-2010-01 or treated with
      autograft under protocol BMTI-2006-01.

      Subjects will be asked to consent and return to provide long-term follow-up data at or after
      60 months (5 years) have elapsed since their original surgery as a subject in protocol
      BMTI-2009-01 or BMTI-2010-01.

      STUDY HYPOTHESIS: The effectiveness and safety profile for AUGMENT® Injectable Bone Graft is
      maintained and remains comparable to that of autologous bone graft over long-term subject
      follow-up.

      REGULATORY PHASE: Post-approval study

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain on weight bearing via Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 1 (Day 0)</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects were asked to stand and report pain on a 100 mm Visual Analog Scale (with 0 being no pain and 100 being worst pain imaginable).</description>

    <measure>AOFAS (American Orthopaedic Foot &amp; Ankle Society) Hindfoot and Ankle Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 1 (Day 0)</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects were asked to report pain, functionality and ability levels while the physician performed assessments based on alignment, abnormality, motion, and stability. The total score ranges from a low of zero to a high of 100, with subscales measuring pain (40 points), function (50 points), and alignment (10 points), with higher scores showing better outcomes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Foot Function Index, FFI</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 1 (Day 0)</time_frame>
    <description>The Foot Function Index (FFI) measures the impact of foot pathology on function in terms of pain, disability and activity restriction. The FFI is a self-administered index consisting of 23 items divided into 3 sub-scales all ranging from 0-100. To obtain a sub-scale score, the item scores for a sub-scale are totaled and then divided by the maximum total possible for all of the sub-scale items which the subject indicated were applicable. Any item marked as not applicable is excluded from the total possible. Sub-scales are an average of the completed ratings within that sub-scale. The total foot function score is an average of the three sub-scale scores and ranges from 0-100. Lower scores are indicative of better outcomes whereas higher scores indicate greater impairment.</description>
