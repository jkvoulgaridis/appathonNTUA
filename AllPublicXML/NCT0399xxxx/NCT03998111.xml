  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Maintaining stable blood glucose concentrations after eating has important implications for
      health. Individuals who are better able to maintain stable blood glucose concentrations after
      consuming carbohydrate have a lower risk of mortality from cardiovascular disease. Muscle is
      the primary tissue for glucose disposal following a meal, and responsiveness of this tissue
      to insulin is dictated by GLUT4 translocation to the muscle cell membrane. Clathrin heavy
      chain isoform 22 (CHC22) is a protein that plays a key role in intracellular GLUT4 action,
      and it may play an important role in whole-body glucose control. Genetic variation in the
      gene which codes for CHC22 may be able to explain differences in glucose control at the
      whole-body level.

      The ability to maintain relatively stable blood glucose concentrations after eating has
      important implications for health. Individuals who are better able to maintain stable blood
      glucose concentrations after consuming carbohydrate have a lower risk of mortality and
      morbidity from cardiovascular disease. Muscle is the primary tissue for glucose disposal
      after a meal and the ability to tolerate a glucose load is largely dependent on the ability
      of muscle to respond to insulin by translocating the glucose transporter, GLUT4, to the
      muscle cell membrane, facilitating glucose import into muscle from the circulation.
      Therefore, by understanding the mechanisms that explain why some people are better able to
      maintain glucose control can give insight into how to target physiological pathways (such as
      muscle glucose uptake) to reduce disease risk and improve health.

      Clathrins are cytoplasmic proteins that play essential roles in cell membrane trafficking
      pathways. Pilot data indicate that the clathrin heavy chain isoform 22 (CHC22) plays a key
      role in intracellular targeting of GLUT4 and may therefore play an important role in
      whole-body glucose control. Cell-based studies suggest that genetic variation in the CLTCL1
      gene (which encodes for CHC22) at SNP rs1061325, influences GLUT4 retention. It is currently
      unknown whether genetic variation in CHC22 has consequences for whole-body glucose control in
      humans.
