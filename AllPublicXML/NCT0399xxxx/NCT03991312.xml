  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Part 1 of this study will determine the effect of multiple-dose itraconazole, a strong
      cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitor, on the single-dose
      pharmacokinetic(s) (PK) of mitapivat sulfate in healthy adult participants. Part 2 of this
      study will determine the effect of multiple-dose rifampin, a strong CYP3A4 and P-gp inducer,
      on the single-dose pharmacokinetic(s) (PK) of mitapivat sulfate in healthy adult
      participants.
