      The Prospective Cohort Study for Azoospermia Patients was set up to investigate the short-
      and long-term health consequences in Reproductive Medical Center, First Affiliated Hospital
      of Zhengzhou University, China.

      Infertility is an important problem with a multifactorial etiology that affects approximately
      15% of couples who attempt pregnancy. Its cause in approximately 50% of infertile couples is
      male factors. Spermatogenesis is an extremely complex cell differentiation process involving
      2,300 genes that regulate germ cell development and maturation.

      Since last decade, Clinical Reproductive Medicine Management System/Electronic Medical Record
      Cohort Database (CCRM/EMRCD) has been used in Reproductive Medical Center, First Affiliated
      Hospital of Zhengzhou University, and Henan Province Key Laboratory for Reproduction and
      Genetics. Information of patients (POI, PCOS, Endometriosis, azoospermia, ect) were recorded
      comprehensively. The current project plans to recruit azoospermia participants in our center.
      Biological samples, questionnaires and short/long term health data will be collected. The
      study is aimed to provide evidence for azoospermia prognosis.
