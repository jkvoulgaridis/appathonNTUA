    <measure>Lowest effective concentration of intralesional triamcinolone acetonide for nail psoriasis</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks (end of study)</time_frame>
    <description>The most effective concentration of intralesional triamcinolone acetonide will be determined between 0 mg/mL, 2.5 mg/mL, 5.0 mg/mL, 7.5 mg/mL, and 10.0 mg/mL.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in nail psoriasis, as measured by Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks, 24 weeks (end of study)</time_frame>
    <description>The Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) is used to evaluate nail psoriasis. Scores range from 0 to 8 with 0 indicating no nail psoriasis and higher scores indicating worsening nail psoriasis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in nail psoriasis qualify of life, as measured by Development and Validation of Nail Psoriasis Quality of Life Scale (NPQ10)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 24 weeks (end of study)</time_frame>
    <description>The NPQ10 consists of 10 questions that assess the effects of nail psoriasis on daily activities. Each response is given a score of 0 to 2 and, as some questions are specific to toes or fingernails, final scores are converted to percentages based on the number of questions the patient has been able to answer. The value of the score obtained is proportional to the functional difficulty experienced.</description>

             limited to: immunodeficiency, onychomycosis, any other nail condition other than
             psoriasis, allergy to triamcinolone acetonide, local anesthetic, normal saline, or any
             other material used for procedures

          -  Subject who has received radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and/or immunosuppressive
             drugs within 6 months of study, and/or oral corticosteroids for &gt;1 month within the 6

             30 days prior to enrollment into this study

          -  Subject who is unwilling to abstain from any cosmetic nail treatments outside those
             provided by the study clinic, beyond basic nail trimming (i.e. no spa nail treatments,
             no nail polish use, no other topical prescription nail medication)

          -  Subject who is unwilling to abstain from any medical nail treatments on their nails
             other than the study intervention (i.e. topical steroids, anti-fungal creams) for the
             duration of the study intervention and for duration of the washout period (if
             applicable)

          -  Subject who is part of the staff personnel directly involved with this study or a
             family member of the investigational study staff
