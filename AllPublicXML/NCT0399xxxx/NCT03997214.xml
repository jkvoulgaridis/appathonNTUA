  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a pre-post test with quasi experimental design. Forty-two intubated-adults who
      had been mechanically ventilated for more than 21 days were selected on the basis of
      inclusion criteria in respiratory care ward. These patients were classified equally into
      study group and control group. The experimental group received the intervention of
      respiratory muscles training 5 times/ a week for 6 weeks. The control group received normal
      care. The intervention was adjusted trigger sensitivity to 10% of the first recorded Maximal
      Inspiratory Pressure at the start of training, then increased the ventilator trigger
      sensitivity and training duration weekly. The largest of ventilator trigger sensitivity is
      not over 40% of the initial Maximal Inspiratory Pressure and the timing of training duration
      is no longer than 30 minutes.

    <description>The experimental group received the intervention of inspiratory muscles training 5times/week for 6 weeks, 5days/ per cycle; the patients stayed in the semi-recumbent position, recorded the initial/first measurement of MIP. The trigger sensitivity was adjusted to 10% of the first recorded MIP at the start of training, then reducing the ventilator trigger sensitivity and training duration weekly.</description>
