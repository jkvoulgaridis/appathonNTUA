    <textblock>
      Perinatal depression is experienced by at least 14-20% of pregnant and postpartum women, and
      is recognized as the most common complication of childbirth. In this project, the
      investigators plan to complete the process of making MomMoodBooster (MMB), a web-based
      cognitive-behavioral depression intervention, into a commercial ready product, MMB 2.0, that
      fits the workflow and staffing of healthcare organizations and is designed for both prenatal
      and postpartum women who are depressed. The investigators will also conduct a 2-arm
      randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of treatment as usual plus MMB 2.0
      compared to treatment as usual in a large healthcare setting.

    <textblock>
      Perinatal depression (experienced by at least 14-20% of pregnant and postpartum women) is
      recognized as the most common complication of childbirth and as having extremely serious
      consequences, including significant suffering for pregnant women/new mothers and their
      families, and adverse impacts on infant development. Unfortunately, there are many barriers
      that make it difficult for women with perinatal depression to access clinic-based mental
      health treatments, and participation is low. Treatment uptake is limited by psychological
      barriers (stigma, feelings of failure, and embarrassment); knowledge barriers (poor
      understanding about impact of perinatal depression on infant health, uncertainty about where
      to get treatment); infrastructure barriers (fear of negative judgment from care providers,
      avoidance of prescription medications while breastfeeding); physical barriers in rural
      settings (too few care providers, unacceptable logistical demands on time, transportation,
      and childcare); and provider-level barriers (inadequate skills, fear of liability, dearth of
      treatment options, and inadequate reimbursement). To address this need, investigators
      obtained funding (National Institutes of Health (NIH) R01MH084931) to develop and test the
      MomMoodBooster program (MMB), an innovative Web-based program for treating postpartum
      depression (PPD). Based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and incorporating multimedia
      modeling and engaging activities, MMB is designed to enable women to identify patterns in
      their thoughts and behaviors and to develop a personal action plan to make helpful changes.
      MMB also has an administrative website designed for use by both project managers and
      supportive phone coaches to monitor the overall progress of participants. In our SBIR Phase I
      grant (R43MH109191), the investigators began a redesign of MMB so that it could be used more
      effectively as a product for delivering PPD treatment by practical healthcare delivery
      organizations. Specifically, the investigators enhanced the underlying database architecture
      (and the related administration website interface) to make it easier for multiple
      organizations in multiple settings to use MMB. In our proposed SBIR (Small Business
      Innovation Research) Phase II, the investigators propose to complete the process of making a
      commercial-ready product (MMB 2.0) that fits the workflow and staffing of healthcare
      organizations. Specifically, the investigators propose to finish the enhancement of the
      database architecture and its administrative site, to expand MMB to include prenatal as well
      as postpartum depressed women, and to deliver MMB using a new responsive design technology so
      that women will be able to use it interchangeably with any internet-accessible computer
      device (desktop, laptop, tablet, smartphone). Finally, the investigators plan to use a 2-arm
      randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of MMB 2.0 compared to treatment as
      usual in a large healthcare setting.

    <measure>Change in Primary Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pretest (at enrollment) and posttest (3 months post enrollment)</time_frame>
    <description>The PHQ-9 measures self-reports of depressive symptoms within the prior 2 weeks and has been well-validated, shown high test-retest reliability, shown high internal consistency, and shown to be responsive to changes in treatment. Finally, it includes an item, &quot;Thoughts you would be better off dead or hurting yourself in some way,&quot; that will trigger our safety monitoring procedure. The minimum overall score is 0 and the maximum overall score for the PHQ-9 is 27. Higher values represent more severe depression status. To evaluate the clinical significance of the intervention effects, the investigators will calculate the minimal clinically important difference, which for the PHQ-9 is a score of 5 points difference from Pretest to posttest.</description>

    <description>The 25-item BADS measures self-reports of activation, avoidance/rumination, work/school impairment, and social impairments. The minimum overall score is 0 and the maximum overall score is 150. Higher values represent more severe depression status related to behavioral activation.</description>

    <measure>Change in Automatic Thoughts Questionnaire (ATQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pretest (at enrollment) and posttest (3 months post enrollment)</time_frame>
    <description>The 30-item ATQ will measure negative thoughts associated with depression. The minimum overall score is 0 and the maximum overall score is 120. Higher values represent more severe depression status related to experiencing automatic thoughts.</description>

    <measure>Change in General Anxiety Disorder (GAD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pretest (at enrollment) and posttest (3 months post enrollment)</time_frame>
    <description>The 7-item GAD will measure generalized anxiety. The minimum overall score is 0 and the maximum overall score is 21. Higher values represent more severe symptoms of generalized anxiety.</description>

    <measure>Satisfaction with Treatment: questions</measure>
    <time_frame>Posttest (3 months post enrollment)</time_frame>
    <description>Three individual questions will assess participant self-reported satisfaction with using the MMB program. Each question will have a minimum rating of 0 and a maximum rating of 5. A higher overall rating indicates greater satisfaction with using the MMB program.</description>

    <description>Women assigned to use MMB 2.0, along with NorthShore HealthSystem's well established usual care, will be guided by the program to move sequentially through 6 sessions, one of which becomes available for use each week, while interacting with engaging activities within each session along with recommended practice activities to encourage transfer of learning and skills to everyday routines. Content is presented using text, interactions, animations, and videos. MMB includes daily tracking and charting of mood and pleasant activities as well as online access to a library, covering a range of issues of concern to pregnant women and new mothers. Integrated text messages offer both motivational messages and links to access specific portions of session content in the MMB 2.0 program. The study coordinator will also provide up to 3 supportive coaching calls to each woman in the MMB 2.0 condition. These calls complement and thus are adjunctive to the MMB 2.0 program.</description>

    <description>NorthShore HealthSystem's treatment as usual, or usual care, has been in place since 2003. Screen positive women randomized to this condition will receive social work assessment by phone, followed by community mental health referral as indicated. Referrals will vary by need and may include psychotherapy, support groups, or psychiatry. Referrals will include consideration of geographic proximity, insurance, and acuity. Consistent with routine practice, NorthShore staff will document time spent during evaluation and in making specific referrals.</description>
