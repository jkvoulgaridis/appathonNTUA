      This is an open-label, single arm study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of treatment
      with CT032 CAR-CD19 T in patients with relapsed and/or refractory non-Hodgkin's B cell
      lymphoma (R/R B-NHL).

    <textblock>
      This study is a single-arm, open label, phase I/II clinical trial to evaluate the safety,
      efficacy and cellular kinetics of CT032 CAR-CD19 T cells in patients with R/R B-NHL. The
      study is composed of two stages, Phase I stage is for dose escalation and recommendation of
      phase 2 dose, and Phase II stage is to verify the efficacy and safety of the dose proposed.
