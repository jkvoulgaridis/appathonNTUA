      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-935. TAK-935 is being tested to treat
      people with chronic complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). This study will look at the
      efficacy, safety, and tolerability of TAK-935 as an adjunctive therapy in participants with
      CRPS.

      The study will enroll approximately 24 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned (by
      chance, like flipping a coin) in 2:1 ratio to one of the two treatment groups—which will
      remain undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an
      urgent medical need):

      TAK-935 100 mg tablets, 100, 200 or 300 mg BID Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a
      tablet that looks like the study drug but has no active ingredient

      Participants will receive 100 mg TAK-935 tablets or placebo-matching TAK-935 tablets, BID for
      Week 1, 2x100 mg TAK-935 tablets or placebo-matching TAK-935 tablets, BID for Week 2 and
      followed by 3x100 mg TAK-935 tablets or placebo-matching TAK-935 tablets, BID for Week 3.
      Dose will be uptitrated based on safety and tolerability in titration period. Participants
      will continue to receive the same dose in maintenance period. Dose adjustments during
      maintenance period may take place due to safety and tolerability.

      Participants will then enter Part B (optional) or taper period. In Part B all participants
      will receive TAK-935 2x100 mg tablets, BID for 1 Week, followed by TAK-935 3x100 mg tablets,
      BID for 1 Week. Dose will be uptitrated/downtitrated based on safety and tolerability in
      titration period (Part B), participants will continue to receive the same dose in maintenance
      period (Part B) and followed by a taper period.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in United Kingdom. The overall time to participate
      in this study is approximately 36 weeks. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic
      and will be contacted by telephone 15 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up
      assessment.

    <description>The 24-hour average pain intensity (NPS, an 11 point scale, 0-10, 0= no pain to 10 = most pain imaginable) will be calculated from current pain intensity scores collected 3 times a day as measured by the electronic pain diary daily during Parts A and B. Pain intensity will be evaluated on the affected limb. If more than 1 limb is involved, the participant and the investigator will determine which limb is the most problematic and the pain will be evaluated for that limb throughout the study.</description>

    <description>The PROMIS-29 (version 2), a generic health-related quality of life survey, assesses each of the 7 PROMIS domains (depression, anxiety, physical function, pain interference, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and ability to participate in social roles and activities) with 4 questions per domain. The questions are ranked on a 5-point Likert scale. The scale ranges from 1-5 in each domain: depression (1=never and 5=always); anxiety (1=never and 5=always); physical function (1=unable to do and 5 =without any difficulty); pain interference (1=not at all and 5=very much); fatigue (1=not at all and 5=very much); sleep disturbance (1=very much and 5=not at all); ability to participate in social roles and activities (1=always and 5=never).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Participant meets the Budapest clinical diagnosis of complex regional pain syndrome
             (CRPS) at the screening visit and is at least 6 months since onset of symptoms.

          2. Participant's pain medications and nondrug treatments must be stable (regimented per
             prescription) for 1 month prior to screening and remain stable throughout Part A.

          3. Participant agrees to use a single previously prescribed rescue medication within the
             prescribed dose during Part A of the study and to record the daily use of these
             medications.

          4. Participant must have an average 24-hour pain intensity score ≥4 and ≤9 on the 24-hour
             average pain intensity numeric pain scale (NPS) during screening/baseline. This score
             will be calculated by averaging the daily 24 hour pain intensity scores for the past
             seven days prior to randomization. The participant must have daily 24-hour pain
             intensity scores recorded for at least 6 of the past 7 days.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Currently receiving intravenous (IV) or oral ketamine, history of IV or oral ketamine
             use within the past 6 weeks prior to screening, or planned use of IV or oral ketamine
             during this study.

          2. Participant is receiving chronic opioid treatment at a dose that has not been stable
             28 days prior to screening.

          3. Participant is receiving chronic opioid treatment &gt;160 mg of morphine equivalent per
             day.

          4. Participant has a positive drug screen for phencyclidine, amphetamine/
             methamphetamine, or cocaine at screening. Cannabis is allowed.

          5. Has cataracts based on investigator opinion.

          6. Participant is positive for hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection at screening. (Note
             that participants who have been vaccinated against hepatitis B [hepatitis B surface
             antibody {Ab}-positive] who are negative for other markers of prior hepatitis B
             infection [eg, negative for hepatitis B core Ab] are eligible. Also, note that
             participants who are positive for hepatitis C Ab are eligible if they have a negative
             hepatitis C viral load by quantitative polymerase chain reaction).
