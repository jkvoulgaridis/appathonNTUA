  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of
      intravenous (IV) CR845 at a dose of 0.5 mcg/kg administered after each dialysis session. The
      study includes an up to 12-week Treatment Period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Screening Period: The Screening Period includes a Screening Visit and a Run-In Period.
      Informed consent will be obtained prior to performing any study-specific procedures. The
      Screening Visit will occur within 21 days prior to the start of the Run-in Period. Patients
      will start the Run-in Period during the week prior to Treatment Period to complete
      eligibility verification.

      Treatment Period: All scheduled study visits during the Treatment Period will be conducted on
      dialysis days. Patients will be administered CR845 as an IV bolus after the end of their
      dialysis during a Treatment Period of up to 12 weeks so that each patient will receive CR845
      3 times weekly for a total of up to 36 doses. End of treatment (EOT) is defined as the first
      day of dialysis following the last dose of drug. The EOT procedures will be conducted on the
      dialysis visit following the last dose of study drug.

      Follow-up Visit: A final safety Follow up Visit will be conducted 7-10 days after the
      EOT/Early Termination Visit.

    <description>Intensity of itch will be measured using an NRS used to indicate the intensity of the worst itching over the past 24 hours using a 0 to 10 numeric rating scale, where &quot;0&quot; represents &quot;no itching&quot; and &quot;10&quot; represents &quot;worst itching imaginable&quot;.</description>

    <description>The impact of itch on patients' quality of sleep will be measured using an NRS used to indicate how the itch interferes with sleep over the past 24 hours using a 0 to 10 numeric rating scale, where &quot;0&quot; represents &quot;did not interfere&quot; and &quot;10&quot; represents &quot;completely interfered&quot;.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The 5-D Itch Scale is a multidimensional questionnaire which assesses itch-related quality of life over the past 2 weeks. The questions cover five dimensions of itch including the degree, duration of itch/day, direction (improvement/worsening), disability (impact on activities such as work), and body distribution of itch. A lower total score represents better quality of life. The Skindex-10 Scale is a multidimensional questionnaire which assesses itch-related quality of life over the past week. The questions cover 3 domains: disease, mood/emotional distress, and social functioning domain. A lower total score represents better quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Patient health state and Proportion of patients with reported problems or no problems by level and EQ-5D-5L-P dimension will be summarized at baseline and each postbaseline time point (Week 4, 8, and Week 12).</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. The EQ-PSO (Pruritis bolt-on) will be added to the EQ-5D-5L and includes two additional dimensions &quot;skin irritation&quot; and &quot;self-confidence&quot; to better capture the itch associated burdens.</description>
