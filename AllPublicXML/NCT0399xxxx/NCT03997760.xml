      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK),
      pharmacodynamics (PD) and efficacy of SHP655 in participants with baseline health sickle cell
      disease (SCD) and SCD with acute vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC).

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this investigational product or medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including a clinically significant laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not causality is suspected (ICH Guidance E2A 1995). A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward clinical manifestation of signs, symptoms or outcomes (whether considered related to investigational product or not and at any dose) which results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization, prolongation of hospitalization, is an important medical event. Number of participants with adverse events in both part A and part B will be assessed.</description>
