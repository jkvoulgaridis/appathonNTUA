  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clozapine is prescribed to patients with psychosis in whom other treatments have not worked.
      Research has shown, however, that clozapine may be associated with weight gain and abnormal
      blood sugar levels in some patients. There is strong evidence to suggest that genetic
      variation between individuals plays an important role in the development of these side
      effects in response to the medication. Our research aims to evaluate the effects of two genes
      and the blood level of clozapine on side-effects such as weight changes and blood sugar
      levels in patients receiving clozapine treatment. From out-patient clinics in Cwm Taf UHB,
      the investigators aim to recruit 160 patients who are taking clozapine; collect information/
      measurements from recruits relating to size/ weight/ BMI, risk of diabetes and blood samples
      to measure markers of blood sugar, fat/lipids, clozapine and its breakdown products, blood
      cells and variants of two specific genes. From this information the investigators will be
      particularly interested to understand if there is any association between the variation in
      these two genes with weight gain or changes in blood sugar, in patients taking clozapine.
