  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will utilize a prospective, observational, exposure cohort design to examine
      pregnancy and infant outcomes in women and infants who are exposed to tildrakizumab during
      pregnancy to treat an approved indication.

      The pregnancy registry cohort study will be conducted by the Organization of Teratology
      Information Specialists (OTIS), which is a network of university and health department based
      information centers serving pregnant women and healthcare providers throughout North America.
      These services provide a basis for collaborative research such as this Registry.

      These Services located throughout the United States (US) and Canada will serve as a source of
      referrals not only for tildrakizumab-exposed pregnancies but also for similarly ascertained
      disease-matched comparison pregnant women who have not used tildrakizumab in pregnancy.

      The target follow-up period will be until end of pregnancy and 1 year of age for live born
      infants.
