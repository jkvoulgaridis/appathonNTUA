    <textblock>
      The rational of this study is to provide evidence on the safety and efficacy of a new
      chewable tablet of mebendazole compared to the standard tablet in preschool- and school-aged
      children infected with hookworm.

    <description>Eggs per gram of stool (EPG) will be assessed by adding up the egg counts from the quadruplicate Kato-Katz thick smears and multiplying this number by a factor of six. The egg reduction rate (ERR) is calculated as follows: ERR = (1-(geometric mean EPG at follow-up/geometric mean EPG at baseline))*100). Note: in contrast to the publication the &quot;outcome measure&quot; entry mask requires the complementary percentage: (geometric mean at follow-up/geometric mean at baseline)*100).</description>

        <title>Geometric Mean Egg Reduction Rate (ERR) of the Two Formulations of Mebendazole Against Hookworm</title>
        <description>Eggs per gram of stool (EPG) will be assessed by adding up the egg counts from the quadruplicate Kato-Katz thick smears and multiplying this number by a factor of six. The egg reduction rate (ERR) is calculated as follows: ERR = (1-(geometric mean EPG at follow-up/geometric mean EPG at baseline))*100). Note: in contrast to the publication the &quot;outcome measure&quot; entry mask requires the complementary percentage: (geometric mean at follow-up/geometric mean at baseline)*100).</description>

        <title>Geometric ERR of Both Mebendazole Formulations Against Ascaris Lumbricoides.</title>
        <description>Eggs per gram of stool (EPG) will be assessed by adding up the egg counts from the quadruplicate Kato-Katz thick smears and multiplying this number by a factor of six. The egg reduction rate (ERR) is calculated as follows: ERR = (1-(geometric mean EPG at follow-up/geometric mean EPG at baseline))*100). Note: in contrast to the publication the &quot;outcome measure&quot; entry mask requires the complementary percentage: (geometric mean at follow-up/geometric mean at baseline)*100).</description>
