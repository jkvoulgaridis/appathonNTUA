  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the analysis is an evaluation of the current performance of the Swiss Trauma
      Registry (STR) with respect to providing a reliable basis for (scientific) investigations on
      the management of trauma patients in Switzerland. The current project tries to address this
      question by considering central aspects of completeness and by exemplifying the use of the
      registry for research questions. The aim is to identify potential shortcomings of the
      registry.

        The data source for this project is the Swiss Trauma Registry with approx. 65 patients per
        year. Data will be extracted from the databank and transferred for analysis in anonymized
        form.
