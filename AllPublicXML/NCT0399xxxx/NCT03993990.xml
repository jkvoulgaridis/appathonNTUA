  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate an empowerment-based program. A randomized
      controlled trial design will be used. From August 2019 to July 2021, 160 subjects will be
      recruited at a medical center and randomly assigned to the intervention or comparison group.
      Participants in the intervention group will receive an assessment of their self-care demand
      and self-efficacy, as well as an empowerment-based program delivered by the project host. The
      program includes the identification of the problems of participants, clarification of their
      feelings and the significance of their problems, plan setting discussion, motivation for
      action, and evaluation of the execution of their plan. Empowerment-based strategies will be
      provided individually at the following time points: before discharge, on post-discharge days
      3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 42, 56, 70, and 84, and at 6, 9, and 12 months post-discharge. Those in the
      comparison group will receive routine care only. Outcome measures include self-care
      behaviors, glycemic control (measured by HbA1C), diabetic foot ulcer infection, and diabetic
      foot ulcer recurrence. Data will be collected at baseline and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after
      discharge.

    <description>The WS-DFUD-KQ comprises of 12 items. Three of the 12 items are negatively worded and state as misconceptions regarding warning signs of diabetic foot ulcer deterioration (i.e. item 8, 9, 10). The response choices include &quot;yes,&quot; &quot;no,&quot; and &quot;uncertain.&quot; Each item with the correct answer obtains a score of 1, after which the scores are summed to obtain a total score.</description>

    <description>The Diabetes Foot Self-Care Behavior Scale (DFSBS) The DFSBS contains 7 items. The scale had two parts: In the first part, the responses were rated on the number of days patients performed a certain behavior over the course of one week. In the second part, the responses were rated by the frequency with which patients performed a certain behavior in general, from never (1) to always (5).</description>

    <description>The Chinese version of summary of diabetes self-care activity questionnaire (C-SDSCA) The C-SDSCA is a short self-reported questionnaire of diabetes self-management across five components of diabetes regimen a person with diabetes should practice in order to stay well ( i. e. diet, exercise, blood sugar testing, foot care and attention to smoking.)</description>

    <measure>Diabetes-related Foot Ulcer Self-Management Behavior</measure>

    <description>The Diabetes-related Foot Ulcer Self-Management Behavior Scale (DFUSMBS) measures behaviors that patients use to manage their diabetes-related foot ulcers to promote wound healing and to prevent the deterioration of their wounds, including timely treatment seeking and management, wound management, and self-management of diabetes. The 18-item scale includes three reverse-scored items (Item 1, 2, 11) and uses a 5-point Likert scale (1 = never, 2 = seldom, 3 = sometimes, 4 = frequently, and 5 = always).</description>

    <measure>Diabetes Management Self-Efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Chinese version of the Diabetes Management Self-Efficacy Scale (C-DMSES) was a self-administered scale containing 20 items. It assessed the extent to which respondents were confident that they could manage their blood sugar, diet, and level of exercise. Responses were rated on a 10-point Likert-style from not at all (1) to certainly can do (10). The responses were summed to become a total score for &quot;self-efficacy&quot;. Possible scores ranged from 0 to 200 points. The tool had acceptable reliability and validity in a Taiwanese population.</description>

    <measure>Self-efficacy regarding diabetes foot self-car</measure>
    <time_frame>1 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Two items were used to measure the self-efficacy regarding diabetes foot self-care of participants. They are &quot;I have confidence to check my feet (including the bottom of my feet and between the toes) daily, either by myself or to ask for someone's help.&quot;, and &quot;I have confidence to apply moisturizing lotion to my feet by myself or asking for someone's help, If my skin is dry&quot;. Responses were rated on a 10-point Likert-style scale according the degree of confidence.</description>

    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The 16-item diabetes-related foot ulcer self-management self-efficacy scale was used to measure the confidence in delivering diabetic foot ulcer self-management behavior, and management of diabetic foot ulcer. Responses were rated on a 10-point Likert-style from not at all (1) to certainly can do (10). The higher score indicates better self-efficacy.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive an empowerment-based intervention individually, based on five steps (i. e. problem identification, meaning and perception clarification, intervention planning, intervention delivery, and evaluation). After the principal investigator delivers a pre-discharge assessment (i. e. the self-care behavior and self-efficacy of diabetes and diabetic foot ulcer, risk factors of foot ulcer, family support, and threat belief of participant), the plan of behavioral modification will be determined by the principal investigator and participants. The subsequent follow-up and intensifying interventions will be delivered at the following time points: three days after discharge, every weeks for one month, every two weeks for subsequent two months, and then every three months for three times.</description>
