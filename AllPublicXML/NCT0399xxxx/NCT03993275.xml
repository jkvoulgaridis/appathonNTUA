  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exergames are games that require physical movements and are used with a therapeutic purpose,
      e.g. to improve strength, balance or flexibility. Exergames rely on technologies that track
      body movements and reaction, to perform exercises in a persuasive environment. Exergames are
      increasingly used in rehabilitation to improve motor function and independence of patients.
      Exergames are increasingly used for self-regulated exercise. However, usability of the MMGO
      is reduced by the fact that 1) therapists are needed to choose exercises and 2) adapt the
      exercise program depending on patients' ability level, and 3) patients' motivation reduces
      after about 5 sessions if exercises are not adapted and variation of exercises is low.

      The planned study aims to overcome the given limitations and thus improve usability. Using
      routine data of patients exercising with MMGO and clinical outcome measures this study will
      investigate the relationship between scores on the MMGO and on clinical outcome measures and
      how these scores change over time. In addition, the study will determine the relative
      difficulty levels of each exercise and its difficulty level in relation to participants'
      balance ability.

      Exergames are games that require physical movements and are used with a therapeutic purpose,
      e.g. to improve strength, balance or flexibility. Exergames rely on technologies that track
      body movements and reaction, to perform exercises in a persuasive environment. Exergames are
      increasingly used in rehabilitation to improve motor function and independence of patients.
      In the Rehabilitation Center Valens, the exergames of 'MindMotion GO' (MMGO) are used to
      improve balance in patients with neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis and stroke.
      Patients' movements are captured by a Kinect camera. With their body movements, patients
      control an avatar that has to be moved goal directed. Several games are available and during
      rehabilitation therapists select games and adapt the exercise program according to patients'
      progress. In this way, trunk control and balance can be trained in sitting and standing.

      Rehabilitation is effective to improve independence in activities of daily living (ADL) for
      patients with Multiple Sclerosis and Stroke. Higher levels of mobility and balance are
      associated with better outcomes regarding ADL independence. Higher treatment dose is
      positively associated with ADL and balance improvement. Self-regulated exercise, whereby
      patients perform given exercises independently, is recommended. Exergames are increasingly
      used for self-regulated exercise. However, usability of the MMGO is reduced by the fact that
      1) therapists are needed to choose exercises and 2) adapt the exercise program depending on
      patients' ability level, and 3) patients' motivation reduces after about 5 sessions if
      exercises are not adapted and variation of exercises is low.

      The planned study aims to overcome the given limitations and thus improve usability. Using
      routine data of patients exercising with MMGO and clinical outcome measures this study will
      investigate the relationship between scores on the MMGO and on clinical outcome measures and
      how these scores change over time. In addition, researchers will determine the relative
      difficulty levels of each exercise and its difficulty level in relation to participants'
      balance ability.

    <measure>Game score of performed MindMotion GO Exergames</measure>

    <measure>Change in Balance (Berg Balance Scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, weekly, and after 3-4 weeks of training</time_frame>
    <description>The Berg Balance Scale measures stattic balance and fall risk in adults. It consists of The Berg Balance Scale is used to asses Balance. The Scale consists of 14 items, for each item the minimum score is 0 points, the maximum score is 4 points. A total amount of 56 points can be achieved on the Berg Balance Scale which indicates a normal balance for adults. A score lower than 45 points in elderly indicates that individuals may be at greater risk of falling.</description>

    <measure>Change in trunk control and sitting Balance (Trunk Impairment Scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after 3-4 weeks of training</time_frame>
    <description>The Trunk Impairment Scale assesses stattic and dynamic sitting balance and coordination of trunk movement. The test consists of 17 items with a minimum score of 0 and a maximum score of 23 points, which is calculated by adding up the scores from the subscales (0-7 Points for static sitting Balance, 0-10 Points for dynamic sitting Balance, 0-6 Points for coordination), with a higher scores for better trunk control.</description>

    <measure>Change in mobility</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after 3-4 weeks of training</time_frame>
    <description>The Timed Up and GO Test assess mobility, balance, walking abaility and fall risk. The patient is asked to stand up from a chair, walk a distance of 3 meters, turn, walk back to the chair and sit down again. The performance of the patient is measured by measuring the time it takes to perform this task. With a shorter time, representing better mobility.</description>

    <measure>Change in dynamic balance during gait</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after 3-4 weeks of training</time_frame>
    <description>The Dynamic Gait Index assesses the ability to modify balance while walking. Eight items are scored from 0 to 4 points, showing the amount of dysfunction the patient shows in executing the tasks. The Minimum score is 0 Points, the maximum score is 24 points, indicating a better balance while walking.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and after 3-4 weeks of training</time_frame>
    <description>The MS Walking scale 12, is a 12-item questionnaire to assess the impact of MS on the walking ability. The questions are scored 1 to 5, with 1 meaning no limitation and 5 meaning extreme limitation on gait related activites. The total score is calculated into percentages, with a higher percentage meaning a higher perceived impact of the MS on walking ability.</description>
