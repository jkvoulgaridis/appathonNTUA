    <textblock>
      Inaccuracy of laboratory medicine diagnostic tests may be associated with ingestion of
      over-the-counter biotin supplements.

      Study group 1) Due to a lack of systematic studies, little is known about how performance of
      specific biotinylated immunoassays is associated with biotin ingestion at doses common in
      over-the-counter supplements (10 mg/d) in healthy adults and subjects with thyroid hormone
      supplementation. Therefore, this study was designed to assess the association of short-term
      biotin ingestion for 10 days with performance of various analytes based on Roche, Abbott and
      Siemens assays.

      Study group 2) Due to a lack of systematic studies, little is known about how performance of
      specific biotinylated immunoassays is associated with biotin ingestion at doses common in
      multivitamin supplements (biotin = 50 µg/d) in healthy adults. Therefore, this study was
      designed to assess the association of short-term biotin ingestion for 20 days with
      performance of various analytes based on Roche, Abbott and Siemens assays.

    <description>The study aims to assess the performance of specific biotinylated immunoassays after 10 days of ingesting 10 mg/d of biotin (high-dose), or 50 µg/d of biotin (low-dose). Control measurements will be performed at baseline (before biotin intake), and 10 days after last biotin intake.</description>
