        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Non-smoking, healthy participants at the time of informed consent.

          2. Body Mass Index (BMI) greater than (&gt;) 18 and less than or equal to (&lt;=) 30 kilogram
             per square meter (kg/m^2) at Screening.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Females who are breastfeeding or pregnant at Screening or Baseline (as documented by a
             positive beta-human chorionic gonadotropin [ß-hCG] (or human chorionic gonadotropin
             [hCG]) test with a minimum sensitivity of 25 international units per litre (IU/L) or
             equivalent units of ß-hCG [or hCG]). A separate baseline assessment is required if a
             negative screening pregnancy test was obtained more than 72 hours before the first
             dose of study drug

          2. Females of childbearing potential who:

               -  Within 28 days before study entry, did not use a highly effective method of
                  contraception, which includes any of the following:

                    1. total abstinence (if it is their preferred and usual lifestyle)

                    2. an intrauterine device or intrauterine hormone-releasing system

                    3. a contraceptive implant

                    4. an oral contraceptive (with additional barrier method) (Participant must be
                       on a stable dose of the same oral contraceptive product for at least 28 days
                       before dosing and throughout the study and for 28 days after study drug
                       discontinuation)

                    5. have a vasectomized partner with confirmed azoospermia

               -  Do not agree to use a highly effective method of contraception (as described
                  above) throughout the entire study period and for 28 days after study drug
                  discontinuation NOTE: All females will be considered to be of childbearing
                  potential unless they are postmenopausal (amenorrheic for at least 12 consecutive
                  months, in the appropriate age group, and without other known or suspected cause)
                  or have been sterilized surgically (i.e., bilateral tubal ligation, total
                  hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy, all with surgery at least 1 month before
                  dosing)

          3. Males who have not had a successful vasectomy (confirmed azoospermia) and their female
             partners meet the exclusion criteria No: 2, above. If the female partner is pregnant,
             then males who do not agree to use Barrier contraception (latex or synthetic condoms)
             throughout the study period and for 90 days after study drug discontinuation. No sperm
             donation is allowed during the study period and for 90 days after study drug
             discontinuation

          4. Clinically significant illness that requires medical treatment within 8 weeks or a
             clinically significant infection that requires medical treatment within 4 weeks of
             dosing

             dosing; eg, psychiatric disorders and disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, liver,
             kidney, respiratory system, endocrine system, hematological system, neurological
             system, or cardiovascular system, or participants who have a congenital abnormality in
             metabolism

          6. Any history of major surgery, e.g., intestinal resections, hepatectomy, nephrectomy,
             digestive organ resection that may affect absorption, metabolism or excretion of
             E7386.

          7. Any clinically abnormal symptom or organ impairment found by medical history at
             Screening, and physical examinations, vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG) finding, or
             laboratory test results that require medical treatment at Screening

          8. Clinically significant ECG abnormality including a marked baseline prolongation of
             QT/corrected QT interval (QTc) (example: repeated demonstration of a QTc interval
             greater than (&gt;) 500 milliseconds [msec]), or a family history of prolonged QTc
             syndrome or sudden death

          9. History of drug or alcohol misuse within 6 months prior to Screening, or who had a
             positive urine drug test at Screening or Baseline

             donation of plasma within 1 week of dosing

         16. Participated in another clinical trial less than 4 weeks prior to dosing or was
             currently enrolled in another clinical trial

         17. Consumed grapefruit, starfruit, Seville oranges or their products within 7 days prior
