  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over the past few years, a growing number of campaigns from around the world, including
      Canada, are highlighting the positive impact of spending time in nature on well-¬being.
      Indeed, mounting evidence suggests that spending time with nature is associated with a myriad
      of affective and cognitive benefits. Surprisingly few studies to date have tested the
      assumption that walking in nature versus in urban settings could alleviate stress and
      depressive symptoms in clinically depressed adults.

      The main purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of walking in nature
      versus in urban settings to improve depression related symptoms and reduce stress. The trial
      included 2 primary outcomes: patients stress levels (salivary cortisol) and
      depression-related symptoms (eg, affect, rumination, executive functioning)

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in morning salivary cortisol secretion pattern</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Salivary cortisol levels will be measured via the collection of passive drool using a straw.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in affect from baseline up to 72 hours post-walk</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to Day 3</time_frame>
    <description>Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) The original PANAS is a 20-item self-rated questionnaire measuring positive affect (e.g., &quot;excited&quot;) and negative affect (e.g., &quot;upset&quot;). Four items of sadness (sad, depressed, discouraged, despondent) were added to the negative affect subscale to assess the level of induced sadness. Participants indicate to what extent they feel each affect &quot;right now—that is, at the present moment&quot; using a Likert scale ranging from one (very slightly or not at all) to five (extremely).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Executive Functions</measure>
    <time_frame>The Stroop test will be administered at 2 time points: 1) before the walk (between 9:45-10:30); 2) after the walk (between 11:30-11:50)</time_frame>
    <description>The stroop color word test is a widely used task to assess selective attention and inhibitory control. In the first block of this task (A), color words (red, blue, yellow, green) printed in black ink are presented in random order and participants are asked to read out loud the words. In the second block (B), solid color patches in one of the same four colors are shown and participants name the colors. Finally, in the third block (C), color words are printed in an incongruous ink color and participants must name the ink color (e.g. GREEN [typed in red]; response = red). Participants are asked to complete each block as quickly and accurately as possible and the time to complete each trial is calculated and averaged for each block. An interference score is calculated as followed: C - [(A + B) /2].</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in suicidal Ideations</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Severity of Suicidal Ideations The severity of current suicidal ideation will be assessed with three items derived from a prior study of momentary assessment of suicidal risk: &quot;How intense is your desire to kill yourself right now&quot;?; &quot;How strong is your intention to kill yourself right now&quot;?; &quot;How strong is your ability to resist the urge to kill yourself right now&quot;? Each item is scored on a scale from 0 (not strong [intense] at all) to 4 (very strong [intense]).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in depressive symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to Day 2</time_frame>
    <description>The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) The BDI is a widely used 21‐item depression inventory with good internal consistency (α = .93 in the current sample) and validity. Items are answered on a 4-point scale from 0 to 3.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in rumination</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>The Rumination-Reflection Questionnaire (RRQ) The RRQ is a 24-item self-reported questionnaire assessing both self-rumination and self-reflection, 57 with 12 items corresponding to each subscale. Participants rate the degree to which they engage in self- rumination (e.g. &quot;sometimes it is hard for me to shut off thoughts about myself&quot;) and self-reflective thoughts (e.g. &quot;I love to meditate on the nature and meaning of things&quot;) on a Likert scale ranging from one (strongly disagree) to five (strongly agree)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in irritability</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to Day 3</time_frame>
    <description>The Brief Irritability Test (BITe): The BITe is a 5-item self-report measure of irritability that is suitable for use among men and women. Participants respond to statements using a 6-point Likert scale ranging from Never to Always. Items include the following five statements: &quot;I have been grumpy&quot;; &quot;I have been feeling like I might snap&quot;; &quot;Other people have been getting on my nerves&quot;.</description>

    <description>Patients will go for a silent 60-minute walk in an urban setting. The walk will take place in the months of June, July, August and September between 10:00 to 11:00 am.
Participants will walk in groups of two to three participants accompanied by two research assistants trained in mental health (doctoral students in psychology). The urban walk will be located on Boulevard de la Vérendrye with large arteries with three to four lanes.</description>

    <description>Patients will go for a silent 60-minute walk in a nature park setting. The walk will take place in the months of June, July, August and September between 10:00 to 11:00 am.
Participants will walk in groups of two to three participants accompanied by two research assistants trained in mental health (doctoral students in psychology).
The nature walk will take place at Parc Angrignon, an area of 96 hectares, one of Montreal's largest green and biodiverse spaces with a forest of 20 000 trees and a pond surrounded by willow trees.</description>
