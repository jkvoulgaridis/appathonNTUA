  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing retrograde intrarenal surgery for kidney stones from November 2017 to May
      2018 were prospectively recruited to participate in the study. In each case after the
      beginning of general anesthesia with mechanical ventilation surgeons were asked to assess the
      mobility of the operative field and conditions for laser lithotripsy according to the
      developed questionnaire scale. The questionnaire consisted of 5 degrees of assessment of
      kidney mobility and each question was scored from 1 to 5, 1 being very mobile (extremely poor
      conditions for dusting) and 5 completely immobile (Ideal conditions for dusting). After this
      assessment modified technique of general anesthesia was applied called combined respiratory
      support which consisted of reduction of tidal volume to 250-300 ml and respiratory rate to
      4-5 per minute with transcatheter high frequency jet ventilation through endotracheal tube
      with a respiratory cycle frequency of 300 per minute and maintained during retrograde
      intrarenal surgery. At the beginning of combined respiratory approach, surgeons were once
      again asked to assess the mobility of the operative field and the conditions for laser
      lithotripsy. Main ventilation parameters were recorded and compared in both regimens.

    <description>a questionnaire was implemented in order to assess surgeon's feedback on novel technique. This was done in 2-step fashion in every patient and each patient served his own control: first, after the beginning of GA with MV in the mode of normal ventilation the questionnaire was implemented and surgeons were asked to assess the mobility of the operative field and the decency of conditions for laser lithotripsy.
Second, novel CRS technique was then instituted and maintained throughout RIRS. Before lithotripsy itself surgeons were once again asked to assess the mobility of the operative field and conditions for laser lithotripsy according to the previously mentioned questionnaire.</description>
