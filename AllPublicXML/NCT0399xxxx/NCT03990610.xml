  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial studies how an investigational surgical procedure called vascularized lymph node
      transfer works in lowering the risk of arm swelling (lymphedema) in patients with breast
      cancer undergoing breast reconstruction. Patients who undergo breast reconstruction are often
      at high risk of developing lymphedema. Vascularized lymph node transfer involves transferring
      lymph nodes from an unaffected area of the body to replace those removed as part of
      treatment, which may lower the risk of lymphedema after breast reconstruction.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine incidence of patients who develop lymphedema following autologous breast
      reconstruction.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the overall complications of prophylactic vascularized lymph node transfers.

      II. Compare the incidence of patients who develop lymphedema following autologous breast
      reconstruction among patients who had prophylactic lymph node transfer and a historical
      cohort who did not have prophylactic lymph node transfer.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo vascularized lymph node transfer during standard of care breast
      reconstructive surgery.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 2 weeks, at 3 and 6 months, and then
      at 1 and 2 years.
