  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For decades, vitamin K antagonists are the main oral anticoagulants used for primary and
      secondary prevention of arterial and venous thromboembolic events. Both observational and
      randomized controlled trials have confirmed an outstanding outcome (the percentage of time in
      the therapeutic range-TTR, effectiveness and safety) in patients received anticoagulation
      management provided by pharmacists (AMPP) in comparing with usual physician care.

      However, at present, pharmacist-managed anticoagulation services are still not popular in
      developing countries. In addition, there are few studies evaluating the patient outcomes with
      the AMPP model in Vietnam. Above all, it is important to explore whether AMPP is superior to
      other usual models in the improvement of effectiveness and safety.

      The study is a randomized controlled trial. Patients who will use VKA are prospectively
      divided into routine group and pharmacist intervention group.

      For the intervention group, patients receive an intensive medical education from pharmacists
      in anticoagulation management service. Pharmacists regularly provide telephone and outpatient
      follow-up. At the end of the 12-month follow-up, the percentage of TTR and major bleeding
      events will be evaluated in both groups.

      Clinical data is designed to be collected from 800 patients, 400 patients in each group. Data
      will be analyzed by SPSS 20.0 software. P &lt; 0.05 is considered significant.

    <description>The time in the therapeutic range (TTR) has been used as a measure of warfarin therapy quality. The percentage of TTR is the percentage of the number of patient's INR achieved therapeutic range on the total number of patient's INR test in the 12-month follow-up of each patient.</description>

    <description>Major bleeding is considered to be those events that resulted in death or the need for acute medical or surgical intervention, also as defined by previously described criteria. Minor bleeding includes increased bruising on the skin and other bleeding episodes not meeting the criteria for major bleeding.</description>
