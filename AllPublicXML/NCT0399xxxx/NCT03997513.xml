  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COPD impacts a significant proportion of the Veteran population. Acute exacerbations, or
      flare-ups, of COPD are associated with impaired muscle function and worse quality of life.
      Pulmonary rehabilitation, a formal exercise program for patients with lung disease that
      includes both endurance and strength training exercises, has been shown to improve muscle
      function and quality of life after an acute exacerbation of COPD. However, lack of
      geographically accessible rehabilitation facilities and/or transportation issues are often
      barriers to pulmonary rehabilitation attendance in the Veteran population. This study will
      assess the feasibility and impact of an eight-week, three sessions per week, home-based,
      pulmonary telerehabilitation program in Veterans with COPD following hospitalization for an
      acute exacerbation of their lung disease. We will measure adherence and satisfaction with the
      program and muscle strength, physical activity, quality of life, and exercise tolerance pre
      and post-intervention in Veterans randomized to the pulmonary telerehabilitation arm versus
      Veterans randomized to the control arm who do not participate in pulmonary rehabilitation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary telerehabilitation programs have been shown to have a high acceptance and adherence
      rate and lead to improvement in exercise capacity and quality of life in stable COPD.
      However, data regarding the feasibility and impact of pulmonary telerehabilitation following
      hospitalization for an Acute Exacerbations of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (AECOPD)
      on physical activity levels, muscle function, exercise capacity, and health-related quality
      of life are lacking. The primary hypothesis is that a home-based pulmonary telerehabilitation
      program initiated at hospital discharge following an AECOPD is feasible in the Veteran
      population and will result in increased physical activity and greater improvement in muscle
      function, exercise capacity, and health-related quality of life compared to usual care. This
      hypothesis will be tested with the following specific aims: (1) To determine the feasibility
      of an eight-week home-based pulmonary telerehabilitation program in Veterans with moderate to
      severe COPD initiated in the immediate post-hospitalization period following an AECOPD. (2)
      To determine physical activity levels and the magnitude and variability in changes of
      measurements of muscle strength, functional exercise performance, and health-related quality
      of life following an eight-week home-based pulmonary telerehabilitation program versus usual
      care initiated in Veterans with moderate to severe COPD immediately following hospitalization
      for an AECOPD. The study will randomize (1:1 allocation) 30 male and female Veterans
      hospitalized with an AECOPD to either an eight-week, three sessions per week, home-based
      pulmonary telerehabilitation program that includes lower extremity endurance exercises with a
      cycle ergometer and upper and lower extremity strength training with 1:1 supervision via
      video conferencing with an exercise physiologist as well as a twice-monthly online support
      group via video conferencing versus usual care. Changes from baseline in physical activity
      levels, handgrip and quadriceps muscle strength, exercise endurance, and health-related
      quality of life will be assessed following the pulmonary telerehabilitation program versus
      usual care. Findings from this project will contribute to the growing field of pulmonary
      telerehabilitation and will provide critical preliminary data for the design and
      implementation of a larger, randomized control trial assessing the impact of pulmonary
      telerehabilitation on long-term clinical outcomes following AECOPD.

    <intervention_model_description>The intervention will consist of an eight-week, three sessions per week, home-based pulmonary telerehabilitation program that will incorporate both lower extremity endurance exercise and upper and lower extremity resistance training.

    <measure>quadriceps muscle strength testing change</measure>
    <time_frame>measured at baseline and at ten weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Quadriceps muscle maximal force (kilogram-force, kgf) will be measured with a Keiser leg press. One repetition maximum (1RM) measures will be obtained by progressively increasing resistance until the participant is unable to successfully complete one repetition. Peak muscle power will be measured at 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, and 90 percent of the 1RM 30 minutes after the 1RM measurement was obtained.</description>

    <measure>Endurance shuttle walk testing change</measure>
    <time_frame>measured at baseline and at ten weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will first complete an incremental shuttle walk test (ISWT), which consist of the participant walking on a level, ten meter course at a pace dictated by audio signals, incrementally increasing in frequency each minute, until either the participant is too breathless to maintain the required speed, is unable to complete a ten meter shuttle in the allowed time, or has walked for 20 minutes. Peak oxygen consumption during the ISWT will be estimated using previously described regression equations. The walking speed corresponding to 75% of the estimated peak oxygen consumption will be used to determine the constant speed of the ESWT. Participants will complete one endurance shuttle walk testing (ESWT), consisting of walking at a constant pace (75% of estimated peak oxygen consumption) on the ten meter course until either the participant is too tired or breathless to continue or 20 minutes of walking time has elapsed.</description>

    <description>Health-related quality of life will be assessed with the Short-Form 36-Item Questionnaire (SF-36) prior to hospital discharge and following eight weeks of either the pulmonary telerehabilitation intervention or usual care. The SF-36 consists of 36 questions spanning nine health domains and is a valid measure of health-related quality of life in COPD that is responsive to change following a pulmonary rehabilitation intervention.</description>

    <description>Participants will be administered a survey by the study coordinator after completion of the eight-week pulmonary telerehabilitation intervention that will require them to respond to statements related to their satisfaction with the home-based program using a five point Likert scale (strongly agree, agree, neutral, disagree, strongly disagree). Statements will address ease of use of the video conferencing modality, acceptability of exercise components, perceptions of impact on muscle strength and exercise endurance, and willingness to participate in additional pulmonary telerehabilitation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>sit-to-stand test change</measure>
    <time_frame>measured at baseline and ten weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The one-minute sit-to-stand test has been shown to be reliable, valid, and responsive to change in exercise capacity following pulmonary rehabilitation in individuals with COPD. The test consists of the participant standing at full leg extension from a sitting position at their own pace as often as possible during a one minute testing interval. The participant is permitted to stop at any time during the one minute interval if necessary. An armless chair is used for testing and the participant is asked to fold their arms across their chest during testing. Two tests will be performed on separate days prior to discharge and the test with the greatest number of repetitions will be used as the baseline performance measure. A third test will be performed following eight weeks of either the pulmonary telerehabilitation intervention or usual care.</description>

    <measure>Handgrip strength</measure>
    <time_frame>measured at baseline and ten weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Handgrip strength of the dominant hand will be measured with a hand dynamometer. Three measurements will be taken with a 60 second recovery period between trials. The average maximal force across trials will be calculated as the final handgrip strength.</description>

    <description>The St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) is a disease-specific questionnaire validated to measure health status in patients with COPD. Total SGRQ scores range from 0-100 with higher scores indicating greater symptoms burden. The minimal clinically important difference is a difference of four points in the total SGRQ score.</description>
