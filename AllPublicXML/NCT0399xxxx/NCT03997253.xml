  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increased indications for transplantation continue to worsen the shortage of organs and need
      the extension of graft sampling criteria and the search for new potential sources of organs.
      Despite undeniable success in the short term, due to major advances in surgery, medicine and
      research, transplant recipients continue to face the risk of chronic rejection and long-term
      complications.

      The University Hospital Federation (UHF) &quot;SUPORT&quot; was created to optimize the chances of
      success of the organ transplant and improve the quality of life of the transplanted patient.
      UHF SUPORT 's ambition is based on a translational strategy that presents two priority areas:

      Axis 1: Optimization, evaluation, conditioning of the donor, graft, recipient Axis 2:
      Personalized follow-up of the transplanted patient in the short and long term Identifying
      factors for long-term graft and patient survival through translational research from a common
      cohort and biological collection will predict transplant rejection, prolong graft function,
      or improve the patient's care.
