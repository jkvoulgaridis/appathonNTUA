  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of the study is to identify altogether 3000 children aged between 12 and 16
      years old with asthma symptoms in six sub-Saharan African countries. The study furthermore
      aims to assess their asthma control, current treatment, knowledge of and attitudes to asthma,
      as well as the barriers to achieving good asthma control.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma prevalence in young people has been rising in several African countries during the
      last decade, reaching between 10% and 20% in Central Africa, and up to 20% in South Africa.
      In addition, asthma related mortality in many African countries is high. South Africa has the
      third highest asthma related mortality rate in the world. Yet to date, a lack of asthma
      research and research infrastructure means that we do not have the evidence to either inform
      advocacy or to develop interventions that improve asthma outcomes.

      This study aims to collect data about asthma prevalence and to identify existing barriers to
      effective asthma management of young people in 6 sub-Saharan countries: Malawi, South Africa,
      Zimbabwe, Uganda, Ghana, and Nigeria. Each of these countries will identify 500 young people
      with asthma between 12 and 16 years of age through a screening questionnaire in schools.
      These 3000 young people with asthma symptoms will fill in a survey about asthma, including
      questions around asthma control, current treatment and access to care, asthma knowledge,
      asthma attitudes, smoking and environmental influences. Some of the participants will also
      discuss asthma related topics in focus groups. A subset of the participants will furthermore
      do Spirometry and FeNO testing. In addition to the data collection, the study will develop
      and test options for an intervention aimed at improving asthma control, including the
      adaption of a United Kingdom - based theater play about asthma awareness. The development of
      WiFi infrastructure and IT solutions will be promoted by the study, where appropriate.

    <measure>Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Each of the 9 items in the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire has a minimum score of 0 and a maximum score of 10.
The consequences score is the response to item 1. The timeline score is the response to item 2. The personal control scores is the response to item 3. The treatment control score is the response to item 4. The identity score is the response to item 5. The coherence score is the response to item 7. The emotional representation is the response to item 8. Illness concern is measured by item 6. Item 9 is the causal item.
Overall score which represents the degree to which the illness is perceived as threatening or benign. To compute that score, reverse score items 3, 4, and 7 and add these to items 1, 2, 5, 6, and 8. A higher score reflects a more threatening view of the illness. The overall score has a minimum score of 0 and a maximum score is 80.</description>
