  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of initiating SUBLOCADE™ treatment
      following a shorter period of transmucosal (TM) buprenorphine treatment.

      Currently patients who are appropriate candidates for SUBLOCADE™ injection for subcutaneous
      (SC) use must initiate treatment with TM buprenorphine for a minimum of 7 days before
      receiving their first injection. This study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      starting SUBLOCADE treatment following a shorter period.

      Adults with moderate to severe opioid use disorder (OUD) not currently receiving medication
      assisted treatment will be recruited to participate. Prior to receiving TM buprenorphine,
      subjects will report their last opioid use and be experiencing at least mild withdrawal.
      Subjects will receive at least one dose of TM buprenorphine to ensure tolerability and that
      they show no evidence of precipitated withdrawal. If no evidence of intolerability or no
      precipitated withdrawal occurs, subjects will receive a single injection of SUBLOCADE and
      remain in the clinic for approximately 48 hours after the injection to assess for safety and
      tolerability.

Timepoints will be reported for 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours post administration.

    <description>Subjects with a diagnosis of OUD will stop use of their current opioid prior to coming to the clinic to be assessed for withdrawal symptoms. If confirmed to be in withdrawal, subjects will be administered TM buprenorphine. Depending on their response after 1 hour, the investigator will either administer additional TM buprenorphine, ask the subject to return to the clinic on another day or administer SUBLOCADE.</description>
