  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The C3PO pilot and feasibility study uses a rigorous, mixed-method research design to provide
      information needed to refine and implement a technology-mediated primary care outreach
      intervention approach before conducting a larger and more definitive future intervention
      trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will implement and evaluate a pragmatic and generalizable framework for population
      management of obesity by the primary care sector. With patient and other stakeholder input,
      the C3PO intervention will be designed to leverage existing primary care professionals and
      technologies to implement a scalable framework for population obesity management that
      coordinates primary care services with extant intensive lifestyle interventions in community
      settings to achieve wider reach and population-level effectiveness. A rigorous, mixed-method
      pilot and feasibility study will provide critical information needed to optimize the
      intervention design and prepare us for a larger and definitive future trial.

    <intervention_model_description>The active intervention &quot;C3PO&quot; involves enhanced use of pragmatic electronic health record system technologies and members of the primary care workforce to increase supportive accountability and problem solving support for weight loss goals and behavior, which in turn will lead to routine self-weighing, increased take up into intensive community programs, and increased adoption and maintenance of healthy eating and physical activity behaviors that collectively lead to greater weight loss at a population level.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Double (Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Patients will be randomized to either Basic Resources and Services or the C3PO intervention arm. Although patients will be aware of the specific forms of support they are receiving throughout the trial, each individual will not be aware that they are part of a randomized experiment and will not know that other patients may be receiving different levels of support. For this reason, the non-concealed nature of the behavioral support intervention for participating patients should not introduce bias. Investigators and outcome assessors will not be aware of intervention assignment during the study conduct or evaluation phase.</masking_description>

    <description>Patients will receive a MyChart activation message assessing weight loss interest that invites them to complete a MyChart Survey encouraging a weight loss goal using principles adapted from Brief Action Planning. Patients will then receive a cellular network-enabled electronic body weight scale, and weighing data transmitted by the scale will be received and integrated into the electronic health record for access by the patient's primary care team.</description>

    <intervention_name>Adaptive Tailoring of Information Delivery and Intensity of Primary Care Outreach Support</intervention_name>
    <description>Data received into the electronic health record from the cellular network-enabled electronic scale will categorize each patient based on their daily self-weighing behaviors and rate of progress towards their weight loss goal. Patients who are not engaged in daily self-weighing or are not making progress towards their goal will receive more intensive outreach support in the form of automated weekly MyChart problem solving messages, more frequent encouragement to access a broader array of community resources, and telephonic support from a nurse care coordinator who is an existing member of the primary care team. Support from this nurse care coordinator will be facilitated by the incorporation of each patient's self-weighing data into an EpicCare patient dashboard accessible to the nurse coordinator and other members of the care team</description>
