      The study evaluates the the utility of a non-invasive skin measurement as a biomarker of
      infant food intake during complementary feeding.

      RATIONALE: During infancy, children go from consuming primarily breast milk or formula, to
      consuming a variety of baby foods and table foods. Doctors, researchers, and community health
      workers are interested in knowing what foods infants eat, but since many infants have
      multiple adult caregivers, it can be hard for one caregiver to accurately recall the dietary
      pattern of the infant. A rapid, non-invasive biomarker of food intake in infants could serve
      as a useful monitoring tool.

      PURPOSE: In order to develop a non-invasive measure of infant food intake, the association
      between infant dietary patterns, skin carotenoids, and blood carotenoids will be evaluated at
      4, 6, and 8 months of age.

      OUTLINE: Infants will visit the research center at 4, 6, and 8 months of age for length,
      weight, skinfold thickness, and skin colorant measures. An infant blood sample will be
      collected at each visit and lactating mothers will be asked to provide a breast milk sample.
      The caregiver will complete a food survey at each visit, will keep an infant food diary for a
      week at 4, 6, and 8 months of age, and will enter the food diaries into an online survey 3
      times during each of the diary weeks.

        Subjects will be recruited using the CNRC and BCM clinical study recruitment websites and
        listservs, the CNRC volunteer database, word of mouth, and approved flyers posted on the
        BCM campus, the Texas Children's Health Plan Center for Women and Children clinics, the
        Texas Children's Hospital/Baylor College of Medicine (TCH/BCM) pediatric clinics, and the
        TCH/BCM obstetrics and gynecology clinics. We will also distribute flyers in-person
        (pending the permission of the clinic) in the waiting rooms of the TCH/BCM pediatrics and
        Texas Children's Health Plan Clinic and at sites throughout the community.
