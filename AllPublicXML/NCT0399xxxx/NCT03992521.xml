    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most common cancer in Austrian women. Estimation of prognosis and
      treatment strategies is increasingly being dependent on stratification of tumors into
      different entities or classes. Currently, clinical routine stratification of tumors is mostly
      based on hormone receptor, HER2 status, and estimation of proliferation. However, a more
      robust and objective classification of tumors can be achieved by elucidation of further
      biological properties, which is also of increasing significance, as novel anticancer
      therapies are based on biological mechanisms. Consequently, available information from
      molecular analyses is increasingly being implemented in routine diagnostic assays with the
      aim to improve stratification for optimal treatment selection. To date the most extensive
      molecular-based taxonomy of breast cancer has been achieved by a classification based on
      combining gene expression and somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs), referred to as
      integrative clusters. Tissue biopsies are the current gold standard to attain such a
      classification. However, they can often be difficult to obtain in the metastatic setting and
      are subject to sampling bias due to intratumor heterogeneity. &quot;Liquid biopsies&quot; are, among
      other analytes, based on the analysis of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) which contains circulating
      tumor DNA (ctDNA), i.e. DNA fragments shed from normal and tumor cells into the blood, in
      patients with cancer. cfDNA can be obtained minimally invasive with a blood draw, allows for
      the &quot;real time&quot; analysis of tumor DNA from the circulation, and blood samples can be repeated
      at any time point, which is especially important for monitoring response to therapy. The
      investigator's group has extensive expertise in the analysis of cfDNA and has developed a
      plethora of approaches for ctDNA analysis. Recently, the investigators have developed a new
      approach, which relates to nucleosome positions and gene expression. cfDNA fragments have
      been associated with the release of DNA from apoptotic cells after enzymatic processing and
      hence consist mainly of mono-nucleosomal DNA. By performing whole-genome sequencing of cfDNA
      the investigators could demonstrate that at transcriptional start sites, the nucleosome
      occupancy results in different read-depth coverage patterns in expressed and silent genes. By
      employing machine learning for gene classification, the investigators were able to classify
      genes in cells releasing their DNA into the circulation as expressed. The main hypothesis of
      the project is that integrative breast cancer clusters can be established from directly blood
      without the need for an invasive tissue biopsy. Hence, the study aims include refining
      stratification of patients for an improved selection of treatment strategies. Furthermore,
      the investigators will obtain novel insights into the biology of metastatic breast cancer, so
      that this project will have important implications for patients, clinical oncologists,
      pathologists, pharmacologists, and all basic researchers interested in cancer.

      The investigators collected 340 plasma samples from 144 clinically annotated patients with
      detailed clinical data. All plasma samples were already analyzed by plasma-Seq, an approach,
      which measures copy number from sequence read depth, for a first evaluation of somatic copy
      number alterations (SCNAs). As this project represents a feasibility study, the investigators
      want to evaluate to what extend cis-acting alterations can be determined, i.e. establish the
      corresponding gene expression changes via nucleosome position mapping as previously published
      by our group. The results will be corroborated by analyses of the corresponding primary tumor
      by SCNA-seq and RNA-seq.

      From the 340 plasma samples the investigators selected 59 as representative for being either
      luminal (i.e. those with amplifications at 17q23, 11q13/q14, 8p12, 8q, and gains of 16p and
      1q; n=25), basal (i.e. gains of 8q, 10p, 12p and various amplifications occurring due to the
      high-genomic instability; n=25), and ERBB2/HER2 (i.e. high-level amplification on 17q,
      centered and including the HER2 gene; n=9). These samples will be sequenced with high
      coverage (70x) so that both mutations and nucleosome positions can be extracted from the
      obtained sequences.
