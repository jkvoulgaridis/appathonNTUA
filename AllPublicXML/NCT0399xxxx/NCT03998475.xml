  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to find out more about how to support young adults
      (ages 18-22) with type 1 diabetes as they prepare to transition from pediatric and adult
      endocrinology medical care.

      The overarching goal of the proposed trial is to improve diabetes self-management and
      glycemic control in young adults and prepare them for the transition to adult endocrinology.
      The current application will investigate the impact of a multisystem transition preparation
      intervention for young adults (ages 18-22) with T1D. Twenty-five young adults and a parent
      will be enrolled in a 6-month transition preparation program which will use a hybrid
      in-person and technology delivery structure. Providers will receive training highlighting
      their role preparing young adults for transition and provides practical tips to use in their
      communication with young adults. If effective, this multisystem intervention, designed to
      enhance T1D self-management and increase young adults' readiness for transition to adult
      healthcare during this critical developmental period, has the potential to inform clinical
      practice guidelines.
