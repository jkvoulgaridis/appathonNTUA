  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      REPAIR-MS is a single-center open label, sequential group, investigator and patient blinded
      study to assess the CNS metabolic effects, safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of
      CNM-Au8 in patients who have been diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) within fifteen (15)
      years of Screening. The primary endpoint is the ratio of the oxidized to reduced form of
      nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+:NADH) measured non-invasively by 31phosphorous
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P-MRS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center open label, sequential group, investigator blinded study of the CNS
      metabolic effects, safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of CNM-Au8 in patients who
      have been diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) within fifteen years of Screening. The
      Sponsor will select a starting treatment dose of CNM-Au8 for the initial treatment.
      Investigators and patients will be blinded to each cohort's study dose. Upon completion of
      the first treatment cohort, the Sponsor will select a single dose or two different doses for
      the subsequent second cohort from a pre-specified dosing selection plan based on the
      evaluation of the 31P-Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (31P-MRS) changes versus baseline in
      the first cohort. Up to a total of two treatment cohorts may be studied (n=12
      patients/cohort, total n=24 patients). All patients will receive daily oral treatment over
      twelve consecutive weeks during each cohort's Treatment Period.

      There will be three study periods per treatment cohort:

      A four-week screening period (Screening Period); A twelve-week treatment period (Treatment
      Period); A six-week follow-up period (End-of-Study Assessment). The primary study outcome,
      CNS metabolic changes, will be assessed based upon each patient's Week 12 study visit versus
      the pre-treatment baseline. The primary endpoint is the brain metabolic effects of treatment
      with CNM-Au8 as assessed by an improvement of 31P-MRS assessment of Brain Tissue Cellular
      Redox Potential defined by the measured tissue ratio of NAD+:NADH concentrations following 12
      weeks of once daily treatment.

    <description>CNM-Au8 is a dark red/purple-colored liquid formulation consisting of a stable suspension of faceted clean surfaced elemental gold nanocrystals in buffered deionized water with a concentration of up to 0.5 mg/mL of gold. The formulation is buffered by sodium bicarbonate present at a concentration of 0.546 mg/mL. There are no other excipients. The drug product is formulated to be taken orally and will be provided in single dose HDPE containers. The study doses vary by the concentration of gold nanocrystals per milliliter in a volume of 60 mL.</description>
