  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this Single arm study, histologically or cytologically confirmed ED-stage small cell lung
      cancer (SCLC) patients resistant to or relapsed after standard chemotherapy will be enrolled
      to investigate the Efficacy and Safety of a Combination of Sintilimab and Metformin.

      Primary outcome:

      Objective response rate (ORR), Safety of the combination therapy

      Secondary outcome:

      Overall survival (OS), Progression-free survival (PFS), Duration of response(DOR),
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Exploratory Endpoints:

      The association between the efficacy of the combination treatment and changes in CTC counts
      after administration of the treatment.

      Evaluating the correlation between programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression derived from
      circulating tumor cells (CTC) and tumor tissue cells, and the predictive role of CTC PD-L1
      expression in ED-SCLC.

      The compositional changes in the gut microbiota after administration of the treatment and its
      association with the efficacy of the combination treatment.

    <intervention_model_description>Patients fulfilling Eligibility Criteria will be included in our study. Participants will be given intravenous administration of Sintilimab (1200mg/3w).
Metformin treatment will be given (day20) 1 week before the second administration of Sintilimab at a dose of 2000 mg daily (1000mg BID).
Treatments will be administrated for one year or until disease progression, death, or unacceptable toxicity.
Regular follow-up and safety assessment: Patients were assessed for drug safety and treatment efficacy every 2 cycles (6 weeks) in the first 3 months after enrollment, and then evaluated every 4 cycles (12 weeks). Assessment of tumor response, adverse events. Follow-up until disease progression and patient death.</intervention_model_description>
