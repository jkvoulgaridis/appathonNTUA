  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim is to investigate the mechanism by which galacto-oligosaccharide acutely increases
      iron absorption by using stable isotope appearance curves. This will allow the evaluation of
      changes in serum iron isotopes over the first few hours after administration of the iron
      supplement and provides information where and in what amount iron absorption takes place in
      the GI-tract.

      Iron is an important mineral in our body and fulfills essential functions such as for example
      oxygen transport from the lungs to the tissues. Iron deficiency is still the most common and
      widespread nutritional disorder in the world according to WHO. Common iron supplements all
      have their limitations in terms of availability and compatibility. Prebiotic fibers, such as
      galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS), selectively enhance growth of beneficial colonic bacteria.
      Prebiotics in general enhance the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and thereby
      decrease luminal pH. Through the reduction in pH, prebiotics can enhance absorption of
      minerals such as calcium and magnesium and they have been proposed to potentially improve
      iron absorption.

      In a recent iron absorption study in adult women with low iron stores in the laboratory of
      human nutrition ETH zurich, it was found that 15 g of GOS given with an iron supplement in
      the form of iron fumarate acutely increased iron absorption when given with water and a bread
      based meal. The dose of 15 g of GOS was tolerated well by the participants. As a follow up to
      the study, the aim of the current study is to investigate the mechanism by which GOS acutely
      increases iron absorption by using stable isotope appearance curves. This will allow the
      evaluation of changes in serum iron isotopes over the first few hours after administration of
      the iron supplement and provides information where and in what amount iron absorption takes
      place in the GI-tract.
