  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (aHUS) is a rare, lifethreatening, chronic disease of
      complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) characterized by acute onset of renal
      impairment, thrombocytopenia, and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. The estimated incidence
      of aHUS is approximately 0.5 per million per year. aHUS affects both adults and children, but
      is observed primarily in children and young adults.

      Atypical HUS commonly develops due to dysregulation of the alternative complement pathway and
      can be sporadic (80%) or familial(20%).

      The clinical course of aHUS is often unpredictable and can be dependent upon the specific
      genetic abnormality present within the complement system, if any, and/or triggering events
      associated with complement activation or inflammation, including autoimmune disease,
      transplant, pregnancy, infection, metabolic conditions, and drug use. In patients with
      dysregulated complement activity, such as those with complement mutations commonly observed
      in aHUS, the kidney vasculature is often the site of thrombosis stemming from endothelial
      injury.

      Cemdisiran has been designed to reduce the level of C5 mRNA in the liver, thereby reducing
      levels of circulating C5 protein, inhibiting terminal complement pathway activity, and
      preventing formation and deposition of the MAC (C5-b9) on endothelial cells in the kidney. As
      a result, complement-mediated endothelial cell damage in patients with aHUS and subsequent
      progression to End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) may be reduced.

             contraception;

         10. Documented previous immunisation against Neisseria meningitidis (serotypes A, C, Y,
             W135 e B) by anti A, C, W and Y vaccine and anti B vaccine (Bexsero®) and antibiotic

             should be vaccinated.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Solid organ or bone marrow/stem cell transplantation;

          2. Alanine transaminase (ALT) &gt;3×ULN, INR &gt;2 (or &gt;3.5 if on anticoagulants), or total
             bilirubin &gt;3×ULN (unless bilirubin elevation is due to Gilbert's syndrome);

          3. Clinical or biochemical evidence of active thrombotic; microangiopathy or flare of
             aHUS at the time of enrolment

          4. Evidence of Shigatoxin associated HUS;

          5. Patients who required intensified eculizumab therapy because of uncontrolled disease
             (these patients could be at very high risk of relapse after the shift, even in the
             cemdisiran treatment arm and their inclusion could be unsafe);

          6. Patients who did not relapse despite prolonged (&gt;3 months) interruption of eculizumab
             therapy (these would probably be low risk patients that are expected to be event-free
             throughout the whole study period independent of treatment allocation and could have a
             dilution effect for event analyses);

          7. Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of sepsis, defined as positive blood cultures
             within 7 days of the screening visit and not treated with antibiotics to which the
             organism is sensitive;

          8. Presence or suspicion of active and untreated systemic bacterial infection that, in
             the opinion of the Investigator confounds an accurate diagnosis of aHUS or impedes the
             ability to manage the aHUS disease;

          9. Evidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (positive serology for HIV antibody
             [HIV Ab]), hepatitis B infection (positive hepatitis B surface antigen [HbsAg]), or

             syndrome;

         12. Exposure to any other investigational drug acting directly on the complement system
             (except for eculizumab) within 5 half-lives of screening is prohibited;

         14. History of malignancy within 5 years of screening;

         15. Participation in other clinical trials within 4 weeks of signing the consent form;

         17. Any severe systemic disorder that could interfere with the evaluation of the study
             treatment (e.g. hepatic disease) that in the opinion of the Investigator would affect
             the outcome of the study or interfere with interpretation of results;

         18. Failure to satisfy the Investigator of fitness to participate for any other reason or
             any condition (e.g. severe depression or psychiatric disorder) that, in the opinion of
             the Investigator, could increase the subject's risk by participating in the study or
             confound the outcome of the study;

         19. If female, the subject is pregnant or lactating or intending to become pregnant
             before, during, or within 90 days after last dose; or intending to donate ova during
             such time period;

         20. If male, the subject intends to donate sperm while on the study or for 90 days after
             last study drug administration;

         21. The subject has a history of drug abuse (defined as any illicit drug use) or a history
             of alcohol abuse within one year prior to screening. Alcohol abuse is defined as
             regular weekly intake of &gt;14 units (unit: 1 glass of wine [125 mL] =1 measure of
             spirits=1/2 pint [0.25 mL] of beer). Alcohol is limited to no more than 2 units per
             day for the duration of the study;

         22. Patients with a poor prognosis that is expected to limit their life expectancy to less
             than 3 months, in the opinion of the Investigator;

         23. History of multiple drug allergies or history of allergic reaction to an
             oligonucleotide or GalNAc;

         24. History of intolerance to subcutaneous (SC) injection(s) or significant abdominal
             scarring that could potentially hinder cemdisiran administration or evaluation of
             local tolerability.
