  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, Phase 1b/2 study with multiple treatment arms evaluating the safety,
      tolerability, PK, and preliminary efficacy of rucaparib in combination with a second
      anticancer therapy in patients with an advanced/metastatic solid malignancy (Phase 1b),
      followed by evaluation of the combination in one or more specific patient populations in an
      expansion phase (Phase 2 cohorts).
