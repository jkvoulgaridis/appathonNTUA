  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total knee arthroplasty is a common and effective surgical procedure for patients with
      end‚Äêstage knee osteoarthritis, and wound pain is still a problem for many of the patients.

      Therefore, the purpose of this study was to apply low level laser therapy Measured variables
      included postoperative pain intensity, patient-controlled analgesia requirements, side
      effects caused by morphine, knee stiffness and wound pain in the daily activities of patients
      undergoing total knee arthroplasty. Data were collected between April 2018 and January 2019.
      Eighty-two knee osteoarthritis patients receiving total knee arthroplasty were recruited from
      one hospital and randomly, equally assigned to the laser acupuncture or control group. The LA
      group received the low-level laser therapy with 3 joules at each acupuncture point at Hour 2,
      Hour 6, Hour 10, Hour 24, Hour 48, and Hour 72 after surgery; whereas the control group
      received the same manner except for joule.

    <measure>The Numerical Rating Scale (NRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>the first 72 hours after the surgery</time_frame>
    <description>NRS was assessed pain intensity, ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain imaginable).higher scores, higher pain.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Brief Pain Inventory (BPI)</measure>
    <time_frame>the first 72 hours after the surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The patients answered or pointed their pain on 0-to-10 scales (0=no pain, 10=extreme pain) at the time of responding to the BPI(current pain), and also at the items of &quot;the most severe pain&quot;, &quot;the least pain&quot;, and &quot;the average pain&quot; in the last 24 hours. Using the BPI, patients were also asked to rate pain-related interference in daily activities, including general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleeping, and enjoyment of life. The anchor points, in each items of interference scale, were 11-point NRSs (0=no interference, 10=interferes completely).</description>
