    <textblock>
      This phase II single-arm pilot study will evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of
      Optune-Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) therapy as a prophylactic approach to reducing small
      cell lung cancer (SCLC) brain metastases. Optune is a portable battery powered device that
      produces alternating electrical fields, termed tumor treatment fields (&quot;TTFields&quot;) within the
      human body. These TTFields are applied to the patient by electrically insulated surface
      transducer arrays, which function to disrupt the rapid cell division of cancer cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Observed rate of brain metastases following TTFields therapy at 6 months.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Observed rate of brain metastases following TTFields therapy at 12 months. II. Survival of
      participants with SCLC after using TTFields therapy. III. Usage and overall safety
      characteristics of TTFields therapy. IV. Quality of life among participants using TTFields
      therapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants will receive TTFields therapy on a continuous basis (i.e., 18-24 hours a day, 7
      days a week) for a period of 12 months or until the development of brain metastases,
      whichever comes first. Participants will be able to carry the device in an over-the-shoulder
      bag or backpack so that they can receive continuous at-home treatment. The investigator or
      other designated healthcare provider will provide detailed instructions regarding the
      placement/replacement and positioning of the transducer arrays on the participants head.
      TTFields are applied to the shaved scalp via two pairs of orthogonally positioned transducer
      arrays. Each pair of transducer arrays will be centered on the participants shaved head such
      that one pair is placed on the left and right side of the head, and the second pair placed
      anteriorly and posteriorly. Transducer arrays should be replaced every 2 to 3 days, with a
      slight relocation of the new arrays ~2 cm from the prior location.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.

    <description>Quality of life (QoL) among participants using TTFields therapy evaluated using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core-30 (EORTC QLQ-C30). The EORTC QLQ-C30 uses for the questions 1 to 28 a 4-point scale. The scale scores from 1 to 4: 1 (&quot;Not at all&quot;), 2 (&quot;A little&quot;), 3 (&quot;Quite a bit&quot;) and 4 (&quot;Very much&quot;). For questions 29 and 30, a 7-points scale is used. The scale scores from 1 to 7: 1 (&quot;very poor&quot;) to 7 (&quot;excellent&quot;). Summary of QoLs and its change over time will be presented graphically.</description>
