  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Signed and dated, written informed consent form (ICF) prior to any trial-specific
             procedures.

          2. Male or female aged ≥ 18 years (no upper limit of age) at the time of ICF signature.

          3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.

          4. Life expectancy of at least 3 months.

          5. Patients with a SIRPα polymorphism including at least one V1 allele will be selected
             (i.e., homozygous V1/V1 or heterozygous V1/V2 in separate cohorts in escalation [Step
             1] and only homozygous V1/V1 in expansion cohorts [Step 2]); SIRPα polymorphism will
             be assessed in blood sampling (patient DNA) in a central laboratory; V1 allele is
             understood to include V1 and V1-like alleles.

          6. In Step 1: Patients with histologically or cytologically documented
             advanced/metastatic primary or recurrent malignancies who failed or are not eligible
             to standard therapy;

             In Step 2: Patients with histologically or cytologically documented
             advanced/metastatic primary or recurrent solid tumors who failed or are not eligible
             to standard therapy with the following tumour types: NSCLC, TNBC, pancreatic cancer,
             melanoma, HNSCC, RCC, UC, SCL, gastric cancer, CRC and ovarian cancer. Patients
             included in Step 2 must have no alternative treatment and have been previously treated
             with the standard of care therapy including chemotherapy, targeted therapy and/or
             immune check-point inhibitors, as per local guidelines (except if contra-indication
             and/or ineligibility).

          7. Patients with at least one measurable lesion as per RECIST v1.1.

          8. Patients must agree to pre- and on-treatment tumor biopsies. Fresh tumor biopsy may
             come either from the primary tumor or from a metastasis. Cytological material is not
             accepted. Archival tumor biopsy is acceptable, if done within 4 weeks before the first
             treatment administration.

             Biopsy sites should be carefully selected by the investigator so that it is safe for
             the patient and subsequent biopsy can be performed at the same location; also if
             possible should be distinct from the measurable lesion;

          9. Adequate biological parameters defined as:

               1. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 10^9/L.

                  1.5 x ULN is authorized.

               5. Aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 x ULN.

               6. Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 ULN; or creatinine clearance &gt; 50 mL/min (Chronic Kidney
                  Disease Epidemiology [CKD-EPI] formula).

               7. INR ≤ 1.5 (except if patient treated with anti-vitamin K); anticoagulation with
                  anti-vitamin K and Low Molecular Weight Heparin [LMWH] is allowed;

         10. Prior major treatment-related surgery completed at least 28 days before study drug
             administration;

         11. In all cohorts :

               -  An interval of at least 28 days since the last chemotherapy, approved
                  immunotherapy, biological or investigational therapy, radiation or tyrosine
                  kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy (sunitinib, sorafenib) must have elapsed before
                  the first study drug administration(s);

               -  And all toxicities related to previous anticancer therapies have resolved to
                  normal value or ≤ to Grade 1 prior to the study treatment administration, except
                  alopecia.

         12. Women must not be breastfeeding;

         13. Women of childbearing potential (WOCB) must agree to use highly effective methods of
             contraception (i.e. one that results in a less than 1% per year failure rate when used
             consistently and correctly), prior to study entry, during the study and for 5 months
             after the last dose of study drug.

             Highly effective methods of contraception are defined as one of the following methods:
             combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with
             inhibition of ovulation (oral, intravaginal, transdermal), progestogen-only hormonal

             during the study and until 5 months after last dose of study drug. WOCBP partners of
             male subjects participating in the study may use hormone based contraceptives as one
             of the acceptable methods of contraception since they will not be receiving study drug
             (i.e.; oral hormonal contraception, cap, diaphragm, or sponge with spermicide).

         15. Females of childbearing potential must have a serum negative pregnancy test within 7
             days prior to first administration. Females who are postmenopausal for at least 1 year
