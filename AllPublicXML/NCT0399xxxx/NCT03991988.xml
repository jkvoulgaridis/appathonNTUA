  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a one-year, double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial that compares
      montelukast to placebo in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. The measures include cognitive function, CSF biomarkers
      and neuroimaging (cerebral perfusion and markers of vascular brain damage).

      Participants will be treated with montelukast (escalating doses:10, 20 to 40 mg) or matched
      placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment options for Alzheimer's disease (AD) remain limited, especially treatments linking
      neurovascular and neuroinflammatory changes with clinical manifestations of the disease.
      Prior research studies have documented a positive effect of cysteinyl leukotriene type 1
      (cysLT-1) receptor antagonist, particularly Montelukast, on inflammatory processes in the
      brain and on neuronal injury, blood-brain-barrier (BBB) integrity, and amyloid-β42 (Aβ)
      protein accumulation. Although montelukast is currently in use for the treatment of
      inflammatory diseases e.g. bronchial asthma and exercise-induced bronchospasm, its effects on
      memory and thinking abilities and on AD biomarkers are yet to be fully understood.

      This is a single site randomized controlled trial at Emory University that compares the
      effects of montelukast vs. placebo on memory and thinking abilities, as well as on brain
      imaging and markers of brain degeneration. Each participant will undergo a screening process
      following informed consent to determine if they meet study eligibility criteria. Participants
      will be enrolled in the study for 1 year and will be compensated for their participation.

    <measure>Change in Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The NPI-Q is designed to be a self-administered questionnaire completed by informants about patients for whom they care. Each of the 12 NPI-Q domains contains a survey question that reflects cardinal symptoms of that domain. Initial responses to each domain question are &quot;Yes&quot; (present) or &quot;No&quot; (absent). If the response to the domain question is &quot;No&quot;, the informant goes to the next question. If &quot;Yes&quot;, the informant then rates both the Severity of the symptoms present within the last month on a 3-point scale and the associated impact of the symptom manifestations on them (i.e. Caregiver Distress) using a 5-point scale. The NPI-Q provides symptom Severity and Distress ratings for each symptom reported, and total Severity and Distress scores reflecting the sum of individual domain scores</description>
