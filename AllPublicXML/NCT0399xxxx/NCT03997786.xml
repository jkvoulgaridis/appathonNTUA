  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study has been designed with two components. Part A is an open label PK study followed by
      a randomized trial component (Part B). The initial PK analysis is first done in adolescent
      subjects (12 to &lt;18 years) before initiating the PK study in younger cohort (6 to &lt;12 years)

    <description>The CDLQI is a 10-item questionnaire that measures the impact of skin disease on children's (aged 2-15 years) quality of life. Each question was evaluated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much); where higher scores indicate more impact on quality of life. The CDLQI total score was the sum of individual scores of question 1-10 and ranges from 0 (not at all) to 30 (very much): 0-1 = no effect at all on the children's life; 2-6 = small effect on the children's life; 7-12 = moderate effect on the children's life; 13-18 = very large effect on the children's life; 19-30 = extremely large effect on the children's life. Higher scores indicate more impact on quality of life of children.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject must be 6 to &lt; 18 years of age, of either sex, of any race/ ethnicity, must
             weight greater than or equal to 15Kg.

          -  Diagnosis of predominantly plaque psoriasis for ≥6 months (as determined by subject
             interview and confirmation of diagnosis through physical examination by investigator).

          -  Moderate to severe psoriasis at baseline defined as: at least 10% Body Surface Area
             (BSA) involvement, PGA score ≥ 3, and PASI score ≥ 12

          -  Subject must be considered a candidate for systemic therapy, meaning psoriasis
             inadequately controlled by topical treatments (corticosteroids), and/or phototherapy,
             and/or previous systemic therapy

          -  Subject is considered to be eligible according to tuberculosis (TB) screening criteria

          -  A maximum of 2 QuantiFERON tests will be allowed. A re-test is only permitted if the
             first is indeterminate; the result of the second test will then be used.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has predominantly non-plaque forms of psoriasis specifically erythrodermic
             psoriasis, predominantly pustular psoriasis, medication-induced or
             medication-exacerbated psoriasis, or new-onset guttate psoriasis

          -  Subject has laboratory abnormalities at screening including any of the following:
             Alanine transaminase (ALT) or aspartate transaminase, (AST) ≥2X the upper limit of
             normal, Creatinine ≥1.5X the upper limit of normal serum direct bilirubin ≥ 1.5 mg/dL,
             white blood cell count &lt; 3.0 x 103/μL, and any other laboratory abnormality, which, in
             the opinion of the Investigator, will prevent the subject from completing the study or
             will interfere with the interpretation of the study results

          -  Subject who is expected to require topical therapy, phototherapy, or additional
             systemic therapy for psoriasis during the trial

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential who are pregnant, intend to become pregnant
             (within 6 months of completing the trial), or are lactating. (Sexually active
             adolescent girls will be required to use contraception)

          -  Subject with presence of any infection or history of recurrent infection requiring
             treatment with systemic antibiotics within 2 weeks prior to Screening, or severe
             infection (e.g. pneumonia, cellulitis, bone or joint infections) requiring
             hospitalization or treatment with IV antibiotics within 8 weeks prior to Screening

          -  Positive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) test result, hepatitis B surface (HBS)
             antigen, or hepatitis C virus (HCV) test result
