        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18 to 65 years old (inclusive)

          -  For women of childbearing potential, a negative pregnancy test at screening and on
             vaccination day, practicing highly effective contraception for at least 30 days prior
             to vaccination, and willing to use a highly effective method of contraception through
             study completion.

          -  Able and willing to provide informed consent for study participation prior to
             screening procedures.

          -  Free of obvious health problems as established by medical history and clinical
             examination at screening and enrollment.

          -  Available to participate for the duration of the study (approximately 8 months).

          -  For the cohort of prior alphavirus vaccine recipients, a documented history of prior
             alphavirus vaccination.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Acute disease or febrile illness at the time of screening or enrollment.

          -  Clinically significant cardiac, respiratory, rheumatologic or other medical or
             psychiatric condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, places the subject at
             increased risk or affects their ability to understand and comply with study
             procedures.

          -  Abnormal screening lab test result that, in the opinion of the investigator, obscures
             interpretation of the safety data or suggests a clinically significant cardiac,
             respiratory, rheumatologic or other medical condition that places the subject at
             increased risk.

          -  Pregnant, lactating or planning to become pregnant during the study period.

          -  Laboratory evidence of infection with Hepatitis B, C or HIV.

          -  History of naturally (non-laboratory) acquired chikungunya or other alphavirus
             infection or travel to a WHO-designated chikungunya-endemic region within 30 days
             prior to Day 1.

          -  History of acute allergic reaction to any component of CHIKV-VLP vaccine or
             Alhydrogel速.

          -  Current (30 days prior to Day 1) or anticipated use of systemic immunomodulatory or
             immunosuppressive medications.

          -  History of splenectomy, immunosuppressive condition, autoimmune disease, or
             immunodeficient condition.

          -  Family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency.

          -  Suspected or known current alcohol or drug abuse that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, would interfere with the subject's ability to understand and comply with
             study procedures.

          -  Current intravenous drug use.

          -  Prior receipt of an investigational chikungunya vaccine.

          -  Receipt or planned receipt of any licensed vaccine from 30 days prior to Day 1 through
             Day 29.

          -  Participation in another clinical trial during the study period in which an
             investigational product is administered.

          -  For the cohort of alphavirus na誰ve vaccine recipients, history of prior alphavirus
             vaccination is exclusionary.
