  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TENS-LA trial is a randomised control trial to assess the possible efficacy of Transcutaneous
      Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) on eliminating or reducing the pain of local anaesthetic
      injection for minor surgical procedures. Comparison is done with a mixture of local
      anaesthetic cream (EMLA) which is used at times for the same purpose. Though local procedures
      are carried out in various parts of the body, this trial will be conducted specifically on
      patients undergoing a split skin graft harvest from the thigh. Patients who meet the
      eligibility criteria and are willing to participate will be randomised to receive either TENS
      or EMLA.

      Results will be analysed based on the pain score records at the end of the trial

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing a split skin graft harvest will be selected from theatre lists and will
      be given complete information regarding the nature of trial, possible complications, risks
      and advantages by sending them a Patient Information Sheet at least a week prior to the
      procedure when they are send an appointment. On the day of procedure, either the Chief
      Investigator or one of the other two Investigators will see the patient in the Theatre
      Arrivals Area and have a full discussion on the details of the trial and will answer all
      their questions. Patients willing to take part and are within the inclusion criteria and does
      not have any of the exclusion criteria will be randomised to either the study group or the
      control group after obtaining informed consent.

      The trial group will have the TENS to the area planned for injection for 30 minutes before
      injection of the local anaesthetic (a combination of 0.25% levobupivacaine and 1% lignocaine
      with 1/200,000 adrenaline). The control group will have EMLA applied on the site planned for
      local anaesthetic injection and after 1 hour , will be removed and immediately injected with
      the same anaesthetic solution (this is already a procedure practised by some of the
      surgeons).

      Pain perception will be evaluated using two Numeric Pain Rating Scales in the study and
      control groups- one to assess the pain of needle penetration and the second to assess the
      pain of local infiltration. The Numeric pain scale is filled in by the doctor as indicated by
      the patient. Pulse rate and Blood Pressure monitoring will be carried out as an objective
      measurement of response to pain (these are routinely recorded when patient is in the theater
      for a procedure). Patient involvement in the study ends at this point.

      Analysis of the outcome will be done at the end of the trial period.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The primary outcome is pain of local anaesthetic injection after application of TENS or LA cream as measured by two Numeric Pain Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Pain perception will be evaluated using two Numeric Pain Rating Scales in the study and control groups. One scale will assess the pain caused by needle piercing the skin and the second will do so for the pain caused by infiltration of local anaesthetic agent.
The scale used is &quot;Numeric Pain rating scale&quot; which shows a transverse line with values from 0 to 10 from left to right where 0 indicates no pain and 10 worst possible pain. The middle, which is 5 indicates moderate pain. Outcome of the intervention is better towards the left indicating less pain and worse towards the right indicating more pain.
No sub scales are used.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in blood pressure in response to injection of local anaesthetic</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Blood Pressure (BP) monitoring will be carried out as an objective measurement of response to pain. The unit of measurement is mm of Hg (millimetres of Mercury). This measurement is to assess if there is a rise in BP in response to the local anaesthetic injection after application of either TENS or EMLA and if present, to what extent. The changes will be analysed with respect to the baseline BP recording of the patient.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in heart rate in response to injection of local anaesthetic</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Heart rate (HR) monitoring will be carried out as an objective measurement of response to pain. The unit of measurement is number per minute. This measurement is to assess if there is a rise in HR in response to the local anaesthetic injection after application of either TENS or EMLA and if present, to what extent. The changes will be analysed with respect to the baseline HR recording of the patient.</description>
