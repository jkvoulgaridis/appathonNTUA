  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have developed a mobile app called Resolving Psychological Stress (REPS) to
      help alleviate symptoms of PTSD. The app will administer threat-related attention bias
      modification to individuals who have both a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
      Disorders V (DSM-V) diagnosis of PTSD (and meet at least one DSM-V criteria for threat
      sensitivity) and a DSM-V diagnosis of Alcohol Use Disorder. The aims of the study are to
      explore both the feasibility and acceptability of the app with it's users, and to explore the
      efficacy of the app at alleviating PTSD severity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a highly disabling disorder that affects
      approximately 30 million people in the United States. New low-cost and accessible treatments
      for PTSD are desperately needed. Threat-related attention biases represent an important
      potential treatment target for PTSD. Such attention biases predict risk for PTSD following
      trauma exposure, and are thought to maintain symptoms of PTSD and other anxiety disorders.
      Research indicates that specific forms of computerized attention bias modification (ABM) are
      effective in reducing attention bias for threat as well as anxiety in patients with diverse
      anxiety disorders. The investigators have developed a mobile &quot;app&quot; called RePS (Resolving
      Psychological Stress) to administer threat-related ABM to patients with PTSD and Alcohol Use
      Disorder and have tested it in a laboratory-based pilot study of 19 people with PTSD.
      Preliminary data indicate that the app is highly acceptable to patients and that use of the
      app reduces attention bias for threat and PTSD symptom severity. The study aims are to
      examine the feasibility, acceptability and usability of app-based ABM; and determine the
      efficacy of app-based ABM in reducing attention bias and PTSD severity.

    <measure>Reduction of PTSD symptoms as captured by the Clinical Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 days</time_frame>
    <description>The CAPS will be administered by a trained clinical interviewer and will assess changes in PTSD symptoms. The Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) is a well validated and widely used structured 30-item diagnostic interview for assessing symptomology of PTSD corresponding to a DSM-5 diagnosis. CAPS-5 Provides information on current and lifetime PTSD symptoms and status; providing a diagnosis, frequency, and intensity of symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Differences in heart rate variability (HRV) during a threat sensitivity computerized task</measure>
    <time_frame>2 days</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will perform computerized tasks designed to assess threat sensitivity. The task contains three different &quot;threat&quot; conditions, regarding the possibility of receiving a small, electric shock via an electrode on the hand (shock level is set by the participant). The three conditions are: shock not possible, shock possible, and shock may be possible. HRV is measured during all conditions and differences between the three conditions are scored.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Score of a questionnaire assessing feasibility and acceptability of the Attention Bias Modification (ABM) application</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will report if REPS is acceptable in multiple areas (e.g. ease of use, ability to maintain attention and motivation for training, enjoyment of the task) as measured by responses on a self-report questionnaire.</description>
