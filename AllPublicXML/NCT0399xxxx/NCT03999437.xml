  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tinea pedis or athlete's foot is the most common fungal infection worldwide, caused by
      infection of the feet with dermatophytes such as Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton
      interdigitale (formerly Trichophyton mentagrophytes), and Epidermophyton floccosum. Diagnosis
      of tinea pedia involves clinical symptoms as well as microscopic examination. Topical
      therapies are usually applied once or twice daily for as long as 4 weeks, posing a challenge
      to compliance. The current study aims to test a formulation of the single-dose 1% terbinafine
      hydrochloride, as well as a single-dose 1% butenafine hydrochloride, versus a vehicle control
      in adult Filipino patients with athlete's foot. This study will benefit the Filipino
      community by helping us determine which anti-fungal cream is most effective for athlete's
      foot.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or nonpregnant females aged 18-60 years old.

          -  Clinical diagnosis of tinea pedis (total sign/symptom score &gt;2), lesions between the
             toes, with possible extension to the lateral surfaces and soles of the feet confirmed
             by a positive microscopy prior to dosing.

          -  Willing to sign the informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Females who are pregnant (confirmed by a pregnancy test), suspect themselves to be
             pregnant (even if pregnancy test is negative), breast-feeding, or planning a
             pregnancy.

          -  Signs of systemic or other superficial fungal disease (e.g.onychomycosis), clinically
             relevant abnormal findings upon physical examination of the foot or previous treatment
             with a disallowed medication (such as corticosteroids).

          -  Presence of non-healing wounds and/or bacterial infection on the feet.

          -  Secondary bacterial infection due to tinea pedis

          -  Presence of pigmentation, extensive scarring, or pigmented lesions in the treatment
             areas, which could interfere with the rating of efficacy parameters.

          -  History of hypersensitivity to any component of the test products.

          -  Current imuunosuppression. Specifically, these include ï¿¼patients with co-morbidities
             such as diabetes, HIV, chronic diseases requiring maintenance medications, acute
             febrile/infectious illnesses (i.e. Dengue, pneumonia, etc)

          -  Use within 3 months prior to baseline of: 1.) chemotherapy, or 2.) radiation therapy
