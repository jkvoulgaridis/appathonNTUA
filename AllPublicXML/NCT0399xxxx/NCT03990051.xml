  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and efficacy of Pro-ocular™ 1% topical gel administered twice daily
      for 70 days in reducing or eliminating symptoms and signs of chronic ocular GvHD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ocular graft versus host disease presents a most severe form of ocular surface disease that
      compromises quality of life of afflicted allogeneic hematopoietic transplantation patients.

      A controlled study is necessary to verify findings obtained to date in isolated patients.
      Currently available ophthalmic solutions and suspensions, drugs and devices largely have not
      been effective in alleviating the suffering of chronic ocular GvHD patients. Thus, this is an
      unmet need that Pro-ocular™ topical gel can fulfill.

      Potential benefits: Decrease or cessation of adverse ocular symptoms and signs of chronic
      ocular GvHD, reduction or elimination of the need for other topical ocular therapeutic
      treatments for chronic ocular GvHD, and restoration of quality of life.
