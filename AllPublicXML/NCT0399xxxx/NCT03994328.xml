  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate how safinamide, rasagiline and other SoC drugs are
      associated with the quality of life of PD patients by means of the Parkinson's Disease
      Questionnaire (PDQ)-39 items.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Safinamide is an alpha-aminoamide derivative, structurally unrelated to any other drug for
      the treatment of PD, with a dual mechanism of action (dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic). In
      particular, it is a potent, selective and reversible MAO-B inhibitor, and it is a glutamate
      modulator through the sodium channels blockade.

      Safinamide has been approved in Europe for the treatment of mid- to late-stage patients with
      idiopathic PD and fluctuations as add-on therapy to a stable dose of levodopa (alone or in
      combination with other PD medications).

      Rasagiline is an irreversible MAO-B inhibitor, with unknown activity on other
      neurotransmitters. Rasagiline has been approved in Europe for the treatment of idiopathic PD
      as monotherapy or as add-on to levodopa in patients with end of dose fluctuations.

      The aim of this observational study is to evaluate the effectiveness of safinamide,
      rasagiline and other &quot;standard of care&quot; (SoC) drugs when prescribed in clinical routine as
      add-on to L-dopa in terms of quality of life, improvement of chronic pain, change in
      Anti-Parkinson treatment (modification of doses, addition or withdrawal or other
      Anti-Parkinson drugs, etc.), use of concomitant pain-killer medications, compliance to the PD
      treatment, hospitalizations and use of other healthcare resources, and number of lost working
      days.
