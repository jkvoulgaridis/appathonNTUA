  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify the highest tolerable dose of pyrotinib in
      combination with vinorelbine and to assess the safety and efficacy of the combination in
      Patients With HER2-Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer.

      The study will be conducted in two parts. In the first part, testing will be done on up to 12
      subjects to determine the highest tolerable dose of pyrotinib and vinorelbine in patients
      with advanced solid tumors. In the second part of the study, we will compare the safety and
      efficacy of Pyrotinib + vinorelbine vs. Treatment of Physician's Choice in Patients With
      HER2-Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer Who Have Received Prior
      Trastuzumab-Based Therapy.Participants will be treated until disease progression (PD),
      unmanageable toxicity, or study termination.

    <description>The treatment of physician's choice (TPC) was a protocol-specified approved or standard of care therapy or combination of therapies, based on frequently used regimens for second-line HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer treatment after receipt of trastuzumab-containing regimens. The therapies included single-agent chemotherapy, single-agent (e.g., tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitor) or dual-agent (e.g., aromatase inhibitor with luteinizing hormone releasing hormone [LHRH] agonist) hormonal therapy for hormone receptor positive-disease, and single-agent HER2-directed therapy.</description>
