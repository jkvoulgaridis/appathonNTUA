  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose of the study; The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of two different
      exercise programs on joint patency, pain, functionality, kinesophobia and quality of life in
      upper extremity burn patients. Lütfi Kırdar Training and Research Hospital Burn and Wound
      Center and unilateral upper extremity burns will consist of individuals aged 18-65 years. 48
      burn patients who volunteered to participate in the study will be included in the study.
      Demographic information of the cases will be recorded. Joint range of motion and pain will be
      evaluated with the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) before and after the treatment program.
      Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire will be used to evaluate
      upper extremity functions. TAMPA Kinezophobia questionnaire will also be used for
      kinesiophobia. To evaluate the quality of life, Burn-Specific Health Scale developed for burn
      patients will be used.

      Joint range of motion of the subjects will be measured with a goniometer. Pain will be
      evaluated with the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). In order to evaluate the upper extremity
      functions, the validity and reliability of the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand
      (DASH) questionnaire, conducted by Tülin Düger et al. The TAMPA Kinezophobia questionnaire,
      which has been validated and validated in 2011, will be used for kinesiophobia. The
      Burn-Specific Health Scale developed for burn patients will be used to evaluate the quality
      of life. The validity and reliability study of the questionnaire was conducted by Mehmet Adam
      et al.
