  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study population is advanced gastric, gastroesophageal, and esophageal adenocarcinoma
      participants who have failed upfront standard of care chemotherapy. The goal is to
      demonstrate that Rucaparib plus Ramucirumab with or without Nivolumab has a higher response
      rate than what has been reported for Ramucirumab in previously treated patients. Trial will
      be a phase 1/2 trial. The Phase 1 portion will determine the recommended Phase 2 treatment
      dose for the combination of Rucaparib plus Ramucirumab and Nivolumab and enroll approximately
      6-9 participants. The Phase 2 portion of the study will involve 52 participants allocated
      between two treatment groups comparing Rucaparib plus Ramucirumab with or without Nivolumab.
      The participants will be selected based on the results of a screening HRD gene panel.

    <intervention_model_description>Phase 1 - Safety Lead In - Enroll 6-9 molecularly unselected participants to determine the safety of the triplet combination of Rucaparib plus Ramucirumab and Nivolumab. One level dose de-escalation of Rucaparib will be planned based on dose limiting toxicity (DLT) signal of the first 6 participants run in phase.
Phase 2 - Parallel - Enroll 52 participants (26 in each cohort), open label, two treatment cohorts design evaluating Rucaparib plus Ramucirumab with or without Nivolumab. 50 percent (%) of participants enrollment to each treatment cohort will represent molecularly unselected population and the remaining 50% will be selected based on integrated screening tumor Homologous Recombination Deficiency (HRD) gene panel. The primary objective is efficacy by measuring the Overall Response Rate (ORR).</intervention_model_description>
