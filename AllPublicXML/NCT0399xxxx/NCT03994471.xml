  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized, controlled, parallel groups, open-label, blinded end-point assessment,
      multicenter study, comparing the effects of a low glucose peritoneal dialysis solution,
      XyloCore, to glucose solutions (Physioneal, Fixioneal, Dianeal, Balance, Bicavera, Bicanova
      or Equibalance) only regimen, in patients with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) receiving
      Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis (CAPD), over a 6-month study period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients should be enrolled if they are receiving 2 or 3 diurnal (short dwell) exchange bag
      solution of Physioneal 35 or 40 (including Clear-Flex bag), Fixioneal 35 or 40, Dianeal or
      Dianeal Low Calcium (1.36%, 2.27% or 3.86% glucose), or Balance, Bicavera, Bicanova or
      Equibalance (1.25%, 2.3%, 4.5% glucose) and Extraneal (7.5% Icodextrin) for the long-dwell
      exchange. Patients will be centrally randomized to receive the investigational product
      (XyloCore) or the active control (Physioneal, Fixioneal, Dianeal, Balance, Bicavera, Bicanova
      or Equibalance). A stratified randomization scheme will be employed to ensure a balanced
      allocation of patients with diabetes across the two treatment groups. Patients randomized to
      XyloCore will receive 2 to 3 bags of XyloCore (Low, Medium or High Strenght) with an osmotic
      strength comparable to their pre‐randomization prescription of the glucose peritoneal
      dialysis solution. Patients randomized to the control group will continue the 2 to 3 daily
      (short-dwell) exchanges of Physioneal, Fixioneal, Dianeal, Balance, Bicavera, Bicanova or
      Equibalance. All patients will receive Extraneal (7.5% Icodextrin) for nocturnal (long-dwell)
      exchange. The osmotic strength and number of diurnally short dwells exchanges should be
      modified by the investigator as clinically required. PD prescriptions in both treatment arms
      are tailored to reach a minimum target of total Kt/V of 1.7 per week throughout the study.
      The study will be single-blinded (outcomes assessor), without blinding of patients or
      clinical staff.
