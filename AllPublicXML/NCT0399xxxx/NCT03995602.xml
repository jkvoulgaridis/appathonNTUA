  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Native to South America and South East Asia, the dragon fruit (pitaya) has become
      increasingly popular world-wide due to their vivid hue and bizarre structure. More
      importantly, their high levels of bioactive phytochemical betalains has sparked considerable
      scientific interest. Recent findings from in vitro and in vivo animal studies tentatively
      suggest that betalains may have ameliorative effects on vascular function. This will be a
      first randomised controlled trial aimed to explore the impact of dragon fruit consumption on
      blood pressure and other vascular parameters in healthy individuals. The study will feature a
      randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled and crossover design with flow-mediated
      dilatation (FMD) as primary outcome along with blood pressure and arterial stiffness as
      secondary outcomes. Cardiovascular biomarkers as well as relevant metabolites will also be
      determined from blood and urine samples collected from participants.
