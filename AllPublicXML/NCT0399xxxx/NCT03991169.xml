  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot clinical trial of oral iron therapy in children with chronic kidney disease
      (CKD) and mild anemia. Eligible children will be randomized into a standard of care (iron
      sulfate) arm vs. no iron therapy arm for 3 months. The outcomes will include muscle strength,
      physical activity, and changes in eating behavior, which will be measured at enrollment and
      at the end of the study period.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the percentage of transferrin saturation in the participants' blood</measure>
    <time_frame>0 and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Transferrin saturation is a medical laboratory value, measured as a percentage. It is the value of serum iron concentration divided by the total iron-binding capacity. For instance, a value of 15% means that 15% of iron-binding sites of transferrin are being occupied by iron.
Blood will be collected with the venopuncture used for clinically indicated blood tests at routine clinic visits</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in sedentary time</measure>
    <time_frame>0 and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Sedentary time (in minutes per day) will be measured by actigraphy. Actigraph is a monitor that looks like a wristband or a watch that measures and records body movements throughout the day. Participating children will wear actigraphs for 7 days in the beginning and 7 days at the conclusion of the study.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the percent of skeletal muscle mass</measure>
    <time_frame>0 and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Percent of skeletal muscle mass out of body weight will be measured using bio-electrical impedance analysis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in eating behavior</measure>
    <time_frame>0 and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Appetite / eating behavior assessed using Children's Eating Behavior Questionnaire (CEBQ). It is a parent-report measure comprised of 35 items, each rated as &quot;Never&quot;, &quot;Rarely&quot;, &quot;Sometimes&quot;, &quot;Often&quot;, &quot;Always&quot;. The answers will be grouped into the domains to assess eating styles of the participating children, such as: &quot;Enjoyment of food&quot;, &quot;Slowness in eating&quot;, &quot;Emotional under-eating&quot;, &quot;Food fussiness&quot;.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in quality of life: PROMIS</measure>
    <time_frame>0 and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life will be assessed in the Fatigue, and Physical Activity domains using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS), developed by the National Institutes of Health. PROMIS measures use a T-score metric in which 50 is the mean of a relevant reference population and 10 is the standard deviation (SD) of that population.
Higher scores will mean more Fatigue and more Physical Activity respectively.</description>
