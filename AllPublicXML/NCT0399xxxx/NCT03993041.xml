  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression is a prevalent non-motor symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD). Cognitive-behavioral
      therapy (CBT) has been shown to be an effective treatment for depression in PD. CBT is
      usually administered in-person in weekly sessions, but PD motor disability, stigma, and
      transportation issues may prevent attending such therapy sessions. CBT administered via live
      videoconference technology may allow the treatment of depression, while circumventing the
      barriers that deter those with PD from seeking psychological services. The investigators
      propose that videoconference CBT will improve mood in individuals with PD who have
      depression.

      The investigators plan to conduct a randomized control trial with 12 participants. Six
      (PD-early) will receive three assessments: baseline, immediately post-treatment (post1), and
      6 weeks after treatment (post2). The other six (PD-waitlist) will have an additional
      assessment (Baseline 2; 12 weeks after Baseline 1) to examine practice effects before
      beginning treatment, and then will have the post1 and post2 assessments (four assessments).

    <description>Study therapists will deliver cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) based on an emotion-focused, transdiagnostic protocol. CBT targets problematic thoughts, feelings, and behaviors through goal-oriented, systematic procedures. The intervention used in this study is designed to target emotional processing with an emphasis on present-focused awareness, cognitive flexibility, emotional avoidance, awareness and tolerance of physical sensations, and situation-based emotion exposure. The intervention is designed to help individuals better understand emotional experiences in order to respond to intense emotions in a more adaptive way.</description>
