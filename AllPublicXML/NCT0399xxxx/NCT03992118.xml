      The investigators are trying to determine if delivery a feeding intervention program using
      videoconferencing technology is feasible.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hope to recruit 10 participants who have a diagnosis of autism spectrum
      disorder and food selectivity. A Multidisciplinary feeding assessment will be conducted and
      factors which contribute to the participant's feeding challenges will be identified.
      Treatment goals will be identified using the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure
      (COPM). Intervention geared to address the goals identified by parents will be delivered by
      the clinician(s) via videoconferencing. Participants will participate in up to 12 weekly 1hr
      visits over the study period.

    <measure>Parent Treatment Adherence Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Parent Treatment Adherence scale will be used to rate parent engagement and understanding of in session materials. The scale will be completed by the therapists at the end of each intervention session to rate parent engagement and understanding of instructions and assignment on a three point likert scale.</description>

    <measure>Parent Satisfaction Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A questionnaire was developed for the study to obtain parent feedback at week 12 on the quality of the block of intervention. Questions rated the length of the sessions, number of sessions, the usefulness of teaching tools (for e.g. homework), and participants confidence in handling future feeding challenges. Scores range from 0(strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree).</description>

    <measure>Treatment Fidelity Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A treatment fidelity checklist was developed for this study. Treatment fidelity will be measured using a questionnaire to rate if the intervention session goals were met during the session. This will be done using a 3 point likert scale. After completion of each session the therapists will rate themselves as: 0= Goal was not achieved; 1- Goal was partially achieved; 2= Goal was fully achieved for each treatment goal for that session.</description>
