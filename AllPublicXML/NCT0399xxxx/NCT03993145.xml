    <textblock>
      The aim of this pilot intervention study is to develop and test a tailored web-based
      lifestyle modification program for women with recent preeclampsia or gestational diabetes.
      Women will start the study 3-15 months postpartum. After obtaining written informed consent
      and confirmation of eligibility criteria, eligible women will be included in the pilot study
      using a single arm study design (all women will be assigned to the lifestyle intervention
      program). Participants will be provided access to a web-based lifestyle intervention program
      with personalized coaching from a registered dietician.
