    <textblock>
      This investigation is undertaken to evaluate the workflow and concomitant products to create
      full dentures by using Additive Manufacturing (AM) technology, i.e. Digital Light Processingâ„¢
      Technology (Carbon 3D) to restore fully edentulous jaws. The assessment includes quality of
      materials provided by Dentsply Sirona Lab by using printers for Additive Manufacturing (M2
      series, Carbon 3D 1089 Mills Way, Redwood City, CA 94063). This assessment will be done by
      clinical review of the AM dentures on fit and quality. In addition, the trial includes a
      patient survey to assess current dentures and the new AM dentures with a subjective
      comparison of both.

      Study Design:

        -  This descriptive, prospective, clinical investigation will be conducted on approximately
           forty (40) enrolled subjects at four (4) sites in the US.

        -  Treatment of subjects encompasses all steps to fabricate new dentures for maxilla and
           mandible (no greater than five (5) visits; 30-60 min. chair time per appointment).

        -  The subjects will be followed 7-10 days after final delivery of the denture for function
           check.

        -  Long-term follow-up will be performed after 6 months, 12 months, 24 months and 36 months
           to assess fit, function, and esthetics under function performed by the dental
           professional and by capturing according feedback by the patient.

        The investigational device is part of a treatment concept for edentulous patients of all
        ages, gender and races. The incidence for tooth loss has not declined over years, and the
        prevalence for edentulism is significantly higher for adults 50 years and older15, 16. For
        this descriptive two-part survey, no minimum number of patients is defined, but to achieve
        a reasonable subject number, a minimum of forty (40) patients will be enrolled, i.e. 80
        dentures will be fabricated within this study.
