    <textblock>
      To improve the management of patients suffering from prostate cancer, Laboratoires
      BOUCHARA-RECORDATI wish to set up an observational study to document, in daily practice, and
      over a large population, the profile and clinical and biological follow-up of patients
      undergoing leuprorelin 5 mg implant as well as the conditions for implant placement. The
      evolution of these prostate cancer patients will be monitored on the basis of data available
      in daily practice, including testosterone values, PSA values, and factors that may influence
      disease progression, in order to objectify whether the observed results are consistent with
      those described in the clinical studies.

      The psychological dimension of the management of patients with prostate cancer will also be
      addressed by evaluating the strategies used by patients to cope with their prostate cancer
      [(Prostate Cancer Patients' Coping Strategies Questionnaire (PCPCSQ)].
