  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With support from the NIH, this pilot study will assess the feasibility of using wireless
      devices and financial incentives to motivate medication adherence among HIV-positive adults
      in the U.S., focusing on those with non-suppressed viral loads.

      While daily lotteries using wireless devices may have great potential for improving adherence
      to ART regimens, substantial questions exist as to whether it is: 1) possible to achieve high
      rates of uptake for a pilot offering wireless devices to high-risk populations; 2) achieve
      high rates of sustained engagement.

      The goal of this study is to explore the feasibility of using wireless devices and financial
      incentives to motivate medication adherence among high-risk HIV positive patients. By
      partnering with the Drexel Partnership Comprehensive Care Clinic at Drexel University, the
      investigators will be able to identify such patients using clinic patient data, use clinic
      and physician communication channels to enroll them, and maintain high levels of ongoing
      participation through the use of incentives. The aim is to improve antiretroviral medication
      adherence among high-risk HIV positive patients by providing patients with a AdhereTech
      device (electronic pill bottle), daily adherence notifications tracked by the Way to Health
      platform, as well as daily lotteries and financial incentives. Upon completion, this study
      will answer questions important to the feasibility of conducting well-powered randomized
      controlled trials to improve adherence among HIV patients within the U.S. who have
      sub-optimal adherence.

    <description>Participants randomized to this arm will receive an electronic pill bottle, AdhereTech. The AdhereTech bottle will be remotely monitored by the Way to Health platform. Participants will be randomly assigned a 2-digit number to be used as part of the lottery-based engagement incentives in which eligibility to win will be conditional on medication adherence. Participants will also be eligible for a financial bonus if participant's viral load is suppressed at the end of the intervention period. Participants will also receive an enrollment incentive and an incentive to complete a lab visit at the end of the intervention period.</description>
