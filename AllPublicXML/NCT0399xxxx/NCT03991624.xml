  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early in its development, Alzheimer's disease causes not only brain damage affecting
      different regions of the brain, such as the entorhinal cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex,
      and the prefrontal lobe, but also a cognitive deficit affecting several functions, such as
      episodic memory, executive functions, or working memory. Although these different areas and
      functions are involved in the decision-making process, few studies have focused their
      research on this subject in the context of Alzheimer's disease. However, a 2008 study showed
      an early decline in decision-making skills in the disease, but did not link this deficit to
      cognitive impairment. In addition, decision-making is generally assessed using a test called
      the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), which, despite its many advantages, does not have established
      ecological validity.

      In the context of pathology, however, it seems essential to evaluate decision-making in
      relation to daily life, especially since a deficit in this process would have considerable
      repercussions on quality of life.

      In this study, the investigators seek to better define the disorder by decision-making in
      early Alzheimer's disease, to understand the links between them with the deficit of other
      cognitive functions, and to highlight the the consequences that this decline has on patients'
      daily lives.

Stop Signal task on the computer to give a response to the presentation of a target stimulus (Go signal) (e.g. pressing a button when a red circle appears on the screen, but doing nothing when a blue triangle appears), and prevent this response when the stimulus is followed or preceded by a beep (stop signal) (e.g. the appearance of a red circle is immediately preceded or followed by a beep, the subject should not press the button).</description>

    <description>an update span task for which letters appear on a screen sequentially, and subjects must memorize the last three, without knowing the length of the list. The task will consist of 3 tests of training and then 20 tests. After three errors consecutive, the task ends.
an n-back task that consists of a sequential presentation of letters, during which the subject must indicate when the stimulus. The task consists of 3 levels, with n = 1, n= 2 or n = 3. For level 1 (with n = 1), the subject must press a button when the same letter appears twice in a row on the screen. This task consists of 75 letters.</description>

    <description>the empan baba task, which mainly involves maintaining information, and which consists in retaining a series of letters, appearing sequentially on a screen, and whose latency time between two word presentations is required for a secondary task: the repetition of baba syllables.
the task of reading operations which consists in recalling operations series of letters whose presentation is interspersed with the reading aloud of simple operations and of their results.
the ongoing operational task of recalling a list of letters, the presentation of which is interspersed with operations that are simple to read aloud and to to solve head-on.</description>
