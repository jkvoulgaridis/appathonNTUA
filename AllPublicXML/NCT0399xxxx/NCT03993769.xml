    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare plasma nicotine uptake in adult snus consumers after
      using investigational snus products (A19010-F and B19010-F).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be an unblinded, randomized, multi-site, two-way crossover study to assess nicotine
      pharmacokinetic parameters after use of two smokeless tobacco products A19010-F and B19010-F
      in healthy adult snus consumers. Eligible subjects will be confined to the site for 9 days
      and randomized to one of two investigational product (IP) (A: A19010-F and B: B19010-F) use
      sequences (AB/BA). Each subject will use a single product exclusively for 4 days prior to a
      PK assessment for plasma nicotine concentrations, and then subjects will use the other
      product exclusively for 4 days prior to a PK assessment for plasma nicotine concentrations.
