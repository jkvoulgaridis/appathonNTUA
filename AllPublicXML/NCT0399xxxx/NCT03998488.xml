    <textblock>
      A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial examining the efficacy and
      safety of Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT) and high fiber supplementation in patients
      with active mild to moderate Ulcerative Colitis (UC). All enrolled subjects will provide
      serological, stool and mucosal specimen at each clinic visit to help further define the
      alterations in microbial profiles and immune cell function in response to psyllium fiber
      after FMT treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial with the following
      treatment assignments:

        1. Investigational FMT (one-time)

           a. Subjects in this group will blindly receive placebo FMP250 at week 8 by flexible
           sigmoidoscopy.

        2. Investigational FMT (one-time) + Psyllium (2x/day for 8 weeks)

           a. Subjects in this group will blindly receive placebo FMP250 at week 8 by flexible
           sigmoidoscopy.

        3. Placebo FMT (one-time) + open label FMT (one-time) +/- Psyllium (2x/day for 8 weeks) a.
           Subjects in this group will blindly receive investigational FMP250 at week 8 by flexible
           sigmoidoscopy.

      Subjects will blindly receive the investigational or placebo FMP250 treatment if they meet
      all inclusion and exclusion criteria during the day 0 screening colonoscopy. Subjects will
      receive follow-up phone calls at day 1, week 2, week 6, and week 10 post-FMT and will return
      for clinic visits at week 4, week 8 and week 12 post-FMT. Stool and blood samples will be
      collected for research purposes from subjects at every clinic visit (Day 0 colonoscopy, Week
      4, Week 8, and Week 12). Mucosal biopsies will also be taken during the initial colonoscopy
      at day 0 and during the follow-up flexible sigmoidoscopy at week 8. At week 8 post-FMT, all
      subjects will be evaluated by flexible sigmoidoscopy in the clinic. Subjects originally
      randomized into the placebo cohort will receive investigational FMP250 by flexible
      sigmoidoscopy and subjects originally randomized into the investigational cohort will receive
      placebo FMP250 by flexible sigmoidoscopy. Lastly, all subjects will be contacted for
      follow-up phone calls every subsequent 6 months for the next year.

    <description>The proposed intervention will deliver 250 milliliters of FMT by colonoscopy to the investigational FMT treatment groups at week 0. The placebo treatment group will instead receive the placebo FMT by colonoscopy at week 0 and then the investigational FMT by flexible sigmoidoscopy at week 8.
Investigational FMT is biologically active human fecal material that is pre-screened, tested, quarantined, stored, packaged, and labeled by OpenBiome. Placebo FMP250 is a control unit made of glycerol, saline, and food dye that is stored, packaged, and labeled identically to the investigational FMT, to ensure blinding during delivery.</description>
