  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study plans to learn more about whether taking the medication, Prazosin, immediately and
      during the weeks immediately following a traumatic event can help to reduce the risk of
      developing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Early post traumatic event sleep disturbance
      predicts the later development of PTSD. Prazosin has shown some effectiveness in reducing
      trauma related nightmares and sleep disturbance. We hypothesize that regulating sleep
      immediately after a sexual assault will reduce PTSD and diminish symptoms.

      This study plans to learn more about whether taking the medication, Prazosin, in the weeks
      immediately following a traumatic event can help to reduce the risk of developing
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

      Specific Aim 1: Test the efficacy of the drug prazosin in decreasing PTSD symptom severity as
      compared to placebo at 3 months post rape as measured by the Clinician-Administered PTSD
      Scale version 5 (CAPS-5, primary outcome) as well as associated secondary outcomes (PTSD
      diagnosis rate, sleep scores, and depression symptoms) at 3 months.

      Hypotheses:

      1a: Severity score on the CAPS-5 will be significantly lower in rape victims randomized to
      receive prazosin within 24 hours of at the University of Colorado Hospital (UCH) Emergency
      Department and continue on a titrated dose for one month compared to the control group at 3
      months post rape. Secondarily, PTSD diagnosis rate will be lower in the prazosin group versus
      the control group at 3 months.

      1b: Participants randomized to receive prazosin will have better sleep scores as measured by
      the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and PSQI Trauma addendum at 3 months post rape as
      compared to the control group.

      1c: Severity scores for major depressive symptoms as measured by the Patient Health
      Questionnaire (PHQ-9) will be significantly lower in rape victims randomized to receive
      prazosin as compared to the control group at 3 months post rape.

      1d: Sleep scores as measured by the PSQI and PSQI Trauma addendum will be positively
      correlated with PTSD symptom severity as measured by the CAPS-5 such that higher (worse)
      sleep scores are associated with more PTSD symptoms.

      Rationale: Many studies have shown that sleep disturbances and nightmares that occur directly
      after a traumatic event are a good predictor of the development of PTSD. Prazosin has been
      shown to improve PTSD-related sleep disturbance, including nightmares. If prazosin can
      effectively treat sleep disturbance in the weeks immediately following a traumatic experience
      and decrease the rate of PTSD and the severity of symptoms, then it could possibly become the
      standard of care for individuals exposed to a traumatizing event.

      Brief overview of methods: Females between the ages of 18 and 50 years will be recruited
      directly from the ED at University of Colorado Hospital with the assistance of the Forensic
      Nurse Examiners. Those who elect to take part in this study and complete the informed consent
      process will be randomized to receive either prazosin or placebo. This is a double-blind
      study, so neither the participant nor the study doctor/team will know whether a participant
      is in the treatment (prazosin) or control (placebo) group. Participants will receive three
      2mg tabs and three 1mg tbs for titration purposes (prazosin or placebo equivalent) before
      they leave the hospital, with instructions to take the first dose (2 mg) 1 hour before bed,
      the first night after being seen in the ED. Study staff will follow up the next day to
      inquire about the participant's general condition, possible side-effects, sleep, and to
      schedule the first study visit (at ~72 hours after treatment in ED). PTSD and posttraumatic
      stress symptoms, symptoms of depression, suicidality, medication compliance, side-effects and
      adverse events will be monitored and assessed by study personnel at weekly study visits for
      the duration of the med trial (~6 weeks; 3 weeks on medication and 2-3 weeks of tapering off
      of medication) and again at 3-months post. However, participants will be instructed to report
      any changes or concerns as needed. Each participant will also complete a daily sleep log for
      the duration of their participation in the study.

    <intervention_model_description>Participants in this study will include 40 adult females who complete consent (20 per arm), ages 18-50 years, who are evaluated and treated at the University of Colorado Hospital after an alleged sexual assault on their person. Randomization will be completed by the pharmacy and study condition (prazosin/treatment vs. placebo/control) masked throughout the data collection portion of the study. Participants will attend weekly visits during the 3-week medication trial and 2-3 week tapering off of medication, followed regular check-in phone calls with study staff between stopping the medication and the follow-up assessments at the final study visit (approx. 3 moths post study enrollment).</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Change in PTSD symptoms and severity - Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale - 5 (CAPS-5)</measure>
    <time_frame>The full interview takes 45-60 minutes to administer and will be given at baseline, at approximately 31 days post event, and at three months.</time_frame>
    <description>Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale-5 (CAPS-5) - Past Month &amp; Past Week. The CAPS is the gold standard in PTSD assessment and the total score will serve as the primary outcome. The CAPS-5 is a 30-item structured interview to make a current (past month) diagnosis of PTSD, a lifetime diagnosis of PTSD, and assess PTSD symptoms over the past week. The full interview takes 45-60 minutes to administer and will be given at baseline, at approximately 31 days post event, and at three months.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>The PSQI will be completed weekly through study completion (average three months).</time_frame>
    <description>The PSQI is a 19-item self-report questionnaire that assesses sleep quality over a 1-month interval. The questionnaire takes 10-15 minutes to complete. Total score from PSQI will be a secondary outcome of sleep with higher score indicating poorer sleep quality.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index - Trauma Addendum (PSQI-A)</measure>
    <time_frame>The PSQI-A will be completed weekly through study completion (average three months).</time_frame>
    <description>The PSQI-A is a 7-item self-report questionnaire administered in conjunction with PSQI to examine the frequency of seven disruptive nocturnal behaviors common to PTSD among adults. Total score on PSQI-A will be a secondary outcome of trauma-associated sleep issues.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>It takes about five minutes to complete and will be assessed weekly for the first seven weeks of participation and at three months/study completion (at each study visit).</time_frame>
    <description>The PHQ-9 is a 10-item self-report questionnaire used in screening, diagnosing, monitoring, and measuring the severity of depression. Using an independent structured mental health professional interview as the criterion standard, a PHQ-9 score of 10 or more corresponded to good sensitivity and specificity (both 88%) for major depression.33 Total score will be a secondary outcome of depression symptom severity and score &gt;=10 will be used to indicate major depression at 3 months.</description>
