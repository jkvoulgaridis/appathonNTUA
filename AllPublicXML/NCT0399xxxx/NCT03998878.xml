      This project will test 3 methods of dietary changes in a weight loss clinic. Participants
      will be randomized to one of 3 arms: low-carbohydrate diet, intermittent energy restriction,
      or Hunger Training. A maximum of 30 participants will be assigned to each arm. The goal of
      the proposed study is to determine the feasibility, early efficacy, and patient satisfaction
      of each weight loss modality in a population of patients seeking care at a weight loss
      clinic.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adult obesity, a common condition in the United States, is a well-established risk factor for
      the development of chronic diseases, including diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, and
      many types of cancer. However, research has not determined what type of diet is best for
      reducing weight and achieving optimal health outcomes. In this randomized trial, participants
      seeking care at a weight loss clinic will be assigned to one of three diets:
      low-carbohydrate, intermittent energy restriction, or Hunger Training. On the
      low-carbohydrate diet, participants will be instructed to consume less than 30 grams of
      carbohydrates per day. The intermittent energy restriction protocol will require participants
      to choose 2 non-consecutive days per week in which they will consume 500-650 calories. Hunger
      Training is a relatively new approach that involves teaching people to monitor their hunger
      symptoms and blood glucose, and to eat only when blood glucose is below a certain level. To
      our knowledge, these weight loss modalities have not been compared in a single, clinical
      study. The goal of the proposed study is to determine the feasibility, early efficacy, and
      patient satisfaction of each weight loss modality in a population of patients seeking care at
      a weight loss clinic. The goal will be achieved though the successful completion of the
      following aims:

      Aim 1: To determine the feasibility of recruiting, retaining and maintaining the adherence
      participants in a randomized clinical trial testing 3 weight loss modalities.

      Aim 2: To examine and compare the effect of 3 weight loss modalities on changes in
      anthropometric measures and metabolic and cancer-related health markers.

      Aim 3: To evaluate and compare patients' perceived satisfaction with each weight loss
      modality.
