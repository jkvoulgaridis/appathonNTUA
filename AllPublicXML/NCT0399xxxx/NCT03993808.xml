  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Carter Burden Network (CBN) is an New York City senior services agency, providing vital
      meal programs for low-income, minority seniors, age 60 and over. In 2016, CBN formed a
      community-academic partnership with The Rockefeller University (RU) and Clinical Directors
      Network (CDN) to conduct a Healthy Aging pilot study and found that 84% of participants had
      high blood pressure, with up to 27% &quot;uncontrolled&quot; using age-adjusted criteria. High blood
      pressure is a modifiable risk for cardiovascular disease, and has been readily improved in
      controlled trials by replacement of a typical Western diet with the Dietary Approaches to
      Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet. The DASH diet has been proven to meaningfully reduce blood
      pressure in as little as 14 days. However, the DASH diet has not been tested in seniors, in
      the setting of senior centers. Many seniors attending CBN centers receive close to 40% of
      their daily nutrition through congregate meals served there. This study tests the
      effectiveness of implementing the DASH-diet through modification of congregate meals at CBN
      senior centers to align with DASH, while providing educational and behavioral support,
      including home self-monitoring of blood pressure, to improve self-efficacy related to blood
      pressure management. The primary outcome is the change in systolic blood pressure.

      The Carter Burden Network (CBN) is an New York City senior services agency, providing vital
      meal programs for low-income, minority seniors, age 60 and over. Its four senior centers
      serve 300,000 meals annually through congregate breakfasts and lunches, and home-delivered
      meals. In 2016, CBN formed a community-academic partnership with The Rockefeller University
      (RU) and Clinical Directors Network (CDN) to conduct a Healthy Aging pilot study at two of
      its East Harlem sites, finding that 84% of participants had high blood pressure, with up to
      27% &quot;uncontrolled&quot; by age-adjusted criteria. Hypertension continues to be a significant,
      modifiable, but poorly-controlled contributor to morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular
      disease (CVD), contributing to stroke, heart attack, renal failure, and cognitive decline,
      increasing healthcare costs and causing loss of function, independence, and quality of life.
      Replacement of a typical Western diet with the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)
      diet has been proven to reduce blood pressure in i hypertensive individuals, and individuals
      with normal blood pressure in as little as 14 days. However, approaches to effective
      implementation of the DASH diet are untested in community-living seniors.

      To address the high cardiovascular risk of uncontrolled hypertension among seniors and
      introduce innovation into its nutritional program, CBN, RU and CDN designed this two year
      project to test a DASH-diet-based multi-component intervention to lower blood pressure in two
      of its senior centers, serving low-income and/or minority seniors. The intervention includes
      health education, participant input into menu design, redesign of current congregate meals
      menus to make them with DASH-aligned menus, and home-self monitoring of blood pressure with
      educational and social support. The primary outcome will be the change in mean systolic blood
      pressure, measured by health professionals one month after full DASH implementation, compared
      to baseline. Secondary outcomes include the change in the percentage of seniors with blood
      pressure in the range of &quot;controlled&quot; by Joint National Committee 8 (JNC-8) guidelines, and
      the change in blood pressure at three months and at six months.

      To optimize acceptance of the changes to menu and recipes, clients will be engaged and
      provide feedback during the design, implementation and conduct phases of the study. Dietary
      changes will be planned to incorporate client preferences. Clients will provide feedback
      weekly on menu acceptability referencing a simple smiley face Likert scale. Educational
      programs will consist of a series of sessions covering nutritional education including
      recipes and cooking demonstrations, blood pressure information and training in home
      self-monitoring with a study-provided blue-tooth enabled Omron 10 device, and information to
      enhance medication adherence. Participants will have pulse, blood pressure, weight, and
      behavioral aspects of self-efficacy assessed at baseline, and at Months 1, 3, and 6 of after
      DASH implementation. Surveys to assess quality of life, food frequency (for compliance with
      DASH-aligned eating outside of congregate meals), menu satisfaction, medication adherence,
      and other risks relevant to blood pressure management will be assessed at the same Month
      0,1,3,6 time points).

    <measure>DASH-concordance of meals</measure>
    <time_frame>During the first month of full implementation of dietary changes, compared to Baseline before implementation of any dietary or behavioral changes</time_frame>
    <description>This measure reflects to what degree the meals as served during the intervention, were DASH-aligned, according to the recommendations of the DASH eating adapted for the designed study menus. This concordance is expressed as the number of the 8 food group requirements satisfied (defined in the DASH eating plan and adapted for the study menus) by the meals as provided. The DASH eating plan identifies 8 groups: 1-Grains, 2-vegetables, 3-fruits, 4-fat-free/low fat milk and milk products, 5-lean meats, poultry and fish, 6-nuts, seeds and legumes, 7-fats and oils, 8-sweets and added sugar. The higher the score, the more DASH-concordant the meal. This outcome will report the mean daily meal DASH-concordance, e.g.&quot; 7.5 food group requirements satisfied.&quot; For components that allow for weekly requirements rather than daily requirements, (e.g. nuts/seeds) the score for the week (requirement satisfied - yes/no) will be applied to each day within that week.</description>

    <description>On a programmatic level, congregate meal menus and recipes have been adapted to align with DASH eating. The changes, which include the introduction of additional servings of fruits, vegetables, seeds, grains, replacement of simple or processed carbohydrates with healthier alternatives, introduction of more fish, reduction in added salt, and replacement of animal fats and butter with olive oil, will be phased-in in stages over 6 weeks, concurrent with the start up the study's educational programs addressing nutrition, BP, and medication adherence. The fully DASH-aligned menus will begin by week 7. The dietary intervention affects all seniors eating congregate meals at the center, not only those enrolled in this protocol to study the impact of DASH implementation.</description>
