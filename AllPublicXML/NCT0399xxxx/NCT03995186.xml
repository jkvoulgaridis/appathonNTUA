  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Behavioural activation (BA) is widely accepted as an efficacious treatment for depression. It
      has been suggested that several depression treatments work via early changes in emotional
      processing (e.g. affective bias in the processing of facial expressions) and that these could
      help predict treatment success, but it has not yet been examined whether the same applies in
      behavioural interventions. The investigators will examine how BA affects early emotional
      information processing in participants who are currently experiencing low mood, to see
      whether this can predict eventual changes in mood and to gain a better understanding of the
      treatment mechanisms of BA. Participants will be in three groups undergoing either
      behavioural activation, or activity monitoring alone (active control) for 4 weeks, or they
      will be on a waiting list (passive control). The investigators will also examine whether
      other factors, such as anxiety, social support and environmental reward, can predict the
      success of BA. This could help us understand how BA works and who may be most suitable for
      this intervention.
