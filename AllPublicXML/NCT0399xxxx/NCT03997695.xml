  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of a 6-week core stabilization exercise (CSE)
      program with and without kinesio taping on pain, fatigue, health status, quality of life,
      sleep quality and depression in woman with fibromyalgia.

      Participants were allocated into two groups as CSE and CSE plus kinesio taping group. Pain,
      fatigue, health status, quality of life, sleep quality and depression were assessed at the
      baseline and after 6-weeks treatment.

      A 6-weeks prospective randomized controlled trial examined the effects of core stabilization
      exercise (CSE) plus kinesio taping (KT) compared to CSE alone on pain, fatigue, health
      status, quality of life, sleep quality and depression in woman with FM. The trial was
      approved by the Ethics committee of Ankara Yildirim Beyazit University (Approval time and
      number: 17.01.2018-14). The study was performed in compliance with Helsinki Declaration where
      applicable. The patient's recruitment started in February 2018. The patients diagnosed with
      Fibromyalgia according to the criteria of the 1990 American College of Rheumatology
      participated in the study. Prior to the treatment and after 6-weeks treatment, participants'
      pain level, fatigue, health status, quality of life (QoL), psychological status and sleep
      quality were assessed. Assessments were realized by face-to-face interview method.Patients
      who participated in CSE group performed CSE program alone, whereas patients in CSE+KT group
      performed CSE program with KT application. The treatment was carried out 2 days a week for 6
      weeks.

    <description>Core stabilization exercise (CSE):
The CSE program was carried out 2 days a week for 6 weeks (12 sessions) by supervisor physiotherapist. The CSE program aimed to perform neutral spine and activation of core muscles. Prior to the CSE program, participants were informed about core musculature and their function.The 6-weeks CSE program was performed in stages with gradual progression according to the stages of motor learning and sensory motor integration as static, dynamic, and functional.</description>
