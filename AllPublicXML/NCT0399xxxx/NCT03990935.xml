      Group 1 (intervention)

      Ginger and rosemary gel application:

      First the participant will be asked to brush his/her teeth thoroughly with 1450 ppm fluoride
      toothpaste (Colgate total healthy clean toothpaste). Then an application of a thin ribbon of
      this gel to the teeth using a brush. The medication will be left for at least 1 minute. The
      participant will be asked to spit out the medication after use and not to swallow it. Also
      the participant will be asked not to rinse his/her mouth, eat, or drink for at least 30
      minutes after use to get the best results.

      Group 2 (control group). Sodium fluoride varnish The fluoride varnish will be bifluorid 10
      single use by voco (Germany). It Contains 5 % sodium fluoride (equal to 22,600 ppm fluoride).

      A thin coat will be applied on the tooth surface by using a brush. 10-20 s are sufficient for
      the varnish to be absorbed and then dry with air. Participants will be informed that they
      should not brush their teeth for 12-24 hours after the application and not to eat, or drink
      for at least 30 minutes after use to get the best results.
