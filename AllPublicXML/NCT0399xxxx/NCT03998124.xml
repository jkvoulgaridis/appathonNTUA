      To investigate the effectiveness of a peer-led group intervention compared to a staff-led
      activity group to improve social communication skills for people with severe acquired brain
      injury (ABI).

      An earlier pilot study tested the feasibility of the approach and the sensitivity of existing
      outcome measures to changes in group social interaction (NCT02211339). Following amendments
      to the pilot study protocol, twelve new participants with severe ABI were recruited from a
      residential post-acute rehabilitation centre. An experimental parallel group design was used
      to compare a peer-led group intervention to a staff-led social activity group. Participants
      were randomised to a peer-led intervention (n=6) or a staff-led social activity group (usual
      care) (n=6). The groups met twice a week for 8 weeks. A peer with severe ABI was trained
      separately to facilitate interaction the peer-led group. The training took place in 16
      individual sessions over 4 weeks. Group behaviour was measured twice at baseline, after
      intervention and at maintenance (4 weeks) using measures meeting reliability, validity and
      responsiveness criteria tested in the pilot study.

    <time_frame>Baseline to maintenance (week 12)</time_frame>

    <measure>The Interactional Network Tool (INT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to maintenance (week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>A new measure of group social participation developed for this study. The INT captures group interaction patterns using communication behaviour frequencies and principles of social network analysis. The data is relational and follows a scale-free distribution.</description>

    <measure>La Trobe Communication Questionnaire (self-report)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to maintenance (week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>The LCQ (self) is a measure of perceived change in social communication skills. Scores range from 30 - 120. A higher score indicates perception of more impaired skills.</description>
