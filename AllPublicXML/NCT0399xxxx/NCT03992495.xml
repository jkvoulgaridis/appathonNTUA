      This study investigates the effect of exercise on pain sensitivity in ongoing neck pain
      patients compared to a healthy control group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Increased pain sensitivity is a common finding in neck pain patients when compared to healthy
      controls. Although most studies favor exercise as an intervention, the specific effect on
      pain sensitivity is still debated. This study will investigate the effect of exercise on pain
      sensitivity in neck pain patients compared to healthy controls

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in pain sensitivity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Pain sensitivity will be estimated by determining the pressure pain threshold (PPT) on the neck before and after exercise</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in perceived pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Pain will be scored using a scale from 0-10 with 0 being no pain and 10 being worst imaginable pain and by drawing perceived painful areas on a body charts</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in disability</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Disability will be estimated by scoring the Neck Disability Index (NDI) questionnaire. The questionnaire is designed to help express how neck pain affects your ability to manage everyday activities.(Domains: pain intensity, personal care, lifting, reading, headache, concentration, work, driving, sleeping, recreation). Higher score = high level of disability</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in body movements</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Head repositioning accuracy will be tested using a clinical test in a seated position. Participants will turn their head to end of range in from a neutral position with their eyes closed and return to the start position again. The difference between start and end position will be recorded. Standing balance will be assessed by recording the time (seconds) a tandem stance can be maintained.</description>
