  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart attacks are caused by a blood clot blocking the blood vessels of the heart, preventing
      blood getting to the heart muscle. Opening up the artery with a balloon (angioplasty) and a
      small mesh tube (stent) although life saving can cause this clot to break up and get washed
      downstream, which can make the heart attack worse. The investigators can measure the amount
      of damage caused to the microcirculation by calculating the IMR (Index of Microcirculatory
      resistance).

      This can be measured by a wire in the coronary artery with a pressure sensor at the tip. If
      The IMR is elevated, it is suggestive of extensive microcirculatory damage. A clot dissolving
      medicine can be administered in the artery to try and reduce the IMR which can reduce damage
      to the heart muscle and improve outcomes.

      Impaired microcirculatory perfusion in patients as a result of ST-elevation myocardial
      infarction (STEMI) is associated with poor clinical outcomes. This project seeks to identify
      patients with impaired microcirculatory perfusion after STEMI and to assess whether acute
      improvement in microcirculatory perfusion in these patients by the use of intracoronary
      thrombolytic therapy results in improved clinical outcomes.

      Patients presenting to the participating hospitals with a heart attack will be approached to
      participate in the study. After angioplasty has been performed, the IMR will be measured in
      the infarct related artery. If the IMR is &gt;32 patients will be randomised to receive
      intracoronary clot dissolving therapy in the form of tenecteplase (TNK) or water as a
      placebo. Patients who have an IMR ≤32 will be followed up in a registry. Cardiac enzymes will
      be measured at baseline and discharge. All participants will be followed up at 12 and 24
      months following discharge, with randomised participants also being followed up at 6 months
      after discharge.
