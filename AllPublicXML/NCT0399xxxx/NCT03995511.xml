  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study investigates the sensation deficit in the lower lip and chin area after
      surgical correction of lower jaw deformity.

      The primary null hypothesis is: Lower jaw osteotomy cause no sensory deficit in the inferior
      alveolar nerve.

      The secondary null hypothesis is: Concurrent genioplasty with sagittal split does not
      increase the risk of sensory deficit in the inferior alveolar nerve.

    <measure>Light touch sensation first week</measure>
    <time_frame>One week after the surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Light touch sensation will be measured using cotton wisp applied to the chin and lower lip area divided into four quadrants: upper right, upper left, lower right, and lower left.
The cotton wisp will be in touch with skin in the four quadrants and will be moved in four directions for each quadrant.
The score will be recorded as 0 = No response to stimuli, 1= serious perception loss, 2 = hardly perceive sensation, 3 = perceive touch sensation at a lower degree than preoperative, and 4 = normal sensation.</description>

    <description>A Vernier caliper will be used to measure static two-point discrimination applied to the chin and lower lip area divided into four quadrants: upper right, upper left, lower right, and lower left. Instrument spikes of the caliper will be set open on different separation distances.
The score will be recorded as 0 = more than 15 mm, 1 = 10-15 mm, 2 = 9-10 mm, 3 = 7-9 mm, 4 = 6-7 mm, 5 = equal or less than 5 mm.</description>
