    <textblock>
      This study has as main objective to asses different genetic, biochemical and physiological
      biomarkers affecting performance and health status in ultraendurance runners according to
      individual's sex.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ultraendurance races has been shown to impact on several health-related biomarkers, and
      therefore they may have detrimental effects on runners' health. In this study, we aim to
      analyze the impact of running a 107,6 km mountain race in ultraendurance runners splitting
      our sample by individual's sex.

      To do this, baseline measurements of the runners have been collected through stress tests and
      biochemical analyses of blood and urine samples. Indeed, a saliva sample was collected to
      isolated a genomic DNA sample of each runner.

      During the race anthropometrical, ventilatory and strength data was collected in three
      different moments and after crossing the finish line. Indeed, after completed the
      ultraendurance mountain race, blood and urine samples were taken at the finish line, as well
      as 24h and 48h post-race.
