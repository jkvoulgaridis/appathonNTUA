  <brief_summary>

      This study will examine the combination of pembrolizumab and tadalafil for safety and
      efficacy in advanced head and neck cancer.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Immune competent animal models of HNSCC demonstrate that combination PDE-5 inhibitor
      (tadalafil) and PD-1 inhibitor therapy is more effective than either therapy alone based on
      the concept of targeting multiple immune repressive abnormalities simultaneously (PD-1
      checkpoint and myeloid suppressive pathways).

      This trial will test the hypothesis that combination PD-1 inhibition and PDE-5 inhibition can
      be safely co-administered, and secondarily test the hypothesis that the combination of both
      therapies will be more effective than PD-1 inhibition alone in recurrent/metastatic HNSCC.
