  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy of a combination of motivational
      interventions and a brief therapy session to increase the adherence to medication-assisted
      treatment (MAT) for opioids.

      We will recruit 30 SORI inpatients ages 18-plus admitted to the University of Rochester
      Medical Center (URMC). We will administer a battery of validated assessments of substance
      use, overdose history and risk, opioid-related infection, and suicidal behavior at baseline
      and approximately 2- and 4-week follow-ups. We will assess both forms of overdose
      (unintentional, intentional - i.e., suicidal behavior) because each is common in intravenous
      drug users and they require systematic assessment to disentangle. All recruited individuals
      will receive one-to-three MI sessions as they begin the MAT that is part of standard hospital
      care. Patients will be offered computer-based CBT, which they will complete on the unit at
      their convenience. The CBT program records duration of use of the treatment modules, enabling
      us to track patients' level of CBT treatment participation. Patient-completed intervention
      feedback forms and treatment completion will be examined after 15 subjects have participated.
      Based on this feedback, we will pilot an adapted (MI plus CBT) treatment manual, obtaining
      additional feedback on acceptability. We will assess psychopathy, a constellation of stable
      traits and potentially important moderator of treatment effects, at baseline. We will assess
      potential mediators (i.e., motivation to change, self-regulation) using validated measures at
      baseline and at approximately 2- and 4-weeks post-discharge.

    <description>The intervention typically takes 45 minutes to administer and is designed to enhance motivation to change and includes the following components: establishing rapport, asking permission to discuss substance use and providing feedback regarding the substance use assessment, exploring personal consequences of drug use, eliciting the gap between real and desired quality of life, and discussing readiness to change. The therapist then negotiates a written action plan, during which the subject is supported with empathy and verbal reinforcement.</description>

    <description>This evidence-based, online, Computer Based Training for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT4CBT) program covers six lessons: 1) changing patterns of use, 2) coping with craving, 3) refusing drugs, 4) problem-solving skills, 5) changing drug-related thoughts, and 6) improving decision-making. The program is designed to be user-friendly and includes videotaped instructions and examples, interactive assessments, and practice exercises.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18 or older

          -  Willing to provide contact information (e.g., email, phone, address)

          -  Presence of SORI, including endocarditis, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, epidural
             abscess, or serious bacteremia

          -  Hospital length of stay estimated at &gt; 3 weeks

          -  Admitted to URMC and seen by the Toxicology Consult Team. Providers will be informed
             of inclusion/exclusion requirements so that they can make an informed decision about
             whether a patient may be approached.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Non-English speaking

          -  Unwilling to provide informed consent; unable to provide informed consent or
             participate in study procedures due to lack of comprehension, medical barriers (e.g.,
             intubated), or behavioral (e.g., violence) or severe psychiatric problems (e.g.,
             florid psychosis). Capacity to provide informed consent will be determined by their
             treatment team or other provider consult team as appropriate. This serves a dual
             function of both basing consent capacity on the most accurate and current medical
             information, as well as keeping their treatment team informed of any research
             involvement of their patient.

          -  Note that patients may be ineligible initially but become eligible due to
             stabilization during hospitalization, at which point we would then proceed as usual
             with the identification and recruitment process. We will seek to recruit every SORI
             admission who meets eligibility criteria within the recruitment timeframe.
