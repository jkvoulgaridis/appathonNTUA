  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The strategy to support virological suppression on second-line antiretroviral treatment (ART)
      includes the provision of ART that has a low pill burden, good tolerability, low toxicity, is
      easily monitored, has a high barrier to resistance and that is low cost. The fixed dose
      combination of tenofovir, lamivudine and dolutegravir offers significant advantage as a
      potential second-line regimen compared to the World Health Organization standard of care
      second-line regimen of zidovudine, lamivudine and dolutegravir, in terms of cost,
      tolerability and monitoring requirements.

      The ARTIST study will be a randomised, open-label, active-controlled trial with 48 weeks of
      follow up, and will evaluate the viral load suppression achieved by participants taking the
      fixed dose combination of tenofovir, lamivudine and dolutegravir or zidovudine, lamivudine
      and dolutegravir as second-line therapy. There is evidence to suggest that even in the
      presence of resistance mutations to tenofovir and lamivudine (K65R or M184V/I), using this
      backbone with dolutegravir will provide an effective second-line regimen in patients who have
      failed a first line regimen that includes a tenofovir and lamivudine or emtricitabine
      backbone and a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI).

      The trial will comprise two stages: the first will evaluate the viral suppression in 65
      participants produced by the fixed dose combination of tenofovir, lamivudine and dolutegravir
      with a supplementary dose of dolutegravir for the first 14 days to mitigate the NNRTI effect
      in reducing dolutegravir concentrations when switching antiretrovirals. The study will
      progress to the second stage if this proves effective, and 130 participants will then be
      randomised to receive the fixed dose combination of tenofovir, lamivudine and dolutegravir
      (without a supplementary dose of dolutegravir) or the WHO standard of care second-line
      regimen of zidovudine, lamivudine and dolutegravir.

      The primary endpoint is viral suppression (viral load&lt;50 copies/mL) at 24 weeks.

      A Pharmacokinetic sub-study will be conducted on 12 participants in stage 1 and in 12
      patients in stage 2 who are randomised to the intervention arm, to assess the trough
      concentrations of dolutegravir and off-treatment concentrations of efavirenz at day 3, 7, 14,
      and 28. This is to evaluate the need for the lead in supplementary dose of dolutegravir.

    <intervention_model_description>This study will be a randomised, open-label, active-controlled trial to determine the proportion of patients achieving viral suppression on tenofovir/lamivudine/dolutegravir and zidovudine/lamivudine/dolutegravir as second line. Given that these patients will all have elevated viral loads and a high baseline risk of NRTI resistance, and the inducing effect of efavirenz on dolutegravir metabolism (persisting after efavirenz is stopped), we propose two stages:
Stage 1: patients will be initiated on fixed dose tenofovir/lamivudine/dolutegravir (supplemented with 50mg dolutegravir daily for the first 14 days)
Stage 2: will describe the VL suppression in the intervention and control arms, but will not be powered for a formal non-inferiority comparison
Intervention arm: patients will be initiated on fixed dose tenofovir/lamivudine/dolutegravir (no supplementary dolutegravir)
Control arm: patients initiated on zidovudine and lamivudine twice daily, with dolutegravir once daily</intervention_model_description>

        able to attend the study clinic for one year of scheduled visits and who have given
        written, informed consent will be enrolled in this study. In female patients of
        child-bearing potential, those willing to use effective and reliable contraception for the
        duration of the study will be eligible

        Failure of a first-line regimen is defined as:

        • A VL of &gt;1000 copies/ml (within the previous two months) and an immediately prior VL

        Laboratory Service)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  If the patient has two VL 2-3 months apart: &gt; 2 log drop in VL between the most recent
             VL (within the previous two months) and the immediately prior VL (taken 2-3 months
             prior)

          -  CD4 count &lt; 100 cells/microlitre
