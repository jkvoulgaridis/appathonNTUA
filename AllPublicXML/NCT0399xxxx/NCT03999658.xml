  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the efficacy, as measured by the objective response rate, of STI-3031,
      an anti-PD-L1 antibody, in previously treated patients with selected advanced lymphomas or
      biliary tract cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, global Phase 2 basket study to investigate the efficacy,
      safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of STI-3031 in patients with selected relapsed
      or refractory (R/R) malignancies. The study will be conducted as separate Phase 2, single arm
      substudies for each of the indications below:

        -  Extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTL)

        -  Peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL)

        -  Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) with PD-L1 gene translocation, copy gain,
           amplification, polysomy detectable by a fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay
           or Epstein-Barr virus positivity (EBV+) as assessed by EBV-encoded small RNA (EBER)
           testing

        -  Biliary tract cancers (BTC) (intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma), extrahepatic
           cholangiocarcinoma or gallbladder cancer)

      All participants will receive the study intervention, STI-3031.
