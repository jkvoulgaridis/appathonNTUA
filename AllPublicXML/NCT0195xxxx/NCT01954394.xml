      Primary Objective:

      To assess the long-term safety of alirocumab (SAR236553/REGN727) when added to lipid-lowering
      therapy in participants with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (heFH) who had
      completed EFC12492 (NCT01623115), R727-CL-1112 (NCT01709500), EFC12732 (NCT01617655) and
      LTS11717 (NCT01507831).

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the long-term efficacy of alirocumab on lipid parameters.

        -  To evaluate the long-term immunogenicity of alirocumab.

    <description>Reported AEs are treatment-emergent AEs that is AEs that developed/worsened during the 'treatment-emergent period' (the time from the first dose of alirocumab in this study up to the last dose of alirocumab received in this study +70 days). Clinically significant lab and vital sign abnormalities were to be reported as AEs.</description>

      <recruitment_details>The study was conducted at 177 centers in 24 countries. Overall, 986 participants who completed study EFC12492 (NCT01623115), R727-CL-1112 (NCT01709500), EFC12732 (NCT01617655) and LTS11717 (NCT01507831) were enrolled between December 2013 and December 2014.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The Day 1 visit of this study was: the end of treatment visit of the 78-week treatment period for participants who completed EFC12492, R727-CL-1112 and EFC12732; and the end of study visit i.e. 8 weeks after completion of the 78-week treatment period for participants who completed LTS11717.</pre_assignment_details>
