          <population>Subjects with blastocyst transfer. In COS cycle 2, a total of 254 and 271 blastocysts were transferred in the FE 999049 and GONAL-F groups, respectively. In COS cycle 3, a total of 132 and 121 blastocysts were transferred in the FE 999049 and GONAL-F groups, respectively.</population>
