      1: SPECIFIC Aim I: To compare treatment options for neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) due to
      in-utero narcotic exposure. One hundred eighty four full-term infants with a diagnosis of NAS
      requiring medications will be studied. Infants will be randomized to receive either morphine
      or methadone. It is hypothesized that morphine treated infants will do better and require
      fewer days in the hospital compared to methadone treated infants.

      2. SPECIFIC Aim II: To evaluate the effects of NAS treatment on long-term neurodevelopmental
      outcome. Infants will be evaluated with development testing at 18 months of age. It is
      hypothesized that morphine treated infants will have better neurodevelopmental outcomes. It
      is also hypothesized that neurobehavioral abnormalities identified at two weeks of age will
      correlate with neurodevelopmental impairment at 18 months.

      3: SPECIFIC Aim III: To determine if common genetic variations in the genes involving
      narcotic action contribute to the severity of NAS. A DNA sample will be obtained from all
      infants and analyzed for differences in 3 key genes. This will then be correlated with
      short-term and long-term outcomes.

      1: SPECIFIC Aim I: To compare the short term efficacy of morphine and methadone for the
      treatment of NAS. One hundred eighty four term infants with a diagnosis of NAS requiring
      pharmacotherapy will be studied. Infants born to mothers receiving adequate prenatal care and
      maintained on opioid agonist medication during pregnancy will be eligible. Infants will be
      randomized to receive either neonatal morphine solution or methadone in a double blind,
      double dummy design. It is hypothesized that morphine treated infants will require
      significantly fewer days in the hospital compared to methadone treated infants. While the
      primary outcome is the total length of initial hospital stay (LOS), total LOS related to NAS,
      total duration of medical treatment for NAS, the need for a second drug to control symptoms,
      and infant growth will also be evaluated as important secondary outcomes by medication group
      assignment.

      2. SPECIFIC Aim II: To evaluate the effects of NAS treatment on long-term neurodevelopmental
      outcome. Infants in both treatment groups will be evaluated at 18 months of age using the
      Bayley III Scales of Infant Development. It is hypothesized that morphine treated infants
      will have better neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18 months compared to methadone treated
      infants. It is also hypothesized that neurobehavioral abnormalities (from either treatment
      group) identified at two weeks of age using the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) Network
      Neurobehavioral Scale (NNNS) will correlate with neurodevelopmental impairment detected with
      the Bayley III. Early identification of infants at highest risk for impaired development will
      facilitate therapeutic interventions to improve outcome and decrease resource utilization.

      3: SPECIFIC Aim III: To determine if single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes
      controlling opioid pharmacodynamics contribute to the severity of NAS. SNP genotyping from
      cord blood or buccal swabs will be obtained from all infants and correlated with short term
      outcomes (Aim 1) and neurodevelopment assessments (Aim 2) to confirm that genetic variation
      plays a major role in the severity and outcome of infants with NAS.

    <description>The Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (BSID-III) assesses the development of infants and children (1-42 months) through a series of developmental play tasks, identifying children with developmental delay. Raw scores of completed items are summarized within three distinct scale scores (Cognitive Scale, Language Scale, Motor Scale). Scale scores are each converted to composite scores to determine the child's performance compared with scores of age-matched children of typical development (percentile rank). A higher composite score indicates more ideal developmental outcome (range 40-160). At 18 month follow-up visit, participants were assessed using the BSID-III for cognitive, language and motor scale composite score outcomes.</description>

    <description>Infants randomized to this arm will receive neonatal morphine solution (0.2mg/mL) for first line therapy. Infants will be scored using the standardized Finnegan scoring system and will be initiated on treatment if they have 2 consecutive scores greater than or equal to 8 or 1 score greater than or equal to 12. Dosing will be weight and symptom based. A &quot;double dummy&quot; design will be used - each infant will be ordered for both a methadone/placebo study drug at 0.4 mg/mL and a morphine/placebo study drug at 0.2 mg/mL. Starting doses will range from 0.3mg/kg/day to 0.9mg/kg/day divided every 4 hours depending on the severity of the Finnegan scores. Doses will be increased to a maximum of 0.9mg/kg/day for continued scores generally &gt;8 caused primarily by worsening NAS. Infants will be weaned by 10% of the maximum dose once every 24 - 48 hours and the medication will be discontinued once at 25% of the maximum dose.</description>

    <description>A second line medication will be added once the infant reaches maximum doses of the study drug (morphine or methadone) for continued scores generally &gt;8. Infants will be loaded with 20mg/kg of phenobarbital with the option to re-load with 10mg/kg q8-12 hours for 2 more doses if needed for continued high scores. Maintenance therapy of 5mg/kg/day will be initiated 12 - 24 hours after the last loading dose. Phenobarbital trough levels will be monitored with goal levels of 20 - 30 mcg/mL.
Phenobarbital will be weaned only after the infant has been weaned off of the study drug. Weaning will begin 48 hours after the study drug has been stopped by 20% of the maximum total daily dose every 3 days for scores &lt;8. An infant may be discharged home 48 - 72 hours after the first wean. The remaining wean will be outlined in the discharge prescription, and followed up on by study staff with the goal of the phenobarbital discontinuation within a 2 week period.</description>

          <description>First line therapy: 0.4mg/mL oral solution, based on weight and symptoms.
Clinical monitoring: Infants scored using standardized Finnegan system;
Regimen: Initiated treatment w/ 2 consec. scores ≥8, or 1 score ≥12. Starting doses range 0.3mg/kg/day - 0.9mg/kg/day, divided every 8hrs depending on the severity of Finnegan scores. Doses were increased to max of 0.9mg/kg/day for contd. scores generally &gt;8 caused primarily by worsening NAS, as needed. Weaned by 10% of max dose every 24-48 hours; Medication discontinued once at 25% of max dose.
Second Line Therapy: Phenobarbital (20mg/kg) was added once infant reached max methadone doses for contd. scores generally &gt;8. Option to re-load w/ 10mg/kg q8-12 hours for 2 more doses if needed for contd. high scores. Maintenance therapy of 5mg/kg/day was initiated 12 - 24hrs after last loading dose. Phenobarbital trough levels monitored, w/ goal levels 20 - 30 mcg/mL. Weaning procedure outlined in protocol.</description>

          <title>Infant APGAR score at 1 minute</title>
          <description>Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, and Respiration (APGAR), a 5-criteria assessment used to summarize the health of the newborn against infant mortality, scored at 1 minute after birth. Each assessment (Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, Respiration) is scored on a categorical scale of 0, 1 or 2 based on given criteria. All assessment scores are summarized to create the APGAR score (min = 0, max = 10). An APGAR score ≥7 generally indicates a newborn with normal health; An APGAR score ≤3 is generally considered critically low and cause for resuscitation efforts and critical care.</description>

          <title>Maximum Finnegan score prior to starting treatment</title>
          <description>Finnegan Scoring Tool, a 25-item assessment of infants for Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS), is used within 24 hrs after birth and subsequently every 4 hours. Each item is scored on varying categorical subscales, scored depending on severity of each sign/symptom (ex. Generalized seizure Yes=8 No=0; Poor feeding Yes=2 No=0). Individually scored items are added to create the total Finnegan score. One score ≥12 or two consecutive scores ≥8 affirms the requirement for pharmacological treatment or increasing treatment dosage. A higher Finnegan score indicates greater NAS severity (min 0 max 50)</description>

          <title>Infant APGAR Score at 5 minutes</title>
          <description>Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, and Respiration (APGAR), a 5-criteria assessment used to summarize the health of the newborn against infant mortality, scored at 5 minutes after birth. Each assessment (Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, Respiration) is scored on a categorical scale of 0, 1 or 2 based on given criteria. All assessment scores are summarized to create the APGAR score (min = 0, max = 10). An APGAR score ≥7 generally indicates a newborn with normal health; An APGAR score ≤3 is generally considered critically low and cause for resuscitation efforts and critical care.</description>

If the Finnegan Score remained elevated (still scored ≥8 two times consecutively, or still scored once ≥12) despite increasing to a predetermined maximal opioid dose (methadone or morphine), phenobarbital was administered (20-mg/kg loading dose followed by 4-5 mg/kg daily).</description>
        <time_frame>Participants were monitored for the duration of their hospitalization, an average of 22 days.</time_frame>
        <population>Includes infants requiring treatment for NAS who were randomized to either methadone or morphine study intervention. Analysis does not include Standard Clinical Care cohort.</population>

            <description>Infants randomized to this group will receive methadone oral solution (0.4mg/mL) for first line therapy. Infants will be scored using the standardized Finnegan scoring system and will be initiated on treatment if they have 2 consecutive scores greater than or equal to 8 or 1 score greater than or equal to 12. Dosing will be weight and symptom based. Starting doses will range from 0.3mg/kg/day to 0.9mg/kg/day divided every 8 hours depending on the severity of the Finnegan scores. To maintain blinding of the two study arms, a &quot;double dummy&quot; design will be used - each infant will receive both methadone/placebo study drug at 0.4 mg/mL and a morphine/placebo study drug at 0.2 mg/mL. Doses will be increased to a maximum of 0.9mg/kg/day for continued scores generally &gt;8 caused primarily by worsening NAS as needed. Infants will be weaned by 10% of the maximum dose once every 24-48 hours and the medication will be discontinued once at 25% of the maximum dose.</description>

        <title>Cognitive, Language, and Motor Development From 18 Month Bayley III Neurodevelopmental Assessment</title>
        <description>The Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (BSID-III) assesses the development of infants and children (1-42 months) through a series of developmental play tasks, identifying children with developmental delay. Raw scores of completed items are summarized within three distinct scale scores (Cognitive Scale, Language Scale, Motor Scale). Scale scores are each converted to composite scores to determine the child's performance compared with scores of age-matched children of typical development (percentile rank). A higher composite score indicates more ideal developmental outcome (range 40-160). At 18 month follow-up visit, participants were assessed using the BSID-III for cognitive, language and motor scale composite score outcomes.</description>

Starting doses will range from 0.3mg/kg/day to 0.9mg/kg/day divided every 4 hours depending on the severity of the Finnegan scores. Doses will be increased to a maximum of 0.9mg/kg/day for continued scores generally &gt;8 caused primarily by worsening NAS. Infants will be weaned by 10% of the maximum dose once every 24 - 48 hours and the medication will be discontinued once at 25% of the maximum dose.</description>

          <title>Cognitive, Language, and Motor Development From 18 Month Bayley III Neurodevelopmental Assessment</title>
          <description>The Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (BSID-III) assesses the development of infants and children (1-42 months) through a series of developmental play tasks, identifying children with developmental delay. Raw scores of completed items are summarized within three distinct scale scores (Cognitive Scale, Language Scale, Motor Scale). Scale scores are each converted to composite scores to determine the child's performance compared with scores of age-matched children of typical development (percentile rank). A higher composite score indicates more ideal developmental outcome (range 40-160). At 18 month follow-up visit, participants were assessed using the BSID-III for cognitive, language and motor scale composite score outcomes.</description>
