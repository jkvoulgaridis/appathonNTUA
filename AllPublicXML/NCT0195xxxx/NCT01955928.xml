  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The object of this study is to compare internet-delivered treatment for insomnia to a
      waiting-list. In this study participants are randomized to: 1) online cognitive-behavioral 2)
      waiting-list. Participants in the waiting-list condition receive treatment after the
      post-test. The interventions consist of: diary; psycho-education; relaxation exercises;
      stimulus control/sleep hygiene; sleep restriction; challenging the misconceptions about
      sleep; and paradoxical exercise. Adult persons with insomnia will be invited via a popular
      scientific website to fill out online questionnaires. Participants will fill out
      questionnaires and a dairy at baseline post-test, 3-month follow-up, and 6-month follow-up.
      In this study we are interested in sleep-related worry and daily complaints measured with a
      diary. We expect that the online intervention ameliorates both the sleep-related worry and
      the daily complaints. Furthermore, we expect that the sleep related worry mediates the effect
      of the intervention on sleep- and daily complaints.
