    <measure>Ease of Using Clotting Factor Treatment Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Final Visit (Month 8)</time_frame>
    <description>HaemoPREF is a participant rated 14-item instrument to measure experience of clotting factor treatment including ease of use, burden, impact, risk and influence of others on treatment choices. For determining score for ease of using clotting factor treatment, 4 items assessed by participants were: 1) ease to prepare treatment for injection, 2) ease to store treatment, 3) ease to dispose of containers, syringe and needle once used and 4) ease to use current treatment. Each of the 4 items was scored on a scale of 0 (not at all easy) to 10 (extremely easy), and were summed up, to give a total overall score range of 0 (no ease) to 40 (maximum ease). Higher scores indicate greater ease in using clotting factor treatment.</description>

    <measure>Burden of Clotting Factor Treatment Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Final Visit (Month 8)</time_frame>
    <description>HaemoPREF is a participant rated 14-item instrument to measure experience of clotting factor treatment including ease of use, burden, impact, risk and influence of others on treatment choices. For determining the score for burden of clotting factor treatment, 2 items were assessed by participants: 1) time consumption to treat with treatment and 2) difficulty in finding vein to inject treatment in to. Each of the 2 items was scored on a scale of 0 (most difficult) to 20 ( least difficult) and summed up to give a total overall score range of 0 (most burdened) to 40 (least burdened). Higher scores indicate a lower burden of treatment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Impact of Clotting Factor Treatment Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Final Visit (Month 8)</time_frame>
    <description>HaemoPREF is a participant rated 14-item instrument to measure experience of clotting factor treatment including ease of use, burden, impact, risk and influence of others on treatment choices. For determining score for impact of clotting factor treatment, 3 items were assessed by participants: 1) difficulty to travel for holidays or works, 2) difficulty to perform daily activities including work or study and 3) difficulty to perform social or leisure activities. Each of the 3 items was scored on a scale of 0 (most challenging) to 10 (least challenging), and summed up to give a total overall score range of 0 (greatest negative impact) to 30 (least negative impact). Higher scores indicate less negative impact on daily life.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Risk Associated With Clotting Factor Treatment Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Final Visit (Month 8)</time_frame>
    <description>HaemoPREF is a participant rated 14-item instrument to measure experience of clotting factor treatment including ease of use, burden, impact, risk and influence of others on treatment choices. For determining score for risk associated with clotting factor treatment, 3 items were assessed by participants: 1) worried about getting infected with other disease while using the treatment, 2) worried to contaminate the treatment while preparing for injection and 3) worried to inject treatment by own. Each of the 3 items was scored on a scale of 0 (most concerned) to 10 (not at all concerned), and summed up to give a total overall score range of 0 (most worried) to 30 (least worried). Higher scores indicate lower levels of worry associated with treatment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Satisfaction Score With Refacto AF FuseNGO</measure>
    <time_frame>Final Visit (Month 8)</time_frame>
    <description>HaemoPREF: participant rated 14-item instrument to measure experience of clotting factor treatment. 14 items: 1) ease to prepare treatment for injection, 2) ease to store treatment, 3) ease to dispose container, syringe, needle once used and 4) ease to use treatment, 5) time consumed with treatment, 6) difficulty in finding a vein to inject treatment, 7) difficulty to travel, 8) difficulty to do daily activities, 9) difficulty to do social or leisure activities, 10) worried for getting infected with other disease while using the treatment, 11) worried to contaminate the treatment while preparing for injection, 12) worried to inject by own, 13) importance of family's opinion to use treatment, 14) importance what others use for their hemophilia. Each item was scaled from 0 (no satisfaction) to 10 (maximum satisfaction). Overall satisfaction score was the sum of 14 items, ranged from 0 (no satisfaction) to 140 (maximum satisfaction). Higher scores indicate greater treatment satisfaction.</description>

For determining score for risk associated with clotting factor treatment, 3 items were assessed by participants: 1) worried about getting infected with other disease while using the treatment, 2) worried to contaminate the treatment while preparing for injection and 3) worried to inject treatment by own. Each of the 3 items was scored on a scale of 0 (most concerned) to 10 (not at all concerned), and summed up to give a total overall score range of 0 (most worried) to 30 (least worried). Higher scores indicate lower levels of worry associated with treatment.</description>
        <time_frame>Final Visit (Month 8)</time_frame>
        <population>Per-protocol population included all participants who received at least 1 treatment using the Refacto AF FuseNGo and completed the two final questionnaires.</population>
