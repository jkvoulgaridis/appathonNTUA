    <textblock>
      Patients who have undergone lung transplantation are at an increased risk of developing chest
      infections due to long-term medication suppressing the immune response. In other chronic lung
      diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CF) and bronchiectasis, inhaled, nebulised mucolytic
      medication such as dornase alfa and isotonic saline are often used as part of the management
      of lung disease characterized by increased or retained secretions. These agents act by making
      it easier to clear airway secretions, and are currently being used on a case-by-case basis
      post lung transplantation.

      To the investigators knowledge, these agents have not been evaluated via robust scientific
      investigation when used post lung transplant, yet are widely used in routine practice.
      Patients post lung transplant must be investigated separately as they exhibit differences in
      physiology that make the clearance of sputum potentially more difficult when compared to
      other lung diseases. Lower respiratory tract infections are a leading cause of hospital
      re-admission post lung transplant. Therefore, this highlights the need for a randomized
      controlled trial. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of dornase alfa, compared
      to isotonic saline, in the management of lower respiratory tract infections post lung
      transplant. Investigators hypothesize that dornase alfa will be more effective than isotonic
      saline.

      The effect of a daily dose of dornase alfa and isotonic saline will be compared over a
      treatment period of 1 month. Patients admitted to hospital suffering from chest infections
      characterized by sputum production post lung transplant will be eligible for study inclusion.
      Patients will be followed up through to 3 months in total to analyze short-medium term
      lasting effect. Investigators wish to monitor physiological change within the lung
      non-invasively via lung function analysis whilst assessing patient perceived benefit via
      cough specific quality of life questionnaires. These measures will be taken at study
      inclusion and repeated after 1 month and 3 months. Day to day monitoring will be performed
      via patient symptom diaries, incorporating hospital length of stay and exacerbation rate. The
      outcomes of this study have the potential to guide clinical decision-making and highlight
      safe and efficacious therapies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT), the
      incidence of lung transplants per annum worldwide is rising annually, with over 3000
      transplants completed according to the latest registry(1). The Alfred is a state-wide,
      internationally renowned lung transplant service, transplanting between 59 - 79 patients over
      the last two calendar years, with a wait-list of more than 40 potential recipients. This
      makes it one of only 7 centres worldwide completing this volume of transplants(1).

      Patients who have undergone lung transplantation for end-stage lung disease are subject to
      life-long immunosuppression to prevent allograft rejection. These patients are at a
      heightened risk of acquiring opportunistic lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI)(2),
      often characterized by sputum retention and / or production, which can have a negative impact
      on both morbidity and mortality(3). Patients post lung transplant often find it difficult to
      clear secretions due to an alteration in normal physiology. Transplanted lung tissue is
      denervated upon resection from the donor, which has been shown to lead to slower cilial beat
      frequencies(4), impaired muco-ciliary clearance (MCC) rates(4-6) and an impaired cough
      reflex(7). Devascularisation to lung tissue post ischaemic surgical time in the acute period
      can lead to an alteration in mucosal properties and structural changes around anastomoses,
      which may further impair the ability to clear secretions(3).

      Inhaled, nebulised mucolytic agents are commonly used in the management of other suppurative
      chronic lung diseases characterized by excessive production of secretions. Dornase alfa acts
      by digesting the extracellular deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) released by inflammatory cells
      during infection(8). It has been shown to have positive long-term effects on lung function in
      cystic fibrosis (CF)(8) and short-term benefits treating atelectasis and mucous plugging in
      acute, non-CF adult and pediatric cases(9-11). Yet shown to be safe in normal subjects(8), it
      has been shown to have a detrimental effect on pulmonary function in non-CF
      bronchiectasis(12).

      Inhaled saline acts by restoring the airway surface liquid layer of the mucosa, favorably
      altering mucous properties, accelerating MCC and stimulating cough(13-14). Positive evidence
      exists for hypertonic saline (6-7%) in CF(13-14) and both hypertonic and isotonic (0.9%)
      saline in non-CF bronchiectasis(15). There is discussion of clinical use of saline as a
      mucolytic in the post transplant patient(16) with no evidence by way of randomized controlled
      trial to demonstrate effect. There is no current evidence on the use of inhaled mucolytics
      post transplant.

      Currently, both dornase alfa and saline (isotonic / hypertonic) are used in the inpatient and
      outpatient setting at this institution as a reactive treatment strategy for LRTI
      characterized by excessive sputum production and / or retention. The investigators believe
      this warrants a short-term, randomized trial to assess the efficacy of current practice, and
      to evaluate whether dornase alfa is more effective than 0.9% saline, a cheaper, more
      accessible alternative.

      Aim

      To evaluate the efficacy of inhaled dornase alfa compared to inhaled isotonic (0.9%) saline
      on:

        -  Quantitative and qualitative respiratory outcomes

        -  The need for antibiotics, length of stay and exacerbation / re-admission rates

      Hypothesis Dornase alfa is more effective than isotonic saline in the post lung transplant
      population during LRTI.

      Study design Phase 2, assessor blinded, prospective randomized controlled trial.

      Intervention On admission to the ward as an inpatient, patients who give informed consent
      within 48 hours of initial presentation will be randomly assigned to one of two groups
      defined below. The randomization sequence will be concealed using opaque envelopes.
      Randomization will be stratified according to pre-transplant diagnosis (cystic fibrosis or
      not) as people with cystic fibrosis are expected to be younger and have a different
      underlying systemic disease process.

      All participants will undertake treatment for one month according to their allocated group,
      with follow up to 3 months, (2 months off randomized intervention). Both groups will continue
      to do their regular prescribed physical exercise routine over the course of the study.

      Timing of assessment All outcome measures will be performed at study baseline, 1 month and 3
      months follow-up. Daily outcome measures used as a monitoring diary are an exception. There
      are no cough-specific quality of life questionnaires validated for use in the post lung
      transplant population.

      Sample size and power calculation A total of 30 participants (15 in each group) will enter
      this study. The probability is 80 percent that the study will detect a treatment difference
      at a two-sided 0.05 significance level, if the true difference between treatments is 1.000
      unit in lung clearance index (LCI).

      This is a conservative estimate that is smaller than previous differences found in pediatric
      populations(17-18). This is based on the assumption that the standard deviation of the
      response variable is 0.94 units(17-18).

      As a phase 2 study, this project is powered to detect differences in physiological outcomes,
      rather than quality of life or hospitalization. However, should the treatment prove to have
      physiological benefits, the secondary outcomes of this study will provide critical
      information for powering a future phase 3 trial.

      Feasibility: Approximately 12 patients with pulmonary exacerbations are admitted under the
      lung transplant service each month (minimum estimate). Investigators estimate that 70% will
      meet the eligibility criteria for the study and 50% will consent to participate. It is
      therefore anticipated that it will be possible to recruit the numbers needed for this study
      in 8 months.

      Statistical analysis An intention to treat analysis will be conducted, with inclusion of all
      randomized participants, regardless of study completion. Data for continuous outcomes
      including LCI will be analyzed using a linear mixed models analysis, which makes use of all
      available data at each time point and is less affected by incomplete data than analysis of
      variance. The likelihood of exacerbation or hospitalization during the follow-up period for
      the dornase alpha group will be expressed as a relative risk compared to the isotonic saline
      group.

      Bias / Confounders There is potential for performance bias in this study due to the lack of
      ability to blind participants to their allocated treatment regimen. Investigators are unable
      to package medications in a way other than that currently produced. It is the aim to outline,
      as part of the participant information and consent form (PICF), that both inhaled medications
      have proven to be efficacious (and detrimental in certain circumstances) in disease processes
      other than post lung transplant LRTI. Detection bias will be controlled by the use of a
      blinded outcome assessor for all follow-up data collection points.

      Potential confounders in this study include the diagnosis of bronchiolitis obliterans (BOS),
      or chronic lung rejection, during which LRTI occurs simultaneously. Patients with a diagnosis
      of BOS may in fact demonstrate differences in lung physiology and ease of sputum
      expectoration, which may have an effect on outcomes variables. We feel that excluding these
      patients may have a detrimental impact on the external validity of this study, therefore we
      will stratify patients according to a diagnosis of BOS on study inclusion.

      Outcomes and Significance This will be the first randomized controlled trial to analyze
      inhaled dornase alfa and isotonic saline in the post lung transplant population.

      The outcome of this trial will help to guide physiotherapy and pharmacological management of
      post lung transplant patients with LRTI in the future, both nationally and internationally.

    <time_frame>1 month, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>A measure of ventilation inhomogeneity as measured during multiple breath washout (MBW) of inert tracer gases. It has been shown that this test is a potentially more sensitive measure of peripheral airway obstruction than regular spirometry in short term (4 week) mucolytic interventional studies in pediatric Cystic Fibrosis (CF)(17-18). This test would be performed within the respiratory physiology lung function laboratory on site at all assessment points, by an assessor who is blinded to group allocation for follow up data collection.
Conventionally used primary endpoints in this population, such as regular spirometry(3), may be unable to detect between group differences without large sample sizes and long treatment durations. Based on current evidence from non-lung transplant populations, LCI has been able to show short-term change, whereas regular spirometry has not shown change(17-18).</description>

    <description>Multiple breath washout is a sensitive measure of respiratory function performed with the subject in a seated position, breathing a fixed tidal volume (1L) of inert gas (nitrogen) from functional residual capacity (FRC) via mouthpiece.
Two common outcomes of MBW are Sacin, a measure of gas mixing at the diffusion front, or acinar entrance in the airways, and Scond, in the proximal, conductive zones. An increase in either Sacin or Scond represents an increase in ventilation heterogeneity (deterioration). Both increase with age, normal values are non-zero between 0-0.25(Sacin) and 0-0.1(Scond).</description>

          <title>Multiple Breath Washout (MBW)</title>
          <description>Multiple breath washout is a sensitive measure of respiratory function performed with the subject in a seated position, breathing a fixed tidal volume (1L) of inert gas (nitrogen) from functional residual capacity (FRC) via mouthpiece.
Two common outcomes of MBW are Sacin, a measure of gas mixing at the diffusion front, or acinar entrance in the airways, and Scond, in the proximal, conductive zones. An increase in either Sacin or Scond represents an increase in ventilation heterogeneity (deterioration). Both increase with age, normal values are non-zero between 0-0.25(Sacin) and 0-0.1(Scond).</description>

        <title>Lung Clearance Index 2% (LCI2%)</title>
        <description>A measure of ventilation inhomogeneity as measured during multiple breath washout (MBW) of inert tracer gases. It has been shown that this test is a potentially more sensitive measure of peripheral airway obstruction than regular spirometry in short term (4 week) mucolytic interventional studies in pediatric Cystic Fibrosis (CF)(17-18). This test would be performed within the respiratory physiology lung function laboratory on site at all assessment points, by an assessor who is blinded to group allocation for follow up data collection.
Conventionally used primary endpoints in this population, such as regular spirometry(3), may be unable to detect between group differences without large sample sizes and long treatment durations. Based on current evidence from non-lung transplant populations, LCI has been able to show short-term change, whereas regular spirometry has not shown change(17-18).</description>

        <title>Multiple Breath Washout (MBW)</title>
        <description>Multiple breath washout is a sensitive measure of respiratory function performed with the subject in a seated position, breathing a fixed tidal volume (1L) of inert gas (nitrogen) from functional residual capacity (FRC) via mouthpiece.
Two common outcomes of MBW are Sacin, a measure of gas mixing at the diffusion front, or acinar entrance in the airways, and Scond, in the proximal, conductive zones. An increase in either Sacin or Scond represents an increase in ventilation heterogeneity (deterioration). Both increase with age, normal values are non-zero between 0-0.25(Sacin) and 0-0.1(Scond).</description>

        <title>Breathlessness, Cough and Sputum Scale (BCSS) - Exacerbations</title>
        <description>Self-reported symptom severity, used as a daily patient diary. The BCSS is a 12 point self-reported symptom severity score, consisting of 3 sections concerning how much difficulty the subject is having with breathing; subjective cough symptoms and trouble caused by sputum, each scoring between 0-4, combining to a total score of 0-12 (higher=worse). This scale is validated for daily use in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)(21).
An exacerbation was defined as an increase in BCSS&gt;1 with ≥5 days preceding stability.</description>
