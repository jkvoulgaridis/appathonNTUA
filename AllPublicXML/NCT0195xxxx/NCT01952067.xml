  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of the study is to compare migration of the cemented Corail stem representing
      polished surfaced versions of the femoral stem. Two different methods will be used for
      reaming the femoral canal and cementing of the stem. Radiostereometric analysis (RSA) will be
      used in migration measurements.

      Furthermore pain, postoperative outcome and patient satisfaction will be assessed.

    <measure>Oxford Hip Score</measure>
    <time_frame>change from 6th day postoperative to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>12 questions. Every question is scored 4 to 0 according to the selected response.
Thus it is a continuous score ranging from 48-0. Each of the 12 questions on the Oxford hip score is scored in the same way with the score decreasing as the reported symptoms increase (ie. become worse). All questions are laid out similarly with response categories denoting least (or no) symptoms being to the left of the page (scoring 4) and those representing greatest severity lying on the right hand side (scoring 0).</description>

    <measure>Harris Hip Score (HHS)</measure>
    <time_frame>change from 6th day postoperative to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Four subscales make up HHS. The first is pain, which measures pain severity (44 points); function, which is made up of daily activities and gait (47 points); the absence of deformity, which is a subscale that measures hip flexion, adduction, internal rotation, leg length discrepancy and range of motion measures.(4 points), and range of motion (5 points).
The survey has 10 question items and scores range from 0-100 with higher scores representing less dysfunction and better outcomes.</description>

    <measure>Visual Assessment Scale (VAS) for pain</measure>
    <time_frame>change from 6th day postoperative to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>A horizontal or vertical 10 cm line labelled at each end by descriptors such as 'no pain' and 'worse pain ever'. The patient marks the line to indicate pain severity and it is simply quantified by measuring the distance in cm from 0 (no pain) to the patient's marked rating.</description>

    <measure>Merle D'Aubigne scale</measure>
    <time_frame>change from 6th day postoperative to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The score includes the parameters pain, mobility, and ability to walk, with each rated from 0 points (worst condition) to 6 points (best condition). Addition of the scores for pain and mobility results in an absolute estimation of hip function.</description>
