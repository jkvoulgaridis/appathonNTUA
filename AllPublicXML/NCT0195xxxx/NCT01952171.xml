      Recent advances in genomic techniques are making possible a new wave of genetic discovery in
      congenital heart disease (CHD). Existing data suggests that CHD occur in Sub-Saharan Africa
      at frequencies similar to the rest of the world. In this application, we propose to utilize
      the unique advantages of Sub-Saharan Africa - a combination of the most genetically diverse
      populations in the world and of diminished environmental background effects (i.e. low
      prevalence of smoking, alcohol abuse, obesity in comparison to western countries) - to better
      understand the genetic basis for congenital heart disease. We will couple next generation
      genomic techniques with more traditional gene discovery methods to investigate CHD in two
      African countries: Uganda and Nigeria. The inclusion of syndromic and non-syndromic CHD
      observed in these populations as well as careful phenotyping (including echocardiography)
      will greatly enhance our potential to provide insight into the genetic architecture of CHD in
      African populations. To accomplish this, we plan to enroll families, in whom members have
      congenital heart malformations consistent with an error of early human development in our
      research protocol. Patients will be enrolled at the Uganda Heart Institute in Kampala,
      Uganda, and at the Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, University of Lagos,
      Nigeria, with the potential to include other African sites. High throughput genomic studies
      will be done at the NIH.

        The study will include affected individuals and their affected/or unaffected family
        members. Family members will include parents and siblings. The goal will to be obtaining a
        minimum of a trio (affected and both parents) to increase probability of finding gene
        mutations. Clinical criteria for inclusion is defined as presence of a congenital cardiac
        malformation related to errors in early human development. The diagnosis of congenital
        heart disease (presence of a congenital cardiac malformation thought to be related to
        errors in early human development) will be made by a cardiologist on our team based on
        echocardiogram, physical examination, medical history, and review of medical record.
