    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess full-time workers'impressions and acceptability of a
      prototype pedal desk. The pedal-desk is a semi-recumbent (upright) portable pedal mechanism
      that allows workers to complete tasks in a traditional seated position.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Researchers in recent years have begun to consider how modern occupational practices and
      environments could be enriched to facilitate increased energy expenditure by replacing
      sedentary behaviors with opportunities for non-exercise physical activity without competing
      with time committed to work tasks. The investigators have developed a pedal desk: a
      semi-recumbent (upright) portable pedal mechanism with a maneuverable and adaptable desktop.
      While utilizing the pedal desk, workers are able to complete their tasks in a more
      traditional seated position. Determining workers' acceptability is a key initial step in
      translating this &quot;sedentary behavior countermeasure&quot; to real workplace settings.

      In addition to having their height, weight, body fat percentage, and bioelectrical impedance
      measured, eligible participants will be asked to complete three tasks while simultaneously
      pedaling at a sustainable and self-selected pace. The three tasks are: 1) compose and send an
      email; 2) search a topic on the internet, and 3) complete an on-line questionnaire. The
      questionnaire that participants will complete was developed specifically for this study,
      utilizes Likert scales, and is based on the Theory of Planned Behavior. Constructs tested
      focus on perceptions of using the pedal desk at work and include: behavioral beliefs,
      normative beliefs, control beliefs, intention, self-efficacy, and an open-ended question
      soliciting general impressions concerning using the pedal desk at work.

    <description>Full-time sedentary workers used the pedal desk for 15 minutes while they: 1) searched the internet, 2) composed an email, and 3) completed acceptability ratings using an online Likert scale anchored from 1/strongly disagree to 5/strongly agree. The Questionnaire assessed subjective opinions about exercise and use of the Pedal Desk. No subscale or total scores were generated, and there are no maximum or minimum values. Rather, the number and proportion of participants who rated &quot;strongly agree&quot;, etc. on each item was calculated.</description>
