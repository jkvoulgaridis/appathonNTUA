      The LOTUS Study is intended to demonstrate the usability of the MICHI Neuroprotection System
      (MICHI NPS) or MICHI Neuroprotection System with filter (MICHI NPS+f) for use in subjects who
      are candidates for Carotid Artery Stenting (CAS). It is a prospective, single arm study in
      which a maximum of 30 study subjects, and a run-in enrollment of up to 10 subjects will be
      followed immediately post-op and at 30 days.

      Cerebral embolization during carotid artery stenting (CAS) can often precipitate severe
      adverse neurological effects. Most major clinical studies of CAS have used distal filters for
      cerebral protection and have compared the neurologic complication rates with those of carotid
      endarterectomy (CEA). Many currently available embolic protection devices, however, have
      limited efficacy in capturing microembolic debris liberated during stenting, pre-dilatation
      and post-dilatation. Furthermore, distal protection systems are limited by the need to cross
      the lesion prior to deployment. Some studies have shown a relatively high incidence of
      cerebral infarction even when distal protection devices are employed.

      Cerebral protection with carotid flow reversal is a method that was developed by Parodi, et
      al. (2005), as an alternative to the use of distal protection devices. While novel in its
      approach, this method too has its limitations. Criado, et al. (2004), developed a derivative
      technique that employs carotid flow reversal prior to traversing the stenosis that can be
      accomplished by directly accessing carotid anatomy without the use of the transfemoral
      approach. Major benefits to this method include the ability to perform the procedure on
      patients with severe carotid tortuosity and difficult aortic arch anatomy.

MICHI Neuroprotection System The MICHI Neuroprotection System (MICHI NPS) is a flow reversal circuit consisting of two proprietary sheaths connected by standard surgical tubing. The sheaths each have a standard hemostasis valve and sidearm. An in-line flow regulator allows the clinician to modify the flow through the circuit (either high flow or low flow) in addition to permitting temporary cessation of flow.
The system permits transcervical access to the carotid lesion, and the flow reversal through the circuit re-directs emboli that are liberated during carotid angioplasty and stent delivery.</description>
