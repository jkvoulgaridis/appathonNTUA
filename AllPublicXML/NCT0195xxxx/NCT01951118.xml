  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Olfactory identification deficits occur in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), are
      associated with disease severity, predict conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to
      AD and are associated with healthy elderly subjects developing MCI. Odor (olfactory)
      identification deficits may reflect degeneration of cholinergic inputs to the olfactory bulb
      and other olfactory brain regions. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (ACheI) like donepezil
      show modest effects in improving cognition but can be associated with adverse effects and
      increased burden and costs because of the need for prolonged, often lifelong, treatment.
      Converging findings on odor identification test performance (UPSIT, scratch and sniff 40-item
      test) from four pilot studies, including two of our own, suggest that acute change in the
      UPSIT in response to an anticholinergic challenge (atropine nasal spray), incremental change
      over 8 weeks, and even the baseline UPSIT score by itself, may predict cognitive improvement
      with ACheI treatment in MCI and AD. If change in odor identification deficits can help to
      identify which patients should receive ACheI treatment, this simple inexpensive approach will
      advance the goal of improving personalized treatment, improve selection and monitoring of
      patients for ACheI treatment, reduce needless ACheI exposure with risk of side effects, and
      decrease health care costs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this clinical trial, the investigators will evaluate, treat and follow two broad samples
      of adult patients at New York State Psychiatric Institute/Columbia University Medical Center.
      Study 1 will include 70 patients with amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Study 2 will
      include 100 patients with probable Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Recruitment will be from clinics
      and/or advertisements. In the protocol, all 170 patients will receive baseline memory and
      olfactory assessments and are treated with donepezil. Patients will be followed for a total
      of 1 year. During this time, patients will be monitored closely by the study physician and
      will receive memory and olfactory assessments at weeks 0, 8, 26, and 52. In addition, an
      olfactory challenge test will be done at baseline.

      This project will be of value in the selection of patients with MCI and AD for treatment
      based on the evaluation of olfaction tests to predict response to donepezil. Since mild
      cognitive impairment is widespread and Alzheimer's disease represents a major public health
      problem, this study has considerable public purpose and significance.

    <measure>Change Over Time in Selective Reminding Test (SRT) Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, Week 8, Week 26, Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The Selective Reminding Test (SRT) is a 12-item test of verbal learning and memory. To administer, the researcher will read aloud a list of 12 words. The participant repeats each word aloud to ensure that the word was heard correctly. Immediately following the reading of all 12 words, the participant is asked to recall as many words as possible within the one minute time limit. The participant is then reminded of the words they did not say and asked to recall the list again. This process is repeated for 6 trials. The total immediate recall is the total number of words recalled by the participant from all 6 trials. This is the number that is reported. Lower scores indicate fewer words recalled and a poorer performance.</description>

    <measure>Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive (ADAS-Cog)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, Week 8, Week 26, Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The modified Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive (ADAS-Cog) is a cognitive battery that assesses learning, memory, language production, language comprehension, constructional praxis, ideational praxis, and orientation. The ADAS-Cog is not a timed test and the participant's score does not depend on how rapidly the test is completed. The ADAS-Cog total score is based on the total number of errors made in the test by the participant. Therefore, a lower total score indicates a higher cognitive performance. The total score ranges from 0 to 95 and is determined by summing the errors from 12 subscales. The total score, indicating number of errors made, is the number that is reported at each timeframe.</description>

    <measure>Pfeffer Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, Week 8, Week 26, Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>FAQ is a widely used 10-item instrument that takes 3 minutes to administer and focuses on instrumental, social and cognitive functioning. The assessment is completed by a study informant - typically a caregiver able to report best on the patient's current ability. The instrument assesses the patient's current ability, at the point of testing and through the past month, in these various domains. The total score is described as the cumulative scores of each item, ranging from &quot;0 - No help needed&quot; to &quot;3 - No, unable to do.&quot; More impairment is indicated by higher scores. The reported total score range is from 0 (no impairment score) to 30 (maximum impairment score).</description>

    <measure>Measurement of Everyday Cognition (Ecog)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, Week 8, Week 26, Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>This instrument has 40 items, takes 20 minutes to administer, and focuses on functional correlates of cognitive deficits. This assessment asks the study informant to rate the participant's ability to perform certain tasks with the domains of Memory, Language, Visual-spatial and Perceptual Abilities, Executive Functioning: Planning, Executive Functioning: Organization, and Executive Functioning: Divided Attention. The informant is asked to compare functioning from 10 years prior to the time of testing. The Everyday Cognition measure uses the sum score of all of the subscales, and the items are reverse coded (i.e., 1= &quot;Better or no change&quot;, 2=&quot;Questionable/occasionally worse&quot;, 3=&quot;Consistently a little worse&quot;, 4=&quot;Consistently much worse&quot;), meaning that lower scores are better. Reported total scores range from 39 (Better or no change) to 156 (Consistently much worse).</description>

          <title>Donepezil Treatment &amp; Atropine Challenge</title>
          <description>Atropine nasal spray is administered at baseline for the atropine challenge which involves administration of the 40-item UPSIT immediately before and 45 minutes after atropine administration. Immediately after the atropine challenge, donepezil treatment is started and continues for 52 weeks.
Donepezil: Donepezil 5mg will be given for 4 weeks and if tolerated, the dose will be increased to 10 mg per day. The dose range of 5 to 10 mg of donepezil per day will be continued for the study duration, and this is the recommended dose for donepezil in the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. For patients who do not tolerate donepezil or have a history of intolerance to donepezil or cannot take donepezil for other reasons, treatment with other cholinesterase inhibitors (galantamine or rivastigmine) is permitted at any stage of the protocol. Data will be analyzed in two ways: for donepezil alone, and for any cholinesterase inhibitor (donepezil or rivastigmine or galantamine).</description>

        <title>Change Over Time in Selective Reminding Test (SRT) Scores</title>
        <description>The Selective Reminding Test (SRT) is a 12-item test of verbal learning and memory. To administer, the researcher will read aloud a list of 12 words. The participant repeats each word aloud to ensure that the word was heard correctly. Immediately following the reading of all 12 words, the participant is asked to recall as many words as possible within the one minute time limit. The participant is then reminded of the words they did not say and asked to recall the list again. This process is repeated for 6 trials. The total immediate recall is the total number of words recalled by the participant from all 6 trials. This is the number that is reported. Lower scores indicate fewer words recalled and a poorer performance.</description>

        <title>Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive (ADAS-Cog)</title>
        <description>The modified Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive (ADAS-Cog) is a cognitive battery that assesses learning, memory, language production, language comprehension, constructional praxis, ideational praxis, and orientation. The ADAS-Cog is not a timed test and the participant's score does not depend on how rapidly the test is completed. The ADAS-Cog total score is based on the total number of errors made in the test by the participant. Therefore, a lower total score indicates a higher cognitive performance. The total score ranges from 0 to 95 and is determined by summing the errors from 12 subscales. The total score, indicating number of errors made, is the number that is reported at each timeframe.</description>

The ADAS-Cog total score is based on the total number of errors made in the test by the participant. Therefore, a lower total score indicates a higher cognitive performance. The total score ranges from 0 to 95 and is determined by summing the errors from 12 subscales. The total score, indicating number of errors made, is the number that is reported at each timeframe.</description>
          <population>The number analyzed in one or more rows differs from overall number analyzed due to participant drop-out.</population>

        <title>Pfeffer Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ)</title>
        <description>FAQ is a widely used 10-item instrument that takes 3 minutes to administer and focuses on instrumental, social and cognitive functioning. The assessment is completed by a study informant - typically a caregiver able to report best on the patient's current ability. The instrument assesses the patient's current ability, at the point of testing and through the past month, in these various domains. The total score is described as the cumulative scores of each item, ranging from &quot;0 - No help needed&quot; to &quot;3 - No, unable to do.&quot; More impairment is indicated by higher scores. The reported total score range is from 0 (no impairment score) to 30 (maximum impairment score).</description>

        <title>Measurement of Everyday Cognition (Ecog)</title>
        <description>This instrument has 40 items, takes 20 minutes to administer, and focuses on functional correlates of cognitive deficits. This assessment asks the study informant to rate the participant's ability to perform certain tasks with the domains of Memory, Language, Visual-spatial and Perceptual Abilities, Executive Functioning: Planning, Executive Functioning: Organization, and Executive Functioning: Divided Attention. The informant is asked to compare functioning from 10 years prior to the time of testing. The Everyday Cognition measure uses the sum score of all of the subscales, and the items are reverse coded (i.e., 1= &quot;Better or no change&quot;, 2=&quot;Questionable/occasionally worse&quot;, 3=&quot;Consistently a little worse&quot;, 4=&quot;Consistently much worse&quot;), meaning that lower scores are better. Reported total scores range from 39 (Better or no change) to 156 (Consistently much worse).</description>

        <description>The Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale (TESS) is widely used to evaluate somatic side effects. For each item, a rating is made on a 3-point scale, with an additional rating on the likelihood that the medication caused the side effect. Values range from 0-78; a higher value indicates a worse outcome.</description>

          <title>Donepezil Treatment &amp; Atropine Challenge</title>
          <description>Atropine nasal spray is administered at baseline for the atropine challenge which involves administration of the 40-item UPSIT immediately before and 45 minutes after atropine administration. Immediately after the atropine challenge, donepezil treatment is started and continues for 52 weeks.
Donepezil: Donepezil 5mg will be given for 4 weeks and if tolerated, the dose will be increased to 10 mg per day. The dose range of 5 to 10 mg of donepezil per day will be continued for the study duration, and this is the recommended dose for donepezil in the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. For patients who do not tolerate donepezil or have a history of intolerance to donepezil or cannot take donepezil for other reasons, treatment with other cholinesterase inhibitors (galantamine or rivastigmine) is permitted at any stage of the protocol. Data will be analyzed in two ways: for donepezil alone, and for any cholinesterase inhibitor (donepezil or rivastigmine or galantamine).</description>
