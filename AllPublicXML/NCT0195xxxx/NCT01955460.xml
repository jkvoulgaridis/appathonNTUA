  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of genetically modified
      T-cells followed by aldesleukin in treating patients with stage III-IV melanoma. T-cells are
      a type of white blood cell that help the body fight infections. Genes that may help the
      T-cells recognize melanoma cells are placed into the T-cells in the laboratory. Adding these
      genes to the T cells may help them kill more tumor cells when they are put back in the body.
      Aldesleukin may enhance this effect by stimulating white blood cells to kill more melanoma
      cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the feasibility and safety of autologous transforming growth factor beta (TGFb)
      resistant (DNRII transduced) and NGFR transduced tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) in
      patients with metastatic melanoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the survival and immune function of TGFb resistant (DNRII transduced) TIL in
      vivo.

      II. To assess the anti-tumor effects of TGFb resistant (DNRII transduced) TIL.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of TGFb DNRII-transduced autologous TIL and nerve
      growth factor receptor (NGFR)-transduced autologous T lymphocytes.

      Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days -7 and -6,
      fludarabine phosphate IV daily over 15-30 minutes on days -5 to -1, and TGFb DNRII-transduced
      autologous TIL and NGFR-transduced autologous T lymphocytes IV over up to 4 hours on day 0.
      Patients then receive high-dose aldesleukin IV over 15 minutes every 8-16 hours on days 1-5
      (up to 15 doses) and 22-26 (up to 15 doses).

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 and 12 weeks, every 3
      months for 1 year and then yearly for 10 years.
