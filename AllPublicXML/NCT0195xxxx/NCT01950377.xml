      Background:

      - Previous research has shown that dopamine, a brain chemical, is involved in decision
      making. Different genes influence how much dopamine people have in their brains and how that
      affects their behavior. Researchers will study if genes associated with dopamine affect
      decision making and impulsiveness. All participants will take tests; some will have brain
      images taken. Researchers will study the test responses and images; they will look for how
      differences in these genes affect different types of decision making.

      Objectives:

      - To see if genes involved in a brain chemical, dopamine, are related to impulsiveness on
      behavioral tests.

      Eligibility:

      - Healthy adults ages 18 to 55.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam.

        -  All participants in this study will have at least 1 outpatient visit to the NIH Clinical
           Center. Each visit will last 2 4 hours. At the first visit:

        -  A blood sample will be taken only from participants that have not been previously
           enrolled in 95-M-0150

        -  Participants will be given tests of their memory, attention, concentration, and
           thinking.

        -  Some participants will have a second visit. It will be scheduled as soon as possible
           after the first. At the second visit:

        -  Participants will have an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). They will have to lie in a
           scanner for up to 2 hours. The MRI uses magnets, radio waves, and computers to produce
           detailed pictures of the brain.

        -  Participants will repeat the tests from the first visit. Some will be done during the
           MRI.

      The objective of this study is to examine the effects of genetic variability in the dopamine
      signaling pathway on metric measures of impulsivity. Our hypothesis is that increased
      dopamine levels or conversion of dopamine to intracellular signals, brought about by specific
      variants of genes in this pathway, will increase impulsivity in our behavioral tasks. We will
      examine variability by recruiting up to 400 ethnically and racially diverse healthy adult
      male and female volunteers aged 18 to 55. We will carry out genotyping, behavioral testing
      and functional magnetic resonance imaging on this group. We will initially recruit a large
      pool of subjects for behavioral testing and genotyping. Behavioral tests will include various
      laboratory tasks related to impulsivity. We have recently developed a series of tasks that we
      have used in a group of Parkinson s patients with impulsive/compulsive behaviors (PD+ICBs).
      Several tasks have shown large group effects between Parkinson s patients with and without
      ICBs (PD +/- ICBs). We will focus on those tasks in the present study. Specific examples
      include information sampling tasks and measures of novelty preference. If genetic effects on
      behavior in the large sample are found, we will ask a subset of the original sample to return
      for fMRI testing. The subset will be selected to allow us to examine the neural circuits that
      operate differently as a function of genotype. In other words, they will be selected on the
      basis of their genotype. The outcome measure in this case will be differences in brain
      activity as a function of genotype, during performance of our behavioral task.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Subjects will be eligible for this study if they:

          -  are between 18 and 55 years of age

          -  are in good physical health

          -  speak English well enough to understand task instructions clearly

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Subjects will not be eligible for this study if they:

          -  have a major medical (e.g. heart disease), neurological (e.g. stroke) or psychiatric
             (e.g. bipolar disorder) illness

          -  have a vision and/or hearing problem that interferes with testing

          -  currently use any psychotropic medication, antidepressants, steroids or opiates

          -  currently use alcohol in excess of 14 drinks/week for males or 7 drinks/week for
             females.

          -  have a lifetime history of or currently have alcohol or substance use or dependence
             (excluding nicotine) that requires independent, concurrent treatment intervention
             (such as, antabuse or opiate treatment). This does not include self-help group
             treatment/intervention.

          -  cannot understand the consent and procedures or cannot consent themselves to the study

          -  Smoke more than a half pack of cigarettes a day

          -  NIMH employees and staff and their immediate family members will be excluded from the
             study per NIMH policy.

        In addition to the above, additional exclusion criteria apply for all MRI studies:

          -  Female subjects who are pregnant or have a positive pregnancy test 24 hours prior to
             an experiment will be excluded from neuroimaging studies.

          -  All subjects will be questioned prior to MRI scanning for possible occupational
             exposure to metal slivers or shavings, which may have become accidentally lodged in
             the tissues of the head or neck. Subjects with surgical clips or shrapnel in or near
             the brain or blood vessels, subjects with cochlear implants, subjects with any
             metallic body in the eye or CNS, and subjects with any form of implant wire or metal
             device which may concentrate radiofrequency fields will be excluded from MRI scanning
             experiments because of possible risks during MRI scanning. Those whose history is
             suggestive of such a problem will also be excluded from the MRI portion of the
             experiments. They may still participate in the behavioral experiments.

          -  Subjects unable to lie flat on their back for up to 2 hours or who are uncomfortable
             in small close spaces (have claustrophobia) will not be eligible to participate in MRI
             scans.
