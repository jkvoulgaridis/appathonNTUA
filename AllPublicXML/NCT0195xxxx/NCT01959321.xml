      This multi-center observational study examines risk factors for HCV transmission from mother
      to baby. The study will also assess risk factors associated with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV)
      infection in pregnant women. Also, the study will describe the outcomes of pregnant women
      with HCV as well as the outcomes of their infants to 18 months of age.

      Approximately 750 HCV antibody positive pregnant women and their infants will be followed
      from baseline until the infant is 18 months. A randomly selected control cohort of 500
      pregnant women who are HCV antibody negative will be followed until delivery.

    <description>The primary outcome is HCV infection of the offspring, where infection is defined by satisfying any one of the following criteria:
HCV RNA positive (i.e. presence of viral load) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test at 2-6 months (2 month visit)
HCV RNA positive and HCV antibody positive at the 18-24 months (18 month visit)
HCV RNA positive at 18-24 months with a negative HCV antibody at 18-24 months and negative RNA at 2-6 months. However, the positive result must be confirmed by a repeat test on the 18-month sample to qualify.
HCV antibody positive at 18-24 months with negative HCV RNA at both visits. However, the positive result must be confirmed by a repeat test on the 18-month sample to qualify.
Clinical result that is either HCV RNA positive or HCV antibody positive obtained at 18 months or older with a confirmed clinical diagnosis of HCV, if a central laboratory sample could not be obtained at 18-24 months.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Singleton pregnancy

          2. An HCV antibody positive screen (case) measured using two FDA-approved ELISA tests,
             the Abbott Architect version 3.0 system and the Ortho HCV 3.0.

          3. Gestational age at screening no later than 23 weeks and 6 days, and gestational age at
             enrollment no later than 27 weeks and 6 days, based on clinical information and
