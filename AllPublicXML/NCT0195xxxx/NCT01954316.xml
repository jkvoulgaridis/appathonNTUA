  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1 study to test different doses of a new investigational drug called
      CFI-400945 to see which dose is safer in people. This study will also look at the safety of
      CFI-400945 and to study its effects on patients with advanced cancers. This drug has been
      tested in animals but not yet in people.

      CFI-400945 is an oral (taken by mouth) drug that works by blocking polo-like kinase 4 (PLK4)
      from working. PLK4 is a protein that is important in regulating cell growth and division and
      cell death. Many tumors are shown to make too much PLK4. When there is too much PLK4
      produced, it is believed to lead to uncontrolled cancer cell growth and division. Therefore,
      by blocking this protein from working, it is believed to stop tumors growing or shrink them.

      All participants will receive CFI-400945. At the beginning of the study, participants are
      given a low dose of CFI-400945 and are watched very closely to see what side effects they
      have and to make sure the side effects are not severe. If the side effects are not severe,
      then more participants are asked to join the study and are given a higher dose of study drug.
      Participants joining the study later on will get higher doses of study drug than participants
      who join earlier. This will continue until the highest dose of study drug that can be taken
      without severe side effects is found (called maximum tolerated dose). Doses higher than that
      will not be given.

      After the best dose of study drug is found, additional participants will be asked to join the
      study and will be given the study drug at the maximum tolerated dose to further test the
      safety and the drug at that dose.
