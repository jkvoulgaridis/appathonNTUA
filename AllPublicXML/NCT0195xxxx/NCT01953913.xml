      Primary objective of the trial is to evaluate the safety of afatinib in patients with locally
      advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring EGFR (Epidermal growth
      factor receptor) mutation(s) and have never been treated with an EGFR-TKI (tyrosine kinase
      inhibitor). Secondary objective is to assess the time to symptomatic progression (as judged
      by investigator).

      <recruitment_details>Participants with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation(s), who have never been treated with an EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) were recruited in the phase IIIb open label, multicentre, single-arm trial.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>All participants were screened for eligibility to participate in the trial. Participants attended specialist sites which would then ensure that they (all participants) met all inclusion/exclusion criteria. Participants were not to be entered to trial treatment if any one of the specific entry criteria were not met.</pre_assignment_details>
