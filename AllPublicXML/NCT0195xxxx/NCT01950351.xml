  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects and how well hypofractionated proton beam
      radiation therapy works in treating patients with prostate cancer that has not spread to
      nearby lymph nodes or to other parts of the body. Specialized radiation therapy, such as
      proton beam radiation therapy, that delivers a high dose of radiation directly to the tumor
      may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate the incidence of grade 2 gastrointestinal toxicity following the proposed
      treatment regimens at 2 years post-treatment.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate the change in health related quality of life (HRQOL) following the proposed
      treatment regimen compared to pre-treatment assessment as defined by Expanded Prostate Cancer
      Index Composite (EPIC), Utilization of Sexual Medications/Devices, and Medical
      history/conditions questionnaire.

      II. Estimate the rates of acute toxicity of the treatment regimens. III. Estimate the rates
      of late toxicity at 3, 4, and 5 years post-treatment. IV. Assess the efficacy of
      hypo-fractionated proton beam therapy, defined by the incidence of a rising prostate-specific
      antigen (PSA) at 5 years.

      V. Determine the rate of local failure by biopsy of the prostate when objective tests,
      prostate-specific antigen (PSA), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), digital rectal exam (DRE),
      suggest relapse.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo proton beam radiation therapy in 15 fractions over 5-6 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6-12 months for 24 months
      and then annually until month 60.
