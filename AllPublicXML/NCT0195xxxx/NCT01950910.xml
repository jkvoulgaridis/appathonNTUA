  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Biomarkers are essential for the identification of disease states. There are no early
      diagnostic or prognostic markers for ALS. The purpose of this study is to identify a panel of
      biomarkers from blood or spinal fluid of ALS patients and to collect data to better
      understand disease progression.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a motor neuron disease characterized by progressive
      degeneration of motor neurons, muscle atrophy and paralysis. There is no reliable early
      diagnostic test for ALS making identification of the disease difficult at its earliest
      stages. Early detection is critical to the initiation of early neuroprotective therapy. By
      the time a reliable diagnosis can be made, substantial damage to motor neurons and muscle has
      already occurred. The purpose of the current project is to establish a bank of blood samples
      (serum and protein/RNA/DNA from blood cells) and CSF for use in the development of an early
      diagnostic test for ALS and to better understand the progression of this disease.

      Samples from patients that have a confirmed or unknown diagnosis of motor neuron disease will
      be examined. ALS and suspected neuromuscular disease (control) samples will be collected for
      comparison. Investigators will examine various biochemical, metabolic and genetic markers
      from these samples in hopes of finding differences in the expression between control subjects
      and ALS patients and how these biomarkers vary during disease progression. Participants will
      be asked to complete an optional questionnaire to collect data including medication and
      vitamin use and medical and disease history. This data will be linked to the patient's
      samples; however, all samples will be deidentified and coded to avoid the possibility of
      linking results to the patient. Results will not be stored in the patient's medical record.
