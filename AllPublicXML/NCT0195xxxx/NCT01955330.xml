      OBJECTIVES:

      The objectives of the year study are two-fold:

        1. To determine the 5-7 year patency rate (rate of open bypass grafts) of the LITA graft
           and stent of patients who have already had robotically-assisted Hybrid CABG surgery
           using CTA and MPS-MIBI.

        2. To determine patient quality of life at 5-7 years after robotically-assisted Hybrid CABG
           surgery

      New techniques such as robotically-assisted Hybrid CABG surgery need proper evaluation to
      ensure potential benefits gained are not harmful to that which we know to be of significant
      benefit to the patients, that being the left internal thoracic artery (LITA) graft (one of
      the main coronary arteries supplying your heart with blood). We are therefore proposing a 5-7
      year CT-Angiography (CTA) and Myocardial Perfusion Scintigraphy (MPS-MIBI) to assess the
      patency rate of the LITA graft and the stented graft in patients that have already undergone
      robotically assisted Hybrid CABG.
