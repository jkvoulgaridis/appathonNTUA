      The outcome of this research will be a demonstration that family health history (FHH) risk
      data can be used efficiently to deliver more effective healthcare in geographically and
      ethnically diverse clinical care environments. Although FHH is a standard component of the
      medical interview its widespread adoption is hindered by three major barriers: (1) a dearth
      of standard collection methods; (2) the absence of health care provider access to complete
      FHH information; and (3) the need for clinical guidance for the interpretation and use of
      FHH. In addition, the time constraints of the busy provider and poor integration of FHH with
      paper medical records or electronic medical records (EMR) impede its widespread use. The
      investigators hypothesize that patient-driven and electronic collection of FHH for risk
      stratification will promote more informed decision-making by patients and providers, and
      improves adherence to risk-stratified preventive care guidelines. The study team will use an
      implementation sciences approach to integrate an innovative FHH system that collects FHH from
      patients. Intermountain Healthcare will provide the information technology expertise with EMR
      design to develop an innovative solution to a storage model standard for FHH data as well as
      a centralized standards-compliant open clinical decision support (OpenCDS) rule development
      architecture to analyze FHH and to generate evidence-based, individualized, disease risk,
      preventive care recommendations for both patients and providers.

      Five health care delivery organizations will participate in this demonstration project: Duke
      University, the Medical College of Wisconsin, the Air Force, Essentia Health, and the
      University of North Texas Health Science Center. The study will take place in 'real world'
      clinical, socio-cultural, and demographically diverse (rural, underserved, academic, family
      medicine) care clinics (n=34) in 5 states (CA, MN, NC, WI, TX) that include genomic medicine
      'early adopter' and 'na√Øve' sites, as well as those that are EMR-enabled and others that are
      not. The study team will recruit a minimum of 7000 English or Spanish speaking adults over a
      3-year period and will capture process metrics and outcomes that are measured in the course
      of usual care. The goals are: 1) To optimize the collection of patient entered FHH in diverse
      clinical environments for coronary heart disease, thrombosis, and selected cancers, 2) to
      export FHH data to an OpenCDS platform and return CDS results to providers and patients (and
      to EMRs where relevant) and to explore the integration of genetic risk and FHH data at
      selected sites, 3) to assess the clinical and personal utility of FHH using a pragmatic
      observational study design to assess reach, adoption, integrity, exposure, and
      sustainability, and to capture, analyze, and report effectiveness outcomes at each
      stakeholder level: patient, provider, and clinic/system, and 4) to take a leadership role in
      the dissemination of guidelines for FHH intervention across in diverse practice settings.
