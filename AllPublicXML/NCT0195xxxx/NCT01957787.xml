    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of cryoablation therapy used
      to treat tumors in participants with pulmonary metastatic disease. This study is to enroll
      participants who will undergo cryoablation of at least 1 metastatic pulmonary tumor that is
      less than or equal to 3.5 centimeter (cm). Participants will be followed 24 months post their
      cryoablation procedure.

    <textblock>
      Treatment for pulmonary metastatic disease may include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation
      therapy, or a combination of treatments. However, several variables may exclude participants
      from these treatments such as multiple tumors, multiple previous surgeries, pulmonary
      dysfunction, or co-morbid medical conditions. For these participants, percutaneous
      cryoablation may be a suitable option.

      Ablation of metastatic lung tumors is a rapidly expanding area within interventional
      oncology. Cryotherapy, radiofrequency, laser, and microwave have all been shown to be
      effective. Cryotherapy offers a wide range of anatomic and tumor treatment options because of
      the ability to visualize the ice under imaging guidance and the preservation of collagenous
      tissue structure. Cryoablation has been extensively performed in the prostate and kidney with
      favorable outcomes reported in the literature. More recently, cryoablation has been shown to
      be safe in the treatment of lung tumors with CT guidance.

    <measure>Local Tumor Control for Each Index Tumor as Measured by Imaging at Month 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 1 (Month 3 if Month 1 Data was missing) and Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>Local tumor control defined as the absence of local treatment failure 12 months following study cryoablation based on site-reported data. Local control was achieved if the 3-axis measurement (that is, the greatest trans-axial diameter plus the 2 perpendicular diameters) of a tumor at Month 12 was less than 20% larger than the 3-axis measurement of the tumor at Month 1 following study cryoablation. A separate evaluation of local tumor control at Month 12 following cryoablation was completed per index tumor. Month 1 data served as the baseline for this analysis; if Month 1 data was missing, Month 3 data were used. Tumors with a local failure at the prior study visit and those with repeat cryoablation procedures prior to Month 12 were counted as failures. Imaging for assessment of tumor measurements was performed using CT or 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-CT with or without contrast.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Physical Function as Assessed by the Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) Scale at Months 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 1, Month 3, Month 6, Month 12, Month 18, and Month 24</time_frame>
    <description>The KPS scale is a standard way of measuring the ability of cancer participants to perform ordinary tasks. KPS may be used to determine a participant's prognosis and to measure changes in a participant's ability to function. Assessments were made by examining the change in the baseline scores to those reported post-operatively. KPS scores range from 0 to 100. A higher score means the participant is better able to carry out daily activities.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Quality of Life Over Time as Assessed by the Short Form-12 (SF-12) Generic Measure at Month 1 and Month 3</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 1 and Month 3</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-12 is a shortened version of the well-known SF-36. The SF-12 assesses 8 domains (physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health problems, bodily pain, social functioning, general mental health, role limitations due to emotional problems, vitality, general health perception). The shorter instrument provides a general measurement of quality of life. Assessments were made by examining the change in the baseline scores to those reported post-operatively. The scores range from 0 to 100. A higher value indicates a better quality of life of the participant.</description>

          <description>Participants underwent a cryoablation procedure with the Galil Medical Cryoablation System according to the manufacturer's guidelines. Participant preparation, anesthesia, intra-operative monitoring, and postoperative management for the study cryoablation procedure were identical to those for standard cryoablation treatment routinely performed at the clinical centers that participated in this study and were at the discretion of the Investigators. Tumors in both lungs were to be treated at an appropriate interval, determined on an individual basis. Treatment of bilateral index tumors in a single treatment session was not performed. All participants received cryoablation of up to 6 metastatic lung tumors. Treatment of all study index tumors was completed within an 8-week window.</description>

        <title>Local Tumor Control for Each Index Tumor as Measured by Imaging at Month 12</title>
        <description>Local tumor control defined as the absence of local treatment failure 12 months following study cryoablation based on site-reported data. Local control was achieved if the 3-axis measurement (that is, the greatest trans-axial diameter plus the 2 perpendicular diameters) of a tumor at Month 12 was less than 20% larger than the 3-axis measurement of the tumor at Month 1 following study cryoablation. A separate evaluation of local tumor control at Month 12 following cryoablation was completed per index tumor. Month 1 data served as the baseline for this analysis; if Month 1 data was missing, Month 3 data were used. Tumors with a local failure at the prior study visit and those with repeat cryoablation procedures prior to Month 12 were counted as failures. Imaging for assessment of tumor measurements was performed using CT or 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-CT with or without contrast.</description>

Tumors in both lungs were to be treated at an appropriate interval, determined on an individual basis. Treatment of bilateral index tumors in a single treatment session was not performed. All participants received cryoablation of up to 6 metastatic lung tumors. Treatment of all study index tumors was completed within an 8-week window.</description>

        <title>Local Tumor Control for Each Index Tumor at Month 18 and Month 24</title>
        <description>Local tumor control defined as the absence of local treatment failure 18 and 24 months following study cryoablation based on site-reported data. Local control was achieved if the 3-axis measurement (that is, the greatest trans-axial diameter plus the 2 perpendicular diameters) of a tumor at Month 12 was less than 20% larger than the 3-axis measurement of the tumor at Month 1 following study cryoablation. A separate evaluation of local tumor control at Month 12 following cryoablation was completed per index tumor. Month 1 data served as the baseline for this analysis; if Month 1 data was missing, Month 3 data were used. Tumors with a local failure at the prior study visit and those with repeat cryoablation procedures prior to Month 12 were counted as failures. Imaging for assessment of tumor measurements was performed using CT or 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-CT with or without contrast.</description>

        <title>Local Tumor Control With Additional Cryoablation Galil Medical Technology Treatment(s) of a Previously Treated Index Tumor</title>
        <description>Local tumor control, defined as absence of local treatment failure 12 months following study cryoablation based on site-reported data, was achieved if 3-axis measurement (that is, greatest trans-axial diameter plus 2 perpendicular diameters) of a tumor at Month 12 was &lt;20% larger than 3-axis measurement of the tumor at Month 1 following study cryoablation. Separate evaluation of local tumor control at Month 12 following cryoablation was completed per index tumor. Follow-up visits were re-started after additional treatment, per study protocol and continued through the Month 24 visit after the last study cryoablation. Month 1 data served as baseline for analysis; if Month 1 data was missing, Month 3 data were used. Tumors with a local failure at prior study visit and with repeat cryoablation procedures prior to Month 12 were counted as failures. Tumor measurement imaging performed using CT or 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-CT with or without contrast.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Physical Function as Assessed by the Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) Scale at Months 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24</title>
        <description>The KPS scale is a standard way of measuring the ability of cancer participants to perform ordinary tasks. KPS may be used to determine a participant's prognosis and to measure changes in a participant's ability to function. Assessments were made by examining the change in the baseline scores to those reported post-operatively. KPS scores range from 0 to 100. A higher score means the participant is better able to carry out daily activities.</description>

            <description>Participants underwent a cryoablation procedure with the Galil Medical Cryoablation System according to the manufacturer's guidelines. Participant preparation, anesthesia, intra-operative monitoring, and postoperative management for the study cryoablation procedure were identical to those for standard cryoablation treatment routinely performed at the clinical centers that participated in this study and were at the discretion of the Investigators. Tumors in both lungs were to be treated at an appropriate interval, determined on an individual basis. Treatment of bilateral index tumors in a single treatment session was not performed. All participants received cryoablation of up to 6 metastatic lung tumors. Treatment of all study index tumors was completed within an 8-week window.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Quality of Life Over Time as Assessed by the Short Form-12 (SF-12) Generic Measure at Month 1 and Month 3</title>
        <description>The SF-12 is a shortened version of the well-known SF-36. The SF-12 assesses 8 domains (physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health problems, bodily pain, social functioning, general mental health, role limitations due to emotional problems, vitality, general health perception). The shorter instrument provides a general measurement of quality of life. Assessments were made by examining the change in the baseline scores to those reported post-operatively. The scores range from 0 to 100. A higher value indicates a better quality of life of the participant.</description>

          <description>Participants underwent a cryoablation procedure with the Galil Medical Cryoablation System according to the manufacturer's guidelines. Participant preparation, anesthesia, intra-operative monitoring, and postoperative management for the study cryoablation procedure were identical to those for standard cryoablation treatment routinely performed at the clinical centers that participated in this study and were at the discretion of the Investigators. Tumors in both lungs were to be treated at an appropriate interval, determined on an individual basis. Treatment of bilateral index tumors in a single treatment session was not performed. All participants received cryoablation of up to 6 metastatic lung tumors. Treatment of all study index tumors was completed within an 8-week window.</description>
