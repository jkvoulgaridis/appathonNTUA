          <description>FE 999049 was administered as single daily subcutaneous injections in the abdomen. Subjects randomised to FE 999049 had their individual dose determined on the basis of their anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) level at screening and their body weight at randomisation. The daily FE 999049 dose was fixed throughout the stimulation period and maximum allowed daily dose was 12 μg. Dosing continued until the criterion for triggering of final follicular maturation was met. Subjects could be treated for a maximum of 20 days.</description>

The starting dose of GONAL-F was 150 international units (IU) and fixed for the first five stimulation days, after which it could be adjusted by 75 IU based on the individual response. The maximum allowed daily dose was 450 IU. Dosing continued until the criterion for triggering of final follicular maturation was met.

      <population>Of the 1,329 randomised subjects, 1,326 were exposed to IMP: FE 999049 (665 subjects) and GONAL-F (661 subjects). The 3 subjects who were not exposed to IMP were randomisation failures; 2 subjects (1 in each treatment group) did not fulfil an inclusion criterion, and 1 subject (in the GONAL-F group) withdrew due to personal reasons.</population>
