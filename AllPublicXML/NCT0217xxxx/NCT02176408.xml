  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the leading cause of disability in the developed world and
      is associated with lost productivity, increased health care utilization, and mortality.
      Several empirically supported treatments, such as antidepressant medication and cognitive
      behavioral therapy, exist for the treatment of MDD; however, studies have shown that as many
      as 34% of individuals do not respond to these treatments. Exercise and stretching
      interventions represent alternative strategies associated with strong effect sizes in past
      studies. Additionally, exercise has been shown to enhance cognitive functioning, especially
      attention and memory. This study aims to investigate the effect of a combined aerobic
      exercise and behavioral activation treatment (BA) for MDD. Behavioral activation treatment
      involves completing both pleasant and mastery-based activities with the goal of enhancing
      mood. The current study will recruit 32 MDD patients for an active treatment phase of nine
      60-90 minute sessions (6 weekly sessions and 3 biweekly sessions) of either BA plus exercise
      (BA+EX) or BA plus stretching (BA+STR). The purpose of this study is to identify if adding
      aerobic exercise to a brief psychosocial treatment can improve mood above and beyond an
      active control condition.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) will be recruited to participate in a free
      treatment trial of a combined exercise or stretching regimen plus behavioral activation
      treatment. All individuals will receive 6 weekly and 3 biweekly 1-hour sessions of behavioral
      activation treatment. Behavioral activation involves exploring values in different life areas
      (relationships, education/career, interests, etc.) and scheduling activities in line with
      these values. Research has shown that behavioral activation treatment can improve mood and
      alleviate depressive symptoms.

      In addition, participants will be randomized (like a flip of a coin) to either an additional
      aerobic exercise intervention or an additional stretching intervention. These interventions
      will take place for half an hour after the first 6 weeks of the behavioral activation
      intervention. The purpose of this study is to examine if adding an aerobic exercise
      intervention to a brief psychosocial treatment can improve mood above and beyond an active
      control condition.

      Throughout the study, participants will complete computer, questionnaire, and interview
      assessments as well as exercise tests and a blood draw. The details of each visit are listed
      below. For full completion of this study, participants can earn up to $100.

      Screening visit: diagnostic interview, assessment for physical activity risk (brief meeting
      with physician)

      Baseline visit (week 0): submaximal exercise test, blood draw, questionnaire measures,
      computer tests

      Treatment visit 1 (week 1): BA treatment + EX/STR intervention, brief questionnaires

      Treatment visit 2 (week 2): BA treatment + EX/STR intervention, brief questionnaires

      Treatment visit 3 (week 3): BA treatment + EX/STR intervention, brief questionnaires

      Treatment visit 4 (week 4): BA treatment + EX/STR intervention, questionnaires, submaximal
      exercise test, blood draw

      Treatment visit 5 (week 5): BA treatment + EX/STR intervention, brief questionnaires

      Treatment visit 6 (week 6): BA treatment + EX/STR intervention, brief questionnaires

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The MADRS is a 10-item clinician-rated measure of correlates of depression. Specifically, this questionnaire measures the following: sadness, tension, sleep, appetite, concentration, lassitude, numbness, pessimism, and suicidal ideation. The scale ranges from 0-60 with higher totals indicating worse depression. The following are norms for severity: 0 to 6 - normal/symptom absent; 7 to 19 - mild depression; 20 to 34 - moderate depression; and &gt;34 - severe depression.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The BDI is a widely used 21-item, self-report inventory designed to measure severity of depressive symptoms. Scores range from 0-63 with higher scores indicating worse depression. The following are severity norms for the measure: 0-13: minimal depression; 14-19: mild depression; 20-28: moderate depression; and 29-63: severe depression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The WSAS is a self-report scale of functional impairment attributable to an identified problem, in this case MDD. Scores range from 0 to 40 with higher scores indicating worse functioning. A WSAS score above 20 appears to suggest moderately severe or worse psychopathology. Scores between 10 and 20 are associated with significant functional impairment but less severe clinicalsymptomatology. Scores below 10 appear to be associated with subclinical populations.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (Q-LES-Q)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The Q-LES-Q rates 16 aspects of quality of life, including physical health, mood, activities of daily living, and overall life satisfaction. Scores range from 14 to 70 with lower scores indicating worse quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Logical Memory</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be read a story and asked to remember as many details as possible. Raw scores are reported with a range in the current sample from from 17 to 47 with higher scores indicating better memory performance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Continuous Performance Test- Identical Pairs</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Participants' attention will be assessed using the CPT which is a choice reaction time task which requires a subject to respond whenever two identical stimuli appear in a row within a sequence of rapidly flashed trials. Scores represent the average d' across 2 digit, 3 digit, and 4 digit trials. Average scores in this sample ranged from 1.76 to 4.24. Lower d' represents a better score.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>7 Day Physical Activity Recall (PAR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The PAR is is an interviewer-administered measure of physical activity behavior that will be used as a self-report validation measure of amount of physical activity completed. Metabolic equivalents (METs) of moderate and vigorous intensity activity are reported. METs of activity ranged from 0 to 1520 in this sample with higher numbers indicating more physical activity completed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Brain-derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples (approximately 1 tsp) will be collected at baseline, week 4, week 8, and week 16 to test serum BDNF. Changes in resting BDNF levels were assessed. BDNF levels ranged from 14391 to 43020 ng/ml in this sample with higher levels indicating more BDNF.</description>
