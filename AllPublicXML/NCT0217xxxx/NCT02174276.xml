  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy
      of GS-4774 in adults with CHB and who are currently not on treatment. Participants will be
      randomized to receive TDF alone or GS-4774 plus TDF for 20 weeks. After Week 20, GS-4774 will
      be discontinued. All participants will continue on TDF and will be followed for an additional
      28 weeks. Following completion of the 48 week study period, all participants will be eligible
      for a treatment extension for 96 weeks.

    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The change from baseline to Week 24 in HBsAg was analyzed using a mixed effect model for repeated measures (MMRM). The model included treatment groups, ALT levels (&gt; ULN or ≤ ULN) at baseline, HBeAg status (positive or negative) at baseline, HBsAg level at baseline, visit and treatment-by-visit interaction as fixed effects and visit as a repeated measurement. Estimated least square means of treatment effects are presented with the 95% confidence intervals (CIs).</description>

        <title>Mean Change in Serum HBsAg From Baseline to Week 24</title>
        <description>The change from baseline to Week 24 in HBsAg was analyzed using a mixed effect model for repeated measures (MMRM). The model included treatment groups, ALT levels (&gt; ULN or ≤ ULN) at baseline, HBeAg status (positive or negative) at baseline, HBsAg level at baseline, visit and treatment-by-visit interaction as fixed effects and visit as a repeated measurement. Estimated least square means of treatment effects are presented with the 95% confidence intervals (CIs).</description>

          <title>Mean Change in Serum HBsAg From Baseline to Week 24</title>
          <description>The change from baseline to Week 24 in HBsAg was analyzed using a mixed effect model for repeated measures (MMRM). The model included treatment groups, ALT levels (&gt; ULN or ≤ ULN) at baseline, HBeAg status (positive or negative) at baseline, HBsAg level at baseline, visit and treatment-by-visit interaction as fixed effects and visit as a repeated measurement. Estimated least square means of treatment effects are presented with the 95% confidence intervals (CIs).</description>
