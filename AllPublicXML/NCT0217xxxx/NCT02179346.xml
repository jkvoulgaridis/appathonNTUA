    <textblock>
      Prospective and multicenter non-interventional study to evaluate safety and efficacy of
      NOVOCART® Inject in patients with impingement syndrom in the hip.

      Safety: 24-month post treatment follow up period by measuring the number of adverse drug
      reactions/serious adverse drug reactions.

      Efficacy: 24-month post treatment follow up period using iHOT 33 and EuroQuol-5D-5L.
