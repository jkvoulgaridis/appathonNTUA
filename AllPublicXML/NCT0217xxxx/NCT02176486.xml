  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the safety and tolerability of ixazomib when
      administered as multiple oral doses at escalating dose levels in participants with lupus
      nephritis.

      The drug being tested in this study is called ixazomib. Ixazomib is being tested to find a
      safe and well tolerated dose in participants with lupus nephritis. This study will look at
      side effects and lab results in participants who take ixazomib, along with the
      characterization of its pharmacokinetics (PK). This study is designed as a randomized,
      sequential-panel, multiple rising dose study.

      The study will enroll approximately 40 participants. The study population will consist of 4
      Cohorts. At least 5 participants (4:1 active:placebo) will be recruited into the 0.5 mg dose
      group (Cohort A), at least 5 participants (4:1 active:placebo) in the 2.0 mg dose group
      (Cohort B), 8 participants (6:2 active:placebo) in the 3.0 mg dose group (Cohort C), and 8
      participants (6:2 active:placebo) in the 4.0 mg dose group (Cohort D). Participants in each
      Cohort will be asked to take one capsule on Days 1, 8 and 15 in 28-day cycle, for 3 cycles.
      PK samples will be collected to measure concentrations of ixazomib. The starting dose in
      Cohort A will be 0.5 mg followed by administrations of 2, 3 and 4 mg in subsequent cohorts.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States and Europe. The overall time
      to participate in this study is up to 196 days. Participants will make 19 visits to the
      clinic during the treatment period and will make follow-up visits monthly for 3 months for
      follow-up assessments.

         11. This study permits the re-enrollment of a participant that has discontinued the study
             as a pre- treatment failure (ie, participant has not been randomized). If re-enrolled,
             the participant must be re-consented.

             * The re-enrollment of all participants who completed Cohort A and B is permitted to

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received, an opportunity for the primary publication of the research has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com/Approach for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>

      <recruitment_details>Participants took part in the study at 8 investigative sites in the United States, Spain and Russia from 09 June 2014 to 19 January 2018.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants with a historical diagnosis of lupus nephritis (LN) were enrolled to receive ixazomib as multiple rising doses (MRD) of 0.5 milligram (mg) in Cohort A and 2.0 mg in Cohort B. This study was terminated early after the completion of Cohorts A and B due to lack of sufficient enrollment to complete the study.</pre_assignment_details>
