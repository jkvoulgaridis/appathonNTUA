      Phase IV

      Design : Prospective, open-label, randomized three-arms study

      Main Inclusion criteria Luminal Crohn's disease patients with steroid free remission for at
      least 6 months and a combination therapy with infliximab and anti-metabolites for at least 8
      months

      Primary objective To demonstrate that Infliximab scheduled maintenance with or without
      antimetabolites is superior to antimetabolites alone to maintain sustained steroid-free
      remission over 2 years, while the latter is non inferior with regards to the mean time spent
      in remission over the same duration

      Main co-primary end points Clinical relapse rate at 2 years Mean remission duration within 2
      years Study treatment Infliximab, Mercaptopurine, azathioprine, methotrexate.

      Number of subjects 225 randomized patients (75 per arm)

      Study duration: 3 + 2 years Enrollment: 3 years Follow-up: 2 years

      3. STUDY OBJECTIVES 3.1. Primary objective To assess the effect of two withdrawal strategies
      over two years in patients with stable remission for more than 6 months on combination
      therapy with infliximab and antimetabolites, and demonstrate that continued combination of
      infliximab and antimetabolites or continued monotherapy with infliximab are both superior to
      antimetabolites alone for maintaining sustained steroid-free clinical remission, while
      antimetabolites alone are non-inferior with regards to the mean time spent in remission 3.2.
      Secondary objectives

        -  To identify baseline predictive factors of relapse in the three study groups.

        -  To assess the ability of blood CRP and fecal calprotectin to predict short term relapse
           in the three groups.

        -  To assess time spent inclinical remission in the three groups.

        -  To assess the rate of treatment failure in the three study groups.

        -  To assess the time to treatment failure in the three study groups.

        -  To assess progression of bowel damage in the three groups.

        -  To assess the safety and efficacy of infliximab retreatment in the antimetabolites
           group.

        -  To assess safety in the three study groups.

        -  To assess the health related quality of life in the three study groups.

        -  To assess direct and indirect costs in the three study groups.

        -  To assess evolution of blood CRP and fecal calprotectin in the three study groups.

        -  To assess evolution of infliximab trough levels and ATI in the two infliximab scheduled
           maintenance groups.

        -  To assess genetic association with the various clinical and biological outcomes.

        -  To assess the impact of 6TGN levels on the various clinical and biological outcomes in
           the purine treated patients 4. STUDY POPULATION 4.1. Selection of study population

    <description>There will be two co-primary efficacy end points
Relapse rate at 2 years, relapse being defined by either one of the following events:
A CDAI&gt;250 at any visit or between 150 and 250 with an increase of at least 70 points, over two consecutive visits one week apart associated with a CRP &gt; 5 mg/l or a fecal calprotectin &gt; 250 microg/g
A new opening fistula, perianal or entero-cutaneous.
An intra-abdominal abcess (size of at least 3 cm) or perianal abcess (size of at least 2 cm)
An episode of intestinal obstruction due to Crohn's lesions confirmed by medical imaging and requiring hospitalisation (also considered as treatment failure, see below)
Mean restricted time spent in remission This time will be computed in all patients, from baseline (CDAI &lt;150 and with absence of fistula drainage) until relapse, as defined above, within the 2 first years. First and subsequent remissions will be summed up within the two first years.</description>

    <measure>Treatment failure</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment failure rate. Treatment failure is defined by not achieving remission after treatment adaptation following a relapse according to protocol (CDAI&lt;150 or, in case of relapse defined by the occurence of a new fistula, the absence of fistula closure). The occurence of an intra-abdominal or peri-anal abcess and the occurence of an intestinal obstruction due to Crohn's lesions and requiring a surgical resection or an endoscopic dilatation are also directly considered as treatment failure and will not be managed by treatment adaptation according to protocol.
