    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies how well gallium Ga 68-DOTA-TOC positron emission tomography
      (PET)/computed tomography (CT) or PET/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) works in imaging
      patients with somatostatin receptor positive tumors. Gallium Ga 68-DOTA-TOC binds to
      somatostatin receptor positive tumors and can be seen using a PET scan. A PET scan uses a
      special camera to detect energy given off from gallium Ga 68-DOTA-TOC, to make detailed
      pictures of areas where material accumulates in the body. Diagnostic procedures, such as
      gallium Ga 68-DOTA-TOC PET/CT or PET/MRI, may help find and diagnose somatostatin receptor
      positive tumors and help plan the best treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if gallium Ga 68-DOTA-TOC (gallium-68 labeled DOTA-TOC) results in the
      delineation of more lesions than with conventional imaging.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if the incorporation of gallium (Ga)-68 DOTA-TOC PET/CT into the management
      decision making process results in a change in stage of the patient.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive gallium Ga 68-DOTA-TOC intravenously (IV) over 1-2 minutes. Within 55-70
      minutes, patients then undergo a PET/CT scan over 30-40 minutes or a PET/MRI scan over 50
      minutes.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 2 weeks.

    <description>The 5 largest lesions in each of eight body regions (head and neck, mediastinum, lung, liver, pancreas, the remaining abdomen and pelvis, bone and lymph nodes), will be measured by size (short and long axis) as well as standardized uptake value maximum on conventional imaging and the gallium Ga 68-DOTA-TOC PET imaging. Additionally, the confidence that each lesion represents a metastasis will be recorded The five largest lesions will be (1 = benign, 2 = likely benign, 3 = indeterminant, 4 = likely malignant, 5 = malignant). The number of positive body regions using conventional imaging and Ga-68 DOTA-TOC PET/CT will be compared using a paired t-test (or Wilcoxon signed-rank test if the data appear to be non-normally distributed). The Wilcoxon signed-rank test will also be used to compare reader confidence of paired lesions between conventional imaging and Ga-68 DOTA-TOC PET/CT</description>

        <title>Number of Lesions as Determined by Gallium Ga 68-DOTA-TOC Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Imaging</title>
        <description>The 5 largest lesions in each of eight body regions (head and neck, mediastinum, lung, liver, pancreas, the remaining abdomen and pelvis, bone and lymph nodes), will be measured by size (short and long axis) as well as standardized uptake value maximum on conventional imaging and the gallium Ga 68-DOTA-TOC PET imaging. Additionally, the confidence that each lesion represents a metastasis will be recorded The five largest lesions will be (1 = benign, 2 = likely benign, 3 = indeterminant, 4 = likely malignant, 5 = malignant). The number of positive body regions using conventional imaging and Ga-68 DOTA-TOC PET/CT will be compared using a paired t-test (or Wilcoxon signed-rank test if the data appear to be non-normally distributed). The Wilcoxon signed-rank test will also be used to compare reader confidence of paired lesions between conventional imaging and Ga-68 DOTA-TOC PET/CT</description>
