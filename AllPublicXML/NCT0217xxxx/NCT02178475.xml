    <description>Febrile neutropenia (FN) was defined as an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of &lt; 0.5 x 10^9/L, or &lt; 1.0 x 10^9/L predicted to fall below 0.5 x 10^9/L within 48 hours with fever or clinical signs of sepsis; fever and ANC were measured the same day or within ± 1 calendar day.</description>

    <description>Participants who discontinued pegfilgrastim prophylaxis was defined as participants who received at least one cycle of chemotherapy (cycle 2 or later) in which pegfilgrastim prophylaxis was not administered, but other granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) prophylaxis was administered.

      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>The Clinical Trial Agreement generally does not restrict an investigator's discussion of trial results after completion. The Agreement permits Amgen a limited period of time to review material discussing trial results (typically up to 45 days and possible extension). Amgen may remove confidential information, but authors have final control and approval of publication content. For multicenter studies, the investigator agrees not to publish any results before the first multi-center publication.</restrictive_agreement>
