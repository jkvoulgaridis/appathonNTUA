  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop an accurate and useful way of measuring older
      patients' moods and reactions to the combined issue of cancer treatment and aging. Also, the
      purpose of this study is to test a new self-report measure of depressive symptoms tailored to
      the needs of older adults with cancer. Findings from this research will help us develop
      improved methods of diagnosis and treatment.

    <description>This protocol aims to design, develop and pilot test a psychometric assessment for depression in older cancer patients. This study is comprised of three parts. 1 - Patient Interviews to Explore the Phenomenology of Depression in Older Cancer Patients. 1A- the research team will complete qualitative interviews with 15 depressed and 15 non-depressed older cancer patients.Part 1B- Phase 1b will include recruitment of 50 younger (age range 50 - 69) and 50 older (age &gt;70) cancer patients at MSK. These participants will be asked to complete several existing depression measures.Part 2 - Instrument Development and EvaluationPart 3 - Pilot Testing the Draft Measure</description>

    <description>10-16 patients will review draft items and participate in a cognitive interview. 15 older patients will complete the draft measure in order to generate preliminary psychometric data. All interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed by Ubiqus Transcription Company. The audio recordings are uploaded through Ubiqus's secure server and the transcribed audio is returned to the research staff within 48 hours.</description>

    <description>The draft measure (approximately 35 items, described above) will be administered to a large sample of older cancer patients (n=150) to generate data to evaluate preliminary psychometric properties (item properties including measures of central tendency, skewness/kurtosis, internal consistency, test/re-test reliability, and construct validity (i.e, convergent and discriminant).and known group differences) to further winnow the measure to include approximately 20 items.</description>
