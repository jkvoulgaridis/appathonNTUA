             phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, rifampin and rifabutin is discouraged, but
             not contraindicated. If patients require phenytoin, carbamazepine or phenobarbital
             monitoring of drug levels is suggested during the study.

         12. Pregnant or lactating women.

         13. Psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition potentially hampering
             compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule; those conditions should be
