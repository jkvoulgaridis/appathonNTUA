  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Light treatment was originally employed in Parkinson's disease (PD) to determine if it might
      be effective in treating co-existing symptoms of depression and insomnia. However, a
      preliminary double-blind study as well as other studies reported significant improvement in
      both motor and co-existing Parkinsonian symptoms. As of yet, no long term double blind study
      has validated these findings. This study will use a double-blind design to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of a non-invasive light therapy device to be used with ongoing
      pharmacotherapy for PD, over a six month treatment period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is traditionally described as a disorder of compromised dopamine
      (DA) function in the nigro-striatal dopamine (NSD) system. This system extends from the
      midbrain, through the hypothalamus and into the forebrain to critical areas involved in the
      control of motor performance. Restoration of DA content in this system by administering the
      DA precursor L-dopa or DA agonists reinstates motor control, but provides only symptomatic
      relief with waning efficacy as the disease advances. Symptoms of depression and sleep
      disturbances are also commonly seen in PD patients, and the manifestation of these symptoms
      suggests impaired circadian function.

      Although the involvement of the circadian system in PD was intimated in the first formal
      account of the disorder provided by James Parkinson, it was not until recently that circadian
      malfunction has been specifically cited as playing a major role in the development and
      progression of the disease. In addition to scattered reports depicting circadian-like
      features of PD and related syndromes, a large body of evidence describes the benefits of
      light therapy in PD from both the preclinical and clinical perspectives.

      While the development of a formal understanding has been largely omitted as to the basis for
      any therapeutic effect exerted by light, recent studies have shown that the nigro-striatal
      dopamine system is comprised of the same cell type as cells in the retina and the pineal.
      Such cells are driven by visual input whereby dopamine and melatonin sit in functional
      opposition to regulate day night activities including sleep, mood, reproduction,
      anti-oxidation and movement. Hence one may conclude that the circadian system plays a major
      role in many aspects of PD.

      Recent work in PD has also suggested that the efficacy of light therapy is mediated by
      melatonin and dopamine function in the retina. On this basis it would be reasonable to assume
      that intervention into the function of the circadian system with light therapy in PD patients
      might well serve to modify the course and consequences of the disease. The present study
      serves to extend this finding to the point of providing a practical, non-invasive method for
      helping patients.

    <measure>Change in the Combined Scores (Sum) of Parts I, II, and III of the Movement Disorders Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (M (MDS-UPDRS) From Baseline to Endpoint at 6 Months.</measure>
    <time_frame>Six Months</time_frame>
    <description>Part I: Non-motor impact of experiences of daily living. Part I has 13 questions,the first 6 are assessed by the examiner, and the remaining 7 are usually self assessed, but may include the patient's caregiver. Each question = 0-4, range= 0 - 65.
Part II: Motor Aspects of Experiences of Daily Living: This portion of the scale assesses the motor impact of PD on patients' experiences of daily living. There are 13 questions which are a component of the self-administered Patient Questionnaire.Each question = 0-4, range = 0-65.
Part III: Motor Examination: This portion of the scale assesses the motor signs of PD and is administered by the evaluator. There are 18 questions, however several questions have multiple parts which are also scored. Each question 0-4, Total range=0-132. Higher score=more severe</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Score of the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire - 39 From Baseline to Endpoint at 6 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Six months</time_frame>
    <description>The 39 question Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39) is a widely used patient reported rating scale in Parkinson's disease. Respondents affirm if they have experienced problems due to their disease using a five point scale from never (0 points) to always (4 points, or worse) in doing common activities. The PDQ-39 is comprised of 8 domains: mobility, emotion, activities of daily living, cognition, stigma, social support, communication, bodily discomfort. Total possible range of scores = 0 - 156
The questions are divided into eight measurement scales each comprising 3 to 10 questions. The scores for the questions in each scale are totaled and normalized to a scale of 0 - 100, that is equivalent to percent of maximum score. The scales are; Mobility (MOB): Q1-10; Activities of Daily Life (ADL): Q11-16; Emotional Well Being (EMO): Q17-22; Stigma (STI): Q23-26; Social Support (SOC): Q27-29; Cognitions (COG): Q30-33; Communication (COM) Q34-36; and Bodily Discomfort (BOD): Q37-39.</description>

    <time_frame>Six months</time_frame>
    <description>The Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale 2 (PDSS-2) is designed to assess nocturnal disability in Parkinson's disease. The PDSS-2 is a 15 question analog scale that ranks answers from 0 - 4, with 4 being worse. In addition to an overall assessment of sleep disability three aspects of sleep problems can be obtained; disturbed sleep (total of questions 1-3, 8 and 14), PD-specific nocturnal motor symptoms (total of questions 4-6, 12 and 13), and PD-specific nocturnal symptoms (Total of questions 7, 9-11 and 15). We selected the &quot;Disturbed Sleep&quot; subscale as a key secondary outcome measure. This subscale has a total range of 0 - 16, with 16 being more severe.</description>

        <title>Change in the Score of the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire - 39 From Baseline to Endpoint at 6 Months</title>
        <description>The 39 question Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39) is a widely used patient reported rating scale in Parkinson's disease. Respondents affirm if they have experienced problems due to their disease using a five point scale from never (0 points) to always (4 points, or worse) in doing common activities. The PDQ-39 is comprised of 8 domains: mobility, emotion, activities of daily living, cognition, stigma, social support, communication, bodily discomfort. Total possible range of scores = 0 - 156
The questions are divided into eight measurement scales each comprising 3 to 10 questions. The scores for the questions in each scale are totaled and normalized to a scale of 0 - 100, that is equivalent to percent of maximum score. The scales are; Mobility (MOB): Q1-10; Activities of Daily Life (ADL): Q11-16; Emotional Well Being (EMO): Q17-22; Stigma (STI): Q23-26; Social Support (SOC): Q27-29; Cognitions (COG): Q30-33; Communication (COM) Q34-36; and Bodily Discomfort (BOD): Q37-39.</description>

        <description>The Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale 2 (PDSS-2) is designed to assess nocturnal disability in Parkinson's disease. The PDSS-2 is a 15 question analog scale that ranks answers from 0 - 4, with 4 being worse. In addition to an overall assessment of sleep disability three aspects of sleep problems can be obtained; disturbed sleep (total of questions 1-3, 8 and 14), PD-specific nocturnal motor symptoms (total of questions 4-6, 12 and 13), and PD-specific nocturnal symptoms (Total of questions 7, 9-11 and 15). We selected the &quot;Disturbed Sleep&quot; subscale as a key secondary outcome measure. This subscale has a total range of 0 - 16, with 16 being more severe.</description>

        <title>Change in the Score of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale From Baseline to Endpoint at 6 Months.</title>
        <description>The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) is a scale intended to measure daytime sleepiness to help in diagnosing sleep disorders. The ESS questionnaire asks the subject to rate his or her probability of falling asleep on a scale of increasing probability from 0 (none) to 3 (worse) for eight different everyday situations. The total range is 0 - 24, with higher scores representing worse severity.</description>

      <time_frame>Adverse events were collected from baseline through the endpoint at Month 6, as well as the follow-up Month 7. Because the baseine period also included a two week period, the total safety data collection period was 7.5 months.</time_frame>
      <desc>Adverse events were recorded in the following ways: During the bi-weekly phone calls made by the study coordinator to each patient, during patient evaluations, during post evaluation interviews, and if the patient called to report an adverse event. Participants were asked during the phone calls, evaluations and interviews to report any event.</desc>
