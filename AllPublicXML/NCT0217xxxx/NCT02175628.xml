  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: This study will evaluate a new ultrasound imaging technology called acoustic
      angiography. Acoustic angiography uses an ultrasound contrast agent, already FDA approved for
      use in cardiology, to enhance imaging of blood vessels. Since acoustic angiography uses
      ultrasound, and not x-rays, the patient is not exposed to ionizing radiation, unlike
      traditional angiography and mammography. Specific goals will be to evaluate the quality of
      the images provided by acoustic angiography in the human breast, and furthermore to evaluate
      whether or not acoustic angiography provides additional diagnostic information over
      traditional ultrasound which could provide an improvement in assessing breast lesions.
      Specifically, this additional diagnostic information will hopefully enable us to reduce false
      positive tests and discriminate lethal cancers from non-lethal disease.

      Participants: The investigators are recruiting 60 patients from the UNC Breast Clinic who are
      undergoing core needle biopsy or surgical biopsy (BIRADS 4 and 5 breast lesions).

      Procedures (methods): Acoustic Angiography imaging will be performed in conjunction with
      standard diagnostic imaging, including b-mode ultrasound . Then, a reader study will be
      conducted to compare these modalities. Finally, the images will be analyzed with image
      processing techniques to determine quantitative metrics exhibited by the blood vessel
      morphology in the images. These metrics will be utilized to develop a &quot;malignancy score&quot;
      equation to predict malignancy of a lesion.

      Increasing the sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic imaging in patients at high risk for
      breast cancer could provide substantial clinical benefit by improving diagnosis, preventing
      over-treatment, and reducing healthcare costs. Acoustic angiography is a new type of contrast
      enhanced ultrasound imaging which is specifically sensitive to microvascular structure and
      density. It evaluates tumor micro-vasculature and may provide a powerful prognostic tool for
      the diagnosis of breast cancer, and eventually for treatment evaluation.

      Sixty patients who are to have a clinical surgical breast biopsy based on results from
      pre-study standard of care (SOC) imaging will be recruited from the UNC Breast Clinic for
      participation in the study. The primary objective of this single arm study is to compare the
      sensitivity and specificity of acoustic angiography with traditional b-mode ultrasound in the
      distinction of malignant versus benign breast lesions. Secondary objectives include a
      comparison of area under the curve (AUC) for acoustic angiography versus b-mode ultrasound,
      comparison of radiologist preference for the two imaging techniques for each of 3 lesion
      characteristics, and quantification of vessel tortuosity based on acoustic angiography
      imaging results. These metrics will be used to develop a predictive model of malignancy which
      will subsequently be compared to results from radiology review.

Acoustic Angiography: Acoustic angiography imaging involves a research high frequency ultrasound scanner (VisualSonics Vevo 770) and a prototype transducer as well as conventional b-mode ultrasound to guide the location of the imaging. The conventional ultrasound will be conducted just prior to the acoustic angiography for localization. The imaging also requires administration of Definity ultrasound contrast agent.
Acoustic angiography imaging will be performed by trained medical personnel using mild compression to eliminate motion. Total imaging time is estimated to be less than 15 minutes. All image data will be de-identified and transferred for off-line analysis based on a study ID. The research images will NOT be interpreted or analyzed for clinical decisions related to the patient.</description>

          <title>Acoustic Angiography</title>
          <description>All breast patients will be included in the experimental group.
Acoustic Angiography: Acoustic angiography imaging involves a research high frequency ultrasound scanner (VisualSonics Vevo 770) and a prototype transducer as well as conventional b-mode ultrasound to guide the location of the imaging. The conventional ultrasound will be conducted just prior to the acoustic angiography for localization. The imaging also requires administration of Definity ultrasound contrast agent.
Acoustic angiography imaging will be performed by trained medical personnel using mild compression to eliminate motion. Total imaging time is estimated to be less than 15 minutes. All image data will be de-identified and transferred for off-line analysis based on a study ID. The research images will NOT be interpreted or analyzed for clinical decisions related to the patient.</description>
