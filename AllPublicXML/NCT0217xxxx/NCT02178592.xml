  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HIV/Tuberculosis (TB) co-infection have profound effects on the host's immune system. TB is
      the most common cause of death in patients with HIV worldwide. Rifamycins (such as rifampicin
      [RIF]) are an important component of TB therapy because of their unique activity. The problem
      is that most protease inhibitors (PI) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors
      (NNRTI) used to treat HIV have significant drug-drug interactions with RIF that can lead to
      reduced concentrations of these agents with risk of treatment failure or resistance. The
      non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) efavirenz (EFV) does not present the
      same significant drug interactions with RIF. EFV-based HIV treatment was tested in patients
      concomitantly treated with RIF-containing TB therapy, demonstrating that their
      co-administration can be used safely and effectively. However, the side effect profile of EFV
      overlaps with the RIF-containing TB regimens and makes the management of treatment toxicities
      very complex. Integrase inhibitors (INI), such as dolutegravir (DTG), may offer an important
      alternative to EFV-based therapy in TB coinfected patients. A Phase I drug-drug interaction
      study was conducted in healthy, HIV-seronegative subjects, and showed that DTG at 50 mg twice
      daily given together with RIF was well-tolerated and resulted in DTG concentrations similar
      to those of DTG 50 mg given once daily alone, which is the recommended dose for INI-naive
      patients. Therefore, ART regimens using DTG 50 mg twice daily may represent a new treatment
      option for TB-infected patients who require concurrent treatment for HIV infection. This is a
      Phase III b, randomized, open-label study describing the efficacy and safety of DTG and
      EFV-containing ART regimens in HIV/TB co-infected patients. This study is designed to assess
      the antiviral activity of DTG or efavirenz (EFV) ART-containing regimens through 48 weeks. A
      total of approximately 115 +/-5% subjects will be randomly assigned in a 3:2 ratio to DTG
      (approximately 69 subjects) and EFV (approximately 46 subjects), respectively. This study
      will include a Screening Period, a Randomized Phase (Day 1 to 48 weeks plus a 4-week
      extension), and a DTG Open-label extension (OLE). During the DTG OLE, subjects will be
      supplied with DTG until it is locally approved and commercially available, the subject no
      longer derives clinical benefit, or the subject meets a protocol-defined reason for
      discontinuation, which ever comes first.

    <time_frame>Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of participants who were responders was assessed at the study Week 48 for participants randomized to receive DTG who received at least one dose of study medication. Response was assessed using a modified FDA Snapshot algorithm in which participants were not penalised for any single protocol allowed background therapy substitution even if occurs after the first trial visit.. In this approach participants with HIV-1 RNA &gt;= 50 copies/milliliter are considered as non responders. Participants without HIV-1 RNA data at Week 48 [due to missing data or discontinuation of investigational product (IP) prior to visit window] are also considered as non responders, as well as participants with anti-retroviral (ART) substitutions were not permitted. Study drug (i.e. DTG or EFV) was not allowed to be substituted.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Plasma Human Immuno Deficiency Virus-1 Ribeonucleic Acid (HIV-1 RNA) &lt; 50 Copies/Milliliter at Week 48 Using the Modified US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Snapshot Algorithm</title>
        <description>The percentage of participants who were responders was assessed at the study Week 48 for participants randomized to receive DTG who received at least one dose of study medication. Response was assessed using a modified FDA Snapshot algorithm in which participants were not penalised for any single protocol allowed background therapy substitution even if occurs after the first trial visit.. In this approach participants with HIV-1 RNA &gt;= 50 copies/milliliter are considered as non responders. Participants without HIV-1 RNA data at Week 48 [due to missing data or discontinuation of investigational product (IP) prior to visit window] are also considered as non responders, as well as participants with anti-retroviral (ART) substitutions were not permitted. Study drug (i.e. DTG or EFV) was not allowed to be substituted.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Maximum Post-Baseline-emergent Chemistry Toxicities</title>
        <description>Blood samples for assessment of clinical chemistry parameters were collected from Day 1 up to 52 weeks. Clinical chemistry assessments included alanine aminotransferase (ALT), albumin, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), bilirubin, carbon dioxide, chloride, cholesterol, creatine kinase, creatinine, direct bilirubin, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), glucose, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol direct, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol calculation and direct, lactate dehydrogenase, lipase, phosphate, potassium, sodium, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and urea. Maximum post-Baseline emergent chemistry toxicities were graded using Division of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome [DAIDS] toxicity grading for HIV-infected participants as Grade 1 (mild), Grade 2 (moderate), Grade 3 (severe) and Grade 4 (potentially life-threating).</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Genotypic Resistance</title>
        <description>Whole venous blood samples were obtained from each participants at Screening for resistance testing at the central laboratory (or a laboratory contracted by the central laboratory) and on study plasma for storage samples until Week 52 for potential viral genotypic and phenotypic analyses. Genotypic and phenotypic testing was conducted for participants meeting confirmed virologic withdrawal criteria, i.e., confirmed HIV-1 RNA &gt;=400 copies/milliliter from Week 24 onwards. Genotypic and phenotypic analyses was carried out by Monogram Biosciences using, but not limited to, their Standard Phenosense and GenoSure testing methods for protease (PRO), reverse transcriptase (RT), and integrase assays. Genotypic mutations have been presented for the RT region on codons G190G, K101K, K103K, K65K, V106V and Y181Y. Viral Genotypic population comprised of all participants in the ITT-E population with available on-treatment genotypic data at the time confirmed virologic withdrawal was met.</description>

        <description>Phenotypic susceptibility to all licensed antiretroviral drugs, including DTG and EFV were determined using PhenoSense HIV assays from Monogram Inc. Clinical cutoffs or biological cutoffs by PhenoSense were used to define the phenotypic susceptibility of background treatment and were interpreted as fold change &gt; clinical lower cut-off or biologic cut-off= resistance, fold change &gt;=clinical lower cut-off or biologic cut-off =sensitive (for bilogical cutoff) and fold change &gt; clinical higher cut-off=resistance, fold change &lt;=clinical higher cut-off and &gt; clinical lower cut-off=partially sensitive, fold change &lt;=clinical lower cut-off=sensitive. Viral Phenotypic population will consist of all participants in the ITT-E population with available on-treatment phenotypic resistance data at the time confirmed virologic withdrawal criteria was met. Only participants available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=x in the category titles).</description>
