    <description>The study is conducted over a period of 5 weeks of treatment, using a movement restriction time healthy upper extremity of 2 hours daily.
The restriction applied in the study is performed with the closed hand position and thumb inside the fist through a transparent film that reaches the wrist joint.
In periods mCIMT, monitored the activities designed to enhance their functionality, based on motivation, avoiding frustrations are made.</description>
