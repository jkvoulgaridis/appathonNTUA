      This study is required to demonstrate that the non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP) measurement
      algorithms on two commercially available multifunction hemodynamic acquisition modules, the
      Patient Data Module (PDM) equipped with the DINAMAP® SUPERSTAT algorithm (&quot;PDM-SUPERSTAT&quot;)
      and the Patient Side Module (PSM) equipped with Datex-Ohmeda GE algorithm
      (&quot;PSM-Datex-Ohmeda&quot;), provide accurate NIBP measurements in accordance with the guidelines
      provided by the most recent International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
      81060-2:2013.

      Notably, the new ISO 81060-2:2013 supersedes the previous 2009 version of this standard, and
      this study is being conducted in accordance with the most recent applicable standards.

      This study will assess neonate, infant, children, pediatric, adolescent, and adult patients
      as well as adults with chronic atrial fibrillation in a population that requires non-emergent
      heart catheterization.

      This is a study conducted to satisfy both standards for two NIBP devices and, as such, does
      not require a statistical hypothesis.

    <time_frame>60 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Comparison of the following measurements: non-invasive blood pressure to invasive blood pressure. This is done with a beat to beat comparison. Each pulse from the analyzed time interval (non-invasive blood pressure determination) provides a systolic, MAP and diastolic value and that is compared to the waveform collected at the same timepoint for the invasive BP (measurement). Criteria is defined in ANSI/AAMI/ISO 81060-2 NIBP Standard. Mean &amp; SD of the IBP derived from the IBP wave recordings during a NIBP determination will be calculated; and the range of reference IBP will be determined as mean ±1 standard deviation (SD) of the IBPs. The same method will be used for both systolic and diastolic blood pressures. Data may be excluded for analysis when the range of invasive systolic BP is wider than 20 mmHg or when the range of invasive diastolic BP is wider than 12 mmHg, as such that analysis is performed in accordance with ISO 81060-2:2013.</description>

        The study will include neonates with indwelling femoral, radial, or umbilical arterial
        monitoring lines and infant, pediatric, adolescent, and adult subjects requiring

        <title>Number of Participants With Accurate NIBP Measurements as Confirmed by IBP Measurements</title>
        <description>Comparison of the following measurements: non-invasive blood pressure to invasive blood pressure. This is done with a beat to beat comparison. Each pulse from the analyzed time interval (non-invasive blood pressure determination) provides a systolic, MAP and diastolic value and that is compared to the waveform collected at the same timepoint for the invasive BP (measurement). Criteria is defined in ANSI/AAMI/ISO 81060-2 NIBP Standard. Mean &amp; SD of the IBP derived from the IBP wave recordings during a NIBP determination will be calculated; and the range of reference IBP will be determined as mean ±1 standard deviation (SD) of the IBPs. The same method will be used for both systolic and diastolic blood pressures. Data may be excluded for analysis when the range of invasive systolic BP is wider than 20 mmHg or when the range of invasive diastolic BP is wider than 12 mmHg, as such that analysis is performed in accordance with ISO 81060-2:2013.</description>

        <population>The PDM-SuperSTAT arm was analyzed according to the ISO 81060-2:2013(E) standard. As the PSM-Datex-Ohmeda was prematurely terminated, PASS/FAIL criteria were unable to be determined.</population>

The result of the analysis of mean blood pressure measurement errors shows the PDM-SuperSTAT arm population groups ≥ 3 years old and &lt; 3 years old passed the acceptance criteria. However, the Chronic AFib subgroup population of ≥ 3- years old did not meet the subject enrollment because of the challenging population; but as a group, the NIBP determinations for the PDM-SuperSTAT arm for both population group of ≥ 3 years old and &lt; 3 years old showed the study conformed to ISO 81060-2:2013(E) standards.</description>
