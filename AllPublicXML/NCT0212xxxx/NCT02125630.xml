  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A registry trial evaluating resection of the primary breast tumor in women presenting with de
      novo stage IV breast cancer with bone metastasis only. Previous reports of carefully selected
      patients presenting with stage IV breast cancer suggest that surgery on the primary tumor may
      result in improved survival, but this remains unproven. The early results of our ongoing
      trial MF07-01 trial (a phase III randomized controlled trial of breast cancer women with
      distant metastases at presentation who receive loco-regional treatment for intact primary
      tumor compared with those who do not receive such treatment) showed that patients with bone
      metastasis only have a trend toward improved survival with initial surgery.

      This registry trial evaluating resection of the primary breast tumor in women presenting with
      de novo stage IV breast cancer with bone metastasis only. Previous reports of carefully
      selected patients presenting with stage IV breast cancer suggest that surgery on the primary
      tumor may result in improved survival, but this remains unproven. The early results of our
      ongoing trial MF07-01 trial (a phase III randomized controlled trial of breast cancer women
      with distant metastases at presentation who receive loco-regional treatment for intact
      primary tumor compared with those who do not receive such treatment) showed that patients
      with bone metastasis only have a trend toward improved survival with initial surgery. Our
      goal is to test if primary surgery improves overall survival in bone only metastasis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Primary breast tumor amenable for complete surgical resection

          -  Patients in good physical condition for receiving protocol driven locoregional and
             systemic treatment

          -  Patients eligible for sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy and receiving radiotherapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Primary tumor not amenable for complete resection (such as tumor extending to
             neighboring tissues; T4a,c or inflammatory breast cancer; T4d)

          -  Primary tumor with extended infection, bleeding, or necrosis

          -  Patients with poor physical condition which prevents the patient from receiving
             protocol driven locoregional and systemic treatment

          -  Synchronous primary cancer at the contralateral breast

          -  Previous diagnosis of other cancers (excluding basal cell skin cancer

          -  Squamous cell skin cancer

          -  Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia)

          -  Clinically involved contralateral axillary nodes

          -  Patients not suitable for adequate follow-up
