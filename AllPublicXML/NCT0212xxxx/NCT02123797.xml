  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer kills 160,000 patients annually; this represents 28% of all US cancer deaths. The
      overall year survival rate has only improved from 12% to 17% in 33 years. This failure
      reflects the innate lethality of lung cancer, but also reflects defects in patient care
      delivery. Care for the lung cancer patient starts with an abnormal radiologic scan, proceeds
      through a diagnostic biopsy, tests to determine the extent of spread of the disease (stage),
      selection of appropriate treatment, and finally ends with patient outcomes. At each step are
      multiple options and independent specialists, each one engaged by a process of sequential
      referrals in the serial care model. This process is often not user-friendly, is riddled with
      inefficiency, delays, and outcome variances.

      The coordinated multidisciplinary model, in which patients and their doctors collaborate to
      provide evidence-based care, is believed by experts to be superior, but has few examples of
      successful implementation. The implementation gap exists because of the paucity of good
      quality data, and lack of implementation know-how.

      Embedded in the highest US lung cancer mortality zone, the greater Memphis area has a
      racially, culturally, economically and geographically diverse population. The investigators
      research group has shown how poor quality care impairs patient survival in this region and in
      the greater US. The investigators have linked patient survival to compliance with
      multidisciplinary care plans. In this project, the investigators propose to rigorously test
      the impact of the multidisciplinary care model on patient outcomes in a community-based,
      private practice environment, similar to where 70% of lung cancer care is delivered in the
      US.

      The objective of this study is to provide high-level evidence of the impact of
      multidisciplinary care on lung cancer patient outcomes. Multidisciplinary care is defined as
      a model of care in which patients, their care-givers and key specialists concurrently and
      directly evaluate the same patients in the presence of the patients and their informal
      caregivers, in order to develop evidence-based consensus care plans

      Within the Baptist Memorial Health Care system, the Multidisciplinary Thoracic Oncology
      Program has two components: Primarily, the program is centered in a multidisciplinary clinic,
      wherein patients and their informal caregivers are seen by multiple specialists at a single
      appointment time; secondarily, the program includes a multidisciplinary conference, wherein
      all of the specialists potentially involved in lung cancer care discuss patients referred for
      presentation and make consensus recommendations for care. This study focuses primarily on the
      experience and outcomes of care delivered to patients evaluated in the multidisciplinary
      clinic. However, data from the conference will also be included in some aspects of the study.
      The goal is to improve the access and quality of thoracic oncologic care delivery within the
      Baptist Healthcare System The investigators specific aim is to perform a prospective, matched
      cohort comparative effectiveness study of patients receiving serial vs. multidisciplinary
      care, with key patient-centered endpoints (survival, stakeholder satisfaction with the care
      experience, timeliness and stage-appropriateness of care, quality of staging). Serial care is
      defined as the current system of linear, sequential, referral-based care delivery.

The hierarchy to rank recommendations, from highest priority to lowest, was (1) treatment, (2) staging, (3) diagnosis, (4) surveillance.
If a patient had a treatment recommendation and it happened, he/she was concordant. If treatment was recommended and it did not happen, he/she was discordant. If no treatment recommendation was made, then concordance was measured by whether or not the staging recommendation was met. If no staging recommendation was made, then the diagnostic recommendation was given priority for a concordance measurement. If no diagnostic recommendation, then a surveillance recommendation was used to measure overall concordance.</description>

    <description>Overall survival, defined as the time from cancer diagnosis to death from any cause or data censoring, is analyzed and summarized with the survival probabilities over time using the Kaplan-Meier method. Confidence intervals for the 1- and 3- year survival probabilities are reported. Additionally, the Cox proportional hazard model was used to estimate hazard ratios which are reported in the statistical analyses with 95% confidence intervals.
This measure compares 3 groups, instead of 2, because some patients in the serial care group were presented for discussion in a multidisciplinary thoracic oncology conference while still not being seen in the multidisciplinary clinic setting. Therefore, we split the serial care group in two in order to measure the potential impact of a multidisciplinary conference model, separate from the multidisciplinary clinic model.</description>

          <title>Initial Stage</title>
          <description>Initial Stage is the patient's clinical stage at initial lesion detection as determined by a radiologic scan that first showed a lesion. The staging reported uses the AJCC 7th edition Tumor/Node/Metastasis (TNM) framework for lung cancer staging. Lower staging (Stage IA) is considered a better prognosis than higher staging (Stage IV). For each stage, an earlier letter means a lower stage. Occult carcinoma means the main tumor can’t be assessed. In this study, a change in clinical staging from initial to independently-calculated stage measures the impact of pre-treatment decision-making.</description>

          <description>The T category measures the size and extent of the primary tumor. Lower T categories (T1 tumor 3 cm or less) are considered better prognosis than higher T categories (T4 tumor larger than 7 cm, 2+ separate tumor nodules, or growth between the lungs). Independently calculated clinical T category refers to the method by which the T category immediately before onset of first line treatment is determined.

          <title>Independently Calculated Clinical N Category</title>
          <description>The N category measures the degree of cancer spread to nearby lymph nodes. Lower N categories (N0 the cancer has not spread to nearby lymph nodes) are considered better prognosis than higher N categories (N2 cancer spread to lymph nodes between the lungs). Independently calculated clinical N category refers to the method by which the N category immediately before onset of first line treatment is determined. The independent calculation is performed by a trained researcher using all available pre-treatment clinical information following the AJCC 7th edition framework for lung cancer staging.</description>

This measure compares 3 groups, instead of 2, because some patients in the serial care group were presented for discussion in a multidisciplinary thoracic oncology conference while still not being seen in the multidisciplinary clinic setting. Therefore, we split the serial care group in two in order to measure the potential impact of a multidisciplinary conference model, separate from the multidisciplinary clinic model.</description>

Note that two patients (one from the MD arm and one from the SC arm) have died before receiving recommendations and therefore were not analyzed for this outcome.
The hierarchy to rank recommendations, from highest priority to lowest, was (1) treatment, (2) staging, (3) diagnosis, (4) surveillance.
If a patient had a treatment recommendation and it happened, he/she was concordant. If treatment was recommended and it did not happen, he/she was discordant. If no treatment recommendation was made, then concordance was measured by whether or not the staging recommendation was met. If no staging recommendation was made, then the diagnostic recommendation was given priority for a concordance measurement. If no diagnostic recommendation, then a surveillance recommendation was used to measure overall concordance.</description>

        <description>Aggregate time in days from enrollment to specific care delivery endpoint including: from initial detection of lesion to initial biopsy, from initial detection to non-invasive staging, from initial detection to invasive staging, and from initial detection to definitive treatment.
This measure compares 3 groups, instead of 2, because some patients in the serial care group were presented for discussion in a multidisciplinary thoracic oncology conference while still not being seen in the multidisciplinary clinic setting. Therefore, we split the serial care group in two in order to measure the potential impact of a multidisciplinary conference model, separate from the multidisciplinary clinic model.</description>

        <description>Overall survival, defined as the time from cancer diagnosis to death from any cause or data censoring, is analyzed and summarized with the survival probabilities over time using the Kaplan-Meier method. Confidence intervals for the 1- and 3- year survival probabilities are reported. Additionally, the Cox proportional hazard model was used to estimate hazard ratios which are reported in the statistical analyses with 95% confidence intervals.
This measure compares 3 groups, instead of 2, because some patients in the serial care group were presented for discussion in a multidisciplinary thoracic oncology conference while still not being seen in the multidisciplinary clinic setting. Therefore, we split the serial care group in two in order to measure the potential impact of a multidisciplinary conference model, separate from the multidisciplinary clinic model.</description>

Confidence intervals for the 1- and 3- year survival probabilities are reported. Additionally, the Cox proportional hazard model was used to estimate hazard ratios which are reported in the statistical analyses with 95% confidence intervals.
This measure compares 3 groups, instead of 2, because some patients in the serial care group were presented for discussion in a multidisciplinary thoracic oncology conference while still not being seen in the multidisciplinary clinic setting. Therefore, we split the serial care group in two in order to measure the potential impact of a multidisciplinary conference model, separate from the multidisciplinary clinic model.</description>
