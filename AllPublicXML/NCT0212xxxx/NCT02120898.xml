      The purpose of this study it so compare the safety and efficacy profiles of a generic

      Aldara® (imiquimod) Cream, 5% was the first imiquimod product approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) for the topical treatment of AK, superficial basal cell carcinoma and
      external genital and perianal warts. The FDA approved regimen for the treatment of AK is
      application of 250 milligrams (mg) of cream twice a week for 16 weeks to a 25 square
      centimeters (cm^2) area. In 2011, a lower strength imiquimod cream, Zyclara (imiquimod)
      Cream, 2.5% was approved by the FDA. When used for the treatment of AK, Zyclara is applied
      for a shorter duration and in an expanded treatment area (for example, face or scalp) in
      comparison to Aldara®. This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, Good
      Clinical Practice (GCP) and the applicable regulatory requirement(s). Marketed by Medicis,
      Zyclara® (imiquimod) cream 2.5% is a safe and effective topical therapy for the treatment of
      AK of the face and scalp. Actavis has developed a generic formulation of imiquimod 2.5% cream
      and the current study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this formulation.

    <measure>Complete Clearance Rate - Percentage of Participants With Treatment Success: Per-Protocol (PP) Population</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 14</time_frame>
    <description>Complete clearance rate (treatment success) was defined as the percentage of participants in each treatment group with a count of zero actinic keratosis (AK) lesions in the treatment area at Week 14. All AKs (baseline and new lesions) independent of size within the treatment area were included in the efficacy lesion count. The AK clearance rate for a participant was calculated as follows: {1 - [ (number of AK lesions at Week 14) / (number of AK lesions at Baseline)]} * 100.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) up to Week 14</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. Mild AEs: awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated. Moderate AEs: discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal activities. Severe AEs: inability to carry out usual activities. Serious AEs: death, a life-threatening AE, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or an important medical event that jeopardized the participant and required medical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed in this definition. A summary of other non-serious AEs and all serious AEs, regardless of causality is located in Reported AE section.</description>

          <title>Complete Clearance Rate - Percentage of Participants With Treatment Success: ITT Population</title>
          <description>Complete clearance rate (treatment success) was defined as the percentage of participants in each treatment group with a count of zero AK lesions in the treatment area at Week 14. All AKs (baseline and new lesions) independent of size within the treatment area were included in the efficacy lesion count. The AK clearance rate for a participant was calculated as follows: {1 - [ (number of AK lesions at Week 14) / (number of AK lesions at Baseline)]} * 100.</description>
          <population>ITT population included all randomized participants who applied at least 1 dose of study drug, and returned for at least 1 post-baseline evaluation.</population>

Serious AEs: death, a life-threatening AE, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or an important medical event that jeopardized the participant and required medical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed in this definition.
