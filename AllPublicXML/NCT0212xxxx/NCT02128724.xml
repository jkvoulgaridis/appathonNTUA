  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test whether a drug called BKM120/buparlisib is a safe and effective
      treatment when given to lung cancer patients having radiotherapy treatment. The trial will
      identify which of three possible doses of buparlisib is best to give with lung radiotherapy.

      This study will be a single-centre, open-label, 3+3 cohort, dose escalation phase I study of
      the use of buparlisib in combination with thoracic radiotherapy. Patients with incurable
      NSCLC requiring palliative thoracic radiotherapy will be eligible for entry.

      The first three cohorts of patients will be treated with escalating doses of BKM120. These
      patients will be treated with buparlisib for a total of fourteen days. One week after
      commencing buparlisib, patients will start palliative radiotherapy treatment. Radiotherapy
      treatment will be delivered as 20Gy in 5 fractions over a one week period. Maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) will be determined and a further 6 patients will be treated at this dose. Response
      to buparlisib treatment will be based upon changes in tumour hypoxia and perfusion as
      detected by 18F-Miso PET-CT scans and perfusion CT scans respectively.

      In the event that no changes are detected in tumour hypoxia or perfusion in cohorts 1-3, an
      optional group of patients (cohort 4) will be recruited. These patients will receive
      buparlisib treatment for a total of 28 days. Three weeks after commencing buparlisib, this
      cohort will receive palliative radiotherapy with 20Gy in 5 fractions over a one week period.

      Samples from the patients will also be analysed:

    <time_frame>8 weeks (10 weeks cohort 4 - this cohort was not opened)</time_frame>
    <description>The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was defined as the highest dose at which no more than 1 of 6 evaluable patients or 0 of 3 evaluable patients experience a dose limiting toxicity (DLT). The study was carried out using a 3+3 dose escalation design.
DLTs were defined per NCI CTCAE v 4.0. The following were considered DLT if they occur at any point whilst the patient is on study: 1) Any ≥ grade 3 non-haematological toxicity (excluding nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea) that requires hospital admission or which does not resolve to ≤ grade 2 within 7 consecutive days of optimal treatment. 2) Any ≥ grade 3 nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea will be considered DLT only if any of them persist for &gt;48 hours despite maximum supportive care. 3) ≥ Grade 3 pneumonitis 4) Any ≥ Grade 4 haematological toxicity. 5) Mood deterioration from baseline. DLT will be any grade ≥3 mood change if BL score of 2. DLT will be any grade ≥2 mood change if baseline score of ≤ 1.</description>

        <title>Dose Escalation Analysis: Number of DLTs Observed in Evaluable Patients</title>
        <description>The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was defined as the highest dose at which no more than 1 of 6 evaluable patients or 0 of 3 evaluable patients experience a dose limiting toxicity (DLT). The study was carried out using a 3+3 dose escalation design.
DLTs were defined per NCI CTCAE v 4.0. The following were considered DLT if they occur at any point whilst the patient is on study: 1) Any ≥ grade 3 non-haematological toxicity (excluding nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea) that requires hospital admission or which does not resolve to ≤ grade 2 within 7 consecutive days of optimal treatment. 2) Any ≥ grade 3 nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea will be considered DLT only if any of them persist for &gt;48 hours despite maximum supportive care. 3) ≥ Grade 3 pneumonitis 4) Any ≥ Grade 4 haematological toxicity. 5) Mood deterioration from baseline. DLT will be any grade ≥3 mood change if BL score of 2. DLT will be any grade ≥2 mood change if baseline score of ≤ 1.</description>

        <description>18F-Miso is a radiotracer that selectively accumulates in hypoxic tissues. 18F-Miso PET-CT scans are able to non-invasively image tumour hypoxia. A 18F-Miso PET-CT scan was conducted prior to commencing buparlisib and repeated prior to commencing radiotherapy treatment to identify changes in tumour hypoxia due to buparlisib treatment. For tumour hypoxia, a patient is classified as a 'responder' if there is evidence of a 10% or greater reduction in retained F-Misonidazole. Hypoxia was measured using TBRmean or TBRvolume (tumour-to-blood ratio).</description>

        <title>Changes in Blood Flow as Detected by Perfusion CT: Response</title>
        <description>Perfusion CT is a technique used to study the vasculature within tumours and other tissues. It is non-invasive and readily incorporated into existing CT protocols using conventional contrast agents. A perfusion CT scan was conducted prior to commencing buparlisib and repeated prior to commencing radiotherapy treatment to identify changes in tumour physiology due to buparlisib treatment. For tumour perfusion, a patient is classified as 'responder' if blood flow (BF) and/or blood volume (BV) is increased and/or mean transit time (MTT) is reduced from baseline measurements by more than 25%.</description>

A 18F-Miso PET-CT scan was conducted prior to commencing buparlisib and repeated prior to commencing radiotherapy treatment to identify changes in tumour hypoxia due to buparlisib treatment.
Hypoxia was measured using TBRmean and TBRvolume (tumour-to-blood ratio mean, tumour-to-blood ratio volume).
TBR mean is measured by dividing all tumour/node/metastases voxels by the mean value of the descending aorta activity concentration.</description>
