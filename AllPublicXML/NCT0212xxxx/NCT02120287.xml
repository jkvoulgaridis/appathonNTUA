  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II study on the usage of stereotactic Gamma Knife radiosurgery as a boost to
      the tumor bed border zone in conjunction with the usage of bevacizumab.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor in adults.
      Unfortunately, despite aggressive surgery, radiation therapy (RT) and chemotherapy, the
      prognosis for this disease is poor. It is our hypothesis that GBM is a &quot;local&quot; disease
      wherein treatment failure is due to failure to eradicate tumor cells in the pathways along
      which the tumor eventually spreads (the &quot;border zone&quot;).

      The investigators hypothesize that treatment volume escalation will be successful at
      improving overall survival in patients with GBM when appropriate targeting and precision dose
      delivery is performed in a single treatment session. The 'border zone' of the tumor will be
      targeted for SRS (defined as a combination of the MRI volume of gadolinium enhancement plus
      up to 2 cm of the surrounding T2 volume). This represents the volume of tumor infiltrated
      white matter and is the route of GBM spread. Bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody to vascular
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF), has been used with safety and clinical success with
      concomitant chemotherapy in solid tumors, including GBM.

      The investigators further hypothesize that a combined approach of SRS with this VEGF
      inhibitor will be an effective strategy for GBM because bevacizumab will maximize the effects
      of radiation in the treated volume and potentially reduce radiation toxicity in the adjacent
      brain.

    <description>The Karnofsky Performance Scale Index allows patients to be classified as to their functional impairment. This can be used to compare effectiveness of different therapies and to assess the prognosis in individual patients. Score range from 0 to 100; the lower the Karnofsky score, the worse the survival for most serious illnesses. A score of 100 would indicate 'Normal no complaints; no evidence of disease.' A score of 50 indicates 'Requires considerable assistance and frequent medical care.' A score of 0-10 would indicate 'Moribund; fatal processes progressing rapidly' and 'Death'.</description>

One to 14 days before BZ- SRS procedure, patients at centers with MRS experience will undergo standard brain MRI /MRS. Patients will have MRS Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS)prior to BZ-SRS. Border Zone Stereotactic Radiosurgery (BZ-SRS): The ‘border zone’ of the tumor will be targeted by SRS in a single session.</description>

This tool represents the generic core questionnaire that are utilized in combination with cancer site-specific questionnaires, (FBrain, in this study) Overall score and four subscale scores with ranges and distributions that are sample-specific can be calculated.FACT-G is scored by summing the individual scale scores; higher scores indicate better quality of life. FACT-G uses 5-point rating scale ranging from (0) = Not at all; (1) = A little bit; (2) = Somewhat; (3) = Quite a bit; to (4) = Very much.The FACT-G total score is the sum of the four subscale scores (if least 80% completed) and has a possible range of 0-108 points.</description>

        <title>Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Brain Specific Symptom Index (FACT-BrSI)</title>
        <description>The FACT-BrSI subscale, brain tumor specific version (2007), is a 15-item, patient completed, questionnaire.This brain subscale is used along with the core (general) questionnaire (FACT-G) that includes 27 items. Patients rate all items using a five-point Likert scale ranging from 0 &quot;not at all&quot; to 4 &quot;very much.&quot; Overall, higher ratings suggest higher quality of life (QOL). The FACT BrSI has a range of 0-60, where a higher score indicates less symptomatology.</description>

One to 14 days before BZ- SRS procedure, patients at centers with MRS experience will undergo standard brain MRI /MRS. Patients will have MRS Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS)prior to BZ-SRS. Border Zone Stereotactic Radiosurgery (BZ-SRS): The ‘border zone’ of the tumor will be targeted by SRS in a single session.</description>
