    <measure>Mean Change in Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) as Measured by Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) Letter Scores From Baseline to Week 52 - Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Visual function of the study eye and fellow eye was assessed at each study visit according to the standard procedure developed for the ETDRS adapted for Age Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS), using 70 letter charts at a starting distance of 4 meters. Participants were challenged with reading letters on lines of an eye chart (5 letters per line). Lines became smaller as participants progressed from the top to the bottom of the chart. Participants read down the chart until they reached a row where a minimum of three letters on a line could be read, and were scored by how many letters could be correctly identified.</description>

    <measure>Change of Leakage Area in Fluorescein Angiography (FA) in the Study Eye at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 52</time_frame>

    <measure>Change of Central Subfield Thickness (CST) on Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) From Baseline to Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Retinal and lesion characteristics, such as central retinal thickness (CRT), were evaluated by OCT in both eyes at every study visit. CRT was measured using optical coherence tomography to determine the average thickness of the retina in a circle with 1 millimeter of diameter centered on the fovea. This value is reported by some OCT devices as central subfield thickness (CST).</description>

    <measure>Change in National Eye Institute 25-item Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI VFQ-25) Total Score From Baseline to Week 52</measure>

    <description>The NEI VFQ-25 total score ranges from 0-100 with a score of 0 being the worst outcome and 100 being the best outcome. The NEI VFQ questionnaire is organized as a collection of subscales which are all scored from 0-100. To reach the overall composite score, each sub-scale score is averaged in order to give each sub-scale equal weight.</description>

          <description>Visual function of the study eye and fellow eye was assessed at each study visit according to the standard procedure developed for the ETDRS adapted for AREDS, using 70 letter charts at a starting distance of 4 meters. Participants were challenged with reading letters on lines of an eye chart (5 letters per line). Lines became smaller as participants progressed from the top to the bottom of the chart. Participants read down the chart until they reached a row where a minimum of three letters on a line could be read, and were scored by how many letters could be correctly identified.</description>

        <description>Visual function of the study eye and fellow eye was assessed at each study visit according to the standard procedure developed for the ETDRS adapted for Age Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS), using 70 letter charts at a starting distance of 4 meters. Participants were challenged with reading letters on lines of an eye chart (5 letters per line). Lines became smaller as participants progressed from the top to the bottom of the chart. Participants read down the chart until they reached a row where a minimum of three letters on a line could be read, and were scored by how many letters could be correctly identified.</description>

Participants read down the chart until they reached a row where a minimum of three letters on a line could be read, and were scored by how many letters could be correctly identified.</description>

          <description>The NEI VFQ-25 total score ranges from 0-100 with a score of 0 being the worst outcome and 100 being the best outcome. The NEI VFQ questionnaire is organized as a collection of subscales which are all scored from 0-100. To reach the overall composite score, each sub-scale score is averaged in order to give each sub-scale equal weight.</description>
