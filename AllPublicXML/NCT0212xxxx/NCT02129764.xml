  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hyperuricemia is a very common finding in patients with heart failure. It is usually related
      to diuretic use and deteriorated renal function. The recently evidence showed that prednisone
      and allopurinol may have similar effect on uric acid (UA) lowering in symptomatic heart
      failure patients with hyperuricemia, but prednisone may be superior over allopurinol in renal
      function improvement. Thus the investigators design this randomized head to head study to
      test their hypothesis that prednisone is superior over allopurinol in renal function
      improvement despite their similar effect on UA lowering in heart failure patients with
      hyperuricemia.

    <textblock>
      Hyperuricemia in heart failure (HF) is linked to renal impairment, hemodynamic compromise,
      and inflammation. Hyperuricemic HF patients are characterized by worsening of renal function
      and fragile volume state, both of which restrict the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
      drugs (NSAIDs) when treating concurrent inflammatory diseases. Recent small studies suggest
      that steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, prednisone, may have renal protective, UA lowering,
      and potentiating diuretic effects in hyperuricemic HF patients. However, general acceptance
      of prednisone as a treatment option for anti-inflammation therapy in patients with
      hyperuricemic HF requires more safety data. We therefore designed a randomized study to
      compare the safety and renal protective effects of short-term use of prednisone with
      allopurinol, a widely used xanthine oxidase inhibitor with a well-established safety profile
      in HF, in hyperuricemic HF patients.
