  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the DREAM study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of
      supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids in relieving the symptoms of moderate to severe dry
      eye disease.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to:

        -  Test the hypothesis that omega-3 supplementation is an effective treatment for Dry Eye
           Disease (DED) in Primary Clinical Trial.

        -  Better understand DED by describing and evaluating a comprehensive set of features of
           DED and treatment over 12 months of observation in a well-characterized group of
           patients.

        -  Determine the effects of extended use and discontinuation of omega-3 through the
           Extension trial.

        <title>Change in Schirmer's Test mm</title>
        <description>The Schirmer's test measures the production of tears by an eye as measured by mm of wetting of a strip of paper attached to the lower lid for 5 minutes. Scores range from 0 to 30 or more mm. Lower scores indicate more severe dry eye. Change is the average change from 6 and 12 months minus average of values from screening and eligibility confirmation visits among eyes that qualified for the study.</description>

        <title>Change in Tear Break up Time by Keratography</title>
        <description>Tear breakup time (TBUT) is used to assess for evaporative dry eye disease. In this measure, TBUT is measured using the keratograph machine. TBUT is recorded as the number of seconds that elapse between the last blink and the appearance of the first dry spot in the tear film. Change is the average of values from 6 and 12 months minus average of values from screening and eligibility confirmation visits.</description>
        <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
        <population>Each eye is measured separately. Total are number of eyes assessed, not subjects. Tear Break up Time by Keratography was only measured at the 13 clinical centers that owned an Oculus Keratograph machine; therefore the number of participants analyzed for this measure is less than the overall number of study participants.</population>

      <time_frame>AE data were collected from the safety visit to 12 months The AE reporting period was the from the screening visit to the end of the study follow-up (12 months). At the last visit, subjects were instructed to report any subsequent event(s) occurring within 30 days that the subject or a physician, believed might reasonably be related to study treatment. Subjects who withdrew early were contacted by the Clinic Coordinator 30 days after their last visit to ascertain whether any AEs occurred.</time_frame>
