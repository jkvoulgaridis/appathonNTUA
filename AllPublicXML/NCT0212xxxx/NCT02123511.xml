  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized pilot clinical trial studies whether acetylcysteine oral rinse will lessen
      saliva thickness and painful mouth sores in patients with head and neck cancer undergoing
      radiation therapy. Side effects from radiation therapy to the head and neck, such as
      thickened saliva and mouth sores, may interfere with activities of daily living such as
      eating and drinking, and may also cause treatment to be stopped or delayed. Acetylcysteine
      rinse may reduce saliva thickness and mouth sores, and improve quality of life in patients
      with head and neck cancer undergoing radiation therapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the effectiveness of N-acetylcysteine (acetylcysteine) in improving saliva
      viscosity (as measured by the Groningen Radiotherapy-Induced Xerostomia [GRIX]) in patients
      undergoing chemotherapy and radiotherapy for head and neck cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether N-acetylcysteine (NAC) can improve other GRIX subscale for patients
      undergoing chemotherapy and radiotherapy for head and neck cancer.

      II. To determine whether NAC can improve patient reported quality of life as measured by the
      European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)-Quality of Life
      Questionnaire (QLQ) Head &amp; Neck (H&amp;N)35.

      III. To assess the adverse event profile of NAC as measured by the Common Terminology
      Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) every week during radiation.

      IV. To determine patient adherence to N-acetylcysteine mucoadherent rinse using patient
      reported surveys.

      V. To determine the long-term benefits of N-acetylcysteine as measured by the GRIX
      questionnaire at 45 days and 90 days post treatment.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive acetylcysteine oral rinse and gargle or swish for 60 seconds then
      spit 5 times per day, beginning within 3 days of the initiation of radiotherapy to 14 days
      following completion of radiotherapy.

      ARM II: Patients receive a placebo oral rinse and gargle or swish for 60 seconds and then
      spit 5 times per day beginning within 3 days of the initiation of radiotherapy to 14 days
      following completion of radiotherapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 45 and 90 days.

    <measure>Groningen Radiotherapy-Induced Xerostomia (GRIX) Sticky Saliva Total Score Area Under the Curve (AUC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 weeks following radiotherapy</time_frame>
    <description>Groningen Radiotherapy-Induced Xerostomia (GRIX) sticky saliva total score Area under the curve (AUC).The GRIX questionnaire is a 14-item questionnaire with four subscales on 0-100 scales with higher scores representing worse symptoms. The aAUCpa for each subscale is calculated as the average of each AUC between each sequential assessment from treatment-initiation to the end of radiotherapy. For example; for each patient and each subscale, the subscale values at treatment-initiation and assessment-1 are used to calculate an Area Under the Curve (AUC) for that assessment time-period. Then these AUCs for all available assessment time-periods up to the end of their radiotherapy are averaged to yield the aAUCpa per patient per subscale. AUC will be calculated for each patient from baseline to two weeks following radiotherapy. The AUC values will be compared between the two arms using t-test (equal variance).</description>

        <description>Groningen Radiotherapy-Induced Xerostomia (GRIX) sticky saliva total score Area under the curve (AUC).The GRIX questionnaire is a 14-item questionnaire with four subscales on 0-100 scales with higher scores representing worse symptoms. The aAUCpa for each subscale is calculated as the average of each AUC between each sequential assessment from treatment-initiation to the end of radiotherapy. For example; for each patient and each subscale, the subscale values at treatment-initiation and assessment-1 are used to calculate an Area Under the Curve (AUC) for that assessment time-period. Then these AUCs for all available assessment time-periods up to the end of their radiotherapy are averaged to yield the aAUCpa per patient per subscale. AUC will be calculated for each patient from baseline to two weeks following radiotherapy. The AUC values will be compared between the two arms using t-test (equal variance).</description>

        <title>Groningen Radiotherapy-Induced Xerostomia (GRIX) Sticky Saliva Nighttime Area Under the Curve (AUC).</title>
        <description>Groningen Radiotherapy-Induced Xerostomia (GRIX) sticky saliva Nighttime Area under the curve (AUC).The GRIX questionnaire is a 14-item questionnaire with four subscales on 0-100 scales with higher scores representing worse symptoms. The aAUCpa for each subscale is calculated as the average of each AUC between each sequential assessment from treatment-initiation to the end of radiotherapy. For example; for each patient and each subscale, the subscale values at treatment-initiation and assessment-1 are used to calculate an Area Under the Curve (AUC) for that assessment time-period. Then these AUCs for all available assessment time-periods up to the end of their radiotherapy are averaged to yield the aAUCpa per patient per subscale. AUC will be calculated for each patient from baseline to two weeks following radiotherapy. The AUC values will be compared between the two arms using t-test (equal variance).</description>

        <title>EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ) Swallowing</title>
        <description>Average Area Under the Curve per assessment (aAUCpa) of QLQ H&amp;N35 subscales including pain, swallowing, teeth, opening mouth, dry mouth, sticky saliva, senses problems, coughing, speech problems, felt ill, trouble with social contact, trouble with social eating, less sexuality, pain killers, nutritional supplements, feeding tube, weight loss, &amp; weight gain. The QLQ H&amp;N35 scoring algorithm was used for swallowing (questions 35-38) on 0-100 scales with higher scores representing worse symptoms. The aAUCpa for each subscale is calculated as the average of each AUC between each sequential assessment from treatment-initiation to the end of radiotherapy. For example; for each patient &amp; subscale, the subscale values at treatment-initiation &amp; assessment-1 are used to calculate an Area Under the Curve (AUC) for that assessment time-period. Then these AUCs for all available assessment time-periods up to the end of their radiotherapy are averaged to yield the aAUCpa per patient per subscale.</description>
