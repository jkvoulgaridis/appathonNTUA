    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 30</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory value), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product. A TEAE is defined as an AE with an onset date on or after the first application of the study drug.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Investigator's Global Assessment of Disease Severity (IGA) Score of 0 (Clear) or 1 (Almost Clear) at Each Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 4, 8, 12, 20, 26 and 30 (Follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>The IGA is a 0 to 4 point scale. Where, 0 = clear (no signs of psoriasis except for residual hypopigmentation/hyperpigmentation); 1 = almost clear (just perceptible erythema, no induration, and no scaling); 2 = mild (mild erythema, no induration, and mild or no scaling); 3 = moderate (moderate erythema, mild induration, and mild or no scaling); 4 = severe (severe erythema, moderate to severe induration, and scaling of any degree).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Pruritus Score at Each Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 4, 8, 12, 20, 26 and 30 (Follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>Pruritus was scored on a 0 to 4 point scale. Where, 0 = none (no-itching); 1 = mild (slight itching, not really bothersome); 2 = moderate (definite itching that is somewhat bothersome without loss of sleep); 3 = severe (intense itching that has caused pronounced discomfort, night rest interrupted); 4 = very severe (very severe itching that has caused pronounced discomfort during the night and daily activities). Positive change from baseline indicate worsening of indication.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Percent (%) Body Surface Area (BSA) at Each Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 4, 8, 12, 20, 26 and 30 (Follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>Percent BSA was calculated by modified rules of nines (pediatric participants). Estimate were made from the following for a child up to the age of one year: head and neck total for front and back - 18%; thorax and abdomen-front -18%; thorax and abdomen-back - 18%; each upper limb total for front and back - 9%; each lower limb total for front and back - 14%. For over the age of one year, the relative percentage of BSA changes as follows: the head decreases by 1% per year and the lower limbs increase by 0.5% per year. By the age of ten years, the relative proportions assume the values for adult BSA as follows: perineum becomes 1%; each lower limb becomes a total of 18% front and back; head and neck become 9% total for front and back.</description>

        <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory value), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product. A TEAE is defined as an AE with an onset date on or after the first application of the study drug.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Percent (%) Body Surface Area (BSA) at Each Visit</title>
        <description>Percent BSA was calculated by modified rules of nines (pediatric participants). Estimate were made from the following for a child up to the age of one year: head and neck total for front and back - 18%; thorax and abdomen-front -18%; thorax and abdomen-back - 18%; each upper limb total for front and back - 9%; each lower limb total for front and back - 14%. For over the age of one year, the relative percentage of BSA changes as follows: the head decreases by 1% per year and the lower limbs increase by 0.5% per year. By the age of ten years, the relative proportions assume the values for adult BSA as follows: perineum becomes 1%; each lower limb becomes a total of 18% front and back; head and neck become 9% total for front and back.</description>
