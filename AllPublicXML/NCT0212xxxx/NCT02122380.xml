  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adults with abdominal obesity are at high risk for cardiovascular disease and also exhibit
      diminished growth hormone (GH) secretion; the latter further contributes to the development
      of visceral adiposity, impaired fibrinolysis and inflammation.Growth hormone releasing
      hormone (GHRH), the primary stimulus for endogenous GH secretion, is a substrate of
      dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4); inhibition of DPP4 with the currently available anti-diabetic
      therapy, sitagliptin, may therefore increase GH secretion by decreasing the degradation of
      GHRH. The proposed research will test the hypothesis that chronic sitagliptin therapy will
      enhance GH secretion and vascular function while improving glucose tolerance in patients with
      impaired GH secretion who are at risk for the development of diabetes mellitus and
      cardiovascular disease, specifically obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thirty-four obese (BMI â‰¥ 30 kg/m2) females (18-40 years old) with polycystic ovarian syndrome
      (PCOS) will participate in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study.
      The use of oral contraceptives or metformin will be discontinued at least 30 days prior. In
      females experiencing monthly cycles, the outpatient visit will take place during the
      mid-luteal phase of the participant's menstrual cycle and the inpatient visit will take place
      during the late follicular phase.

      Subjects will be randomized to treatment order (sitagliptin 100 mg daily vs placebo) using a
      block randomization algorithm with a block size of two. The dose of sitagliptin was chosen as
      it is currently the FDA-recommended dose of sitagliptin for type 2 diabetic patients with
      unimpaired renal function. Subjects will receive standardized dietary counseling throughout
      the study; visits will be standardized to the menstrual cycle when possible. Subjects will
      take each therapy for one month; a minimum one month wash-out will separate study treatments.
      Side effects and compliance with study medication will be assessed at each visit in the
      clinical research center (CRC).

      Each subject will undergo one outpatient visit and one inpatient visit during each treatment.
      On each study day, subjects will report fasting to the CRC in the morning having abstained
      from exercise that morning. On each study day, subjects will receive an intravenous catheter.
      Subjects will undergo an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) during the outpatient study
      visit. During the inpatient study visit, endothelium-dependent and -independent vasodilation
      will be assessed using flow-mediated dilation technique with ultrasound. Standardized meals
      will be provided at lunch and dinner. Body composition will be determined in the afternoon.
      At 8 PM overnight frequent sampling for venous GH will begin every 10 minutes for 12 hours to
      determine overnight GH secretion.

    <time_frame>At completion of 30 days of placebo treatment and at completion of 30 days of sitagliptin treatment; every 10 minutes from 8 PM until 8 AM.</time_frame>
    <description>Growth hormone levels were determined every 10 minutes from 8 PM until 8 AM during the inpatient visit on the last day of each treatment. A mean of the GH levels was calculated for each participant, and then the value from each participant was averaged across all participants.</description>

    <measure>Early Insulin Secretion During Oral Glucose Tolerance Test</measure>
    <time_frame>During Outpatient Visit (after 2 weeks of therapy) during placebo and sitagliptin treatment periods. Insulin levels were obtained at time 0, 15 and 30 minutes following 75 gram glucose ingestion.</time_frame>
    <description>Oral glucose tolerance testing was performed with 75 grams of glucose solution. Baseline venous blood samples of insulin were obtained prior to ingestion of oral glucose solution (time 0). Insulin levels were then obtained through a peripheral IV line every 15 minutes for 270 minutes after glucose solution is swallowed. Early insulin secretion was determined by calculating area under the curve using data (i.e. insulin levels) obtained at baseline (time 0), 15 minutes and 30 minutes.</description>

    <description>Oral glucose tolerance testing was performed with 75 grams of glucose solution. Baseline blood glucose was obtained prior to ingestion of oral glucose solution (time 0). Blood glucose levels were then obtained through a peripheral IV line every 15 minutes from timepoint 0 until 120 minutes to calculate the area under the curve.</description>

    <description>During the inpatient visit of each treatment (placebo and sitagliptin), visceral adipose tissue was determined by a certified densitometrist using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry with enCore software (v. 13.6)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Vascular Function (Endothelium-dependent Vasodilation)</measure>
    <time_frame>Vascular function was determined by measuring brachial artery diameter at rest and during reactive hyperemia and calculating percent change. This was determined after 30 days of placebo treatment and after 30 days of sitagliptin treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>Endothelium-dependent vasodilation was evaluated by measuring the diameter of the brachial artery under basal (i.e. rest) condition and during reactive hyperemia. The percentage change in diameter (i.e. endothelium-dependent vasodilation) was calculated as percent change=[(peak diameter-baseline diameter)/baseline diameter]*100. Endothelium-dependent vasodilation was determined twice during the study: at completion of 30 days of placebo treatment and at completion of 30 days of sitagliptin treatment.</description>

        <title>Early Insulin Secretion During Oral Glucose Tolerance Test</title>
        <description>Oral glucose tolerance testing was performed with 75 grams of glucose solution.

Insulin levels were then obtained through a peripheral IV line every 15 minutes for 270 minutes after glucose solution is swallowed. Early insulin secretion was determined by calculating area under the curve using data (i.e. insulin levels) obtained at baseline (time 0), 15 minutes and 30 minutes.</description>

        <description>Endothelium-dependent vasodilation was evaluated by measuring the diameter of the brachial artery under basal (i.e. rest) condition and during reactive hyperemia. The percentage change in diameter (i.e. endothelium-dependent vasodilation) was calculated as percent change=[(peak diameter-baseline diameter)/baseline diameter]*100. Endothelium-dependent vasodilation was determined twice during the study: at completion of 30 days of placebo treatment and at completion of 30 days of sitagliptin treatment.</description>
