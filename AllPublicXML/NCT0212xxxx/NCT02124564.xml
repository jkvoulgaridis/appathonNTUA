      This study is to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of Lacosamide (LCM) 200
      mg/day to LCM 600 mg/day taken in monotherapy in Japanese subjects who currently have
      partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalization and who are treated with a
      single Anti-Epileptic Drug (AED) with marketing approval in Japan.

    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.</description>

    <description>A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:
Results in death
Is life-threatening
Requires in patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization

    <description>Lacosamide (LCM) immediate-release, film-coated tablets at a strength of 50 mg orally administered twice daily in two equally divided doses.
4-week Titration Period: Starting on LCM 100 mg/day increased by 100 mg/day each week until 400 mg/day dose reached at the beginning of Week 4 .
The AED Withdrawal Period and Monotherapy Period (52- week Evaluation Period plus a Follow Up Period): During the AED Withdrawal and Monotherapy Period, the investigator may increase or decrease the dose of LCM to optimize tolerability and seizure control. The LCM dose may be decreased no lower than 200 mg/day or increased, no faster than 100 mg/day per week, up to 600 mg/day.</description>
