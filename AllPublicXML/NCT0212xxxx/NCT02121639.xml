      The aim of the ProCAID study is to determine if the addition of the AKT inhibitor AZD5363 to
      docetaxel and prednisolone (DP) prolongs progression free survival (PFS) in Metastatic
      castration resistant prostate cancer to a degree worthy of further investigation

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically or cytologically proven mCRPC with documented metastases (measurable or
             evaluable disease is acceptable) now eligible for treatment with docetaxel
             chemotherapy

          2. Disease progression since the last change in therapy defined by one or more of the
             following according to the Prostate Cancer Working Group (PCWG2) criteria (J Clin
             Oncol 2008;26:1148-1159):

             i. PSA progression as defined by the prostate cancer working group (2) (PCWG2)
             criteria (Scher et al. 2008 J Clin Oncol. 26; 1148). This must be based on a series of
             at least 3 readings at least 7 days apart. The 3rd reading must be &gt;= 2ng/ml. In the
             event where an intermediate reading is lower than a previous reading, then the patient
             will still be eligible (ie. the 3 readings do not need to be consecutive). The first
             of the three readings must have been obtained after commencing the previous systemic
             therapy, or, in the case of androgen receptor antagonists, after discontinuing.

             ii. Radiographic progression of nodal or visceral metastases as defined by RECIST
             version 1.1 (Eur J Cancer 2009;45:228). See Appendix 5 iii. The appearance of two or
             more new bony metastases

          3. Serum testosterone &lt;1.7 nmol/L (ongoing LHRH analogue or antagonist therapy is
             permitted to maintain a castrate state)

          4. Discontinuation of prior therapies for prostate cancer ≥ 4 weeks prior to commencing
             study treatment (with the exception of an LHRH agonist or antagonist where required
             for ongoing testosterone suppression)

          5. No current anti-androgen withdrawal response from bicalutamide or flutamide.
             Consistent with PCWG2 guidelines, investigators should evaluate patients to exclude
             withdrawal response for 6 weeks after stopping bicalutamide or flutamide.
             Investigators need not wait to assess for withdrawal response in patients who did not
             respond, or who showed a PSA decline for ≤ 3 months, after bicalutamide or flutamide
             was administered as a second-line or later intervention.

          6. ECOG performance status 0 or 1

          7. Hb ≥ 9g/dL; platelets ≥ 100 x 109/L; neutrophils ≥ 1.5 x109/L

          8. Bilirubin ≤ ULN ; ALT and AST ≤ 1.5 x ULN

          9. Sodium and potassium within the normal range for the site

         10. Able to swallow study drugs (without crushing/opening in the case of AZD5363)

         11. Life expectancy &gt; 3 months

         12. Aged 18 years or over

         13. Provision of written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Previous treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy for castrate resistant prostate cancer.
             Patients may have received previous docetaxel for up to 6 cycles given in the 'hormone
             sensitive setting' or ongoing bisphosphonates or denosumab. There are no restrictions
             on prior use of second generation hormonal therapies e.g. abiraterone, enzalutamide as
             long as they have been discontinued ≥ 2 weeks prior to commencing study treatment.

          2. Prior malignancy with an estimated ≥ 30% chance of relapse within 2 years following
             curative treatment

          3. Previously identified brain metastases, or spinal cord compression unless treated with
             full functional recovery

          4. Prior radiotherapy to &gt; 30% of bone marrow

          5. Administration of an investigational agent within 30 days of first dose of study
             medication

          6. Patients will be excluded with any of:

             i. Diabetes mellitus type I ii. Fasting plasma glucose [fasting is defined as no
             calorific intake for at least 8 hours] of either ≥ 7.0mmol/L (126 mg/dL) for those
             patients without a pre-existing diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes mellitus or ≥ 9.3 mmol/L
             (167mg/dL) for those patients with a pre-existing diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes
             mellitus iii. Glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1C) ≥8.0% (63.9 mmol/mol) iv. Requirement
             for insulin for routine diabetic management and control v. Requirement for more than
             two oral hypoglycaemic medications for routine diabetic management and control.

          7. Malabsorption syndrome, previous gastrointestinal surgery, or other gastrointestinal
             condition that may affect drug absorption

             e.g. by Cockcroft and Gault estimation)

         13. Exposure to potent inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 or substrates of CYP3A4
             within 2 weeks before the first dose of study treatment (3 weeks for St John's Wort)
