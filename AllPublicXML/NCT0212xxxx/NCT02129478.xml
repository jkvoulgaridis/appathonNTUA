  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Olanzapine is licensed for use in adults in Canada and in teens in the US with mental
      illness. It is also often used for the management of mental illness in children. This study
      will describe the feasibility of giving olanzapine plus other usual medications to prevent
      chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) to 15 children aged 4 to 18 years.

      What has been done already? - In adult cancer patients, olanzapine improved the control of
      CINV. None of the adults studied experienced any serious side effects from olanzapine.

      What is being studied and how will the study be conducted? - On each day that chemotherapy is
      given, olanzapine will be given to 15 children along with their regular medications to
      prevent CINV. Investigators will study each child only during one chemotherapy cycle.
      Participants' blood sugar, liver function tests (AST and ALT), prolactin and triglyceride
      levels, blood pressure, weight, mood and behavior during the time they receive olanzapine
      will be evaluated to see if they change. Investigators will record anything serious that
      happens while children receive olanzapine. If any child stops olanzapine early or decides to
      decrease the dose, the reason will be recorded. Each child and their guardian will record
      their nausea severity and the times they vomit or retch on each day they receive chemotherapy
      and for 8 days afterwards.

      How will the study help? - This study will help investigators decide if it is feasible to
      conduct a larger study to find out if olanzapine improves CINV control in children. If most
      children are able to take olanzapine as set out in the study without having significant side
      effects, then a larger study would be feasible.

    <description>Our primary study outcome evaluated the feasibility of a future trial of olanzapine that would evaluate the contribution of olanzapine to chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) control in pediatric oncology patients. A future trial was considered feasible if the following patient outcomes were met: mean time to enroll 15 patients was 12 months or less per site, 12 or more patients took at least half of the planned olanzapine doses, and 3 or less patients experienced significant sedation or dizziness despite dose reduction.</description>

    <description>The proportion of children achieving complete CINV control (no nausea, vomiting, or retching and no use of breakthrough antiemetic agents) during the acute (24 hours after the last dose of chemotherapy is administered) and delayed phases (the 7 days following the acute phase) will be described. The duration of assessment will depend on the number of days each individual patient receives chemotherapy. Nausea will be assessed using the Pediatric Nausea Assessment Tool (PeNAT).</description>
