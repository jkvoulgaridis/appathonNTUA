  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current diagnostic aids used in treating ADHD are currently expensive, time intensive, and
      provide little information about accessory movements in response to a stimulus.

      Tests such as the Conners' Rating Scale require subjective responses from parents and
      teachers, making coordination difficult. The computerized Conners' Continuous Performance
      Test (CPT) provides objective data in regards to inattention and impulsive patterns of
      response. However, it does not provide data regarding accessory movements such as
      restlessness, hyperactivity, and other inappropriate movements. If the subject taking the
      exam has a reading disorder, it will impair his or her ability to respond accurately and it
      will increase response time. The T.O.V.A. is another computer based test used as a diagnostic
      aid for ADHD, which uses a microswitch to record responses. It does utilize auditory and
      visual stimuli, which removes the reading level limitation. However, it is unable to measure
      to measure accessory movements that may be contributing to reaction time and errors of
      omission and commission.

      Because of these limitations, a new company called CogCubed has created a new game based on
      the Sifteo Cube (http://www.sifteo.com) platform. These new hands-on digitized cubes are
      unique, motion-sensitive wireless blocks that contain multiple sensors that can interact with
      one another. CogCubed is providing the data for this study. The game will be played in a 30
      minute sessions by subjects aged 18 and over. Subjects recruited to play the game will be
      those with ADHD and those without, matched by gender. Those with comorbidities of
      developmental delay, mental retardation, psychosis, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and
      substance use disorders will be excluded, as well as any physiological disability that
      affects upper limb movement and/or coordination. Informed consent will be obtained from
      participant prior to administering the game.

      The hypothesis is that by analyzing data generated from this new gaming platform named Sifteo
      for which a game was created, which uses auditory and visual stimuli and distracters, the
      investigators expect that they will be able to provide a more accurate profile of impulsivity
      and inattention. The investigators expect that inattention will have more errors of omission
      and less tilt movements than control and impulsivity will be represented as more commission
      and greater tilting movements than control.

      This trial builds on the previous results of our phase 1 trials in children ages 6-17 used to
      create the predictive algorithms to analyze the data and predict the likelihood of ADHD
      diagnosis based on patterns of game play behavior. Participants in this study will complete
      the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (SADS), the DSM IV Adult ADHD
      Checklist, Hamilton Rating Scal for Depression (HRSD), the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety
      (HAM-A), and complete the Conner's Continuous Performance test (CPT 3).

    <description>Groundskeeper is a game, there are four cubes and a base device, three of the cubes display a background of a grassy field, with occasional stimuli that pop up. The fourth cube displays a mallet. When a gopher is displayed on one of the cubes, the user must hit the gopher with the mallet. Groundskeeper incorrect counts of the number of incorrect responses when a target stimulus is presented. Continuous performance task (CPT), participants are asked to press the spacebar each time a letter appears in the middle of the screen, except when the letter is &quot;X.&quot; If the letter is an &quot;X&quot;, the participant should do nothing. Commission errors were when participant pressed the spacebar when an &quot;X&quot; appeared. Company no longer exists, and no longer has access to data collected.

        <title>Correlation of Groundskeeper Incorrect With CPT Commission Errors</title>
        <description>Groundskeeper is a game, there are four cubes and a base device, three of the cubes display a background of a grassy field, with occasional stimuli that pop up. The fourth cube displays a mallet. When a gopher is displayed on one of the cubes, the user must hit the gopher with the mallet. Groundskeeper incorrect counts of the number of incorrect responses when a target stimulus is presented. Continuous performance task (CPT), participants are asked to press the spacebar each time a letter appears in the middle of the screen, except when the letter is &quot;X.&quot; If the letter is an &quot;X&quot;, the participant should do nothing. Commission errors were when participant pressed the spacebar when an &quot;X&quot; appeared. Company no longer exists, and no longer has access to data collected. Only information from draft publication available.</description>
