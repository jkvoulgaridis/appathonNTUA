    <textblock>
      This study considers the safety and tolerability of increasing doses of CX-4945 in
      combination with gemcitabine plus cisplatin to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and
      the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D), followed by a randomized study that compares antitumor
      activity in cholangiocarcinoma patients receiving the standard of care gemcitabine plus
      cisplatin versus CX-4945 at the combination RP2D with gemcitabine plus cisplatin.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Protein kinase CK2 is a constitutively active serine/threonine kinase with a long history as
      a pro-survival, anti-apoptotic kinase. Given the wide spread overexpression of CK2 in
      multiple cancers and its role in multiple non-oncogenic processes required to sustain the
      cancer phenotype, a selective inhibitor of CK2 is an attractive targeted approach to treating
      cancer.

      CX-4945 is a tetracyclic, small molecule carboxylate acid salt that exhibits potent and
      highly selective inhibition of CK2. Protein kinase CK2 is also known to play an important
      role in the DNA damage repair mechanisms of cancer cells, and this study of CX-4945 in
      combination with gemcitabine plus cisplatin will determine if inhibition of CK2, in
      conjunction with the use of chemotherapy drugs, will result in improved clinical outcomes for
      patients with non-resectable cholangiocarcinoma.

          -  Active symptomatic fungal, bacterial and/or viral infection including active HIV or
             viral (A, B or C) hepatitis which would not permit the patient to be managed according

          -  Difficulty with swallowing or an active malabsorption syndrome.

          -  Chronic diarrhea (excess of 2-3 stools/day above normal frequency).
