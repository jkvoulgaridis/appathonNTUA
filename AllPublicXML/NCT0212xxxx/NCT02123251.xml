  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) study is to examine the extent that
      financial incentives when combined with diabetes evidence-based practices, improve
      self-management and biometric measures for adult diabetic Medicaid recipients with an HbA1c
      of ≥ 6.5 at enrollment. The study will also evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the program.

      Specific Aims:

        1. Evaluate whether financial incentives for completing American Diabetes Association (ADA)
           recommended tests, exams, health education, biometric outcome goals, and vaccinations
           will improve primary biometric outcomes.

        2. Evaluate whether financial incentives for completing ADA recommended tests, exams,
           health education, biometric outcome goals, and vaccinations will improve diabetes
           patients' self-management as assessed by Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities
           Measure (SDSCA) and 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF36v2).

        3. Evaluate the extent to which financial incentives for healthy behaviors reduce the cost
           of health care utilization.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes is the seventh leading cause of death in the United States (OECD 2013). It is also
      known that certain populations are at greater risk for diabetes. In Hawaii, diabetes
      disproportionally affects Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders as they are three times more
      likely to be diagnosed with diabetes. In addition, in 2010 the U.S. Department of Health and
      Human Services Office of Minority Health reported that Native Hawaiians/Pacific Islanders in
      Hawaii were 5.7 times as likely as Caucasians living in Hawaii to die from diabetes(Office of
      Minority Health, 2010).

      In order to address the challenges that chronic diseases impose on individuals and the health
      care system the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) is assessing the impact of
      incentivizing patients to increase self-care and disease management. Previous studies have
      demonstrated that monetary incentives have been associated with an improvement in behavioral
      outcomes, most notably when the incentive is received immediately following the targeted
      behavior (Volpp, K.G., et.al., 2008; Mitchell, M.S., et.al., 2013). Cahill et al. (2008)
      showed that economic incentives were tied to smoking cessation and led to a decrease in
      relapse within a year. Our study seeks to build on these findings and determine whether
      financial incentives may provide a way to improve diabetes self-management.

    <description>SDSCA is a validated, self-reported measure assessing the average # of days the recommended diabetes self-care activities are performed over the past 7 days in the areas of general diet, specific diet, exercise, blood-glucose testing, and foot care at baseline, mid, and end of intervention.

    <description>The SF-36v2 is validated, self reported short-form health survey used to assess changes over time in the well-being of participants. It consists of 2 component summary measures that further summarize 8 health domain scales. The Physical Component Summary (PCS) measure is derived from domain scales of Physical Functioning (10 items), Role-Physical (4 items), Bodily Pain (2 items), and General Health (5 items). Scores of component summary measures and health domain scales range from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating better outcomes. Norm-based scoring was used so that scores for each health domain scale and component summary measure have a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10 based on the 2009 U.S. general population. The SF-36v2 was used to assess participants' health and wellbeing at baseline, mid, and endpoint of intervention. Change = (Midpoint Score - Baseline Score)</description>

Financial Incentives: This intervention will examine the effects of incentives on improving adult diabetic Medicaid beneficiaries' health outcomes and reducing associated costs through healthy behavior changes in their diabetes self-management. Incentives focus on improving self-management of diabetes, compliance with ADA recommended preventive, treatment and management measures, primary biometric measures of diabetes, and eliminating barriers to a healthy lifestyle.</description>

        <description>The SF-36v2 is validated, self reported short-form health survey used to assess changes over time in the well-being of participants. It consists of 2 component summary measures that further summarize 8 health domain scales. The Physical Component Summary (PCS) measure is derived from domain scales of Physical Functioning (10 items), Role-Physical (4 items), Bodily Pain (2 items), and General Health (5 items). Scores of component summary measures and health domain scales range from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating better outcomes. Norm-based scoring was used so that scores for each health domain scale and component summary measure have a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10 based on the 2009 U.S. general population. The SF-36v2 was used to assess participants' health and wellbeing at baseline, mid, and endpoint of intervention. Change = (Midpoint Score - Baseline Score)</description>

      <desc>The consent form detailed that participants were at no more risk than that related to standard of care. Should an adverse event have occurred due to standard of care, service providers were responsible and did not communicate any adverse events. Incentives through HI-PRAISE were based on ADA standards of care and did not increase risk. No Adverse Events were reported.</desc>

          <description>Participants (159) in the Incentive Group will: 1) continue to receive usual care; 2) are eligible to receive financial incentives based on completion of recommended ADA benchmarks and achievement of goals that are founded on evidence based guidelines for diabetes; and 3) be compensated for completion of surveys.
Financial Incentives: This intervention will examine the effects of incentives on improving adult diabetic Medicaid beneficiaries' health outcomes and reducing associated costs through healthy behavior changes in their diabetes self-management. Incentives focus on improving self-management of diabetes, compliance with ADA recommended preventive, treatment and management measures, primary biometric measures of diabetes, and eliminating barriers to a healthy lifestyle.</description>

      <restrictive_agreement>The only disclosure restriction on the PI is that the sponsor can review results communications prior to public release and can embargo communications regarding trial results for a period that is more than 60 days but less than or equal to 180 days. The sponsor cannot require changes to the communication and cannot extend the embargo.</restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>Loss of Medicaid status led to reduced # of data points analyzed. Unequally spaced intervention period across subjects increased the variability of outcomes. Usual care setting with providers ordering lab tests led to high # of missing test results.</limitations_and_caveats>
