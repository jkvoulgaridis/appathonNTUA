  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A single subanesthetic dose infusion of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist
      ketamine has rapid and robust antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-refractory
      major depressive disorder (TRD). A family history of an alcohol use disorder (Family History
      Positive, FHP) is one of the strongest identified predictors of an improved antidepressant
      response to ketamine. Like ketamine, alcohol is a functional NMDA receptor antagonist. FHP is
      associated with differential response to both alcohol, e.g. decreased body sway and plasma
      cortisol, and ketamine, e.g. blunted psychotomimetic side effects. One of the primary
      mechanistic hypotheses for ketamine's antidepressant action is the acute intrasynaptic
      release of glutamate from major output neurons, e.g. cortical pyramidal cells. Preliminary
      clinical studies have demonstrated this acute glutamate &quot;surge&quot; in response to subanesthetic
      dose ketamine. Based on these findings, the investigators hypothesize that ketamine's
      enhanced antidepressant efficacy in FHP TRD subjects is, at least in part, attributable to
      increased glutamate release relative to TRD subjects without a family history of alcohol use
      disorder (Family History Negative, FHN). The investigators also hypothesize that alcohol
      similarly augments glutamate release in this bio- logically-enriched subgroup, which may be a
      more objective biomarker than family history status. To test these hypotheses, the
      investigators have designed a now two-site, open-label study of 21-65 year old medically and
      neurologically healthy, currently moderately-to-severely depressed TRD patients. In total,
      the investigators plan to recruit 25 FHP and 25 FHN TRD subjects. All subjects must not have
      a lifetime substance use disorder (except nicotine or caffeine), no lifetime history of an
      alcohol use disorder and socially drink. The experimental portion consists of two phases. The
      preliminary first phase is a medication taper (if needed) and psychotropic medication-free
      period. The experimental second phase comprises two pharmacokinetically-defined basal-bolus
      alcohol and one subanesthetic dose (0.5mg/kg x 40 minute) ketamine infusions. The first
      alcohol infusion will establish the pharmacokinetic profile for a subsequent alcohol infusion
      occurring during 7T-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), both resting-state functional MRI
      (rs-fMRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to detect glutamate in the ventromedial
      prefrontal cortex/ventral anterior cingulate cortex (vmPFC/vACC). The ketamine infusion will
      also occur during 7T-MRI. The primary outcome measure is group mean change in
      Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score from pre-ketamine infusion (baseline)
      to one week post-infusion, where the investigators observed ketamine's greatest
      antidepressant effect in FHP TRD. Additional outcome measures are vmPFC/vACC glutamate change
      in response to ketamine and alcohol challenge based on family history status. In summary,
      this study will provide key mechanistic information on ketamine's improved antidepressant
      efficacy in a biologically-enriched subgroup. This will contribute to the systematic
      development of more efficacious, personalized treatments for major depression in an effort to
      reduce its enormous public health burden.

  <detailed_description>

      Objective:

      Glutamate-based medications including the glutamate modulator ketamine result in rapid,
      robust and sustained (typically up to one week) antidepressant effects in randomized
      controlled trials in treatment-refractory unipolar and bipolar depression. Previous work by
      the investigators' group has demonstrated that a family history of alcohol dependence
      predicts a more robust antidepressant response to ketamine in both treatment-resistant
      unipolar and bipolar depression.

      Recently-detoxified alcoholics and affected first-degree relatives display blunted
      psychotomimetic, cognitive and other neuropsychiatric effects when administered a
      subanesthetic dose of ketamine. A family history of alcoholism also predicts differential
      response to intravenous alcohol. Based on the prior post hoc results, the investigators seek
      to prospectively demonstrate that a family history of an alcohol use disorder predicts a more
      robust antidepressant response to ketamine. The research team will also explore potential
      biomarkers of ketamine's antidepressant effects in treatment-refractory depressed patients at
      greater risk of developing an alcohol use disorder, using physiological and neurochemical
      responses to alcohol.

      Study Population:

      21-65 year old TRD without psychotic features patients in a current major depressive episode
      of at least moderate severity will be recruited and enrolled in this study. All subjects must
      not have a lifetime substance use disorder (except nicotine or caffeine), no lifetime history
      of an alcohol use disorder and socially drink. All subjects must be psychotropic
      medication-free for at least two weeks prior to the first alcohol infusion. The targeted
      number of completers is 50 depressed subjects (60 signing consent to account for attrition):
      25 FHP subjects [as defined by either one first degree relative or two second-degree
      relatives with an alcohol user disorder on the Family Interview for Genetics Studies (FIGS)
      and Family Tree Questionnaire (FTQ)] and 25 FHN negative subjects.

      Design:

      This study is a now two-site, open-label protocol in psychotropic medication-free depressed
      subjects. This protocol consists of two phases. Phase I consists of a medication taper (if
      needed) and at least two week drug-free period. Phase II has three subphases: Subphase IIA
      (alcohol clamp infusion #1 with neurophysiological assessments), Subphase IIB (alcohol clamp
      infusion #2 during 7T-MRI) and Subphase IIC (subanesthetic/antidepressant dose ketamine
      infusion during 7T-MRI).

      Outcome Measures:

      The primary hypothesis/outcome measure will be mean change in MADRS total score from the
      pre-ketamine infusion (baseline) to 7 days post-infusion between the FHP and FHN groups.
      Other exploratory measures include neurophysiological responses to intravenous alcohol,
      glutamate) alterations during intravenous alcohol infusion and ketamine infusions, and
      rs-fMRI as a function of family history status.

    <description>BART is a computer-based task that measures behavioral disinhibition and risk-taking. Subjects will click a mouse to pump up a virtual balloon on the computer screen. The bigger the subject pumps up the balloon, the more points he or she could win; however, if the balloon pops before the subject stops pumping the balloon and collects his or her winnings, they will lose the virtual money earned. There are 20 trials in each task run. A greater number of pumps indicates increased behavioral disinhibition. Greater pumps during the alcohol clamp in comparison to before alcohol infusion indicates increasing disinhibition in response to alcohol.</description>

Increased incidence of selecting the riskier reward at baseline indicates greater impulsivity. Greater selection of riskier rewards during the alcohol clamp in comparison to baseline indicates increasing disinhibition in response to alcohol.</description>
