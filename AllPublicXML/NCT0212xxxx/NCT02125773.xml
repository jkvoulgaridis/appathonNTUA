  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a controlled, un-blinded, two-arm, randomized (1:1) clinical trial to determine
      if providing high-risk subjects with a calculated risk score changes the likelihood of
      pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) uptake.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All men who have sex with men (MSM) and male-to-female transgender individuals who have sex
      with men who present to TNC for HIV testing and are at risk for HIV will be offered
      enrollment in this study (see study schema). Upon enrollment, subjects will be given an
      Ipad-based computerized questionnaire that assesses their risk perception, demographics, risk
      behavior, and perception of whether they are a candidate for PrEP. Upon completion of the
      survey they will be randomized into 1 of 2 arms. Subjects in the intervention arm will
      receive the results of their risk score based on a risk calculator developed at UCSD and the
      Center for Disease Control and Prevention's tool for Assessing Risk for Contracting HIV
      (ARCH, formerly known as the HIV Incidence Risk Index for MSM, or HIRI-MSM), whereas subjects
      in the control arm will not receive this information. Both groups will receive standard risk
      reduction counseling. Subjects will be contacted by phone 2 months after enrollment to
      determine whether they initiated PrEP or not, to re-assess their risk perception, and to
      provide a link to a final online survey. If subjects have not completed the survey 4 weeks
      after being provided with the link, they will receive a text-message reminder.

      The analysis of the data will begin 12 weeks after the last study subject is enrolled.

    <description>Subjects in the intervention arm will receive an estimate of their risk of HIV infection as estimated by the UCSD calculator. The risk of HIV infection will be based on the subject's responses to the self-reported sexual risk questionnaire and the risk of HIV infection in one year will be extrapolated based on continuation of the same risk behavior. The subjects will also be provided the calculated risk if they were to take PrEP. Subjects in the control arm will not be provided with the results of the risk calculators. Both arms will receive standard of care risk reduction education and information sheets about PrEP.</description>
