      Recent reports suggest that it might be possible to induce a state of tolerance in solid
      organ transplantation. So called &quot;tolerogenic immunosuppression&quot; involves induction with
      lymphocyte depleting antibodies followed by monotherapy with calcineurin inhibitors,
      cyclosporin or tacrolimus. The proposed study aims to evaluate a protocol of
      immunosuppression induction with lymphocyte depleting antibody Campath given prior to graft
      reperfusion, followed by tacrolimus monotherapy in highly sensitized patients (PRA &gt;14% or
      past historical =/&gt;50% and/or multiple renal transplants) undergoing renal transplantation,
      and compare it with the current standard protocol at UTMB which employs induction with
      Thymoglobulin given over 4 days followed by 3 drugs: tacrolimus, mycophenolate and steroids.
      In both groups of patients the target tacrolimus levels will be the same i.e, between 10 to
      15ng/mL, soon after the transplant. In the Campath gro up, tacrolimus will be tapered after 3
      months in patients who do not have rejection and appear to be developing donor specific
      tolerance.

    <description>Anti-thymocyte Globulin (Rabbit)] ,tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil and prednisone
Patients with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) and high Panel Reactive Antibody (PRA) who randomize to the control group. These patients will get induction therapy prior to transplant with Thymoglobulin 1.5 mg/kg/day for 4 days to a total dose of 6mg/kg.
They will receive maintenance immunosuppression with three drugs : tacrolimus, cellcept and prednisone.</description>

Patients with ESRD and high PRA who randomize to the study group. These patients will get induction therapy prior to reperfusion of the kidney, during the transplant operation, with Campath (Alemtuzumab) 30mg, one dose. They will receive maintenance immunosuppression with tacrolimus alone (monotherapy).</description>
