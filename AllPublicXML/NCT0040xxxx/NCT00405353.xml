      Since men are less likely to develop multiple sclerosis, the hypothesis was that testosterone
      might be protective in MS. Men with MS for followed untreated for 6 months, followed by a 12
      month treatment period with Androgel.

      Background: Men are less susceptible to many autoimmune diseases including multiple sclerosis
      (MS). Possible causes for this include sex hormones and/or sex chromosome effects.
      Testosterone treatment ameliorates experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal
      model of MS, but the effect of testosterone supplementation on men with MS is not known.

      Design, Setting and Participants: Ten men with relapsing remitting MS were studied using a
      crossover design whereby each patient served as his own control. There was a six-month
      pretreatment period followed by a twelve month period of daily treatment with 100mg of
      testosterone gel.

      Main Outcome Measures: Brain atrophy and Cognitive testing

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Men, age 18-65, with a diagnosis of clinically definite relapsing remitting multiple
             sclerosis.

          2. Relapsing remitting patients who have declined or not tolerated treatment with beta
             interferon (Betaseron, Avonex) or glatiramer acetate, copolymer-1 (Copaxone).

          3. At least one relapse in the two years prior to entry. Relapse will be defined
             historically as definite worsening of a previous symptom (over 0-3 days) or
             development of a new symptom (over 0-3 days).

This model fitted line pieces for pre-treatment and early treatment periods (month -6 to month 3) and treatment response period (months 3-12), and these pieces were joined together to achieve continuity.
