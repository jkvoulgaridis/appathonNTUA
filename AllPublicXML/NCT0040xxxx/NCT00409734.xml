  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if there is an increase in the frequency of formula
      change in patients with pyloric sctenosis prior to being correctly diagnosed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study can be described as a prospective and retrospective study in which information will
      be gathered from questionnaires, analysis of medical records, and the information obtained
      from diagnostic procedures (i.e. Laboratory results, ultrasonography). The time of enrollment
      will be at the time of hospital admission for the study group and the control group. The
      length of time for which the patient will be involved with the study will coincide with the
      length of stay in the hospital. This will be a single center trial involving Maimonides
      Medical center. Approximately 50-100 subjects will be enrolled overall to give the study more
      credibility.

      Methods and Procedures:

      1. Study Participants: All patients admitted to Maimonides Medical Center with a diagnosis of
      pyloric stenosis two to nine weeks of age. Patients will be excluded from the study if there
      is a diagnosed milk allergy, history of prior abdominal surgery, or history of prematurity or
      metabolic disease. Controls will be made up of the same age range, with similar exclusion
      criteria, and will consist of patients admitted for other reasons than listed above, such as
      bronchiolitis and rule out sepsis.

      2: Data: Data will be received through the completion of questionnaire.

      3. Data collection and processing: Questionnaire responses will be analyzed and the responses
      will be statistically analyzed for correlation.

      Benefits: Through participation in this study, patients may help future patients diagnosed
      with pyloric stenosis be brought to the attention of a medical professional.

      Risks: With maintenance of confidentiality, risks to participants in this study are
      negligible.
