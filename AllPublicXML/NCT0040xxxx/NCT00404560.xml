    <textblock>
      This screening study will examine the causes of immune disorders affecting white blood cells,
      which defend against infections and will try to develop better means of diagnosis and
      treatment of these immune disorders. This is a 2 visit screening study and patients
      determined to be of interest for additional study or treatment will be asked to provide
      consent for enrollment into an appropriate NIH follow up study. This study does not cover the
      cost of the first visit to NIH for travel or lodgings but does cover the subsequent visit if
      there is one. A financial assessment may determine if the patient is eligible for financial
      assistance. This study does not enroll children under the age of 2.

      Patients known to have or suspected of having increased susceptibility to infections and
      their blood relatives may be eligible for this study, at the discretion of the principal
      investigator. Patients and family members may undergo the following procedures:

        -  Personal and family medical history.

        -  Physical examination and blood and urine tests.

        -  Studies of breathing function (pulmonary function testing)

        -  Dental examination.

        -  Eye examination.

        -  Genetic Testing

        -  Stored specimens for future analysis

        -  Microscopic examination of saliva, wound drainage or tissues removed for medical reasons
           for cell, hormone or DNA studies.

      In addition, patients will be asked to obtain permission for investigators to obtain their
      medical records, previous test results, or radiographic studies prior to the first visit.
      Patients will be asked to undergo imaging studies, such as a chest X-ray, CT scan or MRI
      scan.

      This screening study is designed to evaluate patients with suspected or identified recurrent
      or unusual infections and their family members for clinical and in vitro correlates of
      exposure and susceptibility. It will allow for up to 2 visits to obtain blood, urine, saliva,
      stool, skin biopsy, or wound drainage from such patients or their family members for research
      studies related to understanding the nature of the infection as well as the genetic and
      biochemical bases of these diseases. Patients determined by initial evaluation to be of
      interest for additional study or treatment will be asked to provide consent for enrollment
      into an appropriate NIH follow-up study. The present study will enroll up to 2000 patients
      and family members over the next 25 years.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        PATIENTS:

          1. Patients known to have, or suspected of having an infection susceptibility will be
             eligible for enrollment.

          2. Patients with known or suspected infections will also be eligible in order to identify
             the microbiologic cause of the infection, identify the extent of infection, or
             determine the proper course of treatment. There will be no limit as to age, sex, race
             or disability.

          3. Patients must have a primary physician outside of the NIH and may be required to
             submit a letter from their physician that documents their relevant health history.

          4. The patient or the patient's guardian will be willing and capable of providing
             informed consent after initial counseling by clinical staff. Separate consent forms
             for all interventional procedures will be obtained after explanation of the specific
             procedure.

          5. Women of childbearing potential, or who are pregnant or lactating, may be eligible.
             Interventions in pregnant or lactating women will minimize as much as possible risks
             to the fetus/infant but will follow state of art evaluation and therapy. Should a
             woman become pregnant or suspect she may be pregnant while participating in this
             study, she should inform the study staff and her primary care physician immediately.

          6. Patients must agree to have blood and tissue stored for future studies of the immune
             system and/or other medical conditions.

          7. Patients may be concurrently enrolled on other protocols as long as the Principal
             Investigator is informed.

        HEALTHY BLOOD RELATIVES OF PATIENTS:

          1. Healthy blood relatives of patients known to have or suspected of having an infection
             susceptibility will be eligible for enrollment only if they have a sick relative who
             is enrolled on this protocol as a patient.

          2. There will be no limit as age, sex, race or disability.

          3. Relatives or the minor relative's guardian must be willing and capable of providing
             informed consent after initial counseling by clinical staff.

          4. Participating relatives agree to have blood stored for future studies of the immune
             system and/or other medical conditions.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. A well understood acquired abnormality which leads to infection susceptibility, such
             as HIV, cytotoxic chemotherapy, or active malignancy may be adequate explanation for
             the infection diathesis. These may be grounds for exclusion if, in the opinion of the
             investigators, the presence of such disease process interferes significantly with
             evaluation (applicable to patients and their blood relatives).

          2. Severe or uncommon infections or syndromes often require highly specialized teams and
             institutions. Some referred cases will not be able to be handled appropriately at the
             NIH and may be deemed ineligible for admission, as determined by the Principal
             Investigator.
