  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized open label, multi-centre study for Korean women with postmenopausal
      osteoporosis, evaluating the preference for either the once-monthly dosing of ibandronate or
      the once-weekly dosing of risedronate.

      Eligible subjects will be randomised either ibandronate monthly regimen or risedronate weekly
      regimen.

      Treatment period consists of 3 month with ibandronate 150mg and additional 12 week with
      risedronate 35 mg or vice versa.

      After taking the first interventional medicine for 3 months or 12 weeks completely, a subject
      changes the treatment arm. There is no washout period.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Prefer the Once-monthly Dosing of Ibandronate to the Once-weekly Dosing of Risedronate</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 4 (Week 24)</time_frame>
    <description>Preference of monthly ibandronate and weekly risedronate was compared. Modified-intention-to-treat (mITT) population was used for analysis. Any participant randomly assigned, received the study drug, and participants were asked to fill the preference questionnaire on completion of study. Preference was calculated as percentage. Data for percentage of participants with preference to once-monthly dosing of ibandronate to the once-weekly dosing of risedronate was presented.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Choosing Ibandronate or Risedronate as Their Preferred Treatment Based on Convenience of Administration</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 4 (Week 24)</time_frame>
    <description>Participant's preference for convenient treatment was compared between monthly ibandronate and weekly risedronate. Analysis population was mITT. Preference for convenient treatment was calculated as percentage. Percentage of participants who think once-monthly ibandronate dosing is more convenient over once-weekly risedronate dosing were presented. Those participants who answered the two treatments equally convenient were excluded while reporting.</description>

    <measure>Mean Percent Change of Serum C-terminal Telopeptide (CTx) From Baseline to Visit 3 for Once-monthly Dosing of Ibandronate &amp; Once-weekly Dosing of Risedronate</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0) and Visit 3 (Week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>The difference of change in serum CTX from basal value between the two sequences was tested using ANCOVA at 95% confidence interval at 3 months (Visit 3) after the administration. Analysis was done with PP population. Baseline was value at Week 0, Change from baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline value from value at specified time point.</description>

          <description>Preference of monthly ibandronate and weekly risedronate was compared. Modified-intention-to-treat (mITT) population was used for analysis. Any participant randomly assigned, received the study drug, and participants were asked to fill the preference questionnaire on completion of study. Preference was calculated as percentage. Data for percentage of participants with preference to once-monthly dosing of ibandronate to the once-weekly dosing of risedronate was presented.</description>
          <population>mITT population was comprised of any participant, who was randomly assigned, received the study drug once more at each phase, filled out the preference questionnaire at the completion of the study. Percentages do not sum to 100 because some participants did not express a preference.</population>

        <description>Participant's preference for convenient treatment was compared between monthly ibandronate and weekly risedronate. Analysis population was mITT. Preference for convenient treatment was calculated as percentage. Percentage of participants who think once-monthly ibandronate dosing is more convenient over once-weekly risedronate dosing were presented. Those participants who answered the two treatments equally convenient were excluded while reporting.</description>
