  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary objective:

      To demonstrate that two doses of ProQuad® administered by IM route are as immunogenic as two
      doses of ProQuad® administered by SC route to healthy children 12 to 18 months of age in
      terms of antibody response rates to measles, mumps, rubella and to varicella at 42 days
      following the second dose of ProQuad®

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To describe the antibody response rates to measles, mumps, rubella and varicella
           measured 30 days following the first dose of ProQuad® administered by IM or SC route,

        -  To describe the antibody titres to measles, mumps, rubella and varicella at 30 days
           following the first dose and at 42 days following the second dose of ProQuad® both
           administered by IM or SC route,

        -  To describe the safety profile of two doses of ProQuad® both administered by IM or SC
           route.

    <description>Antibody response rates were determined 6 weeks after the second dose of IM or SC ProQuad®. Measles, mumps and rubella antibody levels were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and varicella antibody levels were determined with glycoprotein-based ELISA (gpELISA). Response rates were determined as follows: measles antibody titre ≥255 mIU/mL in participants with baseline titre &lt;255 mIU/mL; mumps antibody titre ≥10 ELISA Ab units/mL in participants with baseline titre &lt;10 ELISA Ab units mL; rubella antibody titre ≥10 IU/mL in participants with baseline titre &lt;10 IU/mL; varicella antibody titre ≥5 gpELISA units/mL in participants with baseline titre &lt;1.25 gpELISA units/mL.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Meeting Antibody Response Rate Criteria Six Weeks After Completing ProQuad® Treatment</title>
        <description>Antibody response rates were determined 6 weeks after the second dose of IM or SC ProQuad®. Measles, mumps and rubella antibody levels were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and varicella antibody levels were determined with glycoprotein-based ELISA (gpELISA). Response rates were determined as follows: measles antibody titre ≥255 mIU/mL in participants with baseline titre &lt;255 mIU/mL; mumps antibody titre ≥10 ELISA Ab units/mL in participants with baseline titre &lt;10 ELISA Ab units mL; rubella antibody titre ≥10 IU/mL in participants with baseline titre &lt;10 IU/mL; varicella antibody titre ≥5 gpELISA units/mL in participants with baseline titre &lt;1.25 gpELISA units/mL.</description>
