      This study is investigating the way the lung is damaged in a condition called pulmonary
      fibrosis. Research studies will be conducted on lung tissue obtained from an open lung biopsy
      performed by the subject's surgeon. The identification of unique genetic markers of scarred
      lung may ultimately lead to new approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary
      fibrosis.

    <textblock>
      Subjects are being asked to participate in a research study that is investigating the way the
      lung is damaged in a condition called pulmonary fibrosis. These research studies are
      conducted in the laboratory on a portion of the tissue from the subject's lung biopsy that
      was performed by a surgeon. The lung biopsy is to be performed for clinical purposes to
      diagnose the cause of the subject's lung disease. The tissue used for the research study will
      in no way interfere with the ability of the pathologist to establish a diagnosis. In
      addition, the results of your breathing tests, chest X-rays and CT scans, and diagnosis made
      from the lung biopsy (and slides) will be collected. The goal of the study is to gain an
      understanding of the causes of pulmonary fibrosis and why it gets worse, which may ultimately
      lead to new therapies for this disease. Once the lung biopsies are obtained, the pathologist
      will examine the tissue and determine if there is a sufficient amount available to use in the
      study without compromising their ability to make a diagnosis. If so, the lung biopsy will be
      divided. One portion will be submitted to the research study and the other processed by the
      pathologist in the usual manner to make a diagnosis. The decision to use tissue for the
      research study will be at the complete discretion of the pathologists. The tissue used in the
      study will be further processed in the laboratory in order to analyze for the presence of
      genetic markers in the scarred tissue that are not present in normal. The identification of
      these unique genetic markers of scarred lung may ultimately lead to new approaches to the
      diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary fibrosis.
