    <measure>Number of Participants With Any Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious AEs (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 56</time_frame>
    <description>AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. SAE include adverse events that result in any of the following outcomes: death, a life-threatening adverse event, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.</description>

SAE include adverse events that result in any of the following outcomes: death, a life-threatening adverse event, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.</description>

        <description>On each assessment day at Week 24 and 52, adrenal cortical function tests were performed between 8:00-10:00 in the morning. Additional measurements were taken at follow up visit, if the measurements made at Week 52 revealed any abnormalities of clinical significance. Blood samples were taken from participants at rest before undergoing spirometry. Baseline value was the measurement taken at the start of run-in or the treatment period. Change from Baseline was any post Baseline value minus value at Baseline.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Forced Vital Capacity (FVC)</title>
        <description>FVC was the amount of air which can be forcibly exhaled from the lungs after taking the deepest breath possible measured using spirometer. A participant took rest just before the measurement. At each time of measurement, a participant expired for at least 6 seconds wherever possible. At each time of measurement, at least 3 readings were obtained, and three readings which were obtained in an appropriate manner were stored. Baseline value was the value measured at visit 2. However, when the value at Visit 2 was missing, the value at Visit 1 was used as Baseline. Change from Baseline was any post Baseline value minus Baseline value.</description>

        <description>V25 and V 50 were measured using spirometer. A participant took rest just before the measurement. At each time of measurement, a participant expired for at least 6 seconds wherever possible. At each time of measurement, at least 3 readings were obtained, and three readings which were obtained in an appropriate manner were stored. Baseline value was the value measured at visit 2. However, when the value at Visit 2 was missing, the value at Visit 1 was used as baseline. Change from Baseline was any post Baseline value minus Baseline value.</description>

        <description>Rescue medication (salbutamol sulfate aerosol provided as an investigational product) was issued to a participant and, when necessary, a spacer at the start of the run-in period.

Baseline was mean value of the consecutive 7 days just before Visit 2. Change from Baseline was any post Baseline value minus Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Median Time of Observed Maximum Plasma Concentration (Tmax) of FP</title>
        <description>For analysis of PK parameters for FP, blood samples were taken just before dosing (within one hour prior to dosing), 30, 45 minutes, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 12 hours after dosing to determine plasma drug concentrations. The investigational product was taken in fasting condition just before each blood sampling. Parameters were calculated by a model-independent method with the plasma concentration-time profile data in individual participants.</description>
