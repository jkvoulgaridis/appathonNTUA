    <textblock>
      To assess short and long term outcomes after minimally invasive esophagectomy compared to
      open esophagectomy. To compare both standard outcome measures as well as patient derived
      outcome measures, in particular, quality of life (QOL). To look at the applicability of this
      QOL instrument to this patient group.

      Assess short and long term outcomes after minimally invasive esophagectomy(MIE) compared to
      open esophagectomy. Measure standard observer derived outcomes such as morbidity, mortality,
      tumor recurrence and also patient derived outcomes, in particular quality of life (QOL) using
      the MOS SF36 questionnaire. Evaluate whether the SF36 will accurately reflect pre and
      postoperative changes in clinical status in this patient group.Compare the results of this
      global QOL instrument (SF 36) to disease specific scales of dysphagia and reflux. Assess the
      impact of adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy on QOL in this patient group and determine if any
      advantages of MIE can be demonstrated.

    <measure>Change from baseline in SF36 Quality of Life Questionnaire at 4 month postoperative</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 4 month postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>The SF36 is an eight dimension Quality of Life Measurement. It provides two main Component scores, Physical Component Summary (PCS) and the Mental Component Summary (MCS). It includes 8 scales or sub-scores: Physical function (PF), role physical (RP), Bodily pain (BP), general health (GH), vitality (VT), social functioning (SF), role emotional (RE), and mental health (MG). Each scale contributes a different amount to the component scores, which are calculated by a special algorithm that is licensed by Optum. The Component and sub-scales have a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 100. The higher the score represent the higher quality of life/less disability.</description>
