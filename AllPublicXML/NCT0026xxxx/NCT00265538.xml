      This study examines the use of patient initiated discussions of blood pressure medication in
      the primary care setting. Additionally, this study examines different levels of patient
      incentive(s) to initiate discussions with providers including information only, information
      plus a financial incentive and reimbursement for 6 months of copay, and information/monetary
      incentive plus a reminder call prior to the index visit. Patient opinions about
      doctor/patient relationships will be assessed. Provider attitudes and prescribing behaviors
      will be analyzed as well.

      Patients will be randomized to Pure control, intervention control, intervention group a,
      intervention group b or intervention group c. Pure control patients will not receive any
      study information about diuretics and their providers will not see any patients who receive
      our study intervention letter. Patients in the intervention control group will not receive
      the intervention but will see providers who have other patients in the intervention groups.
      Patients in intervention group a will receive a customized letter prior to their next primary
      care appointment with information regarding the patient's specific blood pressure, current
      blood pressure medication and recommendation for switching or adding a thiazide. Patients in
      group b will receive the customized intervention letter as well as a financial incentive for
      discussing the information with their provider and a copay reimbursement for 6 months if a
      prescription is written for a thiazide. Patients in group c will receive the intervention
      letter, financial discussion incentive, copay reimbursement as well as a phone call reminder
      1-2 days prior to their primary care visit.
