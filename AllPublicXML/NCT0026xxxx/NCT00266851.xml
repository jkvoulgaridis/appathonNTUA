      The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of the azalide macrolide
      azithromycin in adults with persistent asthma.

      Research Question: Will a 12-week treatment with the antibiotic, azithromycin, result in a
      statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in overall asthma symptoms
      and other patient-oriented asthma outcomes one year after initiation of treatment of adult
      primary care patients with asthma?

      Experimental Design: The investigators propose a one-year randomized, placebo-controlled,
      blinded (investigator, patient, data collector, data analyst) trial of 12 weekly doses of
      azithromycin/placebo as adjunctive therapy (in addition to usual care) along with a parallel
      observational cohort who will participate 'open label' in 100 adult asthma patients recruited
      from practice-based research networks (e.g., Wisconsin Research and Education Network (WREN)
      and others). This &quot;practical clinical trial&quot; will (1) enroll a representative sample of
      asthma patients encountered in the practices of primary care physicians, (2) employ standard
      clinical trial methodology to ensure internally valid results and (3) measure outcomes
      important to patients, so that the results will be valid and applicable to the kinds of
      asthma patients encountered by family physicians and other primary care providers.

      1.0 PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS

      Approximately 100 eligible adult patients with physician-diagnosed asthma will either be
      randomized to 12-week treatment with azithromycin or an identical placebo, or join an
      observational open-label azithromycin cohort. Azithromycin is a widely marketed azalide
      antibiotic with an excellent safety profile. Azithromycin or placebo will be adjunctive
      therapy for usual asthma care. The following patient-reported data will be collected via
      Zoomerang™ (a commercially-available data collection tool) periodically until one year after
      randomization: (1) study medication adherence and side effects weekly until 12 weeks, (2)
      asthma control and exacerbations every 6 weeks until 12 months, and (3) asthma quality of
      life and asthma controller medication changes every 3 months until 12 months. The primary
      hypothesis is that azithromycin will significantly improve asthma control (decrease symptoms
      and medication use) by 3 months (end treatment) and the improvement will continue to 12
      months (end study). The primary outcome variable is overall asthma symptoms. Secondary
      outcomes are asthma medication use, quality of life and exacerbations. We will examine the
      predictive value of baseline patient characteristics including age, sex, smoking, co-morbid
      respiratory diagnoses and degree of airflow limitation. We will also examine for any
      imbalances between study groups in controller medication use, other antibiotic prescriptions
      and acute respiratory illnesses during the one-year study period.

      We will enroll subjects from the practices of Wisconsin Research and Education Network (WREN)
      members, UW Department of Family Medicine physicians, Dean Medical Center primary care
      physicians, and from other practice-based research networks (PBRNs), medical group practices
      and individual primary care practices throughout North America.

      Patients with physician-diagnosed asthma aged 18 and older will be identified at
      point-of-service (office, urgent care, emergency room or hospital), by administrative data
      base review, or by physician recall. Most subjects will be the patients of study physicians.
      Other physicians in the group practice may refer subjects. Subjects also may be self-referred
      after responding to posters placed in the clinics. Some sites may elect to identify cases by
      medical record or database review, in which case only the personal physician may initiate
      patient contacts.

      Treatment is azithromycin tablets, 600 milligrams orally once daily for 3 days, then 600
      milligrams once weekly for an additional 11 weeks (total dose 8400 milligrams) or identical
      placebo, in addition to usual care for asthma.

                  of azithromycin (a currently recommended dose for children)

               -  We specify no upper age limit because asthma occurs throughout the age range and
                  because asthma in the elderly is particularly severe and warrants inclusion.

          -  Physician-diagnosed asthma

          -  At the time of randomization, eligible subjects must either:

               -  be having a documented asthma exacerbation OR

               -  be reporting at least mild persistent asthma symptoms, as defined by GINA (Global
                  Initiative for Asthma)

          -  Subjects must also have asthma symptoms for at least six months prior to randomization

          -  Documentation of objective evidence of reversible airway obstruction, either

               -  a 12% or greater (and ≥200 mL) change in FEV1 OR

               -  a 25% or greater (and &gt;60 L/min) change in PEFR either spontaneously or as a
                  result of treatment

             contraception during the treatment period

          -  Chronic use of macrolides, tetracyclines or quinolones Chronic use is defined as 4 or
             more weeks of continuous use within 6 months of randomization

          -  Asthma symptoms for less than 6 months prior to randomization Asthma symptoms must be
             present for at least 6 months to exclude patients without true chronic asthma

          -  Unstable asthma requiring immediate emergency care All patients with asthma
             exacerbations will receive usual urgent or emergency care for asthma and must be
             improving or stable in the judgment of the treating physician prior to being enrolled

          -  Specified co-morbidities likely to interfere with study assessments or follow up.
             Excluded comorbidities include:

               -  cystic fibrosis

               -  alcohol or other drug abuse

               -  or any other serious medical condition that, in the opinion of the study
                  physician, would seriously interfere with or preclude assessment of study
                  outcomes or completion of study assessments

          -  Specified medical conditions for which macrolide administration may possibly be
             hazardous

          -  Patients with acute or chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis or other liver disease, chronic
             kidney disease, or history of prolonged cardiac repolarization and QT interval or
             torsades de pointes, are excluded

          -  Specified medications for which close monitoring has been recommended in the setting
             of macrolide administration Patients taking digoxin, theophylline, warfarin,
             ergotamine or dihydroergotamine, triazolam, carbamazepine, cyclosporine, hexobarbital
             or phenytoin are excluded.

               -  If any of these medications are started after randomization and before completion
                  of the 12-week treatment phase, study medication will be discontinued and the
                  patient may remain in the study.

        The intent of this protocol is to enroll a broadly generalizable sample of adult patients
        with physician-diagnosed asthma, either stable persistent or in exacerbation.
