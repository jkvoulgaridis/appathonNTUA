      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, gemcitabine, and paclitaxel, work
      in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by
      stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor
      growth in different ways. Some find tumor cells and kill them or carry tumor-killing
      substances to them. Others interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.
      Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor.
      Giving combination chemotherapy together with bevacizumab before surgery may make the tumor
      smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed. Giving these
      treatments after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving cisplatin, bevacizumab, and
      gemcitabine followed by surgery, bevacizumab, and paclitaxel works in treating patients with
      locally advanced nonmetastatic bladder cancer that can be removed by surgery.
