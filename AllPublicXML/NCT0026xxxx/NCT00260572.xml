  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aims of this study are to create a prospective data base to evaluate the long term
      outcomes of medical and surgical treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD); to
      measure standard outcomes as well as patient derived outcomes such as general and disease
      specific quality of life (QOL) issues and patient satisfaction; to refine the parameters that
      may identify patients who will benefit from surgery for GERD; and to identify possible
      determinants of failure of both medical and surgical treatments of reflux.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      GERD is a significant public health problem and when it is severe it may have a considerable
      impact on patients' QOL. Relatively new treatments such as proton pump inhibitors (PPI) and
      laparoscopic fundoplication (wrapping or gathering the stomach around the lower end of the
      esophagus to reduce or prevent reflux) are now available. Patient derived outcomes such as
      QOL and satisfaction are rarely taken into consideration when evaluating such new treatments.
      Outcome analysis of the results of medical and surgical treatments using an ongoing database
      of patients will enhance our ability to treat patients with GERD.

      This study's goal is to build a database to collect the outcome information on patients who
      are having medical or surgical treatment of GERD. In addition we want to measure standard
      outcomes such as morbidity, mortality, medication use and patient derived outcomes such as
      general and disease specific QOL, and patient satisfaction with the treatment. We also want
      to assess if and how long QOL is improved by medical and surgical treatment methods. In
      addition we want to see if low QOL scores on medical treatment as well as the standard
      medical criteria can help to identify which patients may benefit from surgical (an operation)
      rather than the medical treatment. It is hoped that we can also identify which factors might
      predict or help to determine which patients will have failure of both medical and surgical
      treatments of GERD. Using this information we want to identify if a psychological profile
      done before treatment will influence or predict the outcomes of treatment.
