      Objectives: Plasma levels of catechols have distinct meanings in terms of indicating
      functions of endogenous catecholamine systems. This Protocol is designed to enable ongoing
      quality assurance of diagnostic and research assays of catechols and their metabolites and to
      identify possible influences of demographic and anthropometric factors, dietary constituents,
      and conditions of sampling on reference values.

      Study Populations: The study population is healthy volunteers and people who are obese or
      have untreated hypertension.

      Design: Arm venous blood is drawn via an indwelling i.v. catheter from healthy volunteers
      across demographic and anthropometric spectra (age, gender, skin color, ethnicity, body mass,
      adiposity), to obtain quality control plasma and establish reference values for plasma levels
      of catechols and their metabolites. Non-invasive physiological measures are obtained
      concurrently. Levels of catechols and their metabolites are related to results of common
      clinical pathology tests. Subgroups of subjects are tested more than once, to assess dietary
      influences (cereal with milk, coffee) and conditions of sampling (temperature at the skin).

      Outcome Measures: The main non-experimental outcome is an ongoing pool of quality control
      plasma. The main experimental outcome measures are plasma concentrations of catechols and
      their metabolites, non-invasive physiological measures, and results of common clinical
      pathology tests. Subject groups are compared with respect to the above demographic and
      anthropometric factors. Effects of the experimental manipulations are assessed within
      subjects

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        The subjects are healthy volunteers 18 years or older who are not pregnant or lactating.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        &lt;TAB&gt;

        Minors younger than 18 years old are excluded.

        A candidate subject is excluded if, in the judgment of the Principal Investigator, Protocol
        participation would place the subject at substantially increased acute medical risk. A
        candidate subject is excluded if, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator, the medical
        risk outweighs the potential scientific benefit.

        A candidate subject is excluded if there is a disqualifying condition. Examples of
        disqualifying conditions are hepatic failure, a history of tachyarrhythmias or heart block,
        symptomatic congestive heart failure, severe anemia, psychosis, refractory ventricular
        arrhythmias, symptomatic coronary heart disease, diabetes mellitus, or hyperthyroidism.
        Abnormal screening results may exclude further participation, at the discretion of the
        Principal Investigator.

        Subjects will be excluded from further participation and referred for medical management,
        if the systolic blood pressure during supine rest is greater than or equal to 160 mm Hg or
        diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 105 mm Hg.

        Alcohol use disorder.

        A candidate subject is excluded if clinical considerations require that the patient
        continue treatment with a drug likely to interfere with the scientific results. Examples
        are acetaminophen, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers,
        adrenoceptor agonists or antagonists, anticoagulants, anticonvulsants, antipsychotics,
        calcium channel blockers, hypoglycemic agents, digoxin, dopaminergic drugs, monoamine
        oxidase inhibitors, oral contraceptives, sedatives, steroids, and tricyclic
        antidepressants. Patients are not to discontinue any medications, just to participate in
        this study.

        Subjects in whom we feel it would be difficult to insert a catheter into a vein may be
        excluded.

        Pregnant or lactating women are excluded. To exclude pregnancy, women with child bearing
        potential have blood testing for pregnancy, with negative results obtained within 1 day of
        each day of testing.

        Candidate subjects who admit to a history of alcohol addiction and alcohol use disorder are
        excluded from the study as a whole, but is especially important in the portion of the study
        involving ingesting red wine.

        Candidate subjects who drink alcohol every day are excluded from the portion of the study
        involving ingesting red wine.

        People with a history of sulfite allergy are excluded from the portion of the study
        involving ingestion of red wine.

        Subjects must be at least 21 years old in order to participate in the portion of the study
        involving ingestion of red wine.
