  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are two ways in which surgeons repair rotator cuff tears. An open method involves
      making an incision (cut) 5-6 inches in length in the skin and repairing the tear with the
      skin open, while the arthroscopic method involves making small holes in the skin and using a
      guiding camera and special equipment to repair the tear. This clinical study is being
      conducted to study the rate of re-tear (one year following surgery) of rotator cuffs that
      have been repaired using the arthroscopic technique.

    <textblock>
      While many studies have researched re-tear rate for rotator cuff tears following open repair,
      to date there have been no studies evaluating re-tear rate following arthroscopic surgery.
      Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair is less invasive and exposes the patient to fewer risks than
      open surgery. Once this pilot study is completed the next step will be to compare the rate of
      re-tear, as assessed via Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) between the two techniques. If the
      rate of re-tear is lower following arthroscopic surgery this will provide validation for use
      of the arthroscopic technique. If, however, the rate of re-tear is higher using the
      arthroscopic technique, then use of this technique is not justified.

    <description>Overall functional status will be assessed by the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES), which is a shoulder specific assessment divided into two sections: pain and activities of daily living (ADL). The overall score is an equal weight of the two sections and produces a score out of 100. The higher the score, the better the outcome. Functional status will also be assessed using The Constant Score reflects an overall clinical functional assessment. This instrument is based on a 100-point scoring system. Subjective findings (pain, activities of daily living, and working in different positions) make up a total of 35 points. Objective measurements make up the remaining 65 points. The test is divided into four sub-categories: (1) pain (2) activities of daily living ability; (3) mobility; (4) strength. All categories are added together, and a total score out of 100 is given (higher score indicates better outcome).</description>

        Patients will be screened by participating surgeons in a fellowship-run outpatient shoulder
        clinic. Patients who have consented and are scheduled to undergo an arthroscopic rotator
        cuff repair, and who have a cuff tear size of &lt;5 cm, and involving 2 or fewer tendons, and
        meet the additional eligibility criteria will be approached to join the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Diagnosis of rotator cuff tear which will involve one of the following:1) history
             of shoulder pain or weakness 2) ability to illicit pain or weakness with one of the
             following signs: tenderness of the rotator cuff insertion, palpable crepitus of the
             subacromial bursa or a palpable defect of the cuff insertion, impingement signs and
             weakness of the rotator cuff musculature 3) radiological evidence of rotator cuff tear
             from ultrasound, arthrogram or MRI. Failed non-operative treatment. Size of tear of
             less than 5 cm and involving 2 or fewer tendons

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical:1. Tear as defined by significant muscular wasting, inability to actively
             forward-flex (strength grade 2/5 or worse), positive drop sign or hornblowers 2.
             Significant tenderness of acromioclavicular or sternoclavicular joints on affected

             surgery on affected shoulderRadiological:1. Bony abnormality on standardized series of

             torn).Arthroscopic:1. Presence of massive cuff tear as defined above on arthroscopic
             examination of the joint 2. Presence of comorbid conditions: Bankart lesion, SLAP
