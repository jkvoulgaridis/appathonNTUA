      This study aimed to examine if technology could enhance the treatment engagement and outcomes
      of low income parents of 3 to 8 children with externalizing problems.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this pilot study is to determine whether a technology-enhanced version of an
      established behavioral treatment protocol, Helping the Noncompliant Child (HNC; McMahon &amp;
      Forehand), enhances the engagement and treatment outcomes of lower income parents of 3 to 8
      children with externalizing problems in treatment. It is predicted that families in both the
      HNC and technology-enhanced HNC (TE-HNC) programs will evidence significant improvement in
      parenting behavior and child externalizing problems; however, it is predicted that
      parent-child dyads in the TE-HNC program will require fewer sessions, will be more likely to
      be retained in the program, will be more likely to remain engaged in the program (e.g.,
      practicing skills between sessions etc.), and will be more likely to have active involvement
      from their coparenting partners (i.e., other adults and family members who participate in
      childrearing).In turn, it is expected that the TE-HNC program will boost treatment outcomes.

    <measure>Mean % Sessions Attended as Scheduled</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Post-Intervention (average 8 to 12 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Participation in each weekly session as scheduled was recorded for each family. Mean attendance of scheduled sessions was computed for each parent-child dyad and then for each group. For example, if a parent-child dyad required 8 sessions to master the program skills and attended all 8 sessions as scheduled they would have 100%. If instead, another parent-child dyad also required 8 sessions to complete the program, but half of those were rescheduled at least once. Then the overall average attendance is calculated across the parent-child dyads in each group. Greater scheduled attendance = optimal outcome.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to Post-Intervention (average 8 to 12 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The ECBI is a 36 item measure frequently used in treatment outcome research with young children, as it it reflects problem behavior in this age range and is sensitive to change. Parents rate the frequency of each problem behavior as occurring 0 = never to 7 = always. Scores can range from 0 to 252 with higher scores reflecting greater problem behaviors.</description>

    <description>Mean number of sessions that parent-child dyads in each group required to master the program skills and complete treatment (Fewer sessions to complete treatment considered more cost-effective as parent-child dyads learning skills more efficiently).</description>

        <title>Mean % Sessions Attended as Scheduled</title>
        <description>Participation in each weekly session as scheduled was recorded for each family. Mean attendance of scheduled sessions was computed for each parent-child dyad and then for each group. For example, if a parent-child dyad required 8 sessions to master the program skills and attended all 8 sessions as scheduled they would have 100%. If instead, another parent-child dyad also required 8 sessions to complete the program, but half of those were rescheduled at least once. Then the overall average attendance is calculated across the parent-child dyads in each group. Greater scheduled attendance = optimal outcome.</description>

        <population>Given the pilot nature of study and smalll sample size, intent to treat analyses were not conducted. Rather, analyses were conducted on those parent-child dyads who completed all sessions within each group.</population>
