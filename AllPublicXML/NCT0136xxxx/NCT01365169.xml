  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial explores the use of wireless collection and transmission of
      physical activity, nutrition, and self-reported data from patients undergoing pancreas
      surgery. Home-based post-operative (post-op) rehabilitation programs that feature structured
      walking have been found to improve post-surgical outcomes. The addition of home monitoring of
      biometric and self-report outcomes may enable more rapid intervention to address slow patient
      recovery rates.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore the feasibility and acceptability in diverse samples of cancer patients of
      wireless collection and transmission of data for transfer into the open-source
      cyberinfrastructure (CI) called Cyberinfrastructure for Comparative Effectiveness Research
      (CYCORE).

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 4 arms.

      ARM I (COLORECTAL CANCER PATIENTS) (CLOSED TO ACCRUAL AS OF 01/30/14): Patients use two
      accelerometers, a blood pressure monitor, a heart rate monitor, a global positioning system
      (GPS) device, and a smart phone that prompts patients to electronically answer questions
      about exercise and health-related symptoms and feelings. The devices are used for 5
      consecutive days. After a 2 week period, patients resume use of the devices for an additional
      5 days.

      ARM II (HEAD AND NECK CANCER PATIENTS) (CLOSED TO ACCRUAL AS OF 01/30/14): Patients use two
      accelerometers, a blood pressure monitor, a weight scale, and a smart phone that prompts
      patients to electronically answer questions about diet and health-related symptoms. The
      devices are used for 5 consecutive days. After a 2 week period, patients resume use of the
      devices for an additional 5 days.

      ARM III (HEAD AND NECK CANCER PATIENTS) (CLOSED TO ACCRUAL AS OF 01/30/14): Patients use a
      smart phone that prompts patients to electronically answer questions about diet,
      health-related symptoms, and swallowing exercises. Patients also take video recordings of
      their neck while performing swallowing exercises. The device is used for 5 consecutive days.
      After a 2 week period, patients resume use of the device for an additional 5 days.

      ARM IV (CANCER SURVIVORS THAT ARE CURRENT/FORMER SMOKERS) (CLOSED TO ACCRUAL AS OF 01/30/14):
      Patients use a carbon monoxide (CO) monitor and a smart phone that prompts patients to
      electronically answer questions about smoking. Patients also take video recordings of
      themselves while exhaling into the CO monitor. The devices are used for 5 consecutive days.
      After a 2 week period, patients resume use of the devices for an additional 5 days.

      PANCREATIC CANCER STUDY (PCS): Patients receive post-surgical wellness program consisting of
      physical activity, nutrition counseling, and daily monitoring (physical activity, weight, and
      self-reported data) for up to 7 months post-op.

    <description>With a true completion rate of 60%, a sample size of 50 for Arm 1, 3 and 4 will yield a 90% confidence interval with its limits extending 0.114 from the observed rate. Therefore, if 23 subjects or fewer complete the intervention, researchers will declare that study arm (i.e., Arm 1, 3 and 4) to be infeasible. For Arm 2, with a true completion rate of 60%, a sample size of 75 will yield a 90% confidence interval with its limits extending 0.093 from the observed rate. Therefore, if 37 subjects or fewer complete the intervention, researchers will declare Arm 2 to be infeasible.</description>
