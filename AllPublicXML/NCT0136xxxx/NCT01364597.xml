      This is a Phase 3, open-label, single-arm, multicenter, long-term study to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of brivaracetam (BRV) in children with epilepsy.

      This study was initially designed for pediatric subjects who had completed a previous BRV
      study.

      With Protocol Amendment 4, enrollment for &quot;directly enrolled&quot; subjects was modified from 'up
      to' an additional 100 subjects to &quot;at least&quot; 100 subjects, keeping the planned total
      enrollment of approximately 600 subjects to allow flexibility in the number of patients
      reaching 1 year of exposure.

      With protocol amendment 5, entry criteria for subjects coming for other pediatric core
      studies in development were included. Additional clarity was provided for subjects enrolled
      in N01266 that temporary roll over to one of those studies and resume participation in
      N01266.

      The primary objective is to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of BRV. The
      secondary objective is to assess the efficacy of BRV during long-term exposure.

    <description>The max BRV dose will be 5.0 mg/kg/day,not to exceed a dose of 200 mg/day for subjects with body weight &gt;40kg. Subjects may receive oral solution or oral tablets. The LTFU subjects will start dosing in N01266 on the individualized BRV dose they were receiving at the completion of the core study. Subjects must be able to tolerate the min BRV dose specified in the core study to be eligible for entry into the Evaluation Period of N01266. Dose can be adjusted as considered necessary by the Investigator and required by the subject's medical condition. All subjects who prematurely discontinue the study should complete an EDV and have their BRV dose down titrated by a maximum of half the dose every week for a maximum of 4 weeks until a dose of 1 mg/kg/day (50 mg/day for subjects with body weights &gt;50kg) is reached.</description>
