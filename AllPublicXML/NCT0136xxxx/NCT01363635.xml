  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe sepsis/septic shock are serious complications of infection with high morbidity and
      mortality. Recent information showed that early and aggressive resuscitation may help
      improving survival and outcome especially the resuscitation within the first 3 hours. In
      surgical patients, either severe sepsis/septic shock bought them to the operating room or
      this sepsis might be found after surgery resulting in higher morbidity and mortality. Not
      only knowledge management, others possible risk factors should also be identified and
      corrected for outcome improving. This prospective observational study will be done in 800
      adult surgical patients admitting to the general surgical intensive care unit. Incidence of
      severe sepsis/septic shock on admission along with risk factors associated with poor outcomes
      [organ failure (AKI, ALI, PMI, liver failure, stroke), prolonged ICU length of, stay, ICU
      death] will be recorded especially effect of amount and type of fluid replacement in the
      first 6 hours, 24, 48 and 72 hours after diagnosis. Outcome as major organ failure, ICU
      length of stay, ICU, 28 and 90 days mortality will also be study.

      Consecutive severe sepsis/ septic shock patients who will be admitted to the general surgical
      ICU of Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand will be recruited to this
      study. Apart from demographic data (age, sex, BMI, comorbidity), detail of septic shock and
      resuscitation (preoperative and intraoperative resuscitation), vasopressor and steroid used,
      type and amount of fluid, blood and blood component used and shock reversal time.
      Complication associated with surgery, anesthesia and in ICU will also recorded. Clinical
      outcome as organ failure (Stroke, PMI, aki, ARDS); ventilator day, ICU and hospital length of
      stay, mortality (in ICU, 28 and 90 days mortality) and cause of mortality will be carefully
      recorded
