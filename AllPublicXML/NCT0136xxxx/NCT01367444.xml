    <textblock>
      Primary Objective:

      Stargardt's Macular Degeneration (SMD).

      Secondary Objective:

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The total duration per participant was up to 52 weeks, which included 4 week screening period
      and 48 weeks study period.

      At the end of the study, the participants were invited to enter in an open-label safety study
      (LTS13588-NCT01736592) for long-term follow-up visits including ophthalmological examinations
      and recording of adverse events (AEs) for up to 15 years.

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Study stopped not for safety reasons. Due to review of clinical development plans and
    priorities, Sponsor decided to stop development of the product.

    <description>An adverse event (AE) was any unfavorable and unintended physical sign, symptom, or laboratory parameter that developed or worsened in severity during the course of the study, whether or not considered related to the investigational product. The TEAEs were defined as any event that started or increased in severity after the participant received investigational medicinal product (IMP), including abnormal laboratory results, electrocardiogram, etc.</description>

    <description>An AE was any unfavorable and unintended physical sign, symptom, or laboratory parameter that developed or worsened in severity during the course of the study, whether or not considered related to the investigational product. For each AE, the severity was categorized as either mild, moderate or severe where 'mild' was defined as discomfort noticed but did not interfere with the participant's daily routines (an annoyance), 'moderate' was defined as some impairment of function, not hazardous to health (uncomfortable or embarrassing), and 'severe' was defined as significant impairment of function, hazardous to health (incapacitating).</description>
