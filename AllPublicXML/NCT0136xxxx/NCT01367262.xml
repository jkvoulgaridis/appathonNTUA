    <measure>Percentage of Urinary and Fecal Excretion of LY2886721 Radioactivity Over Time</measure>
    <time_frame>Predose up to 7 days (168 hours) postdose</time_frame>
    <description>Urinary and fecal excretion of LY2886721 radioactivity over time was expressed as a percentage of the total radioactive dose administered. The amount of drug-related material excreted in urine and feces (Ae) at a specific collection interval (i) was calculated as the product of radioactivity concentration and volume or weight. The Ae values for each collection interval were then summed and calculated as Total Ae=Ae(i1)+Ae(i2)+Ae(in). The percentage of the total radiolabeled dose administered that was excreted in feces or urine=[(Total Ae)/(Total radioactive dose administered)]*100.</description>

    <measure>Relative Abundance of LY2886721 and the Metabolites of LY2886721 in Plasma</measure>
    <time_frame>1 to 8 hours postdose</time_frame>
    <description>The metabolites of LY2886721 were identified using a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) chromatogram. The relative abundance of LY2886721 and its metabolites in plasma were reported as a percentage of recovered radioactivity and calculated by dividing the sum of the radioactive content of fractions contributing to a particular peak by the sum of the radioactive content of all fractions in the radio chromatogram, then multiplying by 100. Radioactivity corresponds to 80 μCi [^14C]-LY2886721.</description>

        <description>Urinary and fecal excretion of LY2886721 radioactivity over time was expressed as a percentage of the total radioactive dose administered. The amount of drug-related material excreted in urine and feces (Ae) at a specific collection interval (i) was calculated as the product of radioactivity concentration and volume or weight. The Ae values for each collection interval were then summed and calculated as Total Ae=Ae(i1)+Ae(i2)+Ae(in). The percentage of the total radiolabeled dose administered that was excreted in feces or urine=[(Total Ae)/(Total radioactive dose administered)]*100.</description>

        <title>Relative Abundance of LY2886721 and the Metabolites of LY2886721 in Urine</title>
        <description>The metabolites of LY2886721 were identified using an HPLC chromatogram. The relative abundance of LY2886721 and its metabolites in urine were reported as a percentage of recovered radioactivity and calculated by dividing the sum of the radioactive content of fractions contributing to a particular peak by the sum of the radioactive content of all fractions in the radio chromatogram, then multiplying by 100. Radioactivity corresponds to 80 μCi [^14C]-LY2886721.</description>

      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>The only disclosure restriction on the PI is that the sponsor can review results communications prior to public release and can embargo communications regarding trial results for a period that is more than 60 days but less than or equal to 180 days. The sponsor cannot require changes to the communication and cannot extend the embargo.</restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>Assay sensitivity of plasma and whole blood radioactivity were not generally quantifiable after 24-hours postdose. Consequently, the AUC(0-inf) estimate for total radioactivity in plasma and whole blood should be considered underestimated.</limitations_and_caveats>
