    <description>An Acute Exacerbation in a COPD patient is an event in the natural course of the disease characterized by a change in the patient's baseline dyspnea, cough, and/or sputum production and beyond normal day to day variations, that is acute in onset and may warrant a change in regular medication in a patient with underlying COPD The Means and Confidence Intervals (CI) were estimated using the Negative Binomial model taking into account time to follow up.

    <measure>Change From Baseline EXAcerbations of Chronic Pulmonary Disease Tool (EXACT) Scores at Enrollment and Any AECOPD Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>During Year 1</time_frame>
    <description>The exacerbations of chronic pulmonary disease tool version 1.0 (EXACT) is a validated self-administered instrument that evaluates the effects of pharmacologic treatment on acute exacerbations of COPD. Analyses of exacerbations in relation to morning or evening EXACT-PRO e-diaries were presented as follows: descriptive statistics on the EXACT daily scores tabulated at enrolment, at any stable and at any, mild, moderate or severe exacerbation visit. EXACT-PRO contains 14 questions with scores ranging from 0 to 4, where 0= best outcome while 4= worse outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline COPD Assessment Test (CAT) Scores at Enrollment and Any AECOPD Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>During Year 1</time_frame>
    <description>The COPD assessment test (CAT) is a validated self-administered instrument designed to provide a simple and reliable measure of health status in COPD patients. Its properties have been shown to be similar to the St George's respiratory questionnaire (SGRQ). The CAT comprises 8 items and has a scoring range of 0-40, 0= most positive answer and 40= most negative answer. In this study, the subjects were to complete the CAT questionnaire every 3 months.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline COPD Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living Scale (NEADL) Scores at Enrollment and Any AECOPD Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>During Year 1</time_frame>
    <description>The NEADL assessed (quarterly in the present study) the ease or difficulty in performing extended activities of daily living. The NEADL scale contains 22 items, each measured on a 4-point Likert scale. There are four dimensions: mobility (6 items); kitchen (5 items); domestic (5 items); leisure (6 items). These are summed producing a total score reflecting general functioning. Each of the 22 individual items had 2 possible scores (0 or 1). Therefore, the range of the NEADL score was 0 to 22. Lower scores indicate greater levels of disability while higher scores indicate greater independence.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline COPD EQ-5D Index and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) Scores at Enrollment and Any AECOPD Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>During Year 1</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D is an established measure of generic health outcome that provides a simple descriptive profile and a single index value that can be used in clinical and economic evaluation of healthcare and in population surveys. Its current format is 3-level and 5 dimensional (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression). The EQ-5D index was derived from the ratings recorded every 3 months for each of the five individual items (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression). The EQ-5D index was 0 (worst health state) to 100 (best health state). The negative numbers presented represent a decrease from baseline values and a worsening of health.</description>

    <description>An Acute Exacerbation in a COPD patient is an event in the natural course of the disease characterized by a change in the patient's baseline dyspnea, cough, and/or sputum production and beyond normal day to day variations, that is acute in onset and may warrant a change in regular medication in a patient with underlying COPD. AECOPD severity was assessed as: any, mild, moderate and severe. Any = any COPD symptom regardless of severity. Mild = Worsening symptoms of COPD that are self-managed by the patient. Moderate = Worsening symptoms of COPD that require treatment with oral corticosteroids and/or antibiotics. Severe = Worsening symptoms of COPD that require treatment with in-patient hospitalisation or home care intervention.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline COPD Assessment Test (CAT) Scores at Enrollment and Any AECOPD Visit</title>
        <description>The COPD assessment test (CAT) is a validated self-administered instrument designed to provide a simple and reliable measure of health status in COPD patients. Its properties have been shown to be similar to the St George's respiratory questionnaire (SGRQ). The CAT comprises 8 items and has a scoring range of 0-40, 0= most positive answer and 40= most negative answer. In this study, the subjects were to complete the CAT questionnaire every 3 months.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline COPD Assessment Test (CAT) Scores at Enrollment and Any AECOPD Visit</title>
          <description>The COPD assessment test (CAT) is a validated self-administered instrument designed to provide a simple and reliable measure of health status in COPD patients. Its properties have been shown to be similar to the St George's respiratory questionnaire (SGRQ). The CAT comprises 8 items and has a scoring range of 0-40, 0= most positive answer and 40= most negative answer. In this study, the subjects were to complete the CAT questionnaire every 3 months.</description>

        <description>The NEADL assessed (quarterly in the present study) the ease or difficulty in performing extended activities of daily living. The NEADL scale contains 22 items, each measured on a 4-point Likert scale. There are four dimensions: mobility (6 items); kitchen (5 items); domestic (5 items); leisure (6 items). These are summed producing a total score reflecting general functioning. Each of the 22 individual items had 2 possible scores (0 or 1). Therefore, the range of the NEADL score was 0 to 22. Lower scores indicate greater levels of disability while higher scores indicate greater independence.</description>

        <description>The EQ-5D is an established measure of generic health outcome that provides a simple descriptive profile and a single index value that can be used in clinical and economic evaluation of healthcare and in population surveys. Its current format is 3-level and 5 dimensional (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression). The EQ-5D index was derived from the ratings recorded every 3 months for each of the five individual items (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression). The EQ-5D index was 0 (worst health state) to 100 (best health state). The negative numbers presented represent a decrease from baseline values and a worsening of health.</description>

        <title>AECOPD Rate With Overall and Specific Bacterial Pathogens in Sputum by Severity</title>
        <description>An Acute Exacerbation in a COPD patient is an event in the natural course of the disease characterized by a change in the patient's baseline dyspnea, cough, and/or sputum production and beyond normal day to day variations, that is acute in onset and may warrant a change in regular medication in a patient with underlying COPD. AECOPD severity was assessed as: any, mild, moderate and severe. Any = any COPD symptom regardless of severity. Mild = Worsening symptoms of COPD that are self-managed by the patient. Moderate = Worsening symptoms of COPD that require treatment with oral corticosteroids and/or antibiotics. Severe = Worsening symptoms of COPD that require treatment with in-patient hospitalisation or home care intervention.</description>

        <population>The analyses of AECOPD were performed on the Full cohort, which included all subjects eligible for inclusion based on medical history and study specific procedures defined in the protocol and who completed at least the Day 0 visit.</population>
