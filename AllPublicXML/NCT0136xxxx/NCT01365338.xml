  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study aims to determine whether the drug affects brain activity
      in healthy volunteers, either when the participants are performing a memory task, or when
      lying at rest. Subjects will undergo a brain scan under both of these conditions after a dose
      of either the study drug or a placebo is administered.The secondary objective is to evaluate
      the safety and tolerability of the four doses of PF-04958242 administered orally to healthy
      adult participants.

    <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a product or medical device. A serious adverse event or serious adverse drug reaction is any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that: Results in death; Is life-threatening (immediate risk of death); Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect.</description>

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) of 17.5 to 30.5 kilograms per meter squared (kg/m2);

          -  Total body weight &gt;50 kilograms (kg) (110 pounds [lbs]);

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic, or
             allergic disease (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic,
             seasonal allergies at time of dosing);

          -  Positive urine drug screen;

          -  Pregnant or nursing females, and females of child bearing potential;

          -  Severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality
             that may increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational
             product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and,
             in the judgment of the investigator, would make the participant inappropriate for
             entry into this study.
