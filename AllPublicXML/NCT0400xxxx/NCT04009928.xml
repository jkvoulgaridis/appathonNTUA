  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment resistant depression (TRD) is a major global health concern, and there is a crucial
      need to develop novel effective treatments.

      The medial forebrain bundle (MFB) is a recently described DBS target, with reported rapid
      onset of antidepressant effects. A recent small randomized trial reported a 100% response
      rate. The subcallosal cingulate cortex (SCC) is the most commonly used target in DBS for
      depression.

      Herein, the investigators will conduct a sham-controlled randomized trial of DBS to the MFB
      or SCC for TRD.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eight patients with TRD will be treated with DBS to the MFB. At approximately 2 weeks
      postoperartively, stimulation will be initiated in all patients. Voltage and contact position
      will be altered initially, looking for optimal and stabilized responses in depressive
      symptoms, while trying to minimize any side effects.

      Following this 6 month open-label optimization phase, patients will be then undergo
      randomization to receive 2 weeks of stimulation followed by 2 weeks of sham stimulation, or
      vice versa. These 2 week phases will be separated by a 1 week washout period. Depressive
      symptoms will be evaluated at the end of each 2 week phase, then patients will resume
      open-label stimiulation.
