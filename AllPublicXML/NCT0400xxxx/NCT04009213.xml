  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized controlled trial of 284 subjects (142 in each group).
      Patients will be blinded to the fixation method used. The objective of this study is to
      compare the efficacy and safety of the LiquiBand FIX8® device to the tack-based control
      device (AbsorbaTack™) for laparoscopic groin hernia (inguinal or femoral) repair. The primary
      outcome measure is an improvement in pain score measured by VAS at 6 months. Secondary
      outcomes include the ability to affix hernia mesh, the ability to approximate the peritoneum,
      recurrence rate, and quality of life (Carolina Comfort Scale).

    <intervention_model_description>Patients will be randomized to one of two treatment arms, LiquiBand FIX8® or Control (AbsorbaTack™) device at a 1:1 ratio. Subjects will also be randomized according to laparoscopic technique used (TEP or TAPP hernia repair procedure), so that there is appropriate distribution between the Investigational and control devices. Randomization will occur immediately prior to use of either device for mesh fixation (TEP repairs) or mesh fixation and peritoneal closure (TAPP repairs only) and only after the Investigator has laparoscopically inspected the site of repair and determined the patient to be eligible for participation in the study.</intervention_model_description>
    <primary_purpose>Treatment</primary_purpose>
    <masking>Single (Participant)</masking>
    <masking_description>Randomization to either Investigational or control device will occur at the surgery visit. The patients will be blinded to their randomly assigned treatment device prior to surgery and during the follow up period following surgery. While it is not possible to blind investigators/staff members to the treatment device used, Investigators and staff members will not learn of randomized device until immediately prior to use of device, so as to maintain subject blinding prior to the hernia repair. Investigators and staff members will be asked to maintain subject blinding through the course of the follow up visits so as to not bias subject feedback on applicable study assessments. Patients will receive the same standard of care prior to, during and following surgery regardless of randomized device assignment, and therefore will not be able to individually determine what device they have been randomized to.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To compare the change in pain following groin hernia repair by LiquiBand FIX8® to control device as measured by Visual Analog Scale (VAS) at baseline (worst pain experienced within 1 month of screening visit) and at six months post hernia repair.</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening from baseline (worst pain experienced within 1 month of screening) and at follow up Day 7 (by telephone), Day 14 (in clinic), Month 1(by telephone), Month 3 (in clinic), Month 6 (in clinic), Month 9 (by telephone), Month 12 (by telephone).</time_frame>
    <description>Effectiveness of LiquiBand FIX8® will be assessed and compared to treatment with AbsorbaTack™ in subjects requiring laparoscopic (TEP and TAPP) hernia repair. Success will be determined by improvement in pain not inferior to control device as measured by a VAS value. The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) consists of a straight line with the endpoints defining extreme limits, 0 = no pain and 10 = worst pain imaginable. The patient is asked to mark his/her pain level on the line between the two endpoints.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate the incidence of hernia recurrence in patients following laparoscopic (TEP and TAPP) hernia repair using LiquiBand FIX8® or control device.</measure>
    <time_frame>Physical examination will take place at 2 weeks, 3 months and 6 months. Suspected hernia recurrence will also be evaluated at any time following surgery and up to the 12 month follow up.</time_frame>
    <description>The incidence of hernia recurrence in patients following laparoscopic (TEP and TAPP) groin hernia repair by LiquiBand FIX8® or control (AbsorbaTack™) will be assessed by physical examination and will be confirmed by ultrasound imaging following physical examination.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To compare the incidence of successful mesh fixation at the time of surgery with LiquiBand FIX8® versus control device.</measure>
    <time_frame>At the time of surgery.</time_frame>
    <description>LiquiBand FIX8® will be required to successfully fix hernia mesh in patients undergoing TEP and TAPP laparoscopic groin hernia repair, at a rate non-inferior to control device (AbsorbaTack™) in order to meet this end point. Successful mesh fixation would not require any additional fixation by alternate fixation device. Unsuccessful mesh fixation is defined as requiring the use of an alternative fixation device or additional procedure to achieve adequate fixation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To compare the incidence of successful peritoneal closure (TAPP repairs only) at the time of surgery for LiquiBand FIX8® versus control device.</measure>
    <time_frame>At the time of surgery.</time_frame>
    <description>LiquiBand FIX8® will be required to successfully approximate the peritoneum in patients undergoing laparoscopic TAPP hernia repair, at a rate non-inferior to control devices in order to meet this end point. Successful peritoneal closure would not require any additional fixation by alternate fixation device or additional procedure. Unsuccessful peritoneal closure is defined as requiring the use of an alternative fixation device or additional procedure to achieve adequate fixation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate the quality of life experienced by subjects following groin hernia repair by LiquiBand FIX8® or control as measured by the Carolinas Comfort Scale (CCS).</measure>
    <time_frame>Prior to surgery and at 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months following laparoscopic (TEP and TAPP) groin hernia repair.</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of Life will be assessed by completion of the Carolinas Comfort Scale (CCS) Questionnaire (a survey used by clinicians and patients to help assess quality of life both pre and post hernia repair) following laparoscopic (TEP and TAPP) groin hernia repair. CCS scores at each timepoint will be compared between the LiquiBand FIX8® and control (AbsorbaTack) treatment groups.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To compare levels of pain experienced following laparoscopic (TEP and TAPP) groin hernia repair by LiquiBand FIX8® or control device, as measured by VAS.</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline (pre-surgery), discharge, and at 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months following surgery.</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation of pain will be measured by VAS (0 = no pain to 10 = most pain imaginable).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate the safety of LiquiBand FIX8® and control device for groin hernia repair by comparing incidence of adverse events in patients post laparoscopic groin hernia repair.</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessments will be intraoperatively, at discharge, and at 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months following surgery.</time_frame>
    <description>The incidence of all adverse events whether or not determined to be related to the LiquiBand FIX8® device or control device (AbsorbaTack™) will be assessed intraoperatively, at discharge, and at each follow-up visit throughout the study, or for cause at any time in the follow up period.</description>
