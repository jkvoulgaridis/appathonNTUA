  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and efficacy of Human BCMA Targeted T Cells Injection for the
      treatment of BCMA-positive relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. Patients will be given a
      conditioning chemotherapy regimen of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide followed by a single
      infusion of BCMA CAR+ T cells.

      Participants with BCMA-positive relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma can participate if all
      eligibility criteria are met. Tests required to determine eligibility include disease
      assessments, a physical exam, Electrocardiograph, CT/MRI/PET, and blood draws. Participants
      receive chemotherapy prior to the infusion of BCMA CAR+ T cells. After the infusion,
      participants will be followed for side effects and effect of BCMA CAR+ T cells. Study
      procedures may be performed while hospitalized.
