  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether sodium nitrite affects the expression of
      cellular proteins important for metabolic and vascular function in vascular offcuts and
      cardiac biopsies taken from patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)
      surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nitrite has been shown in recent studies to improve cardiac performance, particularly in
      patients with heart failure. These improvements were demonstrated in measures that are
      independent of cardiac loading conditions, implying improved contractility via effects at a
      cellular level. In humans, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery presents an
      opportunity to safely obtain cardiac muscle biopsies and vascular tissue in order to
      investigate changes at a cellular level in these tissues.

      The aim of this study is to investigate whether sodium nitrite affects the expression of
      cellular proteins important for heart muscle metabolism and vascular function when infused
      prior to routine CABG surgery. Patients undergoing CABG surgery who provide written informed
      consent will receive intravenous sodium nitrite 24hours prior to surgery, 30 minutes prior to
      surgery, or placebo. As Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus is common in patients undergoing CABG
      surgery, and itself has profound effects on metabolism, these patients will be sub-grouped
      into a diabetic cohort for interpretation of the molecular biology results. The 24hours prior
      to surgery vs. placebo arm will take place first, followed by the 30minutes prior to surgery
      vs. placebo arm. The data from this study will provide important information on the effects
      of nitrite on heart muscle and blood vessel tissues, and inform larger clinical trials in
      patients with cardiovascular disease.
