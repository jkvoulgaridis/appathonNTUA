    <textblock>
      Recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is associated with significant morbidity,
      mortality and health care related costs. Up to 30% of CDI cases recur, resulting in 83,000
      cases of recurrent CDI per year in the US. Although agents for primary and secondary
      prophylaxis for CDI including the use of probiotics, antibiotics, fecal microbiota
      transplantations, and newer therapies such as bezlotoxumab have been reported, there are no
      consensus guidelines regarding their use.

      In order to understand current practices regarding secondary prophylaxis for CDI, a
      nationwide survey to assess physician practices regarding secondary prophylaxis for CDI. A
      total of 246 surveys were completed. Physicians were surveyed from greater than 100
      locations. Most providers (N=173, 71%) reported using secondary prophylaxis for CDI
      prevention. The majority (N=138, 56%) were infectious disease providers. Vancomycin (N=121,
      70%) and probiotics (N=114, 66%) were most commonly used for CDI secondary prophylaxis. Of
      164 respondents who used secondary prophylaxis, 29.9% (N=49) utilized it for patients with a
      history of CDI who were receiving antibiotics, while 54.2% (N=89), used prophylaxis for
      patients with a history of recurrent CDI (more than 2 episodes) receiving antibiotics.

      Despite the lack of guideline recommendations or definitive studies to support secondary
      prophylaxis for CDI, the majority of the physicians who responded to this survey are using
      secondary prophylaxis to prevent recurrent CDI. The purpose of our study is to determine the
      effectiveness of secondary prophylaxis with oral vancomycin vs. placebo for the prevention of
      recurrent clostridium difficile infection.

    <intervention_model_description>Our primary objective is to determine the effectiveness of vancomycin in preventing recurrent Clostridium Difficile Infection (CDI) compared to placebo. Our secondary objective is to attempt to identify risk factors associated with the development of recurrent CDI.
The purpose of this study is to gain further knowledge regarding the effectiveness of vancomycin prophylaxis in preventing Clostridium difficile infections in order to guide physicians' practices. Eligible patient's will be randomized 1:1 double-blinded placebo controlled clinical trial to determine the effectiveness of vancomycin at preventing CDI. The first arm in our study would be the &quot;study drug&quot; which is oral vancomycin. The second arm would be placebo. Patient with a history of CDI admitted to Tampa General Hospital or have been seen at Infectious Disease Associates of Tampa Bay clinics are receiving systemic antibiotics and have a history of at least one episode of CDI that was diagnosed on or after 4/1/2017.</intervention_model_description>
