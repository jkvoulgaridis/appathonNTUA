  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Every year millions of mammograms are performed worldwide, representing the primary
      examination for the early diagnosis of breast cancer. Despite continuous advances in medicine
      and technology, an aspect of mammography has not changed in over fifty years: the breast is
      still compressed on the detector because this allows to reduce the thickness of the breast
      thus improving the quality of the diagnostic image and reducing the dose of radiation
      necessary to obtain a clear image. Many women perceive as painful this compression, including
      women who have been treated for breast cancer.

      Pain can discourage asymptomatic women to present themselves periodically to screening
      mammography, while an increasing number of women in follow-up after conservative surgery have
      to withstand the pain caused by mammography.

      Some studies mention various factors that are responsible for pain when performing
      mammography: breast sensitivity, anxiety level, expected pain and staff attitude. Some
      studies have also identified breast density, breast volume and menstrual phase as other
      influencing factors, although not all studies support these hypothesis. The technical
      characteristics of the equipment can greatly affect annoyance, sense of oppression, pain. The
      technological proposals to reduce the discomfort of the patients concern various items:
      flexible compressors, self-compression devices under the supervision of the technician who
      performs the positioning and the minimum initial compression, environmental factors such as
      equipment noise reduction, chromatic, sound and sensory effects (eg: aromatic diffusers).

      The aim of our study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the self-compression compared to the
      standard one, in reducing annoyance, a sense of oppression and pain, and to evaluate the
      difference of the average glandular dose given to the woman for each projection.

      Self-compression may help reaching better compression tolerating the discomfort and pain
      induced thus allowing to achieve a lower thickness, a lower glandular dose and a better
      image.

    <intervention_model_description>The study will be proposed to women presenting for a clinical mammography . Randomization will be determined by the machine's order entry system. All women will have a mammogram performed on the Pristina. In the control arm, mammography will be performed as normal clinical practice, with compression controlled by the radiographer.
In the experimental arm the radiographer will first explain to the woman how to use the self-compression device, then position the woman's breasts and reach a compression of 5 daN, that this is a minimum but sub-optimal level of compression, and that at that point the woman will have to complete the compression to reach the optimal compression level up to an acceptable pain.</intervention_model_description>

    <ipd_description>The differences in average glandular dose between the two groups will be compared with a student test if the distributions can be assimilated to a normal one and with non-parametric test in case of non-normality of the distributions.
If the average glandular dose is not lower in the study group (superiority test) and / or the proportion of women with suboptimal compression (&lt;10daN) and&gt; = in the experimental group, the image quality measured with a qualitative subjective scale of the radiologist with a non-parametric test (superiority test).
For secondary endpoints, the results will be compared between the two arms with student tests for the medium with normal distribution, non-parametric tests for non-normal distributions, while for the proportions a chi-square test will be performed.</ipd_description>
