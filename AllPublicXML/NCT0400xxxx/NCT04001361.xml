  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laser pulsed energy will be delivered over an optical fiber to create channels into damaged
      cartilage of the knee or knees. The channels have a diameter of approximately 100 microns or
      less and an approximate depth of 1 millimeter or less. Bone marrow aspirate will then be
      delivered into the damaged joint.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The creation of micro-channels into damaged knee cartilage will facilitate the movement of
      fluid into and out of the tissue to allow for more efficient nutrient diffusion. The addition
      of bone marrow aspirate will provide additional growth factor enriched nutrition to the
      tissue. The goal of this combination therapy is to facilitates the body's own reparative
      processes leading to improved patient well being.
