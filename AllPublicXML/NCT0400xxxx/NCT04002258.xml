      Objective:

      Hyperprolactinemia(HPRL) which can result in a series of prolactin-related symptoms is a
      frequent adverse effect of antipsychotics. The investigators are interested to explicate the
      characteristics of serum prolactin level change after taking different antipsychotics and
      related factors.

      Method:

        1. Review of electronic medical records of schizophrenia patients who were brought to
           Shanghai Mental Health Center since January 1, 2007.

        2. The investigators collect their information, and then

             1. set serum prolactin level after first 1-month antipsychotic treatment as primary
                outcome. Secondary outcomes are prolactin levels tested at other time points.

             2. Variables will range from antipsychotic kinds, dosage, treatment duration and blood
                concentration to demographic information, to disease history, to clinical treatment
                on hyperprolactinemia, to laboratory test results, such as blood routine
                examination, biochemistry, sex hormone levels and so on.

             3. After data cleaning and management, we will apply logistic regression, cox
                regression, Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (ROC) and machine learning to

                  -  analyze factors of prolactin level;

                  -  establish a model of prolactin change with time;

                  -  propose optimal monitoring time of prolactin according to prolactin change
                     with time;

                  -  analyze correlation among antipsychotics, prolactin and clinical characters,
                     for the purpose to supply objective evidence for antipsychotic treatment.
