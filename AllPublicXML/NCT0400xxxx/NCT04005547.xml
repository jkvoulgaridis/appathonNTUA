    <textblock>
      Teens with ASD ages 14-19 will be screened for eligibility, complete a baseline
      interviewer/ACASI-administered survey, and randomly assigned to either intervention or
      control group. The enrollment goal is 500 teens. The 12-hour intervention will be run in
      groups of up to 12 teens, with health educators leading the group and actors assisting, role
      playing with participants, and performing a skit. Teens in the intervention group will take a
      post satisfaction survey, and teens in both conditions will take a 6-month and 12-month
      interviewer/ACASI-administered outcome survey. Fidelity will be monitored by observers and
      rated by health educators.
