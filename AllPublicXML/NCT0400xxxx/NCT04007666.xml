  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The unmet need for effective addiction treatment within the criminal justice system
      &quot;represents a significant opportunity to intervene with a high-risk population&quot; according to
      NIDA's 2016-2020 strategic plan. The plan also encourages the development and evaluation of
      implementation strategies that address the needs of the criminal justice system. The proposed
      research will be conducted as part of Dr. Zielinski's Mentored Patient-Oriented Research
      Career Development Award (K23), which aims to: 1) advance knowledge on implementation of a
      gold-standard psychotherapy for trauma, Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT), in the prison
      setting and 2) examine whether prison-delivered CPT reduces drug use, psychiatric symptoms,
      and recidivism compared to a control condition (a coping-focused therapy). These foci have
      been selected because severe trauma exposure, substance use, and justice-involvement
      overwhelmingly co-occur in prison populations. The three specific aims in this research are:
      1) Use formative evaluation to identify factors that may influence implementation and uptake
      of CPT in prisons, 2) Adapt CPT for incarcerated drug users and develop a facilitation-based
      implementation guide to support its uptake, and 3) conduct a participant-randomized Hybrid II
      trial to assess effectiveness and implementation outcomes of CPT with incarcerated drug
      users. Participants will include people who have been incarcerated (pre- and post-release
      from incarceration) and prison stakeholders who will be purposively sampled based on their
      role in implementation of CPT and other programs. Anticipated enrollment across all three
      Aims is 244 adult men and women.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Post-Incarceration Drug Use</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 3 months after release from incarceration</time_frame>
    <description>Drug use will be examined as both binary responses (abstinence vs. any use) and frequency counts (number of days of use). These variables will be derived from information gained via Timeline Follow-Back Interview.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in PTSD Symptoms by Treatment End and 3 Months Post-Release from Incarceration</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment assessments will be completed within 4 weeks of treatment start. Post-treatment assessments will be completed within 2 weeks of treatment end. Post-release assessments will be completed approximately 3 months after release from prison.</time_frame>
    <description>PTSD symptoms will be assessed using the 20-item PTSD Checklist (PCL-5). Response options are used to indicate the severity of each PTSD symptom and range from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). Total scores range from 0-80. Lower scores indicate lower levels of PTSD symptoms and therefore a better treatment outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Depression Symptoms by Treatment End and 3 Months Post-Release from Incarceration</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment assessments will be completed within 4 weeks of treatment start. Post-treatment assessments will be completed within 2 weeks of treatment end. Post-release assessments will be completed approximately 3 months after release from prison.</time_frame>
    <description>Depression symptoms will be assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Response options are using to indicate the severity of each symptom of depression and range from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). Total scores range from 0-27. Lower scores indicate lower levels of depression symptoms and therefore a better treatment outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Recidivism</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months after release from incarceration</time_frame>
    <description>Recidivism will be extracted from administrative incarceration records and examined as both a binary variable (presence or absence of any drug-related recidivism) and frequency counts (number of new drug charges).</description>

    <description>CPT is a gold-standard evidence-based psychotherapy for PTSD that combines education about trauma with strategies to challenge the trauma-related cognitions that are theorized to maintain PTSD symptoms. It can be delivered in group and individual formats, but will be delivered in a group format in this project due to feasibility in the setting. Structure will be based on feedback obtained during completion of Aim 2 while remaining within the range evaluated in prior research (i.e., 8-12 sessions, 1-2x per week, each lasting 1.5-2 hours).</description>

    <description>The Coping Skills Group will match for attention and dose, without adding any cost to the system. Exact content will be determined during completion of Aim 2; however, project sites already provide coping-focused programming and coping-skill approaches to trauma treatment are a common alternative to evidence-based therapies for PTSD, such as CPT, that deal more directly with the index trauma. To provide an enhanced standard of care, the investigator will review treatment materials (workbooks, handouts) already used in prison settings and arrange a curriculum of skills similar to those in coping-focused trauma-informed interventions (e.g., psychoeducation, assertiveness).</description>
