  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trastuzumab resistance, which is a common therapeutic challenge in HER2 positive metastatic
      breast cancer, is not fully understood. Pyrotinib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor
      targeting EGFR, HER-2 and HER-4 receptors. More general inhibition of ErbB family with
      pyrotinib could provide additional benefit. This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy
      and safety of pyrotinib in combination with capecitabine in patients with HER2 positive
      locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who had early failure on or after trastuzumab
      treatment.
