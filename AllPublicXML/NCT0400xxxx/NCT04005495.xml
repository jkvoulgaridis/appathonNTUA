  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The teaching kitchen model is an innovative, multidisciplinary approach for motivating and
      establishing healthful habits and behaviors. The self-care program combines didactic
      information with experiential learning in nutrition, culinary arts, exercise, yoga, and
      mindfulness. The aim of the project is to evaluate the feasibility and acceptance of teaching
      kitchen program as a worksite wellness program at Emory University. Changes in biomarkers and
      self-reported behaviors will be evaluated up to one year.

    <description>RAND Health 36-Item scale is used to evaluate global health, quality of life, and presenteeism. All items are scored so that a high score defines a more favorable health state. In addition, each item is scored on a 0 to 100 range so that the lowest and highest possible scores are 0 and 100, respectively. Scores represent the percentage of total possible score achieved.</description>

    <measure>Change in Dietary Intake score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 10-week, and 6 and 12 months after the program</time_frame>
    <description>Dietary Intake will be assessed using the 8-item Starting The Conversation brief dietary assessment and intervention tool for health professionals. Response options for the survey items are organized into three columns: the left column indicates the most healthful dietary practices (scored 0); the center column indicates less healthful practices (scored 1); and the right column indicates the least healthful practices (scored 2). Item scores are added to create a summary score (range 0-16), with lower summary scores reflecting a more healthful diet and higher scores reflecting the greatest room for improvement.</description>

PAVS requires less than 30 seconds to administer and score</description>

    <measure>Change in Perceived Stress Scale score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 10-week, and 6 and 12 months after the program</time_frame>
    <description>The PSS-10 is a self-report instrument consisting of 10 items purported to assess &quot;how unpredictable, uncontrollable, and overloaded respondents find their lives&quot;. Each of the items on the PSS-10 are rated on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 0 (never) to 4 (very often). The PSS-10 consisted of 6 positively (items 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 and 10: Positive factor) and 4 negatively (items 4, 5, 7 and 8: Negative factor) worded items. Negative worded items were re-coded during analysis. Total scores range from 0 to 40, with higher scores indicating higher levels of perceived stress</description>

    <measure>Change in Mindfulness and Mindful Eating Scale score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 10-week, and 6 and 12 months after the program</time_frame>
    <description>Mindful eating practices will be assessed using this Mindfulness and Mindful Eating tool. Domains of the 28-item questionnaire are: Disinhibition, Awareness, External Cues, Emotional Response, and Distraction. For all items, response options are &quot;Never/Rarely,&quot; &quot;Sometimes,&quot; &quot;Often,&quot; and &quot;Usually/Always&quot;. Each item is scored from 1 to 4, where higher scores signified more mindful eating. Each subscale score is calculated as the mean of items. The summary score is the mean of the 5 subscales.</description>

    <description>The teaching kitchen program will include five 4-hour Saturday classes every other weekend over the course of 10 weeks (5 sessions totaling 20 hours of instruction). It will be taught by subject matter experts from the Emory University faculty and staff as well as potentially from the community. The classes will include the scientific rationale, practical applications, and recommendations for implementing self-care components into participants' daily lives. Experiential learning will include hands-on cooking demonstrations, mindfulness-based lunches, a yoga session, and a group exercise session. Rather than being prescriptive, the lectures and demonstrations are geared to inspire self-designed and personalized alterations in dietary patterns and behaviors that will match participants' culture, preferences, and health conditions. Biometrics and survey instruments will be assessed at 4 times: at baseline, after the 10-week program, and at 6 and 12 months after the program.</description>
