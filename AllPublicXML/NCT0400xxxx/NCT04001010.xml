  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A large number of patients with advanced cancer also suffer from cachexia. Cachexia is a
      syndrome characterized by loss of skeletal muscle mass (with/or without loss of fat mass)
      that cannot be reversed by nutritional support and progressively leads to functional
      impairment. Patients who suffer from anorexia and cachexia have lower survival rates. Some
      patients with cancer use cannabis to improve the way they feel and relieve their pain.
      However, there is very sparse high-quality research to prove that cannabis products are truly
      effective. This study will investigate patients with advanced cancer who use inhaled
      therapeutic cannabinoid-based medication (PPP011), in addition to palliative care management,
      and will assess if these patients experience improvement in functional status as a surrogate
      endpoint for survivalquality

      This is a 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group design trial
      to evaluate the safety and efficacy of inhaled PPP011 on physical functioning and cachexia
      progression in patients with cachexia related to advanced incurable cancer.
