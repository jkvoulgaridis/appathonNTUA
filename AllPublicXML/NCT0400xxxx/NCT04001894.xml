  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor reduces thrombotic events
      in patients with coronary artery disease, but these benefits come at the expense of increased
      risk of bleeding when compared with aspirin monotherapy. Increased evidence showed that P2Y12
      inhibitor monotherapy still maintain antiischemic efficacy while reducing the bleeding risk
      compared with DAPT. Therefore, the investigators performed this study to observe the efficacy
      of ticagrelor in comparison to clopidogrel in Chinese patients with stable CAD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ticagrelor is a novel, direct-acting, reversibly binding P2Y12 receptor antagonist. When
      related with clopidogrel, ticagrelor exhibits a more potent and more predictable antiplatelet
      effect with a faster onset and offset of action. Current guidelines give a recommendation on
      the use of dual antiplatelet therapy support ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily over clopidogrel 75
      mg daily in addition to aspirin in CAD patients. However, increasing evidence showed
      ticagrelor increased the risk of bleeding. Recent studies showed that P2Y12 inhibitor
      monotherapy still maintain antiischemic efficacy while reducing the bleeding risk compared
      with DAPT. So the investigators performed this randomized, single-blind, crossover clinical
      trial to observe the effects of standard-dose ticagrelor and standard-dose clopidogrel on
      platelet reactivity in Chinese patients with stable CAD.
