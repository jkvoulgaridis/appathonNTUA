  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      YIV-906 (PHY906, KD018) is an oral form of a spray-dried aqueous extract of four herbs, which
      have been used in the Orient for more than 1800 years for a variety of gastrointestinal
      symptoms including diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. Extensive clinical and pre-clinical
      research has been done indicated that YIV-906 may have synergistic anticancer activities as
      well as GI toxicity reduction to cancer treatments, including sorafenib. The proposed plan
      will investigate the efficacy and mechanisms of YIV-906 as an adjuvant to sorafenib in the
      treatment of patients with Hepatitis B(+)-associated advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.

      HCC patients with chronic HBV (+) (HBsAg(+) and IgM anti-HBc (-)), and Child-Pugh A status
      will be randomized to either the study arm (YIV-906 plus sorafenib) or control arm (placebo
      plus sorafenib) at ratio of 2:1. Patients will be stratified according to metastatic status
      (extrahepatic/vascular invasion vs. none), and their ECOG performance status (0 vs. 1) at
      randomization.

        -  ARM I: Patients receive Placebo + Sorafenib

        -  ARM II: Patients receive YIV-906+ Sorafenib

      Patients in the study arm will be treated orally each 28-day course with YIV-906 (600 mg (3
      capsules) BID) + sorafenib (400 mg BID) according to the following schedule: sorafenib BID
      daily treatment for 28 days, and YIV-906 BID 4 days on and 3 days off weekly in each course.

      All patients will be evaluated and graded for adverse events according to the NCI Common
      Terminology for Adverse Events, version 5.0 (CTCAE). The Response Evaluation Criteria in
      Solid Tumors 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) will be used to establish disease response or progression.

      Patients will be evaluated for PFS, TTP, OS, antitumor response every two cycles, and QoL and
      safety at the beginning of each cycle. Biomarkers are mandatory and will be studied prior to
      drug administration on day 1 of each cycle. Gut and oral microbiota studies as well as TCM
      Syndrome Research are optional.

      PK is only optional in China study sites, and limited to the first 15 male and 15 female
      patients. Patients will be randomized to either study drug arm or placebo arm (2:1 ratio). PK
      studied immediately prior to dose administration and at 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, and 12
      hours post-dose administration on Day 1 of Cycles 1.
