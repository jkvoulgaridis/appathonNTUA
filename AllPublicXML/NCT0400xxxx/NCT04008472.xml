  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For several decades, there is an aging population, particularly in industrialized countries.
      This lengthening of the duration of life is accompanied by an increase in the number of
      chronically ill patients. On an estimate of 15 million patients in France today, the figure
      reported for 2020 would be 20 million patients. Chronic diseases are responsible for
      functional decompensation and admission responsible autonomy breaks in nursing homes
      (Accommodation Establishment of People Dependent Elderly).

      An estimated 700,000 the number of people currently living in retirement homes in France.
      These residents are mostly dependent and multiple pathologies requiring regular general and
      specialist medical monitoring . Medical concern demographic outlook and the need for access
      to quality care across the country leads to the development of telemedicine.

      The need for telemedicine is not the same throughout the territory. It is less, or different,
      in highly urbanized areas where the density of health professionals is high, then it can be a
      new response to the needs of rural, isolated or landlocked. Telemedicine promotes the
      development of the concept of graduated care sector, especially in the management of patients
      with chronic diseases.

      Telemedicine in rural nursing homes and can be a tool for assessing, monitoring and
      coordination to avoid decompensation of chronic conditions and rehospitalization.

      This organization can afford to break the isolation of general practitioners and EHPAD
      coordinators physicians in rural areas and provide access to several specialties.

    <description>The EQ-5D (Europen Qyuality of llive) five dimension scale) questionnaire has two components: health state description and evaluation.
In the description part, health status is measured in terms of five dimensions (5D); mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Mobility dimension asks about the person's walking ability. Self-care dimension asks about the ability to wash or dress by oneself, and usual activities dimension measures performance in &quot;work, study, housework, family or leisure activities&quot;. In pain/discomfort dimension, it asks how much pain or discomfort they have, and in anxiety/depression dimension, it asks how anxious or depressed they are.
Higher values represent a worse outcome.
The scale ranges from 5 to 15.</description>
