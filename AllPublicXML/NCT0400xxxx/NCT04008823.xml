  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an epidemiological, retrospective and observational study, by reviewing clinical
      histories, of children hospitalized for influenza virus infection, their comorbidities and
      the treatments that have been performed

    <textblock>
      A better knowledge in our environment of the characteristics of the Influenza virus infection
      in the pediatric age, the clinical aspects, risk factors, the evolutionary and prognostic
      aspects, of morbidity and the direct medical costs, can allow a better management of the
      disease and a greater awareness of the importance of vaccination against influenza in the
      healthy child
