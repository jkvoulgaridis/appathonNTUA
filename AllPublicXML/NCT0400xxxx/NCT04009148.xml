  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Identification of BRCA mutations in ovarian cancer patients may help guide cancer therapies,
      prognosis, post-operative screening, and other preventative treatments beyond the initial
      diagnosis. Likewise, genetic testing of ovarian cancer patients for these germline mutations
      provides invaluable information for families regarding cancer risk, genetic testing, and
      subsequently indication for risk-reducing surgery. Cascade testing provides a unique
      opportunity to identify carriers of a deleterious BRCA mutation which can allow for surgical
      and chemoprevention of prevention of ovarian cancer. There is currently no literature on the
      rates of referral for the family members.

      The objective of this study is to perform a pilot study, offering referral to a genetic
      counseling and genetic testing for family members of a probands known to have a mutation in
      BRCA1 or BRCA2. In addition to BRCA1 and BRCA2, the NCCN suggests consideration of
      risk-reducing surgery for mutations in BRIP1, MSH2, MLH1, MSH6, PMS2, EPCAM, RAD51C, RAD51D,
      investigators will include these subjects as well in the study.
