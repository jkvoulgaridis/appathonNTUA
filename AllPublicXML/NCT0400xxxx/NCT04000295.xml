    <textblock>
      The study is conducted to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of apatinib (375 mg
      qd) and etoposide capsule (50 mg/d, d1-14, q3w) in subjects with platinum resistant or
      refractory ovarian cancer compared with weekly paclitaxel (80 mg/m2, d1, d8, d15, q3w).
