  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fatigue is one of the most prevalent and disabling symptoms of multiple sclerosis. Current
      treatments, including pharmacological, physical therapy, sleep regulation and psychological
      interventions are of marginal benefit. Pharmacological treatments have inconsistent evidence.
      Recent studies show that non-deceptive open-label placebos (OLP) have moderate-to-large
      effects on symptoms, including fatigue, in adults with a variety of medical conditions.

      Hence, this is a pilot and feasibility study to obtain data on the feasibility and effects of
      OLP for multiple sclerosis related fatigue and its impact to provide the basis for a
      competitive NIH application. This pilot study will be the first study to evaluate whether
      OLP, that garners full consent and engages patients in their wellness, may offer a safe,
      effective treatment for multiple sclerosis related fatigue.
