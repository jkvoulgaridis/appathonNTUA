  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A strength and endurance training program was conducted in adults with myotonic dystrophy
      type 1 (DM1). Participants underwent a 12-week/18-session supervised training program
      consisted of 6 exercises: elbow flexion/extension, shoulder horizontal adduction, leg press,
      and knee flexion/extension. To offer a complete training program aimed at improving function
      it was divided: the first 6 weeks were dedicated to strength-training, whereas the following
      weeks focused on endurance-training. To evaluate the effects of the training program,
      participants completed maximal strength, endurance and functional evaluations. Volunteers
      could also add a muscle biopsy at the beginning and the end of the program to evaluate
      physiological parameters.
