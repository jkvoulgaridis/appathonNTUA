      A unique approach for cancer treatment employing intratumoral diffusing alpha radiation
      emitter device for advanced pancreatic cancer.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-center, open label, single arm study. The study is designed to
      evaluate the feasibility, safety and preliminary efficacy of intratumoral alpha radiation
      mediated treatment with Alpha DaRT seeds for the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer.

      The study will be comprised of a screening period, DaRT insertion visit, acute follow-up
      phase of 4-6 weeks and a long-term follow up phase of 24 months. The total duration of the
      study will be 24 months from the DaRT insertion procedure.

      30 patients with advanced pancreatic cancer will be recruited by the investigational site.

      Eligible patients who meet inclusion/exclusion criteria (as assessed during the screening
      period) will be invited to the site for the procedure of DaRT seeds insertion. The patients
      will be monitored for a period of 24 months post insertion.
