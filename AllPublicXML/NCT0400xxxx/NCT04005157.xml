  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of electromagnetic
      navigation bronchoscopy (ENB) guided microwave ablation (MWA) for the treatment of
      early-stage peripheral lung cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as a multi-center prospective trial with one arm. There will be 5
      centers participating the study. Patients diagnosed with early-stage non-small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC) that are nonsurgical candidate will be enrolled in the study. Sixty patients
      are expected to be enrolled in the study. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of ENB guided MWA for the treatment of patients with early-stage
      nonsurgical NSCLC.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with peripheral lung nodules demonstrated to be NSCLC by pathology with the
             clinical stage of IA.

          2. The length-diameter of the tumors are more than 8 mm and no more than 30 mm.

          3. Patients are unsuitable for surgery assessed by multi-modality treatment and agree to
             the primary treatment of ablation.

          4. Patients have good compliance and sign the informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients cannot receive bronchoscopy for the severe cardiopulmonary dysfunction and
             other indications.

          2. Patients have contraindications of general anesthesia.

          3. Chest CT suggests that navigation bronchoscopy technology cannot guide treatment
             equipment to reach the peripheral lung lesion.

          4. Chest CT or bronchoscopy shows that the bronchial lumen occlusion or deformation
             leading to the guided and treatment equipment cannot reach the peripheral lung lesion.

          5. There are large blood vessels or important structures adjacent to peripheral lung
             lesion.

          6. Researchers consider the patient do not fit for the study.
