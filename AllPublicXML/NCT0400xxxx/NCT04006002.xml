  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to understand the mechanism of weight loss for weight
      loss procedures: that is Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and Endoscopic sleeve Gastroplasty.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We want to better understand the mechanisms for weight loss by understanding the anatomic and
      physiologic changes that occur with gastric restrictive procedures for weight loss and to
      determine the differences in metabolic profile between the two restrictive procedures. We
      also want to identify the rate of Gastro Esophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) in patients
      undergoing gastric restrictive procedures for weight loss.
