  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preclinical emergency management is frequently associated with a combination of physical and
      psychological stress.

      This stress is known to lead to a broad variety of changes in the physiology even extending
      in the cardiovascular system. Both physical and psychological stress induces ECG changes.
      These changes include not only arrhythmias but also deviations in ST-T segment representing
      the phase of repolarization.

      Information about changes in ST-T segment are missing until now. The investigators
      hypothesise that ST-T deviations occur in emergency physicians during shift at an emergency
      response car.

      In order to show changes in ST-T segment a prospective observational trial will be conducted.
      By using a 12 lead ECG Holter the investigators will obtain ECGs during shifts of emergency
      physicians at an emergency response vehicle.

      During 12-hour shifts emergency physicians will be attached to the 12 lead Holter ECG. ECGs
      will be analysed after blinding of names and reason of call (code) to the investigators. The
      primary outcome will be ST-T segment changes greater than 0.1mV in two corresponding leads
      for more than 30 seconds per 100 calls.

      As secondary outcomes, other ECG changes such as ST-T segment changes &lt;0.1mV, T wave
      inversion or HRV will be analysed. Furthermore, surrogate parameter of stress will be
      measured using NASA-Task Load Index and cognitive appraisal and correlated to ST-T segment
      changes. Correlations between different phases of calls, different indications of calls and
      ECG changes will be assessed. Furthermore, correlation between alarm codes apriori defined as
      stressfull using a delphi process and ST-T segment changes as well es surrogate parameters of
      stress will be assessed.
