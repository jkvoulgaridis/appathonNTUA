  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the timing and sequence of using adjunct obesity pharmacotherapy for
      adolescents with severe obesity who do not respond to lifestyle modification therapy alone.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single site, 2-staged sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) that
      will systematically examine: 1) the optimal timing (12- versus 24 weeks) for identifying
      non-responders to lifestyle modification therapy (LSMT) before starting adjunct
      pharmacotherapy with phentermine and 2) for non-responders to phentermine+LSMT, the relative
      effect of adding topiramate to phentermine+LSMT versus switching to topiramate
      monotherapy+LSMT. All participants will receive a total of 48 weeks of intervention.
      Participant characteristics that differentially predict outcomes and mechanisms that may
      account for the relative effects will also be examined.

    <masking_description>At baseline, each participant will be randomized 1:1 to either the 12-week (Arm 1) or 24-week (Arm 2) response assessment to LSMT. This randomization will be blinded to the participant, investigator, and outcomes assessor for the duration of the study; i.e. up until 48 weeks.
The second randomization includes only those participants who are non-responders to phentermine+LSMT. Each non-responder to phentermine+LSMT will be re-randomized 1:1 to either topiramate+phentermine+LSMT or topiramate+placebo+LSMT. Participants, investigators, and outcomes assessors will be blinded to phentermine/placebo. The topiramate will be open label.</masking_description>

    <description>Participants in this arm will start LSMT at baseline and have a weight loss response assessment at T=12 weeks: if body mass index (BMI) is down 5% at T=12 weeks, the participant will continue with LSMT for the remainder of the study (i.e. for another 36 weeks); if BMI is not down 5% at T=12 weeks, the participant will add phentermine to LSMT (phentermine+LSMT) and undergo a second weight loss response assessment after 12 weeks of phentermine+LSMT; i.e. at T=24 weeks. At T=24 weeks, if BMI is down 5% with phentermine+LSMT, the participant will continue with phentermine+LSMT for the the remainder of study (i.e. for another 24 weeks); if BMI is not down by 5% at T=24 weeks, the participant will be randomized to topiramate+phentermine+LSMT or topiramate+placebo+LSMT for the remainder of the study (i.e. for another 24 weeks).</description>

    <description>LSMT will consist of both in-person and by telephone sessions delivered throughout the entirety of the 48-week intervention phase. Each session will last 30-60 minutes. A trained study coordinator (a registered dietician or someone trained by our registered dietician) will delivery this therapy which consists of counseling using education, goal setting and barrier reduction. Topics covered will include calories, tracking, healthy food choices, reducing high fat, added sugar foods, setting goals and portions, changing the quality of your diet, volumetrics, purposeful activity, quick and easy meals, problem solving, food cues and eating patterns, emotional eating, accurate tracking, eating away from home, unhelpful thoughts, structured menus and the role of protein, social cues, managing stress, slips and relapse prevention, long-term physical activity and overcoming obstacles, high-risk situation and keys to success, motivation and looking to the future (long-term plans).</description>

    <description>Phentermine will be started only if a participant does not lose 5% of BMI after 12 or 24 weeks of LSMT depending on their random assignment. Subjects will take 15 mg of phentermine every morning for 12 weeks at which time there will be an assessment of weight loss. Subjects who achieve 5% or more BMI reduction after 12 weeks of phentermine will continue 15 mg every morning for the remainder of the study (through week 48) along with their LSMT.</description>

    <description>Participants who do no not achieve at least 5% BMI reduction after 12 weeks of phentermine+LSMT will be re-randomized 1:1 to either topiramate+phentermine+LSMT or topiramate+placebo+LSMT. Topiramate dosing will begin at 50 mg every morning for the first 7 days, and then increase to 100 mg every morning through week 48. At the end of week 48 the taper off will be 50 mg every morning for 7 days and then discontinue.</description>
