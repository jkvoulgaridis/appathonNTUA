  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Justification: The diaphragm is the main inspiratory muscle. Its dysfunction therefore
      compromises ventilation, which is necessary for gas exchange. Diaphragmatic dysfunction is
      frequently observed in resuscitation patients. Diaphragm ultrasound is currently a simple and
      validated technique for measuring the function of the diaphragm in intensive care. However,
      the discontinuity of the measurements is one of the major limitations of the current,
      standard ultrasonic evaluation of diaphragm function. Respinor AS (Oslo, Norway) has
      developed an ultrasound device (known as RESPINOR DXT) for continuous quantification of
      diaphragmatic excursion and velocity.

      Aims of the study: To evaluate the feasibility of the continuous monitoring of the
      diaphragmatic excursion using RESPINOR DXT in patients undergoing MV in the intensive care
      unit, to ensure its reliability and to establish a link between the diaphragmatic excursion
      and the weaning outcome of MV.

      Method: In addition to continuous diaphragm monitoring by RESPINOR DXT, a daily measurement
      of the diaphragm excursion will be performed using a conventional ultrasound system for
      comparison. A daily measurement of the oesophageal pressure (Pes) and the gastric pressure
      (Pga) will be performed, thus allowing the calculation of the transdiaphragmatic pressure
      (Pdi).

      Analysis: The feasibility of the measurement will be evaluated through user utility questions
      as well as the time spent with a signal meeting specific quality criteria. Its reliability
      will be studied by the concordance between the measurements of the excursion measured by
      RESPINOR DXT and by standard ultrasound (Bland-Altman, Passing-Bablock). It will be further
      evaluated by the correlation between the variations of the excursion measured by RESPINOR DXT
      and the Pdi variations. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves will be performed to
      identify the optimal diaphragmatic excursion threshold for predicting weaning success and
      prognosis.

      Hypothesis: It is anticipated that the present study will show that the continuous monitoring
      of diaphragm excursion by RESPINOR DXT is reliable. Further, it is anticipated that there
      will be a statistical link between the diaphragmatic excursion and velocity of the movement
      measured by RESPINOR DXT before, during and after the spontaneous breathing trial.
