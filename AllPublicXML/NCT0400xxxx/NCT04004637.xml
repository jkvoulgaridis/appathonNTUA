    <description>Biological: CD7 CAR-T cells infusion. Pretreatment: patients enrolled in this study will receive cyclophosphamide or fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide. CD7 CAR-T cells infusion are allowed within 2 weeks after treatment.
CD7 CAR-T cells infusion: 30-60 minutes before infusion, H1 anti-histamine agents are applied (acetaminophen 30mg,po.; promethazine 25mg,i.v. ; diphenhydramine 0.5-1mg/kg, no more than 50mg.). Non-physiological doses of corticosteroids are not applied for patients during treatment or recovery unless a life-threatening emergency occurs. CD7 CAR-T cells are infused into patients for one or two times, the number of infused CD7 CAR-T cells are 0.5-5×10^6/kg.</description>
