  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational, Pre-phase 1 study of biomarkers in patients with
      mucopolysaccharidosis type II (MPS II), also known as Hunter syndrome.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2-part, prospective, multicenter, observational study of patients with MPS II to
      characterize disease-related biomarkers in urine, blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Part 1
      will include MPS II patients who are 2 -10 years and Part 2 will include MPS II patients who
      are 2 -30 years old at the time of enrollment. All patients may be on approved therapies for
      MPS II; no investigational treatment will be administered.

        Key Eligibility Criteria (Part 1):

          -  Patients aged 2 through 10 years with a confirmed diagnosis of MPS II based on
             iduronate 2-sulfatase (IDS) enzyme activity and documented mutation in the IDS gene

          -  Neuronopathic MPS II (nMPS II) subgroup: patients with a development quotient (DQ) &lt;85
