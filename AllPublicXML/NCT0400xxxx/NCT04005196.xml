  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      EEG phase synchrony and variability has had limited investigation during transition from coma
      to wakefulness in response to sedation and analgesia. Studying changes in phase synchrony and
      variability during and after sedative-induced coma is an exciting opportunity to better
      understand EEG changes during transitions in states of arousal. It is expected that
      consciousness should be higher in entropy and greater in complexity in the number of
      configurations of pairwise connections as compared to sedative-induced coma. If sufficiently
      sensitive, it may be possible to identify states of lower entropy and fewer configurations
      when patient are aroused but with altered sensorium (e.g. delirium).

      Aim 1: To quantify EEG phase synchrony changes, both globally and locally by brain region,
      during emergence from medically induced coma required for performance of a cardiovascular
      related operation (deep sedation defined as a Riker Sedation-Agitation Scale [SAS] of 1-2).

      Hypothesis: The global R-index will be increased above baseline at multiple frequency
      bandwidths and the magnitude of R-index will correlate with the sedative dosage (as a crude
      measure of depth). The rate of fluctuations of the R-index will decrease with deeper
      sedation.

      Aim 2: To compare the magnitude of the EEG phase synchrony globally and locally in patients
      emerging from coma; a patient's pre-anesthesia phase will serve as a control.

      Hypothesis: Fluctuations in R-index will vary; fluctuations will be greater in awake adults
      as compared to while comatose or emerging from coma.

      Aim 3: To determine EEG phase synchrony changes in patients with and without delirium during
      their CVICU stay.

      Hypothesis: Lower scores of R-index consistent with increased phase synchrony and lower
      spatio-temporal variability will be seen while delirious as compared to days when patients
      are not delirious.

    <description>Data recording will continue up until a maximum of 120 hours after emergence from sedation or at CVICU discharge. This study period is informed by baseline data from our institution where the median duration of delirium following emergence from coma was 2 days, allowing sufficient time to capture transitions from coma to wakefulness with and without delirium. EEG recordings will be divided in to epochs corresponding to coma, wakefulness, and delirium if present.</description>

        Population: Adults aged 30 - 65 years, invasively mechanically ventilated for a first-time
        CABG or single valve replacement surgery; Exposure: R-index measured at different states of
        consciousness (awake, emerging from comatosed state, and transitional states between) after
        standardized induction with opioid and benzodiazepine with or without propofol;
        postoperative sedation in CVICU with propofol or other; Outcome: Delirium as measured by
        the Confusion Assessment Method-ICU (CAM-ICU).
