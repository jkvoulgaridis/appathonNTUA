      The study will follow a prospective cohort of racially and economically diverse mothers of
      premature infants for 3 weeks following delivery to test whether antenatal education of the
      support person of mothers may decrease time to initiation of breast pumping, decrease time to
      lactogenesis stage II and increase breast milk production.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Compelling evidence exists that breast milk helps protect premature infants from
      prematurity-specific morbidities, including feeding intolerance, late onset sepsis, and
      necrotizing enterocolitis. Unfortunately, mothers of VLBW infants often exhibit delayed
      lactogenesis stage II (when the milk &quot;comes in&quot;) and inadequate breast milk production.
      Earlier initiation of breast milk expression following delivery is associated with increased
      lactation success. However, lack of nursing time and lack of hospital personal are
      significant barriers to the early initiation of milk expression in this population. The
      proposed study will follow a prospective cohort of racially and economically diverse mothers
      of premature infants for 3 weeks following delivery to test 1 primary aim and 1 secondary
      aim. Aim 1: will evaluate the feasibility of antenatal BM pumping education for SPs of
      mothers of preterm infants. Issues related to recruitment, randomization acceptance of the
      intervention, and refinement of the education materials and process will be scrutinized. Aim
      2 will estimate variability of outcome measurements and effect sizes needed to calculate the
      sample size for a subsequent larger, adequately powered, randomized clinical trial. Eligible
      women and their SP will be randomly assigned to one of two groups. Group 1 will receive a
      prenatally delivered lactation educational program including video recordings, a
      demonstration of how the pump works and will have a breast pump available in their room. The
      volume of breast milk produced, timing of lactation stage II, duration of lactation and
      stress during initial expression will be measured. In addition, breast milk sodium levels
      will be analyzed on Day 1-7, Day 14 and 21.
