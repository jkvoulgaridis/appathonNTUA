  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The recommendations on the method and the realization of the cervico-uterine smears are
      clear. With regard to performing endocervical curettage, several methods are possible without
      precise consensus. In general, the Kevorkian curette is widely used. However, it is often
      reported by doctors and patients that curettage is painful. Some articles show that the
      cytobrush would be less painful. While keeping a percentage of correct curettage failures, it
      is sought to show that the cytobrush would improve the comfort of the patient during
      curettage.

    <description>the brush would be inserted in full until the display of the brush in the endocervical canal disappears. A neck quadrant scan (= quarter turn) will be performed from front to back while simultaneously rotating the brush clockwise, for a total of 3 laps. This would represent 4 sweeps per turn, ie 12 sweeps in total</description>

    <description>the colposcopist holds the curette horizontally and scrapes the endocervical canal all the way around. He realizes 1 small firm and linear movement by quarter turn or 4 movements to realize a complete turn. During this act, the curette must remain inside the canal, and during its extraction, care should be taken not to rotate it so as not to spill the collected tissue contained in the basket of the curette. The tissue material thus obtained must be rapidly immersed in formalin</description>
