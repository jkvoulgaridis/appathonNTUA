  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many different factors affect running performance, transcranial direct current stimulation
      (tDCS) is a widely used and available neuromodulation tool and could hypothetically
      facilitate the supraspinal drive and thereby act upstream of the motor cortex to prolong the
      muscles work in time to exhaustion trials. While it appears to decrease the rating of
      perceived exertion (RPE) during cycling, little is known about the effects of tDCS on
      physiological performance parameters such as maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max), maximal
      aerobic speed (MAS) and lactate thresholds in runners.

      The aim of this prospective randomized sham-controlled clinical trial is to investigate the
      physiological effects of tDCS applied over the motor cortex on perceived exertion and
      performance-related parameters measured by an incremental treadmill test to exhaustion.

      This research thus aims at answering the following questions:

        1. Is active tDCS applied bilaterally over the motor cortex significantly more efficient
           than sham tDCS to improve the TTE?

        2. Does active tDCS decreases the RPE, as compared to sham?

        3. Is there any significant difference between active and sham tDCS on the physiological
           parameters measured during an incremental test to exhaustion, namely: VO2max, MAS,
           respiratory exchange ratio, blood lactate levels, maximal heart rate?

        4. Does the baseline level of physical fitness influences response to tDCS?

      The investigators hypothesize that 1) performance as measured by time to exertion will be
      increased following active and not sham tDCS due to a decreased perceived rate of exertion
      without significantly altering the other physiological parameters; and 2) performance as
      measured by incremental treadmill test to exhaustion will be more improved in recreational as
      compared to trained runners.

    <description>RPE will be assessed continuously (every 3 minutes) during the time to exhaustion trial using the Borg rating of perceived exertion scale (RPE scale). The Borg RPE scale is a quantitative measure of perceived exertion during physical activity. The scale starts with &quot;no feeling of exertion,&quot; which rates a 6, and ends with &quot;very, very hard,&quot; which rates a 20. Moderate activities register 11 to 14 on the Borg scale (&quot;fairly light&quot; to &quot;somewhat hard&quot;), while vigorous activities usually rate a 15 or higher (&quot;hard&quot; to &quot;very, very hard&quot;).</description>

    <description>The active session of tDCS will consist in applying two anodes over M1 bilaterally (C3 and C4 according to the 10-20 international EEG placement) and the cathodes over the occipital areas (O1 and O2), and to inject 2 mA for 20 minutes through sponge electrodes (35 cm²) placed on the scalp using the Startsim 8 (Neuroelectrics, Barcelona). The sham tDCS will use the same montage and device but direct current will only be injected for 30 seconds, with a ramp-up and ramp-down 15 seconds period, to mimic the somatosensory effects of active tDCS.</description>
