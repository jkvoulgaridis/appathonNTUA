    <textblock>
      The study is designed to evaluate the clinical changes in gingival health by measuring the
      reduction of gingival bleeding and inflammation over 4 weeks. Additionally plaque removal
      will be evaluated after a single use and over 4 weeks.

      Data will be analyzed and reported as mean. The target population is approximately 70 healthy
      adult volunteers. There will be two groups with a total of 35 subjects per group. Subjects
      will be randomized using a simple random sample. A computer-generated randomization schedule
      will be prepared by the study statistician. Based on the randomization schedule, patients
      will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either:

      With 35 subjects per group, the study will have 90% power to detect an average reduction in
      the percent of sites with BOP of 25%.

      The primary outcome will be the reduction in the percentage of sites with bleeding on probing
      (BOP) after 4 weeks.

      Reduction in the percentage of sites with BOP after 2 weeks (+/- 2 days). Reduction in the
      MGI after 2 (+/- 2 days) and 4 weeks. Reduction in RMNPI Pre &amp; post, 2 weeks and 4 weeks (=/-
      2 days)

      Data will include whole mouth, approximal, marginal, facial, and lingual analysis for all
      indices. Intraoral examination will be performed and any adverse events will be reported and
      followed up.

      Subjects will complete a questionnaire at the completion of the study.
