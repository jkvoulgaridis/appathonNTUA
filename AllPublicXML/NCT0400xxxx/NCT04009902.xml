  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to compare the depression and sleep disturbances of operated
      endometriosis patients before and after the operation. The main objective here is to provide
      data on how patients' psychological states and sleep patterns are affected by the symptoms of
      endometriosis and how these effects can be corrected. In this way, it is aimed to determine
      whether the patients have psychological support needs and to give the planned treatment due
      to endometriosis in the early period. As a secondary goal, it is planned to keep the patients
      in follow-up with their improved sleep and psychological conditions, and to improve their
      adherence to treatment and quality of life.
