  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary embolism is a frequent and recurrent pathology, especially in the elderly. It is
      often preventable, with high mortality and morbidity, making it a major public health issue.
      The clinical presentation of pulmonary embolism is non-specific and very highly variable,
      ranging from asymptomatic thrombus diagnosed incidentally to sudden death. The current
      diagnosis of pulmonary embolism is based on several diagnostic techniques, mainly
      non-invasive, which should be used sequentially.

      We propose to sample the volatile organic compounds using a device that allows them to be
      trapped on polymer cartridges. Sampling will be performed under monitoring of respiratory
      pressure and a capnograph to collect alveolar and upper respiratory tract air separately
      without contamination of the oral cavity or sinuses.

      This exploratory metabolic analysis will be non-targeted (analysis of all molecules
      detectable without a priori).

      The main objective of the study is to identify specific metabolic profiles to predict the
      results of ventilation-perfusion pulmonary tomoscintigraphy in subjects undergoing this
      examination for suspected acute pulmonary embolism.

      Secondary purposes :

        -  To identify metabolic profiles to be used to predict, in combination with clinical
           probability scores, the results of ventilation-perfusion pulmonary tomoscintigraphy in
           subjects undergoing this examination for suspected acute pulmonary embolism.;

        -  To correlate metabolic profiles with the topography of embolized lung territories
