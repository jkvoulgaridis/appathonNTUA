  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, single-arm, and open-label clinical trial to evaluate the coronary
      artery lesions (CALs) at 2 and 7 weeks after single dose of IGIV 10% (2 g/kg) administration
      for at least 12 hours to evaluate the efficacy and safety of IGIV 10%.
