  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Music has been consistently shown magic power in brain plasticity. Several study proved music
      can influence electronic activity of preterm infants' brain, while none study covered region
      oxygen metabolic. The investigators aim to discover the effects of music therapy on
      near-infrared spectroscopy and electroencephalogram in premature infants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies of music therapy have made some achievements for adult Parkinson's disease,
      schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress and pediatric autism spectrum
      disorders. For newborns, studies mainly focused on the effects of basic vital signs, feeding
      and pain score decreasing. So far, no studies evaluating the effect of music therapy on brain
      oxygen metabolic and electronic activity.

    <description>electroencephalogram to monitor brain electronic activity, using Burdjalov developed cerebral function monitoring scoring system which including: (1)record continuity: assessed through observing the overall density of the sample tracing, scores ranged from 0 to 2；(2) presence of cyclic changes：refers to the emergence and progression of periods during monitoring，scores ranged from 0 to 5；（3）degree of voltage amplitude depression：estimated as the average lower microvolt level during the recording epoch ，scores ranged from 0 to 2；（4）bandwidth：reflects a combination of the voltage span (peak-to-trough) of the tracing and the magnitude of the electroencephalogram depression，scores ranged from 0 to 4. The minimum possible total score was 0, and the maximum was 13. Scores progressively increased with central nerve system maturation.</description>
