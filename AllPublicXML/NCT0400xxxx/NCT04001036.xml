  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial. The aim is to compare the effects of the
      peritoneal dialysis solution IPX15, containing glucose (0.5%), xylitol (1.5%) and L-carnitine
      (0.02%) as osmotic agents (comparable to the standard 2.5% glucose PD solution), for the
      nocturnal exchange with the PD solution IPX07, containing glucose (0.5%), xylitol (0.7%) and
      L-carnitine (0.02%) as osmotic agents (comparable to the standard 1.5% glucose PD solution),
      for the diurnal (short dwell) exchanges. Planned total recruitment is 40 patients with stable
      end-stage renal disease (ESRD) treated by continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD).
      Treatment duration will be 4 weeks plus a 4 weeks safety follow up with no treatment.
