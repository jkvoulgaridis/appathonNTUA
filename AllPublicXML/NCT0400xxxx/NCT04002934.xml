    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this study is to assess the efficacy of bazedoxifene (BZA) as
      remyelinating agent in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS).

      The investigators will utilize electrophysiologic techniques and magnetic resonance imaging
      to quantify the effect of treatment in 50 women over the course of 6 months.

      Participants may remain on their standard disease modifying treatment during the course of
      the trial but may not concurrently participate in any other investigational new drug research
      study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurologic disorder characterized by the loss of myelin,
      which results in disruption of nerve signal, damage to axons, and, ultimately,
      neurodegeneration. In order to treat MS, new methods for promoting repair (remyelination) are
      sorely needed.

      There is a strong preclinical (including EAE) and epidemiologic rationale for investigating
      the remyelinating potential of estrogenic compounds, including evidence of endogenous
      (puberty, postpartum periods) and exogenous hormonal influences on MS risk and course. MS
      affects 3 times more women than men, and disease course in women appears overall less
      aggressive (on MRI, fewer T2-hyperintense demyelinated lesions develop into axonal
      destruction visualized as hypointense T1 &quot;black holes&quot;).

      Bazedoxifene (BZA), a third-generation SERM with extensive safety data in humans, was
      identified in a novel high-throughput screen (BIMA screen) for compounds capable of promoting
      remyelination. Subsequent analysis validated BZA's remyelinating effect in vitro and in vivo
      following demyelinating insult. Given strong pre-clinical support for BZA's remyelinating
      potential, and the clinical success of other compounds identified using the BIMA screen
      (Green et al., 2017), the investigators will investigate the use of BZA as a remyelinating
      therapy in patients with MS.

    <description>The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of BZA relative to placebo for reducing P100 latencies on full field transient pattern reversal visual evoked potentials (VEPs). In response to a visual stimulus, cortically generated electrical potentials (VEPs) recorded over the scalp are used to measure the functional integrity of visual pathways.</description>
