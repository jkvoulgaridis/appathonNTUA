  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a biology driven, monocentric study, designed to identify biomarkers of activity of
      trabectedin in patients with advanced non-L soft-tissue sarcoma. The aim of this study is to
      implement high-throughput profiling technologies to identify predictive biomarkers of
      trabectedin efficacy through sequential tumor biopsies and blood sample collection in sarcoma
      patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The identification of predictive biomarkers of the clinical benefit of trabectedin is a
      crucial issue to identify potential responders particularly for non-L sarcomas. Considering
      that the molecular profile of STS can change over time, an analysis of archival tumor
      material may not be a reliable method to identify predictive biomarkers of response, and thus
      high-throughput technologies may be promising to identify STS markers for prediction of
      response to trabectedin. For study purpose, blood and tumor samples will be obtained for
      genetic and immunological profiling at baseline, during treatment by trabectedin and at
      disease progression.

             fibrous tumors, hemangioendothelioma, desmoplastic round cell tumors, synovial
             sarcomas. As per the Frech NCI recommendation, diagnosis must be reviewed or confirmed
             by the RRePS Network (Réseau de Référence en Pathologie des Sarcomes des tissus mous
             et des Viscères),

          3. Locally advanced/unresectable and/or metastatic disease,

          4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 2 (Appendix 1),

          5. Measurable disease according to RECIST v1.1,

          6. Indication of trabectedin according to market authorization,

          7. At least one target lesion that can be biopsied for research,

          8. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test before study
             entry,

          9. Patient with a social security in compliance with the French law,

         10. Voluntary signed and dated written informed consent prior to any study specific
             procedure,

             to use a medically acceptable method of contraception throughout the treatment period
             and for 5 months after discontinuation of trabectedin. Subjects of childbearing
             potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have not been free from
             menses for &gt;=1 year.

          2. Known hypersensitivity to any of its components,

          3. Patients with an active serious or uncontrolled infection upon investigator judgement,
