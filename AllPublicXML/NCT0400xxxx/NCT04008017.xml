  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a type of obstructive lung disease characterized by
      long-term breathing problems and poor airflow. It is changed to acute exacerbation of Chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease when respiratory symptoms worsen, beyond normal day-to-day
      variations, severely enough that changes in medication are required.

      Inflammation is a core feature of acute exacerbation of Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
      since it gives insight into the pathological changes causing an exacerbation. Eosinophils may
      play a significant role in airway inflammation in some patients with Chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease.

      Previous studies have indicated that eosinophilic airway inflammation is also associated with
      the development of severe acute exacerbation of Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
      Eosinophilic Cationic Protein has various biological activities, including antibacterial,
      antiviral, antiparasitic and neurotoxic functions, and it contributes to the regulation of
      fibroblast activity. Eosinophilic Cationic Protein also induces airway mucus secretion and
      interacts with the coagulation and complement systems. Eosinophilic Cationic Protein has been
      developed as a marker for eosinophilic disease and quantified in biological fluids including
      serum, bronchoalveolar lavage and nasal secretions. It is found in diseases such as allergic
      asthma and allergic rhinitis but also occasionally in other diseases. Only activated
      eosinophil granulocytes release the granule content and therefore the determination of
      Eosinophilic Cationic Protein concentration is a considerably more specific indicator of
      eosinophil inflammation than eosinophil granulocyte count in peripheral blood as serum
      Eosinophilic Cationic Protein levels increase during acute exacerbation of Chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease
