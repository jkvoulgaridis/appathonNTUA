      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficiency of personalized targeted
      therapy in combination with high-dose chemotherapy as part of a preparative regimen before
      T-depleted allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in children with chemoresistant
      acute leukemias

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The outcome of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in a cohort of children with
      chemorefractory leukemia is poor. The incidence of relapse exceeds 50% and survival varies
      from 10 to 40%. Additional attempts at remission induction with various combinations of
      chemotherapy are unlikely to improve the outcome and will contribute to toxicity.

      The hypothesis of the study is that personalized targeted therapy combined with high-dose
      chemotherapy may improve the outcome of allogeneic HSCT in a cohort of pediatric patients
      with refractory leukemia.

      Bcl-2, CD38, CD184 were chosen as potential targets due to frequent expression in pediatric
      acute leukemias, availability of marketed targeted therapies venetoclax, daratumumab and
      prelixafor, and expected non-overlapping toxicity profile of these agents and the
      conditioning regimen.
