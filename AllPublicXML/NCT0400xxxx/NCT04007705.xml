  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized clinical trial, aimed to analyse the effects of a potentially
      anti-inflammatory nutritional intervention in disease assessment parameters, inflammatory
      markers, and quality of life of Fibromyalgia patients. Patients in the intervention group
      will adopt an anti-inflammatory diet and a diet with a low ingestion of fermentable oligo-,
      di- and monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs), for a 3 months period. Group control will
      adopt a diet based on general recommendations for healthy eating in accordance with the World
      Health Organization.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The presence of low grade intestinal inflammation has been reported in Fibromyalgia (FM)
      patients. Other studies associate the persistence of symptoms described in FM to possible
      alterations of the intestinal microbiota composition, i.e. dysbiosis, with consequent
      existence of Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO). A sample of 100 female patients
      diagnosed with FM, followed-up at Portuguese Rheumathology Institute in Lisbon, will be
      distributed randomly in two groups. Group 1 will adopt an anti-inflammatory diet, which is
      characterized by the exemption of the intake of potentially inflammatory foods, namely
      gluten, dairy and ultra-processed foods, over a consecutive period of 3 months. During the
      first month, a low FODMAPs diet will be implemented, along with the anti-inflammatory diet,
      followed by the reintroduction of all fruits and vegetables over a consecutive period of 2
      months, for a total of 3 months of intervention. Group 2 will adopt a diet based on general
      recommendations for healthy eating in accordance with the World Health Organization. The
      Ethics Committee of the Portuguese Institute of Rheumathology approved this intervention
      study.

      The results of this study are expected to determine whether a change in patient nutrition
      helps to alleviate symptoms, which would optimize medical intervention.
