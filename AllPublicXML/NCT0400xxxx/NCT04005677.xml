    <textblock>
      The researchers are aimed to investigate the early diagnosis of pulmonary nodule based on
      DNA, RNA, protein, metabolites through analyzing the serum, urine and clinical
      characteristics.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      By recruiting people with pulmonary nodules identified by CT scans, three groups are
      confirmed as the lung cancer group, the benign lung nodule group who are identified by
      pathological analysis, and the small lung nodule group that should be followed up. Then the
      serum, the urine and the clinical characteristics including age, sex, smoking status, BMI,
      address, greening environment are collected to analyze the ctDNA, RNA, protein, metabolites,
      immune status and their relationships with the tumorigenesis and the gene mutation of lung
      cancer.
