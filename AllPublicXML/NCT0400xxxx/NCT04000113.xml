  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to previous studies, the quality of subjective sleep in women is generally worse
      than that of men. Although studies have shown that menopausal women who use hormone therapy
      can improve sleep disorders, the limited benefits of hormone therapy are reported, the
      duration of treatment and efficacy required is uncertain. The suspicions of the safety of
      hormone therapy have deterred many menopausal women.

      Systematic review and meta-analysis show that acupuncture and related therapies (including
      electro-acupuncture, ear needle, body acupoint massage and ear acupoint massage, etc.) used
      in the study of insomnia treatment have a significant therapeutic effect. However, for the
      reason that most of them are invasive treatments, patients receiving such treatment are often
      afraid and hesitated. This study will apply the low-energy laser acupuncture treatment trials
      to menopausal women with insomnia. Sixty perimenopausal female volunteer subjects with 45-60
      years of age who have been assessed and screened for sleep disorders will be recruited and
      participate in this experiment. After completing the basic data and various related scales,
      the subjects will undergo a double-blind, randomly allocated and controlled clinical trials.
      The experimental procedure is that the subjects will be placed in a soundproof, lying on a
      comfortable bed. After the instruments setting ready, subject receives the monitoring of
      5-minute heart rate variability (HRV) measurements before and after the near-infrared laser
      acupuncture (10mWx10) treatment, a total of 30 minutes experimental process. The results of
      the analysis will be based on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality index (PSQI) questionnaire, the
      Insomnia Severe Index scale (ISI) data as the main assessment results for analysis. The
      Menopause Rating Scale, (MRS), the Beck Depression Inventory Index scale (BDI-II) and the
      signal measurements of heart rate variability will be analyzed as secondary assessment
      grounds. Data of the questionnaires will be analyzed by the statistical method of Pair-t test
      for the comparison of the data before and after trial. The signal data of heart rate
      variability are analyzed by the two way ANOVA method. We expect that by way of combination of
      low-energy laser light irradiation method and theory of effective acupoints for insomnia can
      effectively improve the quality of sleep in peri-menopausal women.

      According to previous studies, the quality of subjective sleep in women is generally worse
      than that of men. The prevalence rate can be dramatically increased from 30% before menopause
      to 50% during menopausal transition. Although studies have shown that menopausal women who
      use hormone therapy can improve sleep disorders caused by hot flashes, night sweats, sleep
      disorders, such as sleep apnea, the limited benefits of hormone therapy are reported, the
      duration of treatment and efficacy required is uncertain. The doubts about the safety of
      hormone therapy have deterred many menopausal women.

      Systematic review and meta-analysis show that acupuncture and related therapies (including
      electroacupuncture, ear needle, body acupoint massage and ear acupoint massage, etc.) used in
      the study of insomnia treatment have a significant therapeutic effect. However, for the
      reason that most of them are invasive treatments, patients receiving such treatment are often
      afraid and hesitated. This study will apply the low-energy laser acupuncture treatment trials
      to menopausal women with insomnia. Sixty perimenopausal female volunteer subjects with 45-60
      years of age who have been assessed and screened for sleep disorders will be recruited and
      participate in this experiment. After completing the basic data and various related scales,
      the subjects will undergo a double-blind, randomly allocated and controlled clinical trials.
      The experimental procedure is that the subjects will be placed in a soundproof, undisturbed
      clinic room, lying on a comfortable bed and a pillow and covered by a thin blanket. After the
      instruments setting ready, subject lie by first for 10 minutes, then a 5-minute heart rate
      variability (HRV) measurement recording is underwent, followed by low-dose near-infrared
      laser acupuncture (10mWx10) treatment for 5 minutes, then subject lie by again for 5 minutes,
      and another 5 minutes of heart rate variability instrument recording followed, a total of 30
      minutes experimental process. Acupoints of treatment will include both sides of the Sleep 1
      (EXTRA-1), both sides of the Neiguan (PC-6), both sides of Shemen (HT-7), both sides of the
      Sanyinjiao (SP-3), both sides of the Taichung (LI-3),total of 10 acupoints. The results of
      the analysis will be based on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality index (PSQI) questionnaire, the
      Insomnia Severe Index scale (ISI) data as the main assessment results for analysis. The
      Menopause Rating Scale, (MRS), the Beck Drepression Inventory Index scale (BDI-II) and the
      signal measurements of heart rate variability will be analyzed as secondary assessment
      grounds. Data of the questionnaires will be analyzed by the statistical method of Pair-t test
      for the comparison of the data before and after trial. The signal data of heart rate
      variability are analyzed by the two way ANOVA method. We expect that by way of combination of
      low-energy laser light irradiation method and theory of effective acupoint for insomnia can
      effectively improve the quality of sleep in perimenopausal women. The experiment will start
      on June, 2019.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality index (PSQI) questionnaire,</measure>
    <time_frame>scores change between baseline and after last treatment(one month later)</time_frame>
    <description>The 2I-item PSQI yields a global score, which represents the sum of seven individual component scores: sUbjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances (including items such as feeling pain, having difficulty breathing), use of medications for sleep and daytime dysfunction (including items related to daytime sleepiness and energy).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>the Insomnia Severe Index scale (ISI)</measure>
    <time_frame>scores change between baseline and after last treatment(two weeks and one month later)</time_frame>
    <description>The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) is composed of seven items that evaluate: (a) the severity of sleep-onset (initial), (b) sleep maintenance (middle), (c) early morning awakening (terminal) problems, (d) satisfaction with current sleep pattern, (e) interference with daily functioning, (f) noticeability of impairment attributed to the sleep problem, and (g) level of distress caused by the sleep problem. Each of these items is rated on a five-point Likert scale (&quot;0&quot; = not at all, &quot;4&quot;= extremely) and the time interval is &quot;in the last 2 weeks&quot;. Total scores range from 0 to 28, with high scores indicating greater insomnia severity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Menopause Rating Scale (MRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>scores change between baseline and after last treatment(one month later)</time_frame>
    <description>The score increases point by point with increasing severity of subjectively perceived symptoms in each of the 11 items (severity 0 [no complaints] 4 scoring points [very severe symptoms]). The respondent provides the subject's personal perception by checking one of 5 possible boxes of &quot;severity&quot; for each of the items.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Beck Inventory Index scale (BDI-II)</measure>
    <time_frame>scores change between baseline and after last treatment(one month later)</time_frame>
    <description>The BDI-II is a 21-item self-report measure of the severity of depressive symptomatology. Each of the 21 items is rated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0-3. The rating are summed, yielding a total score that can range from 0-63.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The signal measurements of heart rate variability</measure>
    <time_frame>change of nLF and HFcomponents of HRV from baseline and after last treatment.(one month later)</time_frame>
    <description>Frequency-domain analysis of heart rate variability (HRV), a noninvasive method, has been used to reflect cardiac autonomic nervous activity in humans. The high-frequency power (HF; 0.15-0.4 Hz) of HRV represents vagal (parasympathetic) control of heart rate. The low-frequency power (LF; 0.04- 0.15 Hz) of HRV is jointly contributed by both sympathetic and vagal nerves, whereas normalized LF (nLF) is regarded as the sympathetic modulation.An elevated LF component and a decreased HF component of the HRV have been found in women with insomnia when they are compared with healthy women.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>sleep diary</measure>
    <time_frame>scores change between baseline and after last treatment(one month later)</time_frame>
    <description>The sleep diary provides daily subjective estimates of sleep parameters including: daytime nap, sleep aids intake, bedtime, sleep onset latency, frequency of nocturnal awakenings, awakenings duration, wake-up time, arising time, feeling upon arising (five-point scale) and sleep quality (five-point scale).</description>
