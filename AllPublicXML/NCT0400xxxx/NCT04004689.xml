  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronicle obstructive pulmonary disease is a worldwide cause of mortality and morbidity. This
      systemic disease progressively leads to dyspnea, muscle wasting and exercise capacity
      impairment.

      Pulmonary rehabilitation is a cornerstone in the management of these systemic effects.
      Unfortunately, access to pulmonary rehabilitation is limited for many people who would
      benefit from it, primarily because of a lack of pulmonary rehabilitation and assessment
      centers. Optimal assessment should include cardiopulmonary exercise testing to determine both
      the optimal training settings as well as any cardiopulmonary contraindications to pulmonary
      rehabilitation. However, this is not available in most centers and when it is, consultations
      are limited. Therefore, pulmonary rehabilitation is often delayed for several weeks and
      patients can lose motivation.

      In order to promote pulmonary rehabilitation, the incremental cardiopulmonary exercise
      testing could be replaced by field tests to individualize pulmonary rehabilitation
      prescription.

      The 6-minute stepper test is a new field tool. Its sensitivity and reproducibility have
      previously been reported in patients with chronicle obstructive pulmonary disease. It is easy
      to set up in the clinical setting and could be used to individualize pulmonary
      rehabilitation.

      The aim of this study was to develop and validate a prediction equation to set rehabilitation
      intensity for patients with severe to very severe chronicle obstructive pulmonary disease
      attending pulmonary rehabilitation, with the use of a simple, readily available field test.
      Therefore the investigators sought to determine, if it exists, a relationship between the
      plateau heart rate from the first and last 3 minutes of the 6-minute stepper test and the
      heart rate from the first ventilatory threshold from the cardiopulmonary exercise testing in
      order to individualize pulmonary rehabilitation in patients with severe to very severe
      chronicle obstructive pulmonary disease.

      Experimental design:

      The validation of the six-minute stepper test to prescribe endurance training in severe to
      very severe chronicle obstructive pulmonary disease involves two steps :

        1. Patients with severe to very severe chronicle obstructive pulmonary disease who
           performed an incremental cardiopulmonary exercise testing and are referred to pulmonary
           rehabilitation will be approached to participate in the study.

           Eligible patients who agree to participate in the study and sign informed consent will
           perform two six-minute stepper test. Their performance and heart rate (first and last
           3minutes) will be compared with those obtained at the first ventilatory threshold from
           the previously performed incremental cardiopulmonary exercise testing (usually used for
           the prescription of endurance training in pulmonary rehabilitation) using multiple
           regression in order to derive a predictive equation.

        2. The validity of this predictive equation will be assessed in an independent
           cross-validation group issued from a completed multicenter observational study
           (NCT03244137). This cross-validation group will be formed with those patients of this
           cohort who performed both the incremental cardiopulmonary exercise testing (and had a
           determined first ventilatory threshold) and the six-minute stepper test. The heart rate
           prescription for endurance training from the direct measurement of the the first
           ventilatory threshold will be compared to the heart rate derived from the
           6minute-stepper test using the predictive equation determined in step 1. Data will be
           compared using the mean absolute difference between both prescriptions and a
           Bland-Altman analysis.

    <description>Every patient referred to pulmonary rehabilitation program will be eligible. They will perform cardiopulmonary exercise testing prior to join the rehabilitation program.
During the first session of pulmonary rehabilitation, they will perform 2 6-minute stepper test with a rest of 20 minutes minimum between each test.</description>

    <intervention_name>2 times : 6-minute stepper test with a rest of 20min between each test.</intervention_name>
    <description>Patients will perform two 6-minute stepper tests separated by a rest period of at least 20 minutes. The second test will begin when the heart rate and the transcutaneous oxygen saturation values will be returned to baseline values. Standardization of the instructions for the test will be based on the actual guidelines for the 6-minute walk test.
The test will be performed in an isolated room in order to avoid noise or external stimuli which can affect performance. The stepper will be placed near a door and the patient was allowed to put a hand on it if out of balance or exhausted. The height of the step will be fixed to 20 cm. A step was defined as the rise and lowering of one foot. The patient was informed of the time each minute. No other encouragement was given. Heart rate and transcutaneous oxygen saturation will be continuously recorded by a pulse oximetry.</description>
