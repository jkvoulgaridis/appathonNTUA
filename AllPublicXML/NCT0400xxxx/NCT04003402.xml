  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the potential for pharmacokinetic (PK) and
      pharmacodynamics (PD) interactions between ASP8062 and alcohol.

      This study will also assess safety and tolerability of a single dose of ASP8062 with or
      without alcohol.

      Participants will be admitted to the clinical unit on day -1 of each period and will be
      residential for 6 days/5 nights. Participants will be discharged from the clinical unit on
      day 5 of each period on the condition that all required assessments have been performed and
      that there are no medical reasons for a longer stay in the clinical unit. Participants will
      return to the clinical unit on days 7 and 10 for pharmacokinetic blood sampling.

    <measure>Safety and tolerability assessed by nature, frequency, and severity of Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 55 Days (End of Study)</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events (AEs) will be coded using medical dictionary for regulatory activities (MedDRA). An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered an Investigational Product (IP), and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of IP whether or not considered related to the IP.</description>
