  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this multi-center study is to investigate the effect of a multi-wave LED
      light bed on blood pressure and endothelial function in pre-hypertensive and mildly
      hypertensive adults.

      Subjects will be instructed to lay in the bed for 20 minutes on their stomach followed by 20
      minutes on their back for a total of 40 minutes three times per week for 8 weeks. Subjects
      will be instructed to begin light treatment on Day 1 after baseline measurements have been
      collected. Subjects will be required to visit a Wellness Center of Dr. Bryan or Hypertension
      Institute in Nashville, informed of the study and if agreed will sign the consent form. After
      consent, subjects will be required to spend about 30 minutes to get baseline measurements.
      Subjects will then be required to lie in bed for 40 minutes each day three days per week for
      8 weeks. Blood pressure and endothelial function tests will be recorded at baseline and after
      each light treatment.
