  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Delirium is a common complication following hip fracture surgery (HFS) in older people.
      Postoperative hypoxia has also been associated with delirium, but not specifically in
      geriatric patients. The aim of the study is to demonstrate that post-operative hypoxia is
      associated with in-hospital complications in patients with HFS.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients hospitalized in orthogeriatric unit after HFS will be monitored for nocturnal SpO2
      with a pulse oximeter continuously during 3 nights. In-hospital complications will be
      recorded prospectively in all patients, especially the occurrence of delirium with the CAM
      scale. The hypoxia vs non-hypoxia (more than 20% of the time spent with SpO2&lt;90%) groups will
      be analyzed for clinical characteristics, comorbidities and medication use.

      The statistical association between severe post-operative nocturnal hypoxemia and occurrence
      of delirium will be assessed. The dependance between this association and daytime SpO2 will
      also be assessed. The potential confirmation of an association between post-operative
      nocturnal hypoxemia in patients with HFS and the occurrence of delirium will lead the
      reflection on a clinical trial testing the benefit of oxygen therapy in the prevention of
      post-operative delirium, to improve the medical care of orthogeriatric patients.
