      The purpose for this study is to determine safety and effectiveness of the oxyhydrogen
      generator with nebulizer through a therapy for improving symptoms in patients with acute
      exacerbations of copd.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, patients with acute exacerbations of copd who were included in both treatment
      and control groups, administered randomly oxyhydrogen generator with nebulizer (treatment
      group) or oxygen Nebulizer Machine (control group for the therapy. The therapeutic outcomes
      in both treatment and control groups are analyzed and evaluated to verify safety and
      effectiveness of the test product. This study is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind
      study. The trial lasted for about 10 days. The curative effect was observed for subjects in
      the First, the second, the third, the fourth, the fifth, the sixth, the seventh day,
      respectively as the observing time point. Total patients which are planned to be included are
      108 cases, where, 54 cases in the treatment group and control group respectively are
      distributed in 10 clinical hospitals
