  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single-center, randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trial. The main
      purpose of this study is to evaluate if hemoperfusion is sufficient to improve the prognosis
      of acute type A aortic dissection patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass and deep
      hypothermia circulatory arrest.

    <intervention_name>Hemoperfusion</intervention_name>
    <description>Hemoperfusion is achieved by blood filtration with a hemoperfusion device. Specifically, the hemoperfusion device composed of multiple parallel resin cartridges is connected in parallel to the oxygenator and blood reservoir and perfused at a rate of 200-250ml/min. The purpose of hemoperfusion is to decrease inflammatory mediators produced during cardiopulmonary bypass through resin cartridges adsorption, such as cytokines, free hemoglobin and other toxins. The ultimate goal of hemoperfusion is to decrease postoperative complications, improve postoperative recovery, and eventually shorten the length of hospital stay.</description>
