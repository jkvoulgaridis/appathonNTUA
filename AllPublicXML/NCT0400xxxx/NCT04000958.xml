  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to determine whether the optimized inhalation therapy based on peak
      inspiratory flow rates (PIFR) measured against the simulated resistance can reduce the rate
      of treatment failure in patients recovering from acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease (AECOPD). Errors in inhaler use and quality of life are also to be
      evaluated.

      The study will recruit 460 patients with AECOPD whose exacerbated symptoms are relieved by
      5-7 days of standard therapy. The participants are divided into PIFR group and control group
      in a 1:1 ratio according to a random number table method. All the patients will be given
      inhaled corticosteroid（ICS）/long-acting β agonist（LABA） (budesonide/ formoterolSymbicort
      turbuhaler® 160/4.5 μg bid or Beclometasone/ Formoterol Foster® pressure metered dose
      inhaler(pMDI) 100/6 μg 2 puff bid). For symptomatic patients before acute exacerbation,
      Spiriva handihaler® 18μg qd or Spiriva respimat® 2.5μg qd will be prescribed in combination
      with ICS/LABA. For PIFR group, PIFR is measured by InCheck DIAL(Clement Clarke International
      Ltd, Harlow, UK and Alliance Tech Medical). If PIFR is less than 60L/min , the patient will
      be given pMDI with spacer. If PIFR value is over 60 L/min, the patient will be given dry
      powder inhaler(DPI).). The control group will be given DPI or pMDI with spacer according to
      the judgment of a respiratory physician. Both groups will be taught to use the device after
      the prescription, and then be reminded to use medication via a WeChat public account.

      The primary endpoint of the study is the 30-day treatment failure including AECOPD recurrence
      resulting in an emergency visit, admission, or need for intensified medication). The
      secondary endpoints of the study are the error rate of inhalation device use, satisfaction
      with inhalation devices, symptoms and quality of life, 30-day mortality, chronic obstructive
      pulmonary diseases(COPD)-related treatment costs and PIFR.

    <description>Patients' satisfaction with inhalation devices will be assessed by the following items. If the patient meets any of the following, the result will be unsatisfactory:
The patient has forgotten to use the inhaler.
The patient has forgotten to use the inhaler in the last two weeks.
The patient has reduced the frequency of using inhaler without medical advice.
The patient has forgotten to bring an inhaler when traveling or leaving home.
The patient has quitted the inhaler without medical advice when feeling his condition improved.
The patient has felt it difficult to comply with the COPD treatment plan.
The patient has felt it difficult to use the inhaler.</description>

    <description>COPD assessment test(CAT) is used to assess patient's symptoms. The CAT scale range is from 0 to 40. A score of 0-10 indicates the patient is slightly affected by COPD. A score of 11-20 indicates the patient is moderately affected by COPD. A score of 21-30 indicates the patient is seriously affected by COPD. A score of 31-40 indicates the patient is extremely affected by COPD.</description>

    <description>Peak inspiratory flow rates(PIFR) will be measured using the InCheck DIAL(Clement Clarke International Ltd, Harlow, UK and Alliance Tech Medical). The InCheck DIAL is accurate to +/− 10% or 10 L/min, whichever is greater, and can measure flows in the range of 15 to 120 L/min. Dry powder inhaler(DPI) is to be prescribed if PIFRr is over 60L/min, otherwise pressure metered dose inhaler(pMDI) with spacer is given. All the patients will be given inhaled corticosteroid（ICS）/long-acting β agonist（LABA）. For symptomatic patients, long-acting anticholinergic agents(LAMA) will also be used.</description>
