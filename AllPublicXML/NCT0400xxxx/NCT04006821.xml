      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PD-1 antibody combined
      with apatinib mesylate in patients with unresectable, local advanced recurrent or metastatic
      serum AFP-elevated gastric adenocarcinoma, who have at least received first-line antitumor
      therapy or whose standard treatment is intolerable.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AFP-elevated gastric adenocarcinoma is a special type of gastric cancer, with the
      characteristics of high risk of liver and lymph node metastasis, poor therapeutic effect, and
      prognosis.

      This prospective study is a single-arm, open-label, multi-center phase II clinical trial to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of PD-1 antibody combined with apatinib mesylate in patients
      with unresectable, local advanced recurrent or metastatic serum AFP-elevated gastric
      adenocarcinoma, who have at least received first-line antitumor therapy or whose standard
      treatment is intolerable.

      AFP elevation is defined as serum AFP &gt; 20 ng/ml. In this prospective study, the objective
      remission rate (ORR) will be used as primary outcome measures and 30 patients will be
      recruited. PD-1 antibody combined with apatinib mesylate will be administered. PD-L1
      expression and TMB will be measured before treatment. In addition, the dynamic changes of
      serum AFP levels, T lymphocyte in peripheral blood will be monitored before each treatment
      cycle. In the course of treatment, safety evaluation will be carried out according to the
      standard of adverse reaction classification (CTCAE) 4.0.
