  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The WHO (World Health Organisation) estimated the prevalence of diabetes to be 422 million
      people in 2014, compared to 108 million in 1980. This has led to an increasing number of
      diabetic patients referred to nephrologists for diagnostic purposes. Diabetic nephropathy is
      the most common renal disease in this population and is usually a presumptive diagnosis based
      on clinical and biological features although microscopic examination of a renal sample
      acquired through renal biopsy is the only way to be certain of this diagnosis. However,
      kidney biopsy is an invasive procedure carrying a low but incontestable risk of adverse event
      such as post-procedural pain and bleeding. Consequently, nephrologist around the world feel
      that renal biopsy should only be performed in patients with type 2 diabetes to detect
      non-diabetic renal disease, when the diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy is dubious or
      unlikely. This likeliness is based on the presence or absence of typical feature such as
      diabetic retinopathy, hematuria, progressive decline of renal function or increase of
      proteinuria, long duration of diabetes, nephrotic syndrome. These feature were identified by
      the comparison of patients with type 2 diabetes and non-diabetic renal disease (alone or
      associated to diabetic nephropathy) and isolated diabetic nephropathy.

      However, it is not known if the presence (or absence) of these atypical features by
      themselves are indeed signs of non-diabetic renal disease and necessitate to perform renal
      biopsy. The aim of the study is to determine if these atypical features are relevant
      indications to perform renal biopsy. To answer this question, will be analyze the medical
      records of patients with type 2 diabetes who underwent renal biopsy in five French nephrology
      center to determine, in each case, the indication of the biopsy and if this latter benefitted
      the patients.

      In addition, will be evaluate the prognosis value of the Renal Pathology Society
      classification of diabetic nephropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes and diabetic
      nephropathy.

      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the accuracy of kidney biopsies indications in
      patients with type 2 diabetes to diagnose non-diabetic renal disease based on canonical
      atypical features (Absence of diabetic retinopathy, Low or rapidly decreasing GFR, Rapidly
      increasing proteinuria or nephrotic syndrome and Presence of active urinary sediment. This
      study is a retrospective observational case only study, recruiting patients over 18 years old
      with type 2 diabetes who underwent kidney biopsy in five French nephrology centers between
      2006 and 2015.

      Will be collected demographical, clinical and biological data at the time of the renal biopsy
      and at the last follow-up from the patients' medical charts.

      Indications for renal biopsy will be categorized as

        1. Atypical feature of etiological significance in the presence of any atypical feature not
           listed below (including acute kidney injury as defined by the stage 1 of KDIG
           guidelines)

        2. Brutal nephrotic syndrome in the absence of the above criterion

        3. Rapid decline of GFR (defined as 50 % eGFR decline over &gt;1 week but &lt; 1 year) in the
           absence of criteria 1-2

        4. Absence of proteinuria in the absence of criteria 1-3

        5. Rapid increase of proteinuria in the absence of criteria 1-4

        6. Presence of hematuria in the absence of criteria 1-5

        7. Absence of diabetic retinopathy in the absence of criteria 1-6 Will be evaluate the
           actual probability to reach a non-diabetic renal disease for each of these indications.

      Will be also perform a classical analysis by assessing the association of clinical and
      biological feature such as HbA1c, diabetes duration, absence of diabetic retinopathy,… with
      the presence of a non-diabetic renal disease.

      In addition, the biopsy samples will be scored according to the RPS diabetic nephropathy
      classification to evaluate the prognostic value of this classification.
