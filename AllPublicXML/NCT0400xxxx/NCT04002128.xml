      The goals of this study were to investigate whether two anesthesia regimens, with and without
      N2O, and bacterial colonization influence respiratory complications after major abdominal
      surgery for cancer.

      A study was approved by institutional ethics committee. All patients were informed on the
      study protocol by attending anesthesiologist on the day of the surgery and written informed
      consent was obtained. Patients with clinically or radiologically confirmed acute respiratory
      infections or those using antibiotics due to the respiratory infections a week prior to the
      surgery were not included in the study. Following risk factors were recorded in all patients:
      age, sex, weight loss in the last 6 months, comorbidities and operative time. Comorbidities
      were rated using ASA status and Charlson comorbidity index by 3 independent observers.
      Charlson comorbidity index was calculated after pathological examination. An advanced
      malignant disease was considered if tumor had infiltrated other organs or surrounding
      tissues, or when positive lymph nodes or metastases were confirmed.

      A group of 120 colorectal, gastric, or pancreatic cancer patients scheduled for surgery in
      the single centre were included in the prospective randomized study regardless of their ASA
      physical status. Nasopharyngeal smears were obtained in the preoperative area and tracheal
      aspirates were obtained in the operating room at the end of the surgery with a sterile
      suction catheter in a closed system.

      Postoperative Hgb; CRP and lung auscultation were done in all patients on the second and
      fourth postoperative day.

      Outcome measures registered were:

        -  Postoperative pneumonia

        -  Productive and difficult cough

        -  Dysphonia

        -  Congestive heart failure

        -  postoperative complications, including hypertensive crisis, thromboembolic and infective
           complications were summarized one year after surgical treatment was finished &amp; one year
           survival

    <description>Group air was mechanically ventilated using 35% oxygen in 65% air during the whole surgical procedure.
Thiopental sodium was used for induction of anesthesia, muscle relaxation was maintained with vecuronium. General anesthesia with sevoflurane was maintained during the surgical procedure. Intraoperative analgesia was achieved with fentanyl boluses.</description>

    <description>Group N2O was mechanically ventilated using 35 % oxygen and 65 % of nitrous oxyde during the surgical procedure.
Nitrous oxyde may increase cuff pressure during the general endotracheal anesthesia and result in the respiratory symptoms like sore throat, hoarseness and postoperative cough.
