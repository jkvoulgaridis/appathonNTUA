      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Sintilimab in combination
      with Pegaspargase and anlotinib in the treatment of stage IV NK/T-cell lymphoma patients
      unfit for high-dose chemotherapy.

    <textblock>
      Stage IV NK/T-cell lymphoma has a poor prognosis, and autologous hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation can improve the prognosis of patients who have achieved remission after
      chemotherapy. The median survival time for patients who were not suitable for transplantation
      was about 1 year. Asparaginase is the backbone drug for the treatment of NK/T-cell lymphoma.
      PD-1 antibody is effective for relapsed/refractory NK/T-cell lymphoma. Our previous study
      found that anlotinib is active in relapsed/refractory NK/T Cell lymphoma. This study is aimed
      to investigate the efficacy and safety of Sintilimab, a PD-1 antibody approved in China, in
      combination with Pegaspargase and anlotinib in the treatment of stage IV NK/T-cell lymphoma
      patients unfit for high-dose chemotherapy.
