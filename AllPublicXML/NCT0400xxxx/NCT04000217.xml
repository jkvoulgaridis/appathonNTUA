  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare the efficacy of two different versions of a brief
      online exposure therapy program for PTSD: written versus verbal trauma narrative recounting
      in reducing PTSD symptom severity. Both treatments will be delivered through an interactive
      online program with coaching from a trained peer support specialist. Treatment will be a
      variable length, such that 4 to 8 sessions will be delivered, depending on each participants'
      rate of PTSD symptom recovery.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Post Traumatic Stress Disorder CheckList for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual - 5 (PCL-5; Weathers, et al., 2013)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in total score from baseline to 3-months post treatment (approximately 14-18 weeks).</time_frame>
    <description>Self report measure of PTSD symptoms. A total symptom severity score (range - 0-80) can be obtained by summing the scores for each of the 20 items. Higher scores indicate greater PTSD severity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9; Kroenke, Spitzer, &amp; Williams, 2001).</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in total score from baseline to 3-months post treatment (approximately 14-18 weeks).</time_frame>
    <description>Self report measure of depression symptoms. It is the 9-item measure that yields a total score of 0-27, with higher scores indicating greater depressive symptom severity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Brief version of the difficulties in emotion regulation scale (DERS-16; Bjureberg et al,. 2016)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in total score from baseline to 3-months post treatment (approximately 14-18 weeks).</time_frame>
    <description>A 16-item self report measure of difficulties in emotion regulation. Total scores on the DERS-16 can range from 16 to 80, with higher scores reflecting greater levels of emotion dysregulation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS; Mundt et al., 2002)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in total score from baseline to 3-months post treatment (approximately 14-18 weeks).</time_frame>
    <description>A 5-item self-report measure of work and social functioning and impact of symptoms. Total scores range from 0-40 with higher scores indicating greater impairment.</description>

    <description>Written exposure therapy (Sloan et al., 2012) is a brief evidence-based treatment for PTSD (US Dept. of VA &amp; DoD, 2017), wherein patients are asked to write about their trauma memories for 30 minutes, with therapist instruction and feedback before and after each writing exercise.</description>

    <description>Imaginal exposure therapy will involve verbal recounting of trauma memories for 30 minutes with therapist instruction and feedback before and after each recounting exercise.</description>
