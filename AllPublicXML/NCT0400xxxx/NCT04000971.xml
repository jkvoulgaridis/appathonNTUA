  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is the 5th leading cause of death and the leading cause of adult disability in the
      United States (US). Stroke is a complex disease with multiple interacting risk factors
      (including genetic, high blood pressure and cholesterol, and lifestyle factors like smoking,
      diet, and exercise) that lead to initial and recurrent stroke. Up to 90% of stroke survivors
      have some functional deficit that impacts both physical and mental health.

      Scientific evidence that identifies the best stroke care delivery design is lacking. We
      completed a three-year, Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) Health Care Innovation
      Award that tested a new stroke care design called an Integrated Practice Unit (IPU). This IPU
      was developed through stakeholder input from patients, caregivers, nurses, stroke
      specialists, rehabilitation specialists, patient advocacy groups, payers, and technology
      companies. This IPU design was associated with decreased hospital length of stay,
      readmissions, and stroke recurrence, as well as lower cost.

      Based on the CMS study, a larger, pragmatic trial was developed that is called C3FIT
      (Coordinated, Collaborative, Comprehensive, Family-based, Integrated, and Technology-enabled
      Stroke Care). C3FIT will randomly assign 18 US hospital sites to continue Joint
      Commission-certified Comprehensive/Primary (CSC/PSC) design or to the novel Integrated Stroke
      Practice Unit (ISPU) design for stroke care. C3FIT's ISPU uses team-based, enhanced
      collaboration (called Stroke Central) and follows patients from presentation at the Emergency
      Department (ED) through 12-months post-discharge (called Stroke Mobile). Stroke Mobile
      includes a nurse and lay health educator team who visit patients and caregivers at home or at
      a rehabilitation or skilled nursing facility to assess function and quality of life using
      telehealth technology to facilitate access to multiple providers. Results from C3FIT will
      provide high quality scientific evidence to determine the best stroke care design that
      ensures positive health for patients and caregivers.

          -  Already enrolled or planned enrollment in another clinical trial for which
             participation in C3FIT would be compromised with regard to follow-up assessment of

          -  Patients with a planned admission to hospice care prior to consent.

          -  Patients not anticipated to survive for 1 year due to neurological or other medical
             status (i.e., advanced cancer, hospice care, heart disease, etc.).

          -  Patients who in the opinion of the site investigator cannot be involved in follow up
             care.

          -  Inability or unwillingness of subject or legal guardian/representative to understand
