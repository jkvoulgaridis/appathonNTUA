  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effect of anterior gastropexy (one or more sutures fixing the
      stomach to the inner abdominal wall) on improving durability of paraesophageal hernia repair.
      Half of participants will receive anterior gastropexy, while the other half will not. The
      hypothesis is that anterior gastropexy will help to prevent paraesophageal hernias from
      recurring.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Paraesophageal hernias are hernias in which the stomach and/or other abdominal organs
      herniate through the diaphragm into the chest. This abnormal anatomy can lead to acid reflux,
      trouble swallowing, and shortness of breath, and can also be a risk factor for surgical
      emergencies involving the stomach. For these reasons, the Society of American
      Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons has strongly recommended that all symptomatic
      paraesophageal hernias be repaired.

      These repairs are technically challenging, and the best available evidence suggests that more
      than half of patients undergoing repair will have radiographic hernia recurrence at 5 years
      after surgery. There has been suggestion that use of anterior gastropexy - in which suture is
      used to affix the stomach to the anterior abdomen - may reduce recurrence rates. However, it
      is uncertain whether this data is reliable. While some surgeons use anterior gastropexy
      routinely because they believe it reduces recurrence, other surgeons do not use anterior
      gastropexy due to the concern that patients will have short-term pain at the suture site.
      This study aims to evaluate the effect of using anterior gastropexy on recurrence rates after
      paraesophageal hernia repair, compared to not using anterior gastropexy.

    <description>The Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease Health-Related Quality of Life (GERD-HRQL) is a 10-item instrument to quantify symptom severity in gastroesophageal reflux disease. Scores on individual items are summed and may range from 0 to 50, with higher scores indicating greater severity of symptoms and worse quality of life. Additionally, there is a question about global satisfaction with quality of life, which may be answered as &quot;satisfied,&quot; &quot;neutral,&quot; or &quot;dissatisfied.&quot; The percentages of these categories will be reported.</description>

    <description>Eight symptoms that are potentially related to the presence of a paraesophageal hernia will be assessed on a scale ranging from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating more significant impact on quality of life. Symptoms include regurgitation, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, postprandial pain, cardiovascular, and pulmonary symptoms. Each symptom will be reported separately.</description>

    <description>Two permanent sutures will be introduced into the abdomen and placed along the lesser curvature of the stomach. A suture passer will be used to grasp the ends of the sutures to externalize them at separate fascial punctures. At time of abdominal desufflation, the sutures will be tied and the incision closed per individual surgeon practice.</description>
