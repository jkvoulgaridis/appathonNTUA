  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to assess the ability to swallow the scored film-coated
      darunavir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (D/C/F/TAF) fixed-dose combination
      (FDC) tablet, irrespective of the mode of intake (whole and split tablet).

      This study will be performed in 24 human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infected
      pediatric participants. This study is being conducted to obtain data needed to assist in
      further pediatric development of D/C/F/TAF by assessing the acceptability of the scored
      film-coated D/C/F/TAF FDC tablet administered as a matching placebo tablet in a pediatric
      population. At Day 1, each participant will sequentially take 2 placebo tablets and the
      sequence of placebo tablet, swallowed whole or as split tablet, is assigned by computer
      generated randomization. After each intake period (within 15 minutes and before the next
      intake period, as applicable), participants will be asked to fill out an acceptability
      questionnaires. Every attempt should be made for the participant to complete the
      questionnaire (marking the correct box to correspond with their impact of taking the placebo
      tablet). Caregivers may explain the wording/text in the questionnaire to aid in completion.
      If a participant and his or her caregiver have difficulties in completing the questionnaire,
      then the study-site personnel may assist. Primarily ability to swallow the scored film-coated
      D/C/F/TAF FDC tablet, irrespective of the mode of intake will be assessed. Participants
      safety will be evaluated throughout the study from signing of the Informed Consent Form
      (ICF)/Assent Form onwards until the last study-related visit.
