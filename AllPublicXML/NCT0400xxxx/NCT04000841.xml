    <textblock>
      Over a 12-week period the investigators will test whether, compared to the Waitlist-Control
      (WC) condition, administration of the full CRSR intervention improves participants
      self-reported outcomes of stress, self-efficacy, mindfulness, use of mindfulness strategies,
      and knowledge. The investigators also will examine the usability, cultural relevance, and
      user satisfaction.

      The proposed intervention, Culturally Responsible Stress Reduction: A Mobile Mindfulness
      Application to Support Health Promotion for African Americans (CRSR), is designed to
      encourage the use of mindfulness to mitigate the disproportionate amount of stress-related
      health disparities facing African Americans. Current mindfulness approaches have been
      unsuccessful in engaging this population. This proposal aims to bridge this disparity by
      developing an mHealth (mobile health) mindfulness application (&quot;app&quot;) tailored specifically
      to the cultural values of the African American community.

      Mindfulness involves meditative practices that cultivate purposeful and nonjudgmental
      attention to current thoughts, emotions, and physical sensations in the body. Mindfulness has
      been incorporated into widely-used interventions, including Acceptance and Commitment Therapy
      (ACT). The CRSR app will be grounded in ACT and will integrate the convenience of mobile
      technology with tailored content to allow users to shift from potentially harmful culturally
      prescribed stress-coping activities (e.g., self-reliance, emotional suppression) to adaptive
      mindfulness-based stress-coping activities aligned with culturally specific values. This
      integration of content, backed by theory and empirical evidence, effective instructional
      delivery, an interdisciplinary development team, and modern communication technology will
      produce an effective mHealth intervention.

      The CRSR app features include guided meditations to connect the user to the present moment
      and a place of calm through culturally aligned exercises grounded in spirituality, orality,
      self-empowerment, and resilience; personalized notifications prompting users to reflect and
      engage with the app; periodic email messages on the importance mindfulness as a way increase
      control over physical and psychological health; and user-customized reminders.

      Phase I included developing a testable prototype of the CRSR app, called Mindful You. The
      prototype provided functionality for participants to practice mindfulness and was used to
      test proof of concept, i.e., the feasibility and social acceptability of the CRSR app. Users
      experienced significantly decreased stress and increased self-efficacy. They also reported
      increased use of mindfulness behaviors and improved self-regulation. Phase II will
      iteratively build on the prototype to develop the final product and test its efficacy with a
      fully-powered randomized controlled trial.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Perceived Stress</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Stress will be assessed using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), a 10-item frequency scale that evaluates the amount of stress in one's life.Scale ranges from 1 (never) to 4 (very often) with higher scores indicating more stress, therefore decreases at posttest would indicate better outcomes. The scores are averaged to get a total score on the scale which has good internal reliability (alpha = .90 in Phase I).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Emotion Regulation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Emotion regulation will be assessed by the Difficulty in Emotion Regulation Scale Short Form (DERS-SF), a 18 item frequency scale ranging from 1 (almost never; 0-10%) to 5 (almost always; 91-100%) with higher scores indicating less emotional regulation (negative change scores indicate better outcomes). Single score and 6 subscales (strategies, non-acceptance, impulse, goals, awareness, and clarity) can be analyzed as either total score or average scores. Total scores on the full scale range from 18 to 90. Subscales have three items each, thus total scores on the subscales range from 3 to 15.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Mindfulness</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Mindfulness will be assessed by the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ), a 24-item frequency scale with scores ranging from 1 (never) to 5 (very often). This scale provides subscales with four having five items each (describe, act with awareness, nonjudgmental, and non-reactance) and on having four items (observe). Total scores range from 5 to 25 on the five-item subscales and 4 to 20 on the four-item subscale, with higher scores indicating indicating more mindfulness. Thus positive changes at posttest indicate better outcomes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Attitudes toward Mindfulness</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Attitudes toward general use of mindfulness techniques as well as program specific recommendations, affective responses towards the items, and outcome expectancies will be measured using the Attitudes Towards Mindfulness Scale (MTMS), a 10-item scale developed in Phase I. The MTMS is a 10-item Likert-like scale, on a 5 point scale ranging from 1 &quot;strongly disagree&quot; to 5 &quot;strongly agree&quot; which measured positive attitudes towards mindfulness strategies (higher change scores indicate a better outcome). Example items included &quot;Practicing mindfulness can help me reduce my stress&quot; and &quot;Knowing what I am thinking in the moment is important&quot;. The MTMS demonstrated strong internal reliability during Phase I (alpha = .91 at pretest and .94 at posttest). The average score of the scale is used in analysis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Perceived Behavioral Control</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Perceived Behavioral Control (self-efficacy) will be measured using the Mindfulness Self-Efficacy Scale (MSES) a 12-item Likert-like scale developed in Phase I based on the content about ability and competence in stress reduction through mindfulness. The MSES evaluated self-efficacy, by asking how confident on a 5 point scale ranging from 1 &quot;not at all confident&quot; to 5 &quot;very confident&quot; participants were in their ability to use the skills taught in the course, for example &quot;Take time to breathe&quot; and &quot;Pay attention to tasks in the moment&quot;. Higher scores indicated greater self-efficacy (better outcome). The MSES demonstrated strong internal reliability in Phase I (alpha = .90 at pretest and .91 at posttest). The average score of the scale is used in analysis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Mindfulness Behaviors</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Mindfulness Behaviors i.e., actual behavioral change, will be assessed through the Mindfulness Behavior Usage Scale (MBUS) a self-report of 12 mindfulness activities as well as usage data provided through the app. The MBUS is a 12-item frequency scale, asking how often in the last week participants engaged in mindfulness strategies, ranging from 1 &quot;never' to 4 &quot;daily&quot; (higher change scores indicate better outcomes). For example, &quot;How often did you take time to breathe&quot; and &quot;Pay attention to tasks in the moment&quot;. The MBUS demonstrated good internal reliability (alpha = .94 at pretest and .90 at posttest).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Knowledge of Mindfulness</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Knowledge about mindfulness techniques will be assessed pre- and post- to determine the extent to which participants understand basic knowledge delivered during the intervention. Knowledge items will be derived from the conceptual and practical content. In Phase I we used a 10-item multiple-choice assessment of participants' knowledge about mindfulness. For Phase II additional items will be added to reflect the new information presented in the program.</description>
