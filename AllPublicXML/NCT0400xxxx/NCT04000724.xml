    <textblock>
      TechStep is a three-arm, technology-based randomized controlled trial (RCT), with a stepped
      care approach, among high-risk HIV-negative transgender feminine, transgender masculine, and
      gender non-conforming youth and young adults for reducing sexual risk behaviors and
      increasing pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) uptake. Participants are randomized into one of
      three conditions for a 6-month intervention: Group 1: culturally relevant theory-based text
      messages (Text+Step); or, Group 2: culturally relevant mobile-enhanced website (WebApp+Step);
      or, Group 3: informational website control condition with no theoretically based text
      messages or WebApp.

      TechStep is a three-arm, technology-based randomized controlled trial (RCT), with a stepped
      care approach, among high-risk HIV-negative transgender feminine, transgender masculine, and
      gender non-conforming youth and young adults for reducing sexual risk behaviors and
      increasing PrEP uptake. Transgender youth and young adults are enrolled for 9 months in the
      RCT. During the RCT, 250 participants will be enrolled and randomized to either: (1) text
      messaging (n=83), (2) WebApp (n=83), or (3) an informational website control (n=83)
      condition. Participants will include HIV-negative youth and young adults (ages 15-24) who are
      self-identified transgender feminine, transgender masculine or gender non-conforming.
      Participants will be recruited from venues in Boston, Houston, Los Angeles, New York, and
      Philadelphia. There will be four data collection time points: baseline, 3-, 6-, and 9-month.
      Visits will be conducted in-person at the venues. An ACASI will be completed using online
      survey tools. An HIV test, sexually transmitted infection (STI) panel, urine screen for
      recent illicit drug use, and blood microsampling, for those who report PrEP uptake, to verify
      PrEP adherence will be collected in-person at the participants local venue. Process data of
      each participant activity at each step of the intervention, as well as the control
      intervention, will be collected. The study aims to measure the effects of the
      information-only (Info) arm compared to a text messaging intervention (Text+Step) to a WebApp
      intervention (WebApp+Step) for reducing sexual risk behaviors and increasing PrEP uptake.

Endorsements will be factor analyzed at each time point to construct an index representing the syndemic burden on each participant.</description>
