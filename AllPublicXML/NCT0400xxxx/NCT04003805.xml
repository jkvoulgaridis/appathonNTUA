  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is focused on characterizing the toxic and carcinogenic potential of the
      Standardized Research E-cigarette (SREC) developed by the National Institute on Drug Abuse.
      In the environment of continuously changing e-cigarette market, SREC was developed as a model
      e-cigarette that will remain available for an extended period of time and can be used as a
      bridging element in various studies aimed at evaluating the value and limitations of
      e-cigarettes as tobacco risk reduction tools. Our overall goal is to generate initial
      reference data on chemical exposures and associated effects in smokers switching to SREC.

    <description>The device operates at a single output voltage (3.30 Â± 0.05 V) and uses sealed disposable 3-mL cartridges with tobacco-flavored e-liquid (~350 puffs/cartridge). The concentration of nicotine in e-liquid is 15 mg/mL, and the vehicle composition is 50:50 propylene glycol and glycerin. The device uses a battery that can be recharged via a micro USB port. A single charge is designed to sustain more than 400 puffs, which is more than the capacity of an e-liquid cartridge. The e-liquid and the aerosol are well-characterized in terms of chemical impurities and by-products (such as aldehydes), which are minimal. Additional information, including the results of pharmacokinetics study is available via NIDA website: https://www.drugabuse.gov/funding/supplemental-information-nida-e-cig</description>

    <description>We will use commercially available nicotine mini-lozenges containing 2 or 4 mg nicotine/lozenge (Nicorette, manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline). Dose will be determined per instructions on the package (e.g, if smoking within 30 minutes upon awakening, then 4 mg dose will be prescribed).</description>
