  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be comprised of 2 parts: Part A (Multiple Ascending Dose [MAD]) which will be
      conducted to evaluate the safety and tolerability of SRP-5051 at multiple ascending dose
      levels to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD); Part B (Dose Expansion) will be
      conducted to evaluate SRP-5051 administered at the MTD, both in patients who will complete
      Part A and in an expansion cohort of approximately 15 patients who will be enrolled in the
      study at the beginning of Part B.
