      Identification of the effects of yoga, stabilization exercise and aerobic exercise approaches
      on physical and cognitive variables in individuals with low back pain.

    <textblock>
      Patients participating in the study were divided three parallel groups. The patients in the
      stabilization exercise group were instructed to perform spinal stabilization exercises, the
      patients in the yoga group were instructed to perform yoga program consisting of breathing,
      relaxation and flexibility exercises. The patients in the aerobic exercise group were
      instructed to perform aerobic walking training. The severity of the pain evaluated through
      visual analog scale, functional status and quality of life, alexithymia, kinesiophobia,
      catastrophic pain, back awareness, cognitive function evaluated through Oswestry Disability
      Index(ODI), Nottingham Health Profile (NHP), Toronto Alexithymia Scale, Fear Avoidance
      Beliefs Questionnaire, Pain Catastrophizing Scale, Fremantle Back Awareness Scale, Montreal
      Cognitive Assessment respectively. Assessments were repeated before and after the treatment.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in pain severity</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline in pain severity at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patients' average resting, activity and night pain intensities assessed by Visual Analog Scale. The visual analog scale is an 11-point scale ranging from 0 to 10, in which 0 defines absence of pain and 10 describes unbearable pain. Participants asked to rate the average pain levels a horizontal 10 cm straight line on a white sheet from, before and after treatment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes of functional status</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline in functional status at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patient's permanent functional disability measured by Oswestry Disability Index. The scale is considered the 'gold standard' of low back functional outcome tools. This scale contain questions related to functional activities of pain intensity, personal care, lifting, walking, sitting, standing, sleeping, sex life, social life and travelling.Interpretation of scale are 0% to 20% for minimal disability, 21% to 40% for moderate disability, 41 % to 60 % for severe disability 61% to 80 % for crippled and 81 % to 100 % Bed-bound.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline in life quality levels at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Health-related quality of life assessed by Nottingham Health Profile (NHP). The NHP contain 38 questions in 6 subareas: pain, physical abilities, energy level, sleep, social isolation and emotional reaction. The scores range from 0 to 100, with each question assigned a weighted value; the sum of all weighted values in a given subarea adds up to 100. Lower scores denoting a better quality of life.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in gait parameters</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline in gait parameters at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Gait assessment will be recorded with OptoGait for one minute while participants walked their preferred speed on the treadmill. Patients asked to walk on level surface. Assessment were recorded during one minute.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in metabolic capacity</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline in metabolic capacity at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Metabolic capacity testing will be performed according to the Modified Bruce protocol on the Treadmill. At 3 minute intervals, the inclination increase by %2 with a concomitant increase in speed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in cognitive level</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline in cognitive level at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Montreal Cognitive Assessment Questionnaire (MoCA) will be used to assess the cognitive levels of individuals. MoCA was developed as a rapid screening test for mild cognitive impairment. MoCA assesses various cognitive functions such as attention and concentration, creative functions, memory, language, visual structuring skills, abstract thinking, computation and orientation. The application of MoCA takes about 10 minutes. The maximum total score of the test is 30. A score of 21 or above is considered normal.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in alexithymia</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline in alexithymia at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The alexithymia will be assessed by the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS). The scale is a Likert-type self-assessment scale consisting of 20 items and scored between 1-5. Difficulties in recognizing emotions (TAS-1), difficulty in speaking emotions (TAS-2), extroverted thinking (TAS-3) subscales. The individual is asked to select the best option for each item from &quot;Never&quot;, &quot;Rarely&quot;, &quot;Sometimes&quot;, &quot;Often&quot; and &quot;Always&quot;. The higher the score, the higher the level of alexithymia.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in kinesiophobia.</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline in kinesiophobia at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Fear-Avoidance-Beliefs Questionnaire will be applied to evaluate kinesiophobia which is fear of movement due to low back pain.This questionnaire has 2 sub-sections related to physical activity and work. There are 4 questions scored in the physical activity section and 7 questions in the work section. 0-6 points are obtained for each question. The total score will be recorded. The higher the score, the higher the kinesiophobia.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in back awareness</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline in back awareness at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Fremantle Back Awareness Questionnaire will be used to evaluate how individuals perceive the back according to their body. The questionnaire includes 9 questions that measure how individuals perceive their back according to their body and how they perceive their body position. Questions is answered Likert type as &quot;0&quot; I never feel like this, &quot;4&quot; always or often feel like this.</description>
