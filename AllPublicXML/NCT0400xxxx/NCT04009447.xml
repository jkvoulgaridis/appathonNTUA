  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to elucidate the potential mechanisms responsible for the
      increased risk of cardiovascular disease among patients with hypertension and comorbid
      insomnia.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to utilize a behavioral intervention to manipulate sleep quality in
      150 adults with hypertension and comorbid insomnia, who will receive a 6-week Cognitive
      Behavioral therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) intervention, which has been shown to markedly
      improve sleep quality and promote consolidated sleep in approximately 60% of those treated. A
      lowering of nighttime blood pressure is one of several proposed mechanisms to be examined.
