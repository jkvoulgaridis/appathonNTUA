  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study involves an investigational product: Ad-RTS-hIL-12 given with veledimex
      for production of human IL-12. IL-12 is a protein that can improve the body's natural
      response to disease by enhancing the ability of the immune system to kill tumor cells and may
      interfere with blood flow to the tumor.

      Cemiplimab-rwlc (Libtayo) is an antibody (a kind of human protein) that is being tested to
      see if it will allow the body's immune system to work against glioblastoma tumors. Libtayo
      (cemiplimab-rwlc) is currently FDA approved in the United States for metastatic cutaneous
      cell carcinoma (CSCC), but is not approved in glioblastoma. Cemiplimab-rwlc may help your
      immune system detect and attack cancer cells. Ad-RTS-hIL-12 and veledimex will be given in
      combination with cemiplimab-rwlc to enhance the IL-12 mediated effect observed to date.

      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a single tumoral
      injection of Ad-RTS-hIL-12 given with oral veledimex in combination with cemiplimab-rwlc.

      Eligible patients will receive one dose of cemiplimab-rwlc, via infusion, one week prior to
      standard of care craniotomy and tumor resection (subtotal or total). On the day of surgery,
      patients will receive one dose of veledimex before the resection procedure. Ad-RTS-hIL-12
      will be administered by free-hand injection. Patients will continue on oral veledimex for 14
      days. Following veledimex, patients will receive cemiplimab-rwlc via infusion every three
      weeks.

      The study is divided into three periods: the screening period, the treatment period and the
      follow-up period.
