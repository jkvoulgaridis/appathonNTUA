  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators designed a prospective randomized double-blind trial to determine if the
      oral immunomodulating formula could improve the disease-free survival rate in high-risk
      locally-advanced head and neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma patients treated with
      Chemoradiotherapy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy on disease-free survival of a formula
      enriched with L-arginine, omega-3 fatty acids, and ribonucleic acids, taken for 5 days before
      each cycle of chemotherapy, in patients with high-risk locally-advanced HNSCC treated with
      postoperative concomitant chemoradiotherapy (CRT).

      This study is a national, multicentric double blinded, randomised phase III trial. A total of
      306 patients (102 patients in group control vs 204 patients in group Oral Impact®) will be
      required including 10% of lost-to-follow-up patients.

      An immunomodulating oral supplementation compound (Oral Impact®) is compared to an isocaloric
      isonitrogenous control. The compound to be assessed contains 334kcal/bag and 18.1g of
      proteins, as well as immunomodulatory nutrients such as L-Arginine, RNA and omega-3. The
      control has the same formula to that of the Oral Impact®, but not enriched with specific
      nutrients. Each patient has to take Oral Impact® or a sip feed control during 5 days before
      each cycle of chemotherapy.

      DFS will be measured from the time of randomization to the time of the first evidence of
      progression (local, regional, metastatic, or second primary) or death from any cause.
      Patients alive without carcinologic event were censored at last follow-up date.

      Patients treated with postoperative CRT are expected to have a 2-year DFS rate of 60% without
      specific diet (pControl).

      Including a ratio 1:2, an expected recruitment of 90 patients per year, the current study
      will require 131 events to detect an absolute improvement of 15% (HR=0.56, pExperimental=75%)
      with 0.90 statistical power using a two-sided test and a significance level of 0.05.

      A total of 306 patients (102 vs 204) will be required including 10% of lost of follow-up
      patients.

      The inclusion period would be 4 years, for an expected total duration of study about 8 years.

    <description>The EORTC QLQ-C30 uses for the questions 1 to 28 a 4-point scale. The scale scores from 1 to 4: 1 (&quot;Not at all&quot;), 2 (&quot;A little&quot;), 3 (&quot;Quite a bit&quot;) and 4 (&quot;Very much&quot;). Half points are not allowed. The range is 3. For the raw score, less points are considered to have a better outcome.
The EORTC QLQ-C30 uses for the questions 29 and 30 a 7-points scale. The scale scores from 1 to 7: 1 (&quot;very poor&quot;) to 7 (&quot;excellent&quot;). Half points are not allowed. The range is 6. First of all, raw score has to be calculated with mean values. Afterwards linear transformation is performed to be comparable. More points are considered to have a better outcome.</description>
