      This is a multicenter, open-label, Phase 1/ 2 study to evaluate the short-term and
      longer-term safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of immunopheresis with the LW-02 device
      in removal of Soluble Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptors (sTNF-Rs) from plasma of patients with
      advanced, refractory Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) and for disease control when
      employed as monotherapy, or in combination with a low dose weekly taxane (paclitaxel) plus
      carboplatin chemotherapy regimen. A weekly, combination of low dose paclitaxel plus
      carboplatin (paclitaxel+carboplatin) chemotherapy regimen will serve as control.

      This is a multicenter, open-label, Phase 1/ 2 study to evaluate the short-term and
      longer-term safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of immunopheresis with the LW-02 device
      in removal of sTNF-Rs from plasma of patients with advanced, refractory TNBC and for disease
      control when employed as monotherapy, or in combination with a low dose weekly taxane
      (paclitaxel) plus carboplatin chemotherapy regimen. A weekly, combination of low dose
      paclitaxel plus carboplatin (paclitaxel+carboplatin) chemotherapy regimen will serve as
      control.

      Part A (n=10 evaluable patients): Overall safety, tolerability, and sTNF-R-removal
      effectiveness of LW-02 device-based immunopheresis monotherapy conducted 3 times per week for
      4 weeks in patients with advanced TNBC.

      Part B (n=10 evaluable patients): Overall safety, tolerability, and sTNF-Rs-removal
      effectiveness of LW-02 device-based immunopheresis 3 times per week for 4 weeks combined with
      chemotherapy (weekly administration of paclitaxel+carboplatin regimen) in patients with
      advanced TNBC.

      Part C (3 treatment arms; n=50 patients per treatment arm): Randomized comparison of overall
      safety, tolerability, and clinical efficacy effectiveness of (i) immunopheresis monotherapy
      with the LW-02 device 3 times per week for 16 weeks, (ii) or immunopheresis in combination
      with chemotherapy (weekly administration of paclitaxel+carboplatin regimen), and (iii) plain
      chemotherapy (weekly administration of paclitaxel+carboplatin).

      Safety Endpoints

        1. Safety and tolerability - incidence of Adverse Device Effects (ADEs), Serious Adverse
           Device Effects (SADEs) and Unanticipated Serious Adverse Device Effects (USADEs) related
           to immunopheresis procedure as well as Adverse Events (AE) and Serious Adverse Events
           (SAEs).

        2. Safety endpoints of special interest - incidence of tumor lysis syndrome, and systemic
           inflammatory response syndrome.

        3. Patient-Reported Outcomes to evaluate health status and Quality of Life (QoL)
           instruments for patients with TNBC:

             -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) status

             -  EQ-5D-5L index-based scale

      Efficacy Endpoints

        1. Column efficiency and effectiveness in removal of sTNF-Rs from patient plasma without
           clinically-meaningful leaching of capture ligand (SC-TNF-α) - change in sTNF-R and TNF-α
           plasma levels from initiation to the end of each immunopheresis procedure, including
           pre- and post-column measurements, between each treatment, and from baseline to end of a
           treatment cycle (4 weeks - Part A and B, or 16 weeks - Part C).

        2. Clinical endpoints - response in tumor burden - progression-free survival (PFS), disease
           control rate (DCR), objective response rate (ORR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), duration
           of response (DOR), duration of clinical benefit (DOCB), time-to-progression (TTP) and
           overall survival (OS). Serial evaluation of tumor burden/tumor growth is assessed
           according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1).
           Regardless of the number of imaging techniques used, at least one specific technique
           should be consistent for each patient during the entire study period with measurements
           done initially at 8 and 16 weeks and then every 8 weeks if LW-02 device immunopheresis
           treatment continues, or if discontinued from treatment, every 3 months through 1 year of
           clinical follow up from end of treatment (EOT):

             -  Progression-free survival (PFS), defined as the time from initiation of study
                treatment to the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause,
                whichever occurs first. PFS will be calculated based on disease status evaluated by
                the investigator according to RECIST v1.1.

             -  Disease control rate (DCR), defined as the percentage of patients who attain
                complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) according to
                RECIST v1.1.

             -  Objective response rate (ORR), defined as the percentage of patients who attain
                complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST v1.1.

             -  Clinical benefit rate (CBR) defined as CR plus PR plus stable disease (SD) ≥6
                months

             -  Duration of Clinical Benefit (DOCB), defined as the time from initial response to
                disease progression or death among patients who have experienced a CR, PR or SD
                during the study. Duration of response will be calculated based on disease status
                evaluated by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1.

             -  Time-to-progression (TTP), defined as the time from initiation of study treatment
                to disease progression

             -  OS, defined as the proportion of patients remaining alive from initiation of study
                treatment through 1-year of clinical follow-up from EOT and through year 2 via
                telephonic follow-up.
