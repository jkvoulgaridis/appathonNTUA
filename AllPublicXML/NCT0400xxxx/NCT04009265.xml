      A multi-center prospective randomized controlled study was conducted to compare the effects
      of adjuvant chemotherapy, chemoradiotherapy and surgery alone on the overall survival rate
      (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) of patients with pN1-2 (pT1b-3N1-2M0) thoracic
      esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and to observe the safety, side effects of adjuvant
      therapy and the impact on the quality of life of patients after operation.
