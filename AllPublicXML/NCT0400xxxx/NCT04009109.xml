  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized Phase II clinical trial will be conducted to assess the impact on progression
      free survival (PFS) with the addition of ixazomib and daratumumab to lenalidomide as a
      maintenance treatment following induction with lenalidomide, ixazomib, dexamethasone, and
      daratumumab.

      Patients will be randomized to either:

      Arm A: 12 cycles of lenalidomide, ixazomib, daratumumab, and dexamethasone followed by
      lenalidomide until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or a maximum of 2 years of
      maintenance therapy.

      Arm B: 12 cycles of lenalidomide, ixazomib, daratumumab and dexamethasone, followed by
      lenalidomide, ixazomib, and daratumumab until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or
      a maximum of 2 years maintenance therapy.

      Induction Phase: 28-day treatment cycle for 12 cycles:

        -  Lenalidomide 15 mg PO QD on Days 1-21

        -  Ixazomib 4 mg PO on Days 1, 8, 15

        -  Daratumumab 16 mg/kg IV Q1W week for 8 weeks, then Q2W weeks for 16 weeks, thereafter
           Q4W weeks

        -  Dexamethasone 20 mg PO will be administered day of and day after all doses of
           daratumumab and ixazomib (Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16). The dexamethasone 20 mg PO oral
           or IV dose administered as a pre-infusion medication on daratumumab infusion days (Days
           1, 8, 15, 22) replaces the oral dexamethasone dose for that day.

      Maintenance Phase: 28-day treatment cycle until progression or excessive toxicity or a
      maximum of 2 years of maintenance treatment:

      Arm A

        -  Lenalidomide 10 mg PO QD on Days 1-21 Arm B

        -  Lenalidomide 10 mg PO QD on Days 1-21

        -  Ixazomib 3 mg (or last tolerated dose from the induction phase) PO on Days 1, 8, and 15

        -  Daratumumab 16 mg/kg IV on Day 1

      In the maintenance phase, dexamethasone, 20 mg PO orally or IV will be administered to
      patients as a pre-infusion medication prior to daratumumab dosing. When dexamethasone is
      reduced to 20 mg/week and is given as pre-infusion medication, patients may receive low-dose
      methylprednisolone (â‰¤20 mg) orally (or equivalent in accordance with local standards) for the
      prevention of delayed IRRs as clinically indicated.

      If the investigator wishes to continue the maintenance regimen at the end of the 2 years
      maintenance treatment, patients may continue current maintenance as per standard of care.

    <measure>Quality of Life with the EQ 5D 5L Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>5 Years</time_frame>
    <description>Consists of 2 parts: the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). The descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state. The EQ VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale, where the endpoints are labelled 'The best health you can imagine' and 'The worst health you can imagine'. The VAS can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome that reflect the patient's own judgement.</description>

    <time_frame>5 Years</time_frame>
    <description>The EORTC QLQ-MY20 module was developed as an addition to the QLQ-C30 for use specifically in MM. It has 4 domains (disease symptoms, side effects of treatment, body image, future perspectives). Scores range from 0 to 100; good HRQoL is indicated by high scores for future perspective and body image, and low scores for disease symptoms and side effects of treatment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life with the EORTC QLQ-C30 Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>5 Years</time_frame>
    <description>The EORTC QLQ-C30 is composed of both multi-item scales and single-item measures. These include five functional scales, three symptom scales, a global health status/QoL scale, and six single items. Each of the multi-item scales includes a different set of items - no item occurs in more than one scale. All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level. Thus a high score for a functional scale represents a high/healthy level of functioning, a high score for the global health status/QoL represents a high QoL, but a high score for a symptom scale/item represents a high level of symptomatology/problems.</description>

               -  seropositive for hepatitis B (defined by a positive test for hepatitis B surface
                  antigen [HBsAg]). Subjects with resolved infection (ie, subjects who are HBsAg
                  negative but positive for antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen [anti-HBc]
                  and/or antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen [anti-HBs]) must be screened
                  using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) measurement of hepatitis B virus
                  (HBV) DNA levels. Those who are PCR positive will be excluded. EXCEPTION:
                  Subjects with serologic findings suggestive of HBV vaccination (anti-HBs
                  positivity as the only serologic marker) AND a known history of prior HBV
                  vaccination, do not need to be tested for HBV DNA by PCR.

               -  seropositive for hepatitis C (except in the setting of a sustained virologic
                  response [SVR], defined as aviremia at least 12 weeks after completion of
                  antiviral therapy).

         14. A woman who is pregnant, or breast-feeding, or planning to become pregnant during the
             study period or a man who plans to father a child during the study period. See Section
             12.8 for further details.

         15. Major surgery â‰¤14 days prior to screening or has not fully recovered from surgery, or
             has surgery planned during the time the patient is expected to participate in the
             study. Note: Kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty is not considered major surgery.

         16. Received an investigational drug (including investigational vaccines) or used an
             invasive investigational medical device â‰¤28 days prior to initial dosing or is
             currently enrolled in an interventional investigational study.

         17. Contraindications to required protocol prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and
             pulmonary embolism.

         18. Peripheral neuropathy Grade 2 or severe â‰¤28 days prior to screening.

         19. Systemic treatment with strong CYP3A inducers (rifampin, rifapentine, rifabutin,
             carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital), or use of St. John's wort â‰¤14 days prior to
             screening.
