  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial design is a quasi-experimental cohort trial that includes women referred for pelvic
      organ prolapse specific physiotherapy.

      Candidates will be selected via a convenience sampling method from four physiotherapy
      outpatient departments at a NHS trust within Greater Manchester. The data collection occurred
      in January-June 2019 and ethical approval was granted by School Research Ethics, University
      of Salford.

      Treatment aims to ensure there is respect for their autonomy, treatment is fair (Justice), no
      harm is done to the participant (nonmaleficence) and treatment benefits the participants
      (beneficence).

      Participants are required to complete a consent form prior to their initial session. To
      ensure methodological quality, the STROBE guidelines will be followed to make certain all apt
      information required is reported to allow for replication of the intervention.

      The trial aims to include (n=60) women with a diagnosed pelvic organ prolapse. They are
      required to complete 16 weeks of supervised pelvic floor exercises with a specialist
      physiotherapist as documented within the most recent NICE guidelines.

      The outcome measures used will be the Pelvic Organ Prolapse symptom score (POPSS) and this
      will be documented before and after the 16 week period.

      Along side the POPSS, the patients body mass index and severity of pelvic organ prolapse will
      also be recorded and the results of this will be correlated post trial using the relevant
      data analysis testing methods.

    <time_frame>sixteen weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The POPSS is a patient-reported Outcome Measure consisting of seven POP symptom specific items, each with a five-point Likert response set (0 = never, 1 = occasionally, 2 = sometimes, 3 = most of the time and 4 = all of the time). The minimum score is 0 which would indicate that the pelvic organ prolapse in a-symptomatic and the maximum score for the POPSS is 28 which would indicate higher severity in pelvic organ prolapse symptoms. In addition, the women select a specific symptom which is most bothersome for them.</description>

    <description>Sixteen weeks of supervised pelvic floor muscle training with a specialist physiotherapist.
Participants will be assessed at weeks 0 / 4 / 10 &amp; 16 and the outcome measures will be recorded at week 0 &amp; week 16.
During each assessment, participants will be educated regarding the anatomy of pelvic organ prolapses and the pelvic floor muscles. They will be taught how to contract their pelvic floor, offered a vaginal examination, given a personalised pelvic floor muscle training programme (including the Knack) - up to a ten second hold long contractions (x 10 repitations) and up to 10 quick contractions. They will also be taught a sub max contraction for up to 30 seconds, offered lifestyle management advice including avoiding heavy lifting or straining. A leaflet explaining the aforementioned information will also be provided at the initial assessment.</description>
