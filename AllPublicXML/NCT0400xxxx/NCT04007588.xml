      This research study is studying different immunotherapy regimens as a possible treatment for
      stage III or IV resectable melanoma.

      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a
      specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means the drug is being studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved OPDIVO® (nivolumab), YERVOY®
      (ipilimumab), and a combination of the two as treatment options for metastatic melanoma.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved the combination of nivolumab
      and BMS-986205 as a treatment for any disease. This research study is looking for more
      information on the efficacy the combination of nivolumab and BMS-986205 in the treatment of
      melanoma.

      Nivolumab, Ipilimumab, and BMS-986205 are types of immunotherapy. Immunotherapy works by
      encouraging the body's own immune system to attack the cancer cells. Nivolumab, Ipilimumab,
      and BMS-986205 work by stopping various molecules on cancer cells and body cells from working
      against the immune system's natural fight against cancer.

      In this research study, the investigators are going to look at the following while the
      participants are receiving the study drug(s):

      • The effectiveness (how well the drug works), safety, and tolerability of Nivolumab,
      BMS-986205 and Nivolumab, and Ipilimumab and Nivolumab in people with resectable stage III or
      IV melanoma

             risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with
             nivolumab or BMS-986205, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated
             with nivolumab or BMS-986205. These potential risks may also apply to other agents
             used in this study.

          -  Known active HIV, Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C patients. HIV-positive participants on
             combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for an
             immunologic effect with the therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in
             participants receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.

             cytochrome b5 reductase deficiency (previously called methemoglobin reductase
             deficiency) or other diseases that put them at risk of methemoglobinemia. All
             participants will be screened for methemoglobin levels prior to randomization.

          -  Participant with a history of G6PD deficiency or other congenital or autoimmune
             hemolytic disorders. All participants will be screened for G6PD levels prior to
             randomization.

          -  Participants must not have a history of life-threatening toxicity related to prior
             immune therapy (eg. anti-CTLA-4 or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting
             T-cell co-stimulation or immune checkpoint pathways) except those that are unlikely to
             re-occur with standard countermeasures (eg. hormone replacement after adrenal crisis).

          -  Treatment with botanical preparations (eg, herbal supplements or traditional Chinese
             medicines) intended for general health support or to treat the disease under study
             within 2 weeks prior to randomization.

          -  History of other malignancy within 3 years prior to screening, with the exception of
             those with a negligible risk of metastasis or death (e.g., 5-year OS of &gt; 90%), such
             as adequately treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix, non-melanoma skin carcinoma,
             localized prostate cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ, or Stage I uterine cancer.

          -  Participants who have had major surgery requiring general anesthesia or significant
             trauma who have not recovered per physician determination for at least 14 days prior
             to randomization.

          -  Participants with conditions known to interfere significantly with the absorption of
             oral medication, as per investigator judgment.

          -  Participants with uncontrolled adrenal insufficiency.

          -  Prior history of serotonin syndrome.
