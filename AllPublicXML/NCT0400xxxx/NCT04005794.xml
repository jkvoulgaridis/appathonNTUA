  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Social impairments are core features of schizophrenia that lead to poor outcome. Social
      skills and competence improve quality of life and protect against stress-related exacerbation
      of symptoms, while supporting resilience, interpersonal interactions, and social affiliation.
      To improve outcome, it is necessary to remediate social deficits. Existing psychosocial
      interventions are moderately effective but the effort-intensive nature (high burden), low
      adherence, and weak transfer of skills to everyday life present significant hurdles toward
      recovery. Thus, there is a dire need to develop effective, engaging and low-burden social
      interventions for people with schizophrenia that will result in better compliance rates and
      functional outcome.

      In a previous pilot study, the investigators tested the effectiveness of a novel adaptive
      virtual reality (VR) intervention in improving targeted social cognitive function (social
      attention, as indexed by eye scanning patterns) in individuals with schizophrenia. 10
      sessions of 1-hour VR intervention were sufficient to engage the target mechanism of social
      attention and improve negative symptoms. Acceptability and compliance were very high among
      the participants. '

      The next phase, supported by a R33 grant will compare the VR social skills training with a
      control condition. This new protocol includes a control condition for the exposure to
      computerized training across the 10 sessions and incidental exposure to social interactions
      (i.e. interactions with experimenters twice a week for 5 weeks) by including a control
      condition, which involves computerized brain fitness training for 10 sessions.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The effectiveness of the social VR training (n=20) at an optimal dose will be compared with
      an active control condition (computerized cognitive training) (n=20) in improving social
      attention (social engagement latency: SEL) and social brain network in a pilot RCT.

      Participants with schizophrenia will undergo a baseline assessment of cognition, social
      functioning, symptoms and social brain network functioning. These behavioral, clinical and
      neuroimaging (fMRI of social imitation task, and resting state connectivity analyses of the
      social brain network) methods will be used to assess changes.

      Individuals with schizophrenia will be randomized to either the social skills training or the
      computerized cognitive training at baseline. They will then participate in 10 sessions of
      social skills VR training or computerized cognitive training (1 hour per session, twice a
      week for 5 weeks).

      In addition, long-term social outcome will be assessed approxinately 2 months after the end
      of training with the Social Functional Scale (Birchwood, 1991) and the SANS and SAPS for
      clinical symptoms. For the long-term outcome assessment, no imaging or behavioral assessments
      will be conducted because the primary goal of the follow-up is to assess broad levels of
      social functioning in the real world and because there is not sufficient time within the R33
      mechanism.

      16 matched control participants will be recruited to obtain behavioral and neuroiaging
      comparison data for optimal performance levels but these healthy control participants will
      not undergo social skills training.

      Lastly, at the end of the R33 project, if this adaptive VR technology shows that it can
      improve social attention, which in turn improves social outcome in schizophrenia, it will be
      possible to refine the protocol to make the method more accessible, less burdensome and
      widely available in the future by moving towards a mobile application.

    <time_frame>Baseline and 5 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>BLERT (Bell-Lysaker Emotion Recognition Task; Bell et al, 1997). BLERT measures social cognition in people with schizophrenia and it has been reported to have the strongest psychometric properties for use in clinical trials. BLERT presents 21, 10-second video clips to measure the ability to identify seven emotional states: happiness, sadness, fear, disgust, surprise, anger, or no emotion.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and 5 weeks. In addition, it will also be used to assess long term outcome 2 months after the training has ended.</time_frame>
    <description>SANS is a 25-item clinical symptom rating scale. It consists subscales of alogia, affective blunting, avolition-apathy, anhedonia-asociality, and attentional impairment. (Andreasen, 1983). Each subscale has a single item global score for overall severity of each symptom domain. Each item is rated for severity from least (0) to most severe (5).

    <description>SAPS has 34-items that evaluate hallucinations, delusions, formal thought disorder and bizarre behavior (Andreasen, 1984).

    <description>Social Functioning Scale (Birchwood, 1990). This is a well validated measure used to assess social functioning. SFS consists of 76 items (7 subscales). Every subscale value is normalized to a Scaled Score (Mean = 100, SD = 15). The SFS full scale score is the mean of the 7 subscales scaled scores. The 7 subscales are: social engagement/withdrawal, interpersonal behavior, pro-social activities, recreation, independence-competence, independence-performance and employment.</description>

    <description>If there is a significant improvement in social skills for the active treatment condition, the reason might be that the participants were exposed to social environment by coming to the lab and interacting with the research staff twice a week for 5 weeks and/or they used a computerized training tool twice a week for 5 weeks. In order to control for these potential confounds, we included a cognitive training arm. Participants will undergo a commercially available brain fitness program (Posit Science) for ten 1-hour sessions (twice a week for 5 weeks).</description>
