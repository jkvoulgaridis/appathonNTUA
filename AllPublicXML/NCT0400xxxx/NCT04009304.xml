    <textblock>
      This study of the dissemination of the Out-of-school Nutrition and Physical Activity
      Initiative will utilize a 3-arm group-randomized control trial to establish the effectiveness
      of two learning collaborative training models (e.g. train-the-trainer in-person vs. online)
      for an evidence-based out-of-school time (OST) nutrition and physical activity intervention.
      The study will compare sites that receive the training models with a control group.
      Investigators will work with YMCA leadership to recruit 45 demographically diverse YMCA OST
      sites from across the country. Sites will be matched on racial/ethnic composition, proportion
      of students eligible for free or reduced price meals, program enrollment,
      urban/rural/suburban setting, and physical activity and food service facilities available.
      One-third of the sites will be randomized to participate in the online training over the
      school year, one-third will participate in the in-person train-the-trainer model, and
      one-third will serve as controls. After randomization, in fall 2016, teams of YMCA OST
      directors and line staff will be invited to participate in the OSNAP learning collaborative
      trainings. The intervention follows the social ecological model with activities targeting
      multiple levels of change—school district/program sponsor, OST site, interpersonal, and
      individual—and emphasizing on adoption of the following OSNAP goals: ban sugar-sweetened
      drinks from snacks served and brought in from outside the snack program; offer water as a
      drink at snack every day; offer a fruit or vegetable option every day at snack; ban foods
      with trans fats from snacks served; serve whole grains; offer 30 minutes of physical activity
      to all children daily; offer 20 minutes of vigorous physical activity to all children 3 times
      per week; and eliminate television, movies, and non-educational screentime. Sessions are
      designed consistent with the Institute for Healthcare Improvement Breakthrough Series
      Collaborative model and use constructs from social cognitive theory—knowledge and skill
      development coupled with action planning—to drive environmental and behavior change. Teams of
      afterschool staff will use the Out-of-School Nutrition and Physical Activity Observational
      Practice Assessment Tool (OSNAP-OPAT), decision aids, policy writing guides, and other
      resources available at www.osnap.org to set data-driven goals and implement discrete
      practice, policy, and communication action steps throughout the year. Staff will also receive
      training on the Food &amp; Fun After School curriculum available at foodandfun.org.

    <description>Effectiveness of the intervention will be measured with the Out-of-School Nutrition and Physical Activity Observational Practice Assessment Tool (OSNAP-OPAT)—an observational measure of nutrition and physical activity practices that site staff complete for one week before and after the intervention. Our team validated the tool with OST staff similar to those proposed to complete the measure in this study, establishing criterion validity for physical activity and nutrition outcomes with correlations ranging from 0.56 to 0.85 when compared with accelerometry and direct observation of dietary intake.
