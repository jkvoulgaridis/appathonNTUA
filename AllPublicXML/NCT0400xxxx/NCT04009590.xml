    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well Quit4Health intervention works in supporting smoking cessation
      and preventing smoking initiation in young adults. Quit4Health intervention may help young
      adults learn more about the risks of tobacco use and may help them to quit smoking.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate whether smokers randomized to Quit4Health are more likely to quit smoking and
      remain tobacco-free at 6 months than subjects randomized to the education only control group.

      II. To evaluate whether non-smokers who are randomized to Quit4Health are less likely to
      initiate tobacco usage and remain tobacco-free at 6 months than non-smokers randomized to the
      education only control group.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate whether well-established predictors of susceptibility and barriers to
      cessation (e.g. self-efficacy, knowledge about associated risks, normative beliefs,
      attitudes, resistance skills, peer pressure) and recently identified predictors of tobacco
      use (e.g., depression, nicotine dependence, alcohol use, risk-taking propensity) will mediate
      the effect of the intervention on both onset (for non-smokers) and cessation (for smokers) of
      tobacco use.

      II. To evaluate whether, at the end-of-treatment (EOT) assessment, participants (both smokers
      and non-smokers) in Quit4Health will report a significantly better perception of Quit4Health
      (message relevance, tailoring to specific needs based on tobacco use status, motivation to
      quit, etc.) compared with their counterparts in the education only control arm.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Participants utilize Quit4Health intervention that includes interactive features,
      coping strategies and games related to cigarettes and other tobacco products for 1 month.

      GROUP II: Participants read an educational booklet about cigarettes and other tobacco
      products for 1 month.

      After completion of study, participants are followed at 3 and 6 months.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Abstinence from tobacco</measure>
    <time_frame>At 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Any abstinence is defined as &quot;subjective reports of abstinence from tobacco for at least 24 hours or more in the past 30 days&quot;, the 7-day point prevalence of abstinence at follow-ups will be verified by measurement of saliva cotinine. The primary analysis will compare the abstinence rates at 6 months in the control and treatment group using a 2-sample test of proportion for all smokers. A secondary analysis will involve a simple post-test analysis among smokers using logistic regression.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Susceptibility to tobacco initiation</measure>
    <time_frame>At 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Will assess susceptibility to smoking using the measure proposed by Pierce and colleagues. Will employ similar analytic methods as in primary objective 1 to evaluate the prevalence of susceptibility at the 6-month follow-up in subjects randomized to the experimental intervention condition with respect to subjects assigned to the control condition.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mediation effect of predictors of smoking and recently identified predictors of tobacco use</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The mediation effect estimate will be computed as the product of the effect of the treatment on the mediators and the mediators on the outcome controlling for the treatment. The Bayesian mediation analysis method detailed by Yuan and MacKinnon will be used to estimate and make inference on the mediation effect.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Behavior modification</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Will evaluate the motivational appeal, educational relevance and knowledge acquired in specific modules of the app that lead to behavior modification. Similar assessments will be done among participants in the control condition with educational materials.</description>
