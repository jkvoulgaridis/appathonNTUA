  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Torsade de pointes (TdP) is a cardiac arrhythmia associated with QT interval prolongation
      which may lead to cardiac arrest. Prescription medications which cause QT interval
      prolongation are commonly used in daily practice. To lessen risk of TdP, pharmacists work to
      minimize combinations of QT interval prolonging drugs. If community pharmacists had real-time
      information about a patient's QT interval duration, this would have the direct ability to
      inform their decision making about which patients may be at highest risk of TdP and who may
      need heightened avoidance of QT prolonging drugs. This project will provide 3 community
      pharmacies with mobile ECG devices to easily determine QT intervals among patients who have a
      prescription profile alert for QT interval prolongation. Study outcomes will include:
      frequency of QT interval prolongation, changes in drug therapy related to QT interval
      determination, and patient and pharmacist satisfaction with having pharmacist assessment of
      QT interval.

    <description>The pharmacist will record a 30 second rhythm strip from patients using the KardiaMobile device and calculate the QTc interval using the Bazett calculation formula. The pharmacist will discuss the result with the patient and if necessary, will contact the prescriber to effect a medication change. If the QTc interval is greater than the 99th percentile, (470 ms for males, 480 ms for females) the pharmacist must contact the prescriber. The pharmacist will record any prescription changes which resulted from the intervention and the prescriber response. The pharmacist will email the rhythm strip (with study participation number) to a secure email at the Northeast Iowa Family Practice Center (NEIFPC). Rhythm strips will be archived for future potential research evaluation in a secure, electronic file.</description>
