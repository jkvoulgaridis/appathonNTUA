  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the present study the investigators want to verify if the inhibition of the suboccipital
      muscles improves the postural balance in subjects with cervical pain objectified by
      stabilometry.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Surface of the ellipse open eyes</measure>
    <time_frame>Postintervention immediate</time_frame>
    <description>Determines the surface of the ellipse formed from the oscillations in the X and Y coordinates with open eyes. The measurement is made using a stabilometric platform with 4 pressure sensors per square centimeter. The software of the stabilometric platform collects 40 measurements per second through its pressure sensors, calculating the position of the projection of the center of gravity on the ground 40 times every second. The described variable evaluates the surface of the ellipse that contains the successive points of the displacement of the projection of the center of gravity in the ground during the standarized time for the stabilometric recording (51.2 seconds). It is a unique value, measured in a single moment. If the ellipse formed is larger, it implies a greater amplitude of the displacement of the center of gravity, and therefore a lower equilibrium capacity. Interval: 0-1000 (mm2).</description>

    <time_frame>Preintervention and Postintervention immediate.</time_frame>
    <description>It assesses the lateral and anteroposterior oscillation of the projection on the floor of the center of gravity during the 51 seconds of the stabilometric record. Interval: 0-50 (mm). Greater oscillation implies less postural balance.</description>

    <description>Determines the speed with which the projection of the center of gravity moves in lateral and anteroposterior direction during the 51 seconds of the stabilometric record. Interval: 0-10 (mm/s). Greater speed implies less postural balance.</description>

    <description>With the patient in the supine position and the therapist sitting at the head of the bed with the elbows resting on its surface. The therapist palpates the cervical spinous processes and slides the fingers upwards until contacting the posterior projection of the posterior arch of the atlas. Then, flexing the metacarpophalangeal at 90 degrees slowly raises the skull. The therapist's hands should remain together and the base of the skull should rest on his palms pressing with the index, middle and ring fingers of each hand in a sustained manner, but without causing pain. This pressure must be maintained during 4 minutes.</description>
