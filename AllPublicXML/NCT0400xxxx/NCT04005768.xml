  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effect of an acute administration of hydroxychloroquine sulphate will be investigated on
      hedonic food intake, appetite related sensations and gastrointestinal hormone release in
      healthy female subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intragastric administration of a quinine-solution has shown to decrease hedonic food intake
      in healthy female volunteers. The effect of a tablet containing hydroxychloroquine sulphate
      on hedonic food intake in overweight female individuals has not been studied to date. The
      primary outcome of the current study is to evaluate the effect of hydroxychloroquine sulphate
      on hedonic food intake, assessed by ad libitum food intake of a chocolate milkshake one hour
      after dosing. The study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double blinded cross-over study.
      Ten healthy lean females will be recruited as a proof of concept, before testing
      hydroxychloroquine sulphate in overweight female subjects. An acute dose of 400 mg
      hydroxychloroquine sulphate will be administered. Blood samples will be collected at regular
      time points to measure gastrointestinal hormone release and whole blood glucose levels.
      Appetite-related sensations will be scored at regular time points on visual analog scales.

    <description>Hedonic food intake will be assessed using a chocolate milkshake drinking task. Subjects are instructed to drink ad libitum from a chocolate milkshake until fully satiated. The milkshake will be weighted before and after the experiment. 1 g of chocolate milkshake = 1 kcal.</description>
