  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of disability. Individuals with
      COPD are more likely to spend prolonged periods of time in sedentary behaviour (SB) and less
      in light physical activity compared to their healthy peers. SB is associated with exercise
      intolerance, reduced motivation to exercise, lower self-efficacy and more frequent acute
      exacerbations among people with COPD. To date, there is very limited information regarding
      behavioural approaches to reduce SB in people with COPD. The aim of this study is to examine
      the feasibility of a new 4-week theory-informed behaviour change intervention to reduce SB in
      individuals with COPD.

    <description>To assess the change in self-efficacy to sit less using a scale adapted from the Multidimensional Self-Efficacy Scale over time from baseline to post-intervention. The scale consists of 9 items that measures 3 components of self-efficacy (task, coping and scheduling) with each item is measured on a scale of 0 (no confidence at all) up to 100 (complete confidence). The total score is the average of the scores of the 9 items.</description>

    <description>To assess the change in the outcome expectations using a 15-item scale adapted from the Multidimensional Outcome Expectations for Exercise Scale over time from baseline to post-intervention. The questionnaire is a 5-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree), that assesses physical outcome expectations (6 items), social outcome expectations (4 items), and self-evaluative outcome expectations (5 items) with the higher the scores the more positive the outcome expectations are. The total score is the sum of the score of the 15 items.</description>

    <description>The intervention is a 4-week behaviour change intervention underpinned by the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) that aims to reduce sedentary behaviour. The intervention consists of one individualized face-to-face session and 3 subsequent weekly points of contact (face-to-face meetings or phone calls).
Behaviour change techniques will be provided including education, verbal persuasion, environmental restructuring and goal-setting.</description>
