  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neurons are specialized types of cells that are responsible for carrying out the functions of
      the brain. Neurons communicate with electrical signals. In diseases such as major depression
      this electrical communication can go awry. One way to change brain function is using
      electrical stimulation to help alter the communication between groups of neurons in the
      brain.

      The purpose of this study is to test a personalized approach to brain stimulation as an
      intervention for depression. The study researchers will use a surgically implanted device to
      measure each individual's brain activity related to his/her depression. The researchers will
      then use small electrical impulses to alter that brain activity and measure whether these
      changes help reduce depression symptoms. This study is intended for patients with major
      depression whose symptoms have not been adequately treated with currently available
      therapies.

      The device used in this study is called the NeuroPace Responsive Neurostimulation (RNS)
      System. It is currently FDA approved to treat patients with epilepsy. The study will test
      whether personalized responsive neurostimulation can safely and effectively treat depression.

      This is a single-center 3-stage feasibility study of personalized closed-loop stimulation for
      treatment resistant Major Depressive Disorder. Depending on participant's results at each
      stage, he/she might not be eligible to proceed to all 3 stages.

      Stage 1 of the study will involve surgically implanting small, thin electrodes in brain
      regions that regulate depression in order to identify personalized treatment sites. The
      researchers will test stimulation in the different brain regions and their effect on
      depression symptoms. The electrodes will be surgically removed at the end of Stage 1.

      Stage 2 will involve a second brain surgery to implant the NeuroPace RNS® System. Researchers
      will use information from Stage 1 to decide where to implant the electrodes of the RNS
      System. Over the next ~4-12 months, participants will have regular study visits in the clinic
      where the researchers will determine a personalized brain activity pattern that correlates
      with depression symptoms and can be paired with stimulation to improve depression symptoms.

      Stage 3 will be 12 months long and will involve turning ON and OFF the intervention to test
      its effectiveness. Over the course of a year, the participant will have two 6-week periods
      with no stimulation and will receive the intervention for the remainder of the time.

      At the end of this stage the participant can choose to continue with long-term follow-up or
      have the RNS System surgically removed.
