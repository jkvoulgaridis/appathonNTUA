  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aging and obesity are both risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). One process that
      links both of these conditions to CVD is vascular dysfunction. Data from animal studies
      indicate that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress may play an important role in the development
      of endothelial dysfunction in aging and obesity. Therefore, the goal of this study is to
      investigate the relative contributions of aging and obesity on vascular dysfunction and ER
      stress. Additionally, this study will determine if taking an oral supplement for 8 weeks will
      improve vascular dysfunction and ER stress. Results from this study have the potential to
      identify a safe treatment option for improving vascular function in aging and obese
      populations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aging is the primary risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). One critical process that
      links aging to CVD is the development of vascular dysfunction, characterized by endothelial
      dysfunction and arterial stiffness. Both endothelial dysfunction and arterial stiffness
      predict cardiovascular events in older individuals. Aging often coincides with obesity,
      another independent risk factor for CVD. Although vascular function is well characterized in
      both aging and obesity, it's unclear how these two conditions interact to modulate vascular
      function, and whether the combination of aging and obesity has additive or compounding
      effects on endothelial dysfunction and arterial stiffness.

      Currently, it is unknown whether vascular dysfunction is driven by the same underlying
      cellular mechanisms in aging and obesity. Accumulating data in experimental animals suggest
      that ER stress may be an important factor in aging- and obesity-related vascular dysfunction.
      Additionally, middle-aged and older obese adults with endothelial dysfunction display
      evidence of ER stress within biopsied endothelial cells. In light of these data, the overall
      goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that ER stress is associated with human
      vascular dysfunction in the settings of aging and obesity, and to determine the efficacy of
      the chemical chaperone tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), an established inhibitor of ER
      stress, to reduce endothelial cell ER stress and improve vascular function in these at-risk
      individuals. Results from this study have the potential to identify a novel, safe, and
      clinically relevant intervention strategy for the treatment of vascular dysfunction in an
      aging population at high-risk for the development of CVD.
