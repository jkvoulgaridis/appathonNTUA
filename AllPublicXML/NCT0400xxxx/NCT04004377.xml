  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study has investigated the quality of life of patients with vestibular schwannoma using
      this specific scale prospectively, whether treated surgically or monitored.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The PANQOL scale (Penn Acoustic Neuroma Quality-of-Life) is a specific questionnaire
      containing 26 items Interviewing 7 areas: hearing, balance, facial expression, anxiety,
      vitality, pain, and 'general health. The score is encrypted from 0 to 100, and the highest
      score is a reflection of the best possible quality of life. This score has been translated
      from French into English and validated according to the reverse translation rules by usual
      Oddon et al.

      Three questions for this score were added, evaluating quality of life parameters that seem
      particularly interesting: the first regarding the difficulties in driving, the second
      questioning the recovery of a &quot;normal&quot; life, and the third assessing difficulties in working
      life.

      The questionnaires are sent to the patient in the form of a custom web link generated on the
      online survey platform SurveyMonkey, and integrated into the body of an email sent from the
      mailbox of the investigator Hospital. There is any identifying or indirectly identifying data
      on the questionnaire online, guaranteeing protection of the rights of the individual. Only
      the principal investigator and co-investigator retain the link between the coded identity of
      persons undergoing research used to associate personal health data and their name (s) and
      name (s) (correspondence table retained securely to the paper).
