    <textblock>
      To adequately assess postoperative pain in the coronary artery bypass surgical population a
      multicentered retrospective chart review was carried out; the study utilized a
      nonexperimental comparative descriptive study design. The retrospective review was conducted
      over a six-month time frame, consisting of June 2017 through November 2017, at two hospitals
      within the same organization. The data collection process began in late December of 2017 and
      January of 2018. The assessment of postop pain was performed by using a standard 11-point
      numeric pain rating scale on post extubation day one and the day of discharge.

        The retrospective review was conducted over a six-month time frame, consisting of June 2017
        through November 2017, at two hospitals within the same organization. One of the hospitals
        was a level one trauma center in the center of a major southeastern metropolitan area, and
        the second was a community hospital within the suburbs of the same city's geographic
        limits. All included patients fit the above inclusion and exclusion criteria per the
        aforementioned time frame and involved healthcare centers.
