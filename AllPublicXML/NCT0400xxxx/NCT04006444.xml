  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain may be an additional risk factor for drug iatrogeny due to its management and
      also drug non-compliance in the geriatric population.

      it seems interesting to carry out an inventory of the iatrogenic risk before and after the
      consultation at the pain centre to enable us to identify the patients most at risk. This
      study would make it possible to characterize elderly patients with chronic pain, in order to
      consider, in a future study, setting up a pharmaceutical consultation.

    <measure>Evolution of the ADE Geriatric risk score</measure>
    <time_frame>2018</time_frame>
    <description>The score is calculated on 10 points based on 3 criteria : number of drugs prescribed, prescription of neuroleptics and the initiation of an anticoagulant prescription less than 3 months old. It classifies patients into 3 risk categories: a low risk level for a score of 0 to 1 point, a medium risk level for a score of 2 to 5 points and a high risk level for a score of 6 to 10 points.</description>
