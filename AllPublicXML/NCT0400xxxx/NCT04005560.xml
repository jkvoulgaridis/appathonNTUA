  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess patient's quality of life 5 to 10 years after a severe
      bacterial infection with hospitalization in a intensive unit care. The population is derived
      from the DIABACT III study. The investigators will include every patient still alive. To
      evaluate our question, patients and their parents will answer quality of life questionnaires.
      The investigators will also have telephone interviews with the parents to know somatic and
      psychological effects on their child.

      The investigators will see if quality of life and sequelae differ depending on various
      studied factors.

      The aim of this study is to assess patient's quality of life 5 to 10 years after
      hospitalization in intensive car unit for a severe bacterial infection. The population is
      derived from DIABACT III study, and includes all patients still alive.

      To evaluate their quality of life, patients and parents will answer specific questionnaries.
      The Pediatric Quality of Life inventory (PedSQL) has various versions for children depending
      on their age, adults and parents. The investigators will get physical, emotional, social and
      academic scores.

      To assess somatic and psychological effect after the severe bacterial infection, the
      investigators will have telephone interviews with the parents, with many questions about
      organs disorders, specialized medical follow-up, medication, need physical or material
      assistance, financial and psychological family impact… The investigators will examine data
      from DIABACT III study to assess determinants of the quality of life for these patients.
