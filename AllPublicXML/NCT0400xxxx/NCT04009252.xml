  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Complex high energy fractures of the lower extremity are life changing injuries and are known
      to be associated with poor functional outcome post operatively. The list of potential
      post-operative complications associated with these injuries is long, and the worst of these
      fractures can even be limb threatening. One of the most difficult and prevalent
      post-operative issues this patient population faces is chronic pain and its association to
      opioid addiction, which is currently an epidemic across North America. These individuals not
      only present with physical insult but psychological trauma as well, which also greatly
      affects these patients post-operatively. Properly educating the patient about their injury
      and the process that they will embark on can greatly empower the patient as they begin their
      journey of rehabilitation. This process can hopefully mute or silence some of these
      modifiable risk factors predisposing patients to poor functional outcomes and chronic pain.
      The investigators also hope to help them initiate/develop coping strategies to better
      overcome the many obstacles these patients face and to do so using 3D printing. 3D printed
      models have not only been demonstrated to be valuable in orthopaedics, when it comes to
      educating patients about their disease and associated interventions, but many other
      specialties as well; such as: cardiac surgery, urology, and general surgery. Literature
      suggest that often little is understood or retained by the patient following a patient
      consent with regards to their injury, potential complications, interventions to be
      undertaken, as well as the rehabilitation process to follow. By providing the patient with a
      3D printed model of their fracture while educating them pre-/post-operatively, the
      investigators hope they will better understand the aforementioned, often forgotten points,
      indirectly yielding better overall patient satisfaction, patient outcomes and pain scores.
