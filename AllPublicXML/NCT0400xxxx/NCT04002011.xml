  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative management of oral anticoagulation is a frequent preoccupation in cardiac
      surgery, concerning about half of patients. Vitamin K antagonists are often recommended but
      their management is not easy due to the high dose-response patient variability.
      Pharmacologically more stable, direct oral anticoagulants have similar efficiency in
      preventing thromboembolic complications while they decrease the risk of bleeding in certain
      patient populations. The objective of study is to assess the safety and efficacy of direct
      oral anticoagulants in the postoperative period of cardiac surgical procedures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be composed by 2 groups of 103 participants, patients undergoing cardiac
      surgery and needing oral anticoagulation in the early postoperative period.

      The control group will receive vitamin K antagonist and the study group will receive direct
      oral anticoagulant. The investigators will call back each participants at 3 months to report
      the ischemic and bleeding complications during this period and evaluated the quality of life
      of the oral anticoagulation.
