    <textblock>
      Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is a well-known disorder of upper airways collapse during sleep
      time leading to oxygen desaturation and sleep fragmentation. Despite being increasingly
      recognized as cardiovascular risk, the effect of OSA on clinical outcomes after Acute
      Coronary Syndrome (ACS) is not fully defined. Also, OSA syndrome is highly prevalent in ACS
      and may be related to the deterioration of cardiac function resulting in worsening of the
      severity of sleep apnea or the intermittent hypoxia could be cardio-protective via the
      ischemic preconditioning event. Serial sleep studies have shown the progressive reduction of
      the Apnea / Hypopnea Index (AHI) from the admission in Coronary Care Unit (CCU) to 6 weeks,
      12 weeks and 6-month follow up, making necessary to re-assess the severity of OSA after
      discharge. Therefore, further research in this field is necessary to screen and predict those
      ACS patients who may experience a change in their AHI index over time.

    <textblock>
      Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is a well-known disorder of upper airways collapse during sleep
      time leading to oxygen desaturation, sleep fragmentation, tissue suffering and hypercapnia.
      The repeated airways collapse leads to a fall of blood saturation levels during sleep time
      and it is linked to daytime sleepiness, road traffic accidents, cognitive deficits,
      depression, myocardial infarction, pulmonary hypertension and stroke.

      Despite being increasingly recognized as a major cardiovascular risk, the effect of OSA on
      clinical outcomes after Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is not fully defined. The presentation
      of Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) can be unstable angina, non-ST Elevation Myocardial
      Infarction (NSTEMI) or ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI). Sleep apnea prevalence in
      the context of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) is sizeable, varying from 36.9%-82% when
      polysomnography is executed briefly after admission in Cardiovascular Care Unit (CCU). The
      high prevalence of OSA in ACS may be related to the deterioration of cardiac function
      resulting in worsening of the severity of sleep apnea. In converse, OSA has also been
      proposed as a protective factor in CAD. The intermittent hypoxia related to OSA could have a
      cardio-protective role during acute ACS via the phenomenon of &quot;ischemic preconditioning&quot;,
      showing that in acute MI patients higher AHI was associated with lower peak troponin-T levels
      in partially and fully adjusted models.

      Furthermore, the improvement of cardiac outcomes at the follow-up post-discharge seems to
      positively influence the severity of OSA. In particular, serial sleep studies have
      interestingly shown a progressive reduction of the AHI at 6 weeks, 12 weeks and 6-month
      follow up, making necessary to re-assess the severity of OSA after discharge. Therefore,
      further research in this field is necessary to screen and predict those ACS patients with a
      diagnosis of OSA made at admission in CCU who may experience a change in their AHI index over
      time, in order to identify those with a potential unfavourable prognosis.

    <intervention_model_description>The target sample size (for primary aim) is 37. Patients to be enrolled: 50 Patients to be screened: 70
This sample size (n=37) has been defined as sufficient to detect a difference of 15.0 in mean AHI Index between baseline and 3-month follow up with a power of 95% and a 5% (two-sided) significance level. The sample size was calculated and based on a previous pilot study from our institution and reported in &quot;More information&quot; section.
Notably, attrition has been proposed due to the possible loss of follow up at 90-day: thus, we decided to enroll 13 more patients affected by OSA for a total of 50 patients.
Moreover, given a CCU prevalence of OSA in ACS of 73%, a total of 70 patients affected by ACS are expected to be screened in order to collect 50 OSA target sample size population.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 90 days</time_frame>
    <description>Change of Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) severity from baseline to 90 days in patients affected by an Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS). Within 72 hours from admission, patients will perform a polygraphy and the Apnea / Hypopnea Index (AHI) will be determined. OSA syndrome is defined by AHI more than 5.0 per hour and can be mild (AHI between 5.0 and 15), moderate (AHI between 15.0 and 30.0) or severe (AHI more than 30.0).
When a diagnosis of OSA is confirmed, the patient will have a follow up visit with a new polygraphy and AHI will be defined again. Patients are not going to receive any treatment for the sleep-disorder breathing between baseline and 90-day. The difference between AHI baseline and AHI of the follow-up will define the evolution of OSA severity and will show an improved, stable or worsened sleep-disorder.</description>
