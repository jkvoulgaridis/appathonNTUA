  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to extend the recent Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Sentinel
      tabulations regarding stroke risk among new users of typical and atypical antipsychotics to
      participants who were aged 18-64 years and did not have dementia to participants aged 65
      years and older regardless of dementia status.
