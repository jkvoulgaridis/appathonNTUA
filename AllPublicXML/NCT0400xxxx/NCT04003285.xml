  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine if allopregnanolone (ALLO) improves depression and pain symptoms in
      patients who have a history of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) [primary endpoints]. The
      investigators will also determine if ALLO improves functional outcome [secondary endpoint].
      Participants in this study will receive an intravenous infusion of either ALLO or placebo.
      Behavioral assessments will be conducted during the infusion and at several time points
      post-infusion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ALLO is a neurosteroid that exhibits multiple actions highly relevant to the treatment of
      chronic complex TBI. The investigators' recent human data suggest that ALLO is decreased in
      patients with TBI, suggesting that ameliorating deficits of this neurosteroid may be
      clinically therapeutic. In addition, multiple groups have reported ALLO reductions in
      patients with conditions that frequently co-occur with TBI, including depression and pain
      disorders. 132 Veterans with a history of mild TBI with co-occurring depression and pain
      symptoms (chronic complex TBI) will be randomized to either intravenous placebo or ALLO (3
      groups/44 participants per group: placebo, lower dose ALLO, higher dose ALLO). Following a
      loading dose, Veterans will receive placebo or ALLO infusion targeted to achieve serum ALLO
      levels of 0 nM (placebo), 50 nM (ALLO lower dose), or 150nM (ALLO higher dose). Behavioral
      assessments will be conducted during the infusion, post-taper, and 24 hours post-infusion. In
      addition, the investigators will conduct behavioral assessments 7 days and 14 days
      post-infusion.

      The investigators hypothesize that ALLO will be well-tolerated in patients with complex TBI,
      and that this intervention may reduce depression and pain symptoms (in addition to
      potentially improving function).

    <measure>Brief Pain Inventory, Short Form (BPI-SF) Change</measure>
    <time_frame>6 hours, 24 hours, 7 days, and 14 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Brief Pain Inventory, Short Form (BPI-SF) is a self-reported scale that measures the severity of pain and the interference of pain on function. The scores range from 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as severe as you can imagine). There are 4 questions assessing worst pain, least pain, average pain in the past 24 hours, and pain right now. The Interference scores range from 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes). There are 7 questions assessing the interference of pain in the past 24 hours for general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep, and enjoyment of life.</description>

    <measure>Hamilton-Depression Inventory (HAM-D) Change</measure>
    <time_frame>6 hours, 24 hours, 7 days, and 14 days</time_frame>
    <description>The HAM-D measures the severity of depressive symptoms. It is a checklist of 17 items that are ranked on a scale of 0-4 or 0-2. The range for the total score (which is the sum of the scores of all 17 items) is 0-52; a higher score indicates greater severity of symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) Change</measure>
    <time_frame>6 hours, 24 hours, 7 days, and 14 days</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 is a health survey with an 8-scale profile embedded in 36 questions that measures physical and mental components of health. Each item is scored on a 0 to 100 range with the lowest and highest possible scores are set at 0 and 100, respectively. All of these items are scored so that a high score defines a more favorable health state.</description>

             infarction, the presence of congestive heart failure, or any other serious health
