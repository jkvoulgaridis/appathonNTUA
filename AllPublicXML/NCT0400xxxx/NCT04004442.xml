  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to test the safety of avelumab and AVB-S6-500 and see
      what effects (good and bad) this combination treatment has on patients with advanced
      urothelial carcinoma.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will have tests and exams to see if they are eligible for the clinical trial. If
      found eligible, the patient will receive treatment with avelumab and AVB-S6-500 by vein once
      every two weeks.

      This study has two parts in order to determine the maximum tolerated dose of AVB-S6-500. If
      the patient is enrolled on the first dose level, the patient will be treated at a higher dose
      every two weeks with AVB-S6-500. If the patient is enrolled on the second dose level, the
      patient will be receive AVB-S6-500 only once a week at a lower dose. The patient would
      continue to receive avelumab twice weekly at the same dose.

      Patients will receive the study treatment as long as there is evidence that the tumor is not
      growing or spreading and they are not having any unacceptable, bad side effects.

      Patients will be monitored during treatment with tests and exams and after treatment
      completion for up to one year.
