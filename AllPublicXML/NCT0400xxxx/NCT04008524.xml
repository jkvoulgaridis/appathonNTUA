  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is intended to provide CAR-T cell therapy products for patients with severely
      life-threatening relapsed and refractory hematological malignancies. These patients have been
      previously treated sufficiently, currently have no other treatment methods available, and do
      not meet the inclusion criteria of other clinical trial projects in the process of subject
      recruitment or meet their exclusion criteria. This project is designed to meet the urgent
      clinical needs of individual patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients suffering from a hematological malignancy that is severely life-threatening
             or seriously affects the patient's quality of life and has no effective treatment
             available, who not meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria for other clinical trials in
             the process of subject recruitment, or who are unable to obtain other study drugs or
             participate in clinical studies/trials for some reason (regional or time restriction,
             etc., or the recruitment of subjects for clinical studies/trials has ended but the
             drug has not yet been approved for marketing in China);

          -  Patients who are definitely diagnosed with the corresponding target-positive relapsed
             and refractory hematological malignancies, including but not limited to the following
             circumstances:

               -  Patients who do not meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria for existing clinical
                  trials, such as age &lt;18 years, ECOG &gt;1, extramedullary recurrence, persistent or
                  repeatedly positive for minimal residual disease;

               -  Patients who have relapsed after remission following CAR-T cell therapy, and are
                  expected as judged by the investigator to benefit more from re-use of the same
                  cell or sequential use of other CAR-T cells compared with the risk;

               -  The quantity of CAR-T cells produced does not meet the release criteria of
                  production quality inspection, but is &gt;0.1× 106/kg CAR positive T cells, and the
                  investigator judges that the expected benefit of cell infusion is greater than
                  the risk;

               -  The disease progresses rapidly after cell collection and before infusion, and the
                  investigator judges that the expected benefit of cell infusion is greater than
                  the risk;

               -  Patients who have relapsed after autologous/heterogeneous hematopoietic stem cell
                  transplantation (including those positive for minimal residual disease);

               -  Other circumstances where the investigator judges that the expected benefit of
                  cell infusion is greater than the risk.

          -  Patients with appropriate bone marrow reserve: such as lymphocyte count &gt;0.3×109/L;

          -  Patients with proper heart, lung, liver, kidney and coagulation functions;

          -  The selected patients or their legal representatives voluntarily sign the informed
             consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are positive for any of HIV antibody, TP antibody, HBsAg and HCV
             antibody.

          -  Patients with a history of epilepsy or other central nervous system diseases.

          -  Patients with evidence of currently uncontrollable serious active infections (e.g.,
             sepsis, bacteremia, fungemia, viremia, etc.).

          -  Patients with other conditions making the patients unsuitable for receiving cell
             therapy as judged by the investigator.
