  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to compare the effectiveness of nontargeted rapid opt-out hepatitis
      C (HCV) screening versus targeted rapid opt-out HCV screening using recommended risk
      characteristics in multiple urban emergency departments (EDs) across the United States (Aim 1
      - &quot;Screening Trial&quot;).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will perform a prospective pragmatic randomized effectiveness trial that
      will allow the investigators to directly compare 2 HCV screening methods while minimizing
      threats to internal validity. Patients will be screened for HCV infection using 1 of 2
      interventions using a balanced patient-level random allocation scheme built into existing
      electronic health records (EHRs) for each ED. Patients will therefore be offered HCV testing
      based on the result of the screening arm to which they are assigned, and in the case of the
      targeted arm, the results of the risk assessment evaluation performed by the intake nurse.
      All randomization will be completely integrated into electronic medical screening systems and
      workflow at each site. Integration of randomization into the electronic systems will allow
      for real-time concealed random allocation. Nurses who perform screening and all other ED
      staff (e.g. physicians, technicians) will understand the conceptual goals of the project but
      will be blinded to study hypotheses, and patients will be completely blinded to the purpose
      of the study.

      This study will be performed at multiple sites, including the EDs at Denver Health Medical
      Center (DHMC) (Denver, Colorado), Johns Hopkins Hospital (JHH) (Baltimore, Maryland), and the
      University of Mississippi Medical Center (UMMC) (Jackson, Mississippi).

Targeted HCV screening will consist of offering HCV testing to those identified with the following specific risk characteristics, adapted from the above recommendations: born between 1945 - 1965 (&quot;birth cohort&quot;); injection drug use (IDU); intranasal drug use;tattoo or piercing in an unregulated setting; or blood transfusion or organ recipient before 1992.</description>
