  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is an uncommon disease. Conventional
      treatment has consisted of either whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) or methotrexate
      (MTX)-based combined modality therapy integrating chemotherapy with cranial irradiation in a
      sandwiched manner. No matter whether the dosage of MTX is high or conventional, combining
      chemotherapy with WBRT greatly improves intracranial tumor control and even survival
      outcomes. However, delayed treatment-related neurotoxicity and neurocognitive sequelae
      emerged as a significant debilitating complication in PCNSL patients, especially when
      effective combined chemoradiation can achieve disease control and long-term survival rates.
      Therefore, by delivering hyperfractionated conformal WBRT plus SIB, this prospective cohort
      study aims to accomplish both optimal intracranial control and minimal WBRT induced
      neurocognitive decline. Additionally, by administering objective multi-domain
      neurobehavioral/neurocognitive assessments, the change in neurocognitive functions (NCFs)
      before and after the course of hyperfractionated conformal WBRT will be investigated and
      analyzed.

      According to the treatment guidelines for treating newly-diagnosed PCNSL patients, combined
      chemoradiation in which the WBRT course is sandwiched between initial courses of MTX and the
      later courses of chemotherapy with Ara-C is the treatment of mainstay at our institute.
      Employing the technique of a conformal CT treatment planning, the WBRT course is delivered in
      the manner of hyperfractionation with a reduced cumulative dose of 3600 cGy in 30 fractions
      during 3-4 weeks, administered twice daily in 1.2 Gy - fractions with at least 6 hours
      between fractions. By virtue of multidisciplinary management and teamwork including
      neurosurgery, hematology, radiation oncology, and neuroimaging expertise, it is attempted to
      recruit all potentially eligible patients with newly-diagnosed PCNSL. Most importantly, a
      professional neuropsychologist participates in this research project to integrate
      neurobehavioral outcomes into the prospective study. Accordingly, a battery of
      neuropsychological measures is used to evaluate predetermined NCFs for the studied patients.
      The test battery is composed of six standardized neuropsychological tests, covering four
      domains sensitive to disease and treatment effects (executive function, attention, verbal
      memory, information processing). The primary outcome measure is the change in patients'
      capability of information processing indicated by the Paced Auditory Serial Addition
      Test-Revised (PASAT-R), from the baseline before receiving the WBRT course to the follow-up
      after undergoing the entire courses of combined chemoradiation.

      This prospective cohort study aims to thoroughly examine newly diagnosed PCNSL patients by
      using a standard battery of neurobehavioral/neurocognitive functions. Additionally, a better
      intracranial disease control is expected since the WBRT course relies on a highly conformal
      treatment planning integrated with the individualized arrangement of simultaneous integrated
      boost (SIB) to escalate the focal dose irradiating the originally involved site(s). Moreover,
      WBRT-related neurocognitive sequelae might be significantly less likely to occur because the
      WBRT course is delivered in the fashion of hyperfractionation, indicating a significantly
      lower dose per fraction and a reduced cumulative dose. Furthermore, it is anticipated the
      investigators will analyze which neurobehavioral domain would predict the treatment-related
      neurocognitive impacts to the largest extent in newly diagnosed PCNSL patients treated with
      cranial RT combined with or without MTX based chemotherapy according to the multidisciplinary
      treatment guidelines implemented at a single institute.

The National Taiwan University Irritability Scale (NTUIS) is a self-reported scale with validated and reliable psychometric properties, to specifically evaluate irritability.
The NTUIS required patients to examine their irritability before and after disease.
The NTUIS is a 6-point Likert scale with 18 items. Each item was rated 1 (totally non-matched to patient's conditions) to 6 (totally matched to patient's conditions) with descriptions anchoring each matching level. Since &quot;excessive emotional (e.g. anger and annoyance) and behavioural (e.g. verbal aggression) responses to stimuli&quot; were used as the operational definition of irritability, the items considering anger, verbal aggression and annoyance were selected.</description>
