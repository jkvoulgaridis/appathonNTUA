    <textblock>
      The LENTO study sample includes the caregivers and their clients living in eastern Finland.
      The aims of this study are

        1. to study the nutritional status, oral health, coping, functional capacity and quality of
           life

        2. to find out how individual nutrition and oral health counseling received for caregivers
           affect on the nutritional status and oral health of caregivers and their clients

        3. develop an operating model to maintain good nutrition and oral health.

      In Finland, the aim is to reduce the institutional care of older people and caring them in
      their own homes. The goal of shifting the focus of services to open services is difficult to
      implement if the health of the caregivers is inadequate. In order to achieve this goal, it is
      important to influence the health and performance of caregivers. Information is needed to
      support this, among others, about how the nutrition and oral health of caregivers can be
      promoted and to what extent this affects the performance and quality of life of their
      clients. A randomly of 220 caregivers over 65 years old and their clients is selected for
      this study. The caregivers are randomized to either treatment or control groups. At the
      beginning of the study is estimated the nutritional status and oral health of the caregivers.
      Based on the results, the nutritionist and dental hygienist give individual advice to
      optimize the nutrition and oral health of the caregivers in the intervention group. After six
      months, the same measurements are made as at the beginning of the study. Monitoring
      measurements will be made one year after the start of the intervention. The results of this
      project provide information on the health, well-being, and ability to the function of the
      caregivers. Based on the results, is developed an operating model that is intended to be wide
      as use as possible. Improving the nutrition and oral health of caregivers has a significant
      impact on their own and their clients health and well-being as well as the long-term care
      costs presumably.

    <description>On the basis of a blood test, Mini Nutritional Assessment, food diary and nutritional anamnesis, the nutritionist developed a plan for individualised nutritional care and discussed with the caregivers. If the caregivers seemed unable to increase the energy and/or protein of their diet, daily complementary dietary drinks were recommended to them. The participants were re-examined six months after the baseline interviews to evaluate the effectiveness of the interventions.</description>
