  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and image quality of the
      investigational dye, MB-102, compared to the control dye (fluorescein sodium) in healthy and
      diseased eyes using fluorescent angiography for retinal vascular disease diagnosis and
      monitoring.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single-dose study, in normal participants and in those with current retinal
      pathology, investigating feasibility of the investigational dye, MB-102, for use in
      fluorescent angiography compared to fluorescein sodium. Safety and tolerability of MB-102
      will also be evaluated. Control dye fluorescein sodium will be administered intravenously a
      minimum of 3 days prior to MB-102 dosing. After IV administration of dyes, images will be
      acquired of both eyes with a Zeiss fundus camera (and for some participants additional fundus
      photography will be performed with clinically-approved ocular angiography imaging systems) by
      a trained ophthalmic photographer. Participants will return for a follow-up visit after
      MB-102 dosing for further physical examination, clinical laboratory tests, and reporting of
      any adverse events. Photographs will be examined for quality as well as the utility of the
      angiography in evaluating disease diagnosis and progression.

    <description>Ocular angiography will be performed using a commercially available, FDA-approved clinical Zeiss FF450 fundus camera. Images will be taken of both eyes, acquired by a trained ophthalmic photographer. In at least 2 participants, imaging will also be conducted using 2 different additional clinically-approved ocular angiography imaging systems.</description>

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury, or untoward clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory findings) in participants, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not related to the investigational drug or the reference medication. Adverse events will be collected from the time a participant is considered enrolled (after consent is signed) through the follow-up visit. Participants who fail screening will not have AEs collected.</description>
