    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, randomized, open-label clinical study to assess the treatment
      response of high-dose rabeprazole compared with standard-dose rabeprazole in patients with
      extra-esophageal manifestations of gastroesophageal reflux disease.

      Gastroesophageal reflux disease is a condition in which reflux of stomach contents into the
      esophagus. This disease can be classified in to two subtypes according to the symptoms;
      Typical symptoms such as heartburn and regurgitation, and atypical symptoms (extra-esophageal
      symptoms) such as chronic cough, asthma, non-cardiac chest pain, globus sensation, etc.

      Acid suppression with proton pump inhibitors is the mainstream of therapy for the
      extra-esophageal manifestation as well as the typical symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux
      disease.

      However, there is controversy about the efficacy of proton pump inhibitors on
      extra-esophageal reflux.

      Therefore, we aimed to assess the effect of proton pump inhibotor (rabeprazole) on the
      extra-esophageal manifestation of gastroesophageal reflux disease, through comparison of
      treatment response with high-dose and standard-dose rabeprazole.

    <description>A percentage of subjects showed effective improvement of extra-esophageal symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease by assessing the average sum of the questionnaire symptom scores.
The definition of &quot;effective improvement&quot; is the subjects showed â‰¥50% reduction from the initial questionnaire score.
The symptom questionnaire consists of a 5-graded Likert scale for each symptom to assess intensity of symptoms.
[score 0: no symptoms, score 1: mild symptoms that is not easily felt, score 2: moderate symptoms but not affect daily life, score 3: severe symptoms that hinder daily life or sleep, score 4: very severe symptoms that cannot lead to normal daily life or sleep]
In this trial, extra-esophageal symptoms consist of eight symptoms; non-cardiac chest pain, cough, globus, wheezing, laryngopharyngitis, hoarseness, belching and dysphagia.</description>
