  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sarcopenia is a loss of muscle mass and function that develops during aging. But sarcopenia
      is also observed in several other conditions: chronic diseases, cancers, viral infections,
      renal / respiratory insufficiency, immobility, obesity with low physical activity. This
      sarcopenia is named secondary sarcopenia to distinguish it from the age-associated primary
      sarcopenia. During prolonged hospitalizations in intensive care, a significant loss of
      muscular mass and function is also observed. This acute sarcopenia or Intensive Care
      Unit-Acquired Weakness (ICU-AW) may persist for several months after discharge from hospital.
      In addition to the loss of autonomy, the reduction of muscle mass has important metabolic
      implications, ranging from insulin resistance to modification of myokines production.
      Sarcopenia greatly increases the morbidity and mortality of patients regardless of its cause.
      The aim of our project is to identify the molecular mechanisms implicated in sarcopenia from
      different origin. We will particularly focus our work on the metabolic properties, the
      proliferation/ differentiation and regeneration capacities of the satellite cells (adult
      muscle stem cells). These satellite cells will be purified from quadriceps biopsies of human
      volunteers recruited at CHU Montpellier. These satellite cells will also be used to test the
      ability of some wild aromatic plants from south of France to improve cell survival and
      differentiation. This will allow us to identify the molecular mechanisms involved in
      sarcopenia development and identify potential therapeutic molecules.
