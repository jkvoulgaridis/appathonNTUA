      This study evaluates the effects of Mindfulness-based Interventions (MBI) on the
      neuropsychological profile of individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). It will also
      investigate changes in fMRI activity, such as resting-state functional connectivity networks
      and changes in activity in attention networks in task-related fMRI using graph theory
      analysis after Mindfulness-based Interventions. Participants will be randomly assigned to
      receive either the Mindfulness-Based Intervention, Cognitive Rehabilitation Training or
      Treatment as Usual as the passive control group comparison.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As the population of Singapore ages rapidly, cognitive decline associated with both normal
      aging and disease is becoming a frequently encountered health challenge. In our proposed
      study, we will investigate the effects of mindfulness-based interventions (MBI), which have
      shown significant promise in halting and even reversing age-related cognitive impairment. MBI
      enhances the quality and frequency of mindfulness, defined as a mental state achieved by
      focusing one's attention and awareness on the present moment, while calmly acknowledging and
      accepting one's feelings, thoughts, and bodily sensations. In this study, we will administer
      a standardized MBI program or Cognitive Rehabilitation Therapy to a group of 60 patients
      diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a condition marked by deficits in language,
      memory and attention that often leads to dementia; an additional 30 patients will be assigned
      to the control group. There will be 3 runs with 30 persons per run; each group will have 10
      randomly assigned participants. By comparing the 3 groups across the 3 runs, we seek to test
      the following hypotheses: 1) MBI will result in significantly greater improvements in
      neuropsychological testing outcomes across multiple cognitive domains, including attention,
      memory, language and processing speed, 2) MBI will strengthen cortical connectivity as
      measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and 3) MBI will lead to changes in
      fMRI activation on a test of facets of attention. Neuropsychological testing will take place
      in SGH, while fMRI and EEG scanning will take place in the Center for Cognitive Neuroscience
      at Duke-NUS. Both the MBI and CRT will be facilitated by trained personnel. Our proposed
      experiment comprises one of the most comprehensive interrogations of the effects of MBT on
      patients to date, and if successful, could rapidly translate into a program with both
      clinical and economic impact.

    <time_frame>An average of 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Short-Form 36 (SF-36) is a 36-item self-report survey of health, including physical and mental health, with 8 scaled scores, each ranging from a minimum of 0 to max 100. Total score is the mean of all the subscales.
Physical functioning : 10 items; Role functioning/physical : 4 items; Role emotional: 3 items; Energy/fatigue: 4 items; Mental Health: 5 items; Social functioning: 2 items; Body pain: 2 items; General health : 5 items; Reported health transition: 1 item.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Subjective measures of Sleep quality: Insomnia Severity Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Two weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) evaluates an individual's level of tendency for insomnia on a 7-item questionnaire, scoring in total from 0 to 28. Scores above 15 indicates moderate severity of clinical insomnia while scores above 22 are indicative of severe clinical insomnia. ISI internal consistency was excellent for population samples both in the community and clinical samples as well, (Cronbach Î± of 0.90 and 0.91 respectively).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Subjective measures of Sleep quality: Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index Score</measure>
    <time_frame>One month</time_frame>
    <description>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index Score (PSQI) is a 19-item self-rated questionnaire for evaluating subjective sleep quality over the previous month. The PSQI has a sensitivity of 89.6% and specificity of 86.5% for identifying cases with sleep disorder, using a cut-off score of 5.
The first 4 items are open questions, whereas items 5 to 19 are rated on a 4-point Likert scale. Individual items scores yield 7 components. A total score, ranging from 0 to 21, is obtained by adding the 7 component scores. A score of 5 and above suggests poor sleep quality. A decrease in PSQI score following intervention would reflect and improvement of sleep quality.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Imaging measures (structural): change in orbitofrontal cortex volume</measure>
    <time_frame>6 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The change in the volume of orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is assessed through structural MRI brain scans - Participants will have their baseline fMRI scan before the start of their participation in the intervention and after the end of the intervention.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in functional imaging measures: Resting state</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>During two rsfMRI scans, subjects are imaged over several minutes while their eyes are open, but without performing any explicit task. The resting state scan will show only a fixation cross on the screen in order to minimize the cognitive processing involved while decreasing head movement and sleepiness in the scanner.
Mindfulness predisposition is measured with the use of traditional connectivity analysis as well as a newer method: graph theory analysis for task ready state in Dynamic Functional Connectivity. These data are extracted by decomposing the time-varying signal during resting periods into independent, intrinsically connected networks.</description>
