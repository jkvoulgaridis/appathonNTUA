  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The first aim of this study is to gain insight into older adults' perceptions towards a
      self-monitoring tool aimed at the reduction of sedentary behavior. Secondly, this study aimed
      to investigate the preliminary efficacy of a self-monitoring tool aimed at the reduction of
      sedentary behavior.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A mixed-method study will be conducted to assess participants' perceptions and preliminary
      efficacy of a self-monitoring based intervention aimed at the reduction of sedentary behavior
      in older adults (&gt; 60 years).

      A convenience sample of 40 older adults will be recruited using Facebook advertisements, as
      well as from an existing database of older adults willing to participate in research studies.

      Older adults who agree to participate will be contacted by phone to make an appointment for a
      visit. During this first visit, participants will receive an informed consent. After signing
      the informed consent, a structured interview will be conducted to assess the participants'
      socio-demographic characteristics, domain-specific sedentary behavior and health status. A
      semi-structured interview will be conducted to examine participants' perceptions towards
      (reducing) sedentary behavior. Moreover, an inclinometer will be attached to the
      participants' thigh. Participants will be instructed to wear the inclinometer for one week.
      After one week, a researcher will visit the participants once again to collect the
      inclinometers. During this second visit, participants will receive a self-monitoring tool
      (i.e. the Activator) aimed at the reduction of sedentary behavior. Participants will be able
      to use the self-monitoring tool for four weeks. Apart from that, participants will receive a
      booklet with general sedentary behavior information and an explanation on how to use the
      self-monitoring tool. By the end of the intervention, the self-monitoring tools will be
      collected, and participants will be instructed to answer another structured interview and to
      wear the inclinometer for another week. At the end of this week, inclinometers will
      collected, and a semi-structured interview will be conducted with the older adults of the
      intervention group to gain insight into their experiences with self-monitoring as a behavior
      change technique to reduce sedentary behavior, as well as with the Activator.

    <description>Total sedentary behavior was objectively estimated by means of the ActivPAL inclinometer (PAL Technologies, Glasgow, UK). The inclinometer was attached on the midline of the right anterior thigh. Participants were instructed to wear the inclinometer for seven consecutive days (24h/day) both at baseline, and at post measurement.</description>

    <measure>Perceptions of (reducing) sedentary behavior</measure>
    <time_frame>Posttest (4 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Perceptions of older adults' towards reducing sedentary behavior by means of a self-monitoring tool will be assessed using a semi-structured interview. The interview guide has been developed by the principal investigator and includes open questions regarding older adults' perceptions towards 1) sedentary behavior, 2) using self-monitoring to reduce sedentary behavior and 3) the Activator (i.e. the self-monitoring tool used in our study). Examples of questions are: What are your perceptions regarding the Activator? Did you enjoy receiving feedback on your sitting time every day? Etc.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Domain-specific sedentary behavior</measure>
    <time_frame>Pretest - posttest (4 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Domain-specific sedentary behaviors were assessed using a questionnaire developed by Busschaert et al. Concretely, week and weekend day sedentary behaviors were asked using the following question: 'During the last 7 days, how much time did you usually spend sitting while (1) reading, (2) caring, (3) practicing hobbies, (4) socializing, (5) listening to/playing music, (6) consuming meals, (7) watching television, (8) using a computer, (9) moving from one place to another, (10) doing household activities (11) making phone calls.</description>
