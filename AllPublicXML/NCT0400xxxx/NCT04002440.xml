  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Among ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients, does use of the Baxter AMIA peritoneal
      dialysis cycler with SHARESOURCE connectivity platform achieve dry weight targets better than
      use of the Baxter Home Choice Pro cycler.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The remote patient management system Baxter AMIA automated peritoneal dialysis system with
      SHARESOURCE connectivity platform incorporates innovative technology (two-way remote
      connectivity, touch screen controls, voice guidance) to record patient treatments which are
      then able to be transmitted to their dialysis clinic for review and monitoring in near
      real-time. This has tremendous potential clinical utility given the struggles to achieve dry
      weights for most peritoneal dialysis patients using other systems, where typically,
      management regarding fluid balance is reviewed and revised only monthly. The new technology
      is the only device cleared in the US with patient-centric features. Abstracts available have
      demonstrated that AMIA can improve efficiency of patient training and focus PD nursing time
      towards proactive tasks to help patients. There has also been insight into how remote patient
      management systems like AMIA can be used to objectively monitor patient compliance or
      catheter function above and beyond subjective endorsement from patients. However, with new
      technology comes new training for patient and staff (nurses, physicians) without
      understanding if interfacing with this new patient-centric featured technology improves
      patient-centric clinical outcomes. The new AMIA and SHARESOURCE programs may also require
      additional nurse and physician provider time to monitor data in real-time and to react to
      these data, which may incur additional expense to medical practices. Thus, it is imperative
      to demonstrate the utility of the AMIA and SHARESOURCE programs for important improvement in
      patient management, which may ultimately translate into improved clinical outcomes (e.g.
      fewer hospital admissions, less heart failure, improved quality, and length of life).

    <intervention_model>Crossover Assignment</intervention_model>
    <intervention_model_description>Participants will be consented and then randomized to one of 2 modality groups; AMIA or HomeChoice PRO. Participants will receive PD care with randomized modality for 6 months, then cross-over to other modality for next 6 months. Nephrologists will see patients once a month. Each visit, the nephrologist will define the patient's desired dry weight (DW) at the subsequent visit. The primary end-point will be the average difference between actual DW vs. prescribed DW. The investigators envision a learning curve with each cycler change, and therefore have set the primary endpoint to average the final 3 visits, rather than using all 6 visits. All solutions and supplies will be from Baxter. Labs will be obtained monthly and quarterly per routine. Dialysis RN will review patients on AMIA twice a week and contact those off target DW and offer interventions to achieve prescribed DW. HomeChoice PRO will record data on a chip analyzed at the end of 6 months to evaluate compliance.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>The study is not blinded, as the intervention does not provide an opportunity to blind either the physician or the patient. The PI will be masked to randomization and not involved in patient care or data collection. Statistical analyses will be conducted by Dr. Ronit Katz who is not an investigator for this trial and PI Dr.Joachim Ix after being provided secure study results.</masking_description>

    <measure>Patient Quality of Life while using AMIA with SHARESOURCE: Kidney Disease and Quality of Life -36 questionaire</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will assess quality of life scores using the Kidney Disease and Quality of Life -36 questionaire survey of patients using AMIA with SHARESOURCE compared to patients using HomeChoicePRO. The survey assesses 5 areas pertaining to quality of life on dialysis which include 1) physical component score 2) mental component score 3) burden 4) symptoms 5) effects. Patient answers are compared to their national demographic and reported on a scale of 0-100. The higher the score the better. The scores for each component will be reported and tracked separately.</description>
