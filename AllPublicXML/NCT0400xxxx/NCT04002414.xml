  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized control trial to determine if performing the US Health and Human Services
      recommended amount of weekly physical activity during ovarian stimulation will differentially
      affect mental health or clinical outcomes of individuals who are usually active,
      insufficiently active, or inactive in their everyday lives. The goal overall is to assess for
      safety and value of physical activity during fertility treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Consenting participants will be separated into groups based on current average level of
      physical activity: Active women (complete &gt;75 minutes of vigorous exercise or &gt;150 minutes of
      moderate exercise per week), Insufficiently active women (&lt;75 minutes of vigorous exercise or
      &lt;150 minutes of moderate exercise per week), or Inactive women (no moderate or vigorous
      exercise per week).

      Between time of study enrollment and first ultrasound at start of ovarian stimulation cycle,
      the participants will be sent a link to questionnaires to assess general mental health
      parameters and physical fitness. They will be asked to complete the questionnaire prior to
      first ultrasound visit. At time of first ultrasound, participants who have completed the
      pre-stimulation survey will be randomized into one of two arms depending on their group: the
      active group will be randomized to (A) maintenance or (B) decreased activity arm, and the
      insufficiently active group will be randomized to (C) increased or (D) maintenance activity
      arm, and the inactive group will be randomized to (E) increased or (F) maintenance activity
      arm.

      Also at first ultrasound, participants will be given a wearable heart rate monitor in order
      to track heart rate during the time from ovarian stimulation to first pregnancy test in order
      to monitor compliance to randomized activity level of each participant. The data from the
      monitors will be collected through a central university provided, password protected laptop
      utilizing an app platform. Furthermore, all participants will be asked to complete a daily
      mood, stress, discomfort questionnaire throughout stimulation. Participants will be expected
      to continue recommended physical activity level and questionnaires until day of egg
      retrieval. Wearable monitors will continue to be worn until time of first pregnancy test.
      Within the two weeks after completion of egg retrieval, participants will be sent a follow-up
      questionnaire to assess overall treatment stress and satisfaction with ovarian stimulation
      cycle. Those who completed in vitro fertilization and fresh embryo transfer will be sent a
      second follow-up questionnaire about 1-2 weeks after pregnancy test.

    <intervention_model_description>Patients will be stratified into groups: &quot;active,&quot; &quot;insufficiently active,&quot; or &quot;inactive&quot; based on current average physical activity. Randomization will be into one of two parallel arms, maintenance of current activity during ovarian stimulation, or modify activity level during ovarian stimulation.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Stress During Treatment based on daily end of day stress item</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <description>As validated in prior studies (Schliep et al. 2015) examining stress and infertility, we will ask participants, &quot;how did your stress levels today compare to your usual level of stress?&quot; Participants will respond on a 3-point scale with the following options: 1 (not stressful), 2 (a little stressful), 3 (very stressful). We plan to compare average daily stress as well as stress trend over the 14-days of stimulation.</description>

    <measure>Anxiety/Depression During Treatment based on Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Short Form (PROMIS-SF) Depression 4a and Anxiety 4a</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Measured with daily PROMIS-SF Depression 4a and Anxiety 4a questions for the approximately two weeks of ovarian stimulation. The PROMIS-SF Anxiety 4a item bank assesses self-reported fear, anxious misery, hyperarousal, and arousal-related somatic symptoms (e.g., dizziness). The PROMIS-SF Depression 4a item bank assesses self-reported negative mood (e.g., sadness), views of self (e.g., worthlessness), social cognition (e.g., loneliness), and decreased positive affect and engagement. Items are all answered on a 5-point scale from 1=Never to 5=Always. Scores can range from 0 meaning no anxiety/depression to 40 meaning high anxiety/depression.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Stress during treatment based upon Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)-14</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in mean PSS-14 score from pre-treatment to post-treatment. PSS-14 includes 14 items, 7 negatively states items and 7 positively stated items. Each item is rated on a 5-point scale (0 = Never, 1 = Almost Never, 2 = Sometimes, 3 = Fairly Often, 4 = Very Often). The positively stated items re reverse coded, so all items are summed to create a total score. Scores can range from 0 meaning no stress to 56 meaning severely stressed.</description>
