  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to estimate the association between blood fibrocytes measured during a
      suspected exacerbation and 3-year decline forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), in
      patients with Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in primary care, with a history of
      smoking, independently of the number of exacerbations and of tobacco or occupational
      exposure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COPD is highly prevalent in primary care. It is associated with tobacco smoke or toxic
      occupational exposure. Some COPD patients will experience a faster decline in quality of life
      and lung function. There is currently no prognostic marker allowing to identify those
      patients at higher risk of fast lung function decline. Recent data suggest that fibrocytes
      are involved in COPD's physiopathology. A higher blood fibrocytes level during an acute
      exacerbation has been associated with higher mortality in COPD patients at a late stage of
      the disease. In mice, fibrocytes role in lung function decline has been demonstrated at an
      early stage. To date, association between blood fibrocytes during an exacerbation and lung
      function decline has not been evaluated at the early stage of COPD in humans.

      This study aims to estimate the association between blood fibrocytes measured during a
      suspected exacerbation and 3-year decline in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1),
      in patients with COPD in primary care, with a history of smoking, independently of the number
      of exacerbations and of tobacco or occupational exposure.

      In this study, blood fibrocytes during a suspected exacerbation will be measured at
      inclusion. The lung function (FEV1) will be assessed at follow-up visits at 2 months, 12
      months and 36 months after inclusion. COPD-related health status and severity of dyspnea will
      be assessed with COPD Assessment test (CAT) and the modified Medical Research Council dyspnea
      scale (mMRC) at follow-up visits at 2 months, 12 months and 36 months after inclusion.
