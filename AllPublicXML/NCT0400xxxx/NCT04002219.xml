  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major Depression Disorder is one of the most common psychiatric disease and has affecting
      approximately 350 million people in the world. According to World Health Organization's
      report, it may be the first burden of disease in 2030. Due to the high morbidity and low
      acceptance in the treatment, it is necessary to find some nature compounds to prevent the
      disease.

      Cordyceps militaris, one of the most treasure Chinese herbs in Asia, contains many kinds of
      component such as cordycepin, polysaccharide, mannitol. In winter, it appears as an worm in
      the soil, afterwards, it grows out of the soil and convert into grass in summer. A previous
      study has demonstrated that Cordyceps militaris has anti-depressive effect in mouse tail
      suspension test, and in this study we will explore its effect in human subjects.
