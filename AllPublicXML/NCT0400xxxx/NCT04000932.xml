  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of local platelet rich plasma injection
      therapy in patients with mild to moderate idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) with
      clinical and electrophysiological parameters. Also the effect of platelet rich plasma and
      local steroid injection will be compared.

      Research sample; Voluntary female patients who are referred to the Physical Therapy and
      Rehabilitation Outpatient Clinic and who have a clinical and electrophysiological diagnosis
      of mild or moderate CTS. Patients aged between 25-70 years and who have complaints consistent
      with CTS for more than 3 months will be selected.

      The size of the sample was determined by the preliminary statistical study conducted using
      the NCSS-PASS 12 program, and will consist of 84 patients.

      Patients will be randomly allocated to one of two groups. Local platelet rich plasma (PRP)
      injection in the first group (n = 42) and local steroid injection in the second group (n =
      42) will be performed once into the carpal tunnel. PRP will be obtained by centrifugation of
      autologous anticoagulated whole blood. 6.43 mg of betamethasone dipropionate and 2.63 mg of
      betamethasone sodium phosphate will be administered as local steroids. Both groups will be
      recommended a resting splint for use in the day time when possible and at night time.
      Clinical and electrophysiological evaluations of all patients will be performed by a
      researcher who is blinded to the treatment received by the patient. The electrophysiological
      and clinical evaluations of the patients will be done by the same investigator before and
      after the 1st and 3rd months of therapy. At one and three month follow up, Symptom severity
      and functional capacity will be assessed using the Boston Carpal Tunnel Syndrome
      Questionnaire. The hand grip strength of the patients will be assessed using a Jamar hand
      dynamometer ( (Baseline hydraulic hand dynomometer, Irvington, NY, USA) and the finger
      holding power by pinchmeter. Conventional motor and sensory nerve conduction studies will be
      applied as electrodiagnostic studies.
