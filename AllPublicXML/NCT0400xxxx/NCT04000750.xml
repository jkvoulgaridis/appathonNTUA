  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose is to examine the effects of time-restricted eating (TRE; consuming all calories
      within an 8-hour period each day) vs. normal eating (CON; consuming same kcals and protein as
      TRE, but during a 10-13 hr eating window each day) during 8 weeks of resistance exercise on
      body composition and muscle mass (whole muscle and single fiber), muscular performance,
      anabolic protein signaling, single muscle fiber characteristics, and the gut microbiome in
      well-trained young men and women.

      The primary goal pertains to muscle hypertrophy (not fat loss), thus all participants will be
      placed in a 10% caloric surplus.
