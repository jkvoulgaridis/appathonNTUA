      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of CD19/CD20 chimeric antigen
      receptor (CAR) T-cells when given together with chemotherapy, and to see how effective they
      are in treating patients with non-Hodgkin's B-cell lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia
      that has come back (recurrent) or has not responded to treatment (refractory). In CAR-T cell
      therapy, a patient's white blood cells (T cells) are changed in the laboratory to produce an
      engineered receptor that allows the T cell to recognize and respond to CD19 and CD20
      proteins. CD19 and CD20 are commonly found on non-Hodgkin?s B-cell lymphoma and chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia cells. Chemotherapy drugs such as fludarabine phosphate and
      cyclophosphamide can control cancer cells by killing them, by preventing their growth, or by
      stopping them from spreading. Combining CD19/CD20 CAR-T cells and chemotherapy may help treat
      patients with recurrent or refractory B-cell lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety of the autologous anti-CD19/anti-CD20 CAR-expressing naive/memory T
      cells (CART19/20), including determination of the maximum tolerated dose and assessment for
      replication competent lentivirus (RCL).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Clinical response. Ia. Overall response rate. Ib. Duration of remission. Ic.
      Progression-free survival. Id. Overall survival. II. CD19/CD20 bispecific CAR transgenic
      T-cell persistence. IIa. T-cell monitoring and analyses. IIb. Evidence of B-cell aplasia.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the serum levels of cytokines associated with cytokine release syndrome (CRS)
      in subjects exhibiting &gt; grade-2 CRS following CART19/20 cell treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of CD19/CD20 CAR-T cells.

      CONDITIONING CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) over 30
      minutes and cyclophosphamide IV over 60 minutes 5, 4, and 3 days before cell infusion.

      T-CELL INFUSION: Patients receive CD19/CD20 CAR-T cells IV on day 0. Patients with cytokine
      release syndrome may also receive tocilizumab IV on day 2 at the discretion of the clinical
      investigator.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up daily for 14 days, on days 30,
      45, 60, 70, 90, and 120, every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually for a minimum of 15 years.

    <description>Will be assessed according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0, with the exception of cytokine release syndrome (CRS), which will be graded on the American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (ASTCT) Consensus Grading for CRS scale. Simple descriptive statistics will be used to summarize toxicities observed after each transgenic T-cell infusion in terms of type (organ affected or laboratory determination such as absolute neutrophil count), severity (by CTCAE toxicity table) and minimum or maximum values for laboratory measures, time of onset, duration, and reversibility or outcome. Tables will be created to summarize these toxicities and side effects. Adverse events will be tabulated by treatment group and will include the number of patients for whom the event occurred, the rate of occurrence, and the severity and relationship to study drug.</description>

          -  Previously known hypersensitivity to any of the agents used in this study; known
             sensitivity to cyclophosphamide or fludarabine

          -  Received systemic treatment for cancer, including immunotherapy, within 14 days prior

             the discretion of the lead study investigator

          -  Patients who have received an allograft transplant will NOT be allowed to participate
             in the trial. Patients who have received an autologous transplant will not be excluded

             drugs based on prior history or received systemic steroids within the last 2 weeks
             prior to enrollment (inhaled or topical steroids at standard doses are allowed)

          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seropositivity or other congenital or acquired
             immune deficiency state, which would increase the risk of opportunistic infections and
             other complications during chemotherapy-induced lymphodepletion. If there is a
             positive result in the infectious disease testing that was not previously known, the
             patient will be referred to their primary physician and/or infectious disease
             specialist

          -  Hepatitis B or C seropositivity with evidence of ongoing liver damage, which would
             increase the likelihood of hepatic toxicities from the chemotherapy conditioning
             regimen and supportive treatments. If there is a positive result in the infectious
             disease testing that was not previously known, the patient will be referred to their
             primary physician and/or infectious disease specialist

             participation as long as they are deemed under control at the time of study enrollment
             and there are no neurological signs of potential brain metastases. A brain magnetic
             resonance imaging (MRI) scan taken within 60 days of screening may be used, otherwise
             a brain MRI must be performed to confirm absence of brain metastases

          -  A Tiffeneau-Pinelli index &lt; 70% of the predicted value. Subjects will be excluded if
             pulmonary function tests indicate they have insufficient pulmonary capability

          -  A left ventricular ejection fraction as determined by an echocardiogram lower than 40%
             would preclude participation

          -  Pregnancy or breast-feeding. Female patients must be surgically sterile or be
             postmenopausal for two years, or must agree to use effective contraception during the
             period of treatment and for 6 months afterwards. All female patients with reproductive
             potential must have a negative pregnancy test (serum/urine) at screening and again
             within 14 days from starting the conditioning chemotherapy. The definition of
             effective contraception will be based on the judgment of the study investigators.
             Patients who are breastfeeding are not allowed on this study
