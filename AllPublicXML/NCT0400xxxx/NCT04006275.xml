  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The new version of CEUS LI-RADS published at 2018(version 2017). In this study, the
      investigators aim to investigate the diagnosing performance of CEUS LI-RADS by administrating
      different contrast agents (SonoVue/ Sonazoid).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Independent radiologists from department of ultrasound will report their diagnosing results
      according to CEUS LI-RADS version 2017 without getting any information about patients. The
      researcher of this subject will collect all results and evaluated the sensitivity and
      specificity of CEUS LI-RADS and the diagnosing performance with different contrast agents.
