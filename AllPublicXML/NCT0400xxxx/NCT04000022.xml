  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has become a safe and efficacious
      treatment for patients with treatment-resistant depression. In several studies investigating
      the antidepressant efficacy of rTMS, it has been shown that in low treatment-resistant
      patients rTMS is more efficacious than in patients where several treatment attempts have
      failed. Albeit this finding, most studies to date primarily recruited patients with
      relatively high degrees of treatment-resistance and there is a lack of trials investigating
      rTMS as a first-line treatment. Therefore, this trials aims to compare the antidepressant
      efficacy of 4 weeks open-label theta-burst TMS in non-treatment-resistant patients with a
      comparable group of treatment-resistant MDD patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has become a safe and efficacious
      treatment for patients with treatment-resistant depression (Mutz et al., 2019). Consequently,
      several countries including Australia, Brazil, Canada, Israel and the United States have
      approved rTMS as second-line treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD), while others have
      included rTMS in their guidelines for good clinical practice (e.g. Finland, Germany and
      Serbia). Historically, rTMS was conceptualized as a &quot;soft&quot; alternative to electroconvulsive
      therapy. Therefore, most studies to date primarily recruited patients with relatively high
      degrees of treatment-resistance (&gt; two failed treatment attempts) and there is a lack of
      trials investigating rTMS as a first or second line treatment. This finding is contrasted by
      the fact that on the most stable predictors of response to rTMS is low-treatment resistance.

      Therefore, this trial aims to compare the antidepressant efficacy of 20 pharmaco-naïve
      patients with 20 treatment-resistant patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder. In
      this open label trial, patients will receive four weeks high-frequency left-sided theta burst
      TMS (lDLFPC). The target will be located by neuronavigation to the target ascertained by Fox
      et al.
