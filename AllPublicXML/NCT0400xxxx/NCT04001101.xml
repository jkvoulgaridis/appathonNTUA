      To determine if the out-of-field ORR is improved with the addition of radiation therapy to
      anti-PD-1 for patients with MSI-H/dMMR metastatic solid tumors. Determine the rates of
      in-field tumor control, disease control (stable disease, partial response, complete
      response), durability of disease response, progression-free survival, overall survival, and
      to assess quality of life and toxicity. Determine the chronology and profile of the
      radiation-associated immune response.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized phase II study with a primary objective to compare the objective
      response rate (ORR) for anti-PD-1 therapy alone versus anti-PD-1 therapy and limited
      metastatic site radiation, in patients with microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or
      mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) metastatic solid tumors. The anti-PD-1 agent, pembrolizumab,
      received recent FDA accelerated approval for the use in patients with metastatic MSI-H or
      dMMR solid tumors that have progressed following prior treatment or without satisfactory
      alternative treatment options. FDA approval for pembrolizumab was based on the results of
      five multi-cohort, multi-center, single-arm trials, which together showed an ORR of 39.6%
      among 149 patients with MSI-H/dMMR cancers. Importantly, there is mounting preclinical and
      clinic evidence supporting the safety and efficacy of combining radiation therapy with
      systemic immunotherapy, although no prospective comparative data, to the best of our
      knowledge. In this study, the investigators will focus on patients with MSI-H/dMMR tumors,
      given their baseline responsiveness to immune checkpoint inhibition, and test the hypothesis
      that ORR will be improved with radiation and anti-PD-1 therapy compared to anti-PD-1 therapy
      alone, through a randomized phase II trial design.

    <description>The University of Colorado School of Medicine Human Immune Monitoring Shared Resource (HIMSR) will quantify peripheral CD8, CD4, and regulatory T cell populations and characterize the relative functional state of these cells using activation markers (CD45RO, ICOS, and CD25) and inhibitory markers (TIM-3, CTLA-4, LAG-3, and PD-1). The HIMSR will also characterize peripheral dendritic cells (pDCs, CD1c+, and CD141+ subsets), monocytes (classical and non-classical subsets), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs, granulocytic and monocytic subsets), and expression of activation (CD80 and HLA-DR) and inhibitory molecules (PDL1) on these cells. Further, cytokine production by NK cells, B cells, T cells, and monocytes will be measured by flow cytometry after brief ex-vivo stimulation. The HIMSR will also perform a protein multiplex array of 40 potential biomarkers in plasma.</description>
