  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to compare the effect of changing their outer surgical gloves with a
      new pair of sterile gloves just prior to abdominal closure versus no intervention in the
      incidence of postoperative wound infections in pregnant women undergoing Caesarean section.
      The primary outcome is the incidence of any post cesarean wound related complication,
      including wound seroma, skin separation of at least 1cm, wound infection, or other incisional
      abnormality requiring treatment within 8 weeks of surgery, while the secondary outcomes are
      Postoperative fever: defined as greater than 38 degrees Celsius or post cesarean
      endometritis: defined as a clinical diagnosis, usually involving fever, uterine fundal
      tenderness, or purulent lochia requiring antibiotic therapy or Combined wound complications
      and endometritis.

      The investigators conduct a prospective randomized study at Department of Obstetrics and
      Gynecology, AFHSR since April 2019 till October 2019, after approval of the study protocol by
      the Local Ethical Committee.

      Patients undergoing Both elective and emergency cesarean sections and Patients received
      standard antibiotic prophylaxis within two hours from the procedure or during the procedure
      in emergency case. All patients received appropriate pre-operative antibiotics,
      chlorohexidine skin prep except where allergies prohibited, and hair clipping as indicated.

      The patients (600) are divided into two groups, Group A (300) during CS the surgical team
      change their outer surgical gloves with a new pair of sterile gloves just prior to abdominal
      closure, while in Group B (300) no intervention
