  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in adults continues to be characterized
      by increased development of resistant virus, increased transmission of resistant virus and
      issues associated with the long-term toxicity of anti-retroviral therapy (ART), despite
      advances in development of new ART, which provides extensive insight in management of
      HIV-infected individuals. Cabotegravir (CAB) is a potent integrase inhibitor (INI) and
      rilpivirine (RPV) is a potent non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI). A
      two-drug regimen (DR)with CAB plus RPV long acting (LA) product offers many potential
      advantages over daily oral regimens including better tolerability, improved compliance,
      adherence, less likely to develop resistance, and overall treatment satisfaction in
      virologically suppressed subjects. This is a single-arm, open-label, multicenter, short term
      facilitation study to evaluate the effect of an implementation strategy on the degree of
      acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility, fidelity and sustainability of clinical
      practices to deliver the CAB+RPV LA regimen to HIV infected subjects and to also measure
      subject satisfaction by recording timeliness of visits, length of visit and their education.
      Approximately 135 subjects will be enrolled in the study and the total duration of the study
      will be approximately 52-weeks.

             and site feasibility to conduct protocol procedures.
