  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Previous studies have reported that intermittent hypoxia in obstructive sleep
      apnea (OSA) is associated with tumor progression, metastasis and treatment outcomes. However,
      studies explaining the relationships between specific types of cancer and OSA are needed. In
      this study, it is aimed to show the effect of excessive daytime sleepiness as determined by
      Epworth sleepiness scale(ESS) and the effect of OSA risk determined by STOP BANG
      questionnaire on survival and treatment outcomes in lung cancer.

      Method: The patients who admit the palliative care outpatient clinic of our hospital with the
      diagnosis of lung cancer (stage 3 and stage 4 non-small cell lung cancer or limited /
      extensive stage small cell lung cancer) between July 2019-2020 will be assessed for excessive
      daytime sleepiness(EDS) and risk of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) by Epworth sleepiness scale
      and the STOP-BANG questionnaire. The patients will be grouped according to the risk of OSA
      and EDS.Total / progression-free survival, treatment outcomes and side effects of the
      treatment will be evaluated comparatively.

      The patients who admit the palliative care outpatient clinic of our hospital with the
      diagnosis of lung cancer (stage 3 and stage 4 non-small cell lung cancer or limited /
      extensive stage small cell lung cancer) between July 2019-2020 prior to the treatment and the
      patient who has not yet completed the first-line chemotherapy with a weight loss &lt;10% will be
      invited to fill the Epworth sleepiness scale and the STOP-BANG questionnaire. Patients'
      anthropometric measurements (height, weight, BMI, fat-free BMI, neck circumference) will be
      taken. The treatment outcomes and side-effects in patients with EDS and moderate / high risk
      for OSA will be compared with patients with low OSA risk. Demographic information (age,
      gender, smoking history), anthropometric measurements (height, weight, body mass index, fat
      free body mass index, neck circumference), clinical information (snoring, witnessed apnea,
      daytime excessive sleep presence of symptoms of symptoms, pulmonary function tests,
      radiological TNM stages, diagnostic method, diagnosis date, fiberoptic bronchoscopy findings,
      ECOG performance status, treatment results, treatment-related side effects) laboratory values
      (complete blood count results albumin, lactate dehydrogenase level) and the results of
      Epworth sleepiness scale and of STOP-BANG questionnaire will be recorded.

    <description>Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) is a self-administered questionnaire with 8 questions by which daytime sleepiness in eight different activities is assessed on a 4-point scale (0-3). The ESS score can range from 0 to 24. The higher the ESS score, the higher that person's 'daytime sleepiness'. ESS score ≥ 10 will be used to indicate excessive daytime sleepiness.</description>
