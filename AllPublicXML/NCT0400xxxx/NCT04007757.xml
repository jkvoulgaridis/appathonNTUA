  <brief_summary>

      The investigators will perform follow-up on 500 cases of deep and lobar intracerebral
      hemorrhage to perform advanced neuroimaging before 45 days post stroke, and evaluations of
      motor and cognitive function at baseline, 3 months and 6 months to determine predictors of
      recovery, progressive cognitive or functional impairment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is the third leading cause of death and the leading cause of adult disability in the
      United States. More adults are affected by stroke each year than Alzheimer's disease,
      multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or Parkinson's disease. Hemorrhagic strokes
      represent the most severe subtypes of stroke. An estimated 40-50% of hemorrhagic stroke
      victims will die and more than 80% of survivors remain disabled after hemorrhagic stroke. Yet
      the vast majority of analyses on outcome after stroke have focused principally on gross
      measures of functional outcome.

      Furthermore hemorrhagic stroke differs from ischemic stroke where a loss of blood causes the
      area affected to be readily visible on scanning. But with hemorrhagic stroke, not only the
      area that we can directly see, but nearby tracts that have been compressed or stretched by
      the mass of the hemorrhage can be injured.

      The investigators propose to follow-up on 500 cases of deep and lobar ICH to perform serial
      evaluations of motor and cognitive function and advanced neuroimaging to determine predictors
      of recovery, progressive cognitive or functional impairment. Our proposal has the advantages
      of adding onto a prospective ICH study which will identify and recruit cases, ability to
      evaluate for the degree and impact of survival and severity biases, baseline neuroimaging
      which includes baseline MRI, biologic samples including genotyping for apolipoprotein E
      alleles and uniform phenotype definitions as well as expertise in recovery/outcome analyses,
      advanced neuroimaging processes and epidemiologic study. This proposal performs detailed
      cognitive, motor and functional assessments on cases of intracerebral hemorrhage and
      correlates with tractography imaging. The investigators hypothesize that unlike ischemic
      stroke, the mass effect of the hemorrhage itself may disrupt nearby tracts in some patients
      while preserving them in others and will serve as a better predictor of who may recover after
      ICH. This project will represent the largest number of ICH cases in which tractography
      imaging has been performed to date.

      Specific Aim #1: Improve motor recovery prediction after supratentorial ICH by adding
      proportion of tract injury as measured by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) independent of the
      ICH volume, location, age, gender and intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH).

      Hypothesis #1a: Increasing severity of injury to corticospinal tracts in ICH patients will
      predict worse specific motor deficits assessed at 3-month and 6-month post-stroke.

      Hypothesis #1b. Injury to cortical-cortical tracts including the superior longitudinal
      fasciculus, uncinate fasciculus, cingulum, and arcuate fasciculus, will predict greater
      impairment in corresponding cognitive domains including attention, memory, executive
      function, and language function assessed at 3 and 6-month post-stroke.

      Specific Aim #2: Determine the association of periventricular tract injury in
      intraventricular hemorrhage complicating ICH with subsequent incontinence and gait ataxia.

      Hypothesis #2: Patients with IVH will be associated with greater periventricular tract injury
      than patients without IVH and that this injury will be independently associated with
      long-term neurogenic incontinence and gait instability after controlling for severity of the
      ICH including location and volume, age and gender.

    <measure>Change motor recovery prediction after supratentorial intracerebral hemorrhage(ICH)</measure>
    <time_frame>Ongoing/completed end of August 2020</time_frame>
    <description>This measure will determined by adding proportion of tract injury as measured by diffusion tensor imaging(DTI) methods. Measures are independent of the presenting Glasgow Coma Scale(GCS),ICH volume,location,age,sex and intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH).The primary outcome measure will be the global motor score from the motor assessment scale(MAS) testing which includes eight areas of assessment in eight areas of motor function.The MAS evaluates performance on functional tasks using a 7-point ordinal scale(0-6) in each of eight domains-moving from supine to side lying,supine to sitting over the edge of a bed, balanced sitting,moving from sitting to standing,walking,upper-arm function,hand movements(e.g., drawing a line),and advanced hand activities(e.g. combing the back of the head) rather than isolated movements. A score of 6 on each item, or an overall score of 48 indicates optimal motor behavior, and a lower score would indicate less than optimal motor behavior.</description>

    <description>Determine the correlation of periventricular tract injury in IVH complicating ICH as measured by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) with subsequent incontinence as measured by the Urogenital Distress Inventory (UDI-6),a 6 question measure of urinary continence that is highly reliable.The UDI-6 assessment scoring includes item responses that are assigned values of 0 for &quot;not at all,&quot; 1 for &quot;slightly,&quot; 2 for &quot;moderately,&quot; and 3 for &quot;greatly.&quot;The average score of items responded to is calculated,which ranges from 0 to 3,is multiplied by 33 1/3 to put scores on a scale of 0 to 100.The lower score would indicate a better outcome and a higher score would indicate a worse outcome.</description>
