    <textblock>
      Obesity, diabetes and metabolic syndrome (MS) have all been associated with increase of
      pancreatic cancer (PK) risk. The precise role of obesity and diabetes and the pathways
      involved in the early oncogenic phases of PK associated with MS are not well known. The
      investigators hypothesize that it is possible to decipher this specific
      &quot;fat-fibrosis-neoplastic sequence&quot;, to develop new imaging tools adapted to follow its
      progression, to test the benefit of treatments to slow this sequence and prevent the
      development of PK in obese and diabetic patients.This project is in line with a prevention
      strategy, by planning to understand the physiopathological pathways involved in MS leading to
      PK, to develop tools useful to screen early precancerous lesions in order to diagnose and
      treat patients at high risk, before cancer involvement.

      This clinical trial is part of the INCA PAIR PANCREAS project : Early stages of pancreatic
      cancer associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome:

      prevention and screening tools - Imaging of fatty pancreas in humans: correlation with
      pathological analysis, which includes 3 main coordinated objectives an in vitro approach an
      in vivo approach and this study (clinical approach).

      Translational approach with direct application to humans, to test specific imaging MRI
      sequences in obese patients.

      Obesity and metabolic syndrome are a well-known risk factor of pancreatic cancer. Obesity is
      associated with about 30% increased risk in all studies, but the proportion of obese people
      varies considerably from one country to another. Therefore, the proportion of cancer
      attributable to obesity could range from 3% to 16%. Numerous epidemiological studies
      confirmed that obesity is a risk factor of pancreatic cancer in obese men and women (BMI,
      kg/m2≥30.0), with a relative risk estimated to 1.76 (95% CI, 0.90-3.45) and 1.70 (95% CI,
      1.09-2.64), respectively. As previously demonstrated by partners 9 and 10, obesity is
      associated with fat pancreatic infiltration and precancerous lesions, such as PanIN lesions
      in humans. Pancreatic lesions such as adipose infiltration, iron deposits, extent of
      fibrosis, acino-ductal metaplasia and Pan-IN are involved in pancreatic oncogenesis.

      The goal of this study is to be able to diagnose early precancerous states in patients, such
      as acino-ductal metaplasia (and also PanIN lesions which are more frequently observed in
      humans,) inflammatory process (iron deposits, fibrosis lesions) and adipose involvement in
      the context of obesity and metabolic syndrome. Investigators hypothesis is that specific MR
      imaging sequences, adapted from previous studies in rodents, could be a relevant tool to
      diagnose early pancreatic lesions and follow their evolution in the context of obesity and
      metabolic syndrome.

      To this aim, the investigators will conduct a study to assess the relevance of MR imaging
      sequences to diagnose specific pancreatic lesions in obese patients, validated at the
      microscopic level. The investigators will analyze MR imaging of obese patients (BMI&gt;30)/non
      obese patients (BMI&lt;25) with a planned pancreatic surgery. It will be possible to compare
      imaging with histology performed on resected parenchyma. The investigators propose a
      proof-of-concept study aiming at assessing the relevance of specific MR imaging to diagnose
      early pancreatic lesions in humans and in obese patients especially. MR imaging will be
      performed in both obese and non obese patients with a planned pancreatic surgery in hospital
      to resect a benign lesion (such as neuroendocrine tumour or IPMN...). MRI are performed in
      the normal course of care; their sequences will be adapted for this study. It will be
      possible to compare imaging with histology of the resected parenchyma.

    <description>1st stage: To adjust the transducer, test and validate pancreatic MRI sequences on volunteers without history of known pancreatic disorders. Adjustment of MRI parameters is needed to optimize data acquisition, especially in obese patients. Moreover, an external material (transducer) has to be applied on the abdomen. The right position has to be tested and specified before stages 2 and 3 of the study. We aim to include volunteers without history of known pancreatic disorders for the Stage 1, meaning volunteers without personal history or symptoms suggesting pancreatic disorders.</description>

    <description>2nd stage: To validate and assess pancreatic MRI sequences on obese volunteers with indication for hepatic MRI , in relation with acceptable resolution and field of view criteria applicable to the typical anteroposterior diameters found in obese persons. For Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE), the amplitude setting of the MRE transducer will be adapted to the size of obese patients, in addition to the aforementioned adjustments to spatial resolution and field of view sizes. The effect of frequency on MRE data quality will be investigated. The effects of respiratory motion will be investigated; indeed in obese patients respiration amplitude is typically low and this enables to acquire data in free breathing mode over long periods of time, which offers more possibilities (notably in terms of averaging, spatial resolution, mechanical wave sampling rate) than when constraining acquisition parameters with a maximum breath hold time of less than 20s.</description>
