  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are unmet medical needs in patients who resist to EGFR TKIs, especially to osimertinib;
      APG-1252 shows synergy with osimertinib in both osimertinib treatment naïve and resistant
      cell lines. This study is to explore the safety and efficacy of the combination of APG-1252
      and osimertinib in 3rd generation TKI resistant patients and 3rd generation TKI treatment
      naïve patients.

      This is a multi-center, open-label, Phase 1b study evaluating the adverse events and best
      dose of the combination of fixed dose AZD9291 with APG-1252 in EGFR-TKI resistant NSCLC
      patients.

      In exploration phase, 3+3 design will be used to determine the MTD/RP2D of the combination of
      AZD9291 with APG-1252; Dose of AZD9291 will be fixed at 80mg QD, APG-1252 will start with
      240mg weekly, then escalate to 320mg weekly and 400mg weekly or decline to 160mg weekly and
      80weekly if not tolerate to 240mg weekly dosage.

      In expansion phase, IF 1 confirmed PR or CR observed in NSCLC patients who failed 3rd
      generation EGFR TKI, the exploration of the combination of AZD9291 with APG-1252 in 3rd
      generation EGFR TKI naïve NSCLC patients will be initiated.

      Patients will be treated in 21-day cycles. APG-1252 administered via intravenous infusion for
      30 minutes weekly (,Day 1, 8 15), AZD9291 via oral daily with 80mg.
