  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A few studies have documented that some patients can be down-staged from an initially
      inoperable state to a potentially resectable state. Five-year survival in initially
      inoperable patients that ultimately come to a complete resection appears to be similar to
      patients who are resected at first presentation. The investigators goal is to assess the rate
      of conversion to complete resection in patients with initially inoperable liver-only
      metastases due to colorectal cancer after treatment with HAI of oxaliplatin with FOLFIRI and
      bevacuzimab systemic treatment.
