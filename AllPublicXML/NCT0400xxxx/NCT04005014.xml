  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators aim to perform a prospective, randomized controlled study to
      compare the myopia development between children using myopia prediction algorithm and
      children without using myopia prediction algorithm.

      We propose to enroll Grade 3 children from primary schools in China. Children will be given
      examinations of visual acuity, eye refraction and biometrics, and be assigned to two groups:
      participants in group A use myopia prediction algorithm to predict myopia development, while
      in Group B, the participants do not use myopia prediction algorithm to predict myopia
      development. The visual acuity, eye refraction and biometrics will be investigated over the
      one-year follow-up period, aiming at comparison of actual myopia development between the two
      groups.

    <masking_description>Examinations of visual acuity, eye refraction and biometrics will be performed in each participating clinic by trained investigators. The investigators, outcomes assessors involved in data management and analysis will be blinded to the group assignment. The study participants, the coordinator, senior consultants, and study personnel responsible for randomisation will not be masked.</masking_description>
