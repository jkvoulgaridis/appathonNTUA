  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Local nitroglycerin (NTG) was successfully used as a vasodilator to facilitate cannulation of
      the radial artery. NTG was used in adults by topical application as well as subcutaneous
      infiltration. Subcutaneous infiltration of NTG resulted in significant vasodilatation,
      improved palpability of the radial artery, reduced the number of punctures and the time
      needed for cannulation in adults. Topical NTG was reported to increase radial artery diameter
      in healthy volunteers without reduction in arterial blood pressure. In pediatric population,
      there no sufficient evidence for the effectiveness of NTG in improving radial artery
      cannulation. In a case report on two neonates, topical nitroderm ointment successfully
      reversed tissue ischemia secondary to radial artery cannulation The aim of this work is to
      evaluate the use of topical NTG (patch) for increasing the diameter of radial artery,
      improving the cannulation success, and decreasing catheter-related ischemic complications.

      A written informed consent will be obtained from patient's parents or guardians.
      Randomization will be obtained using computer-generated sequence. Concealment will be
      obtained using opaque envelopes.

      On arrival to the preparing room, patients will be randomized into one of the two groups:

      - NTG group or, Control group

      Ultrasound examination:

      The diameter of radial artery will be measured using a linear, high frequency probe (12 mHz)
      of Simens machine. Measurement will be obtained in the short axis plane at the point with
      maximal pulsation. The point will be marked to guide the post-intervention examination. The
      operator will be an experienced single operator blinded to the study group. Measurements will
      be obtained in both limbs at baseline (before application of NTG patch application,30
      minutes,60minutes after NTG application After induction of anesthesia, radial artery will be
      punctured by 22-g catheter by an experienced anesthetist
