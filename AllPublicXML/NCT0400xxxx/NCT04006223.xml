  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systemic amyloidosis is a multi-system disease caused by extracellular deposition of
      insoluble amyloid fibrils in various tissues and organs, leading to progressive organ
      dysfunction. The clinical manifestations of different types of amyloidosis are complex and
      diverse, and the prognosis is very poor. Early detection and classification of amyloid
      deposition is becoming increasingly important. However, conventional imaging techniques
      including ultrasound and magnetic resonance are not sensitive or specific. Endocardial biopsy
      is the gold standard for the diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis, but it is an invasive
      procedure with a clinical complication rate of 6%.

      Positron emission tomography (PET) provides a valuable tool for diagnosing systemic
      amyloidosis. Recently, amyloid PET imaging agents (11C-PIB or 18F-florbetapir) have been
      shown to be effective as novel positron tracers to detect potential amyloid deposition in
      some small sample studies. The investigators will use the most advanced imaging equipment,
      integrated PET/MR with amyloid PET imaging agents(11C-PIB or 18F-florbetapir) to image
      patients suspected or confirmed systemic amyloidosis, the aim is to explore the value of
      hybrid PET/MR for systemic amyloidosis.

      shown to be effective as novel positron tracers to detect potential amyloid deposition in
      multiple organs in some small sample studies. The investigators will use the most advanced
      imaging equipment, integrated PET/MR with amyloid PET imaging agents(11C-PIB or
      18F-florbetapir) to image patients suspected or confirmed systemic amyloidosis, the aim is to
      explore the value of hybrid PET/MR for systemic amyloidosis.

      For patients suspected of or diagnosed with systemic amyloidosis, the investigators aim to
      evaluate the roles of hybrid PET/MR in differential diagnosis, detecting the deposition of
      amyloid in various tissues and organs of the body, guiding biopsy, and determining treatment
      plan prior to treatment; for the patients with a history of systemic amyloidosis, the aim is
      to evaluate the value of hybrid PET/MR for treatment response assessment.
