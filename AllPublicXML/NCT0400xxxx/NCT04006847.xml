  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/II single site, open label clinical trial. The purpose of the Phase I
      portion is to determine the safety, tolerability, and recommended Phase II dose of
      Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA) when given daily in combination with a Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor
      (TKI) in subjects with Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) in chronic stable phase. The
      recommended Phase II dose will be the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of EPA as determined by
      the evaluation of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). The Phase II portion will subsequently
      examine the Anti-CML effects of EPA when administered with a TKI at the recommended Phase II
      dose. This efficacy objective will be done by evaluating BCR-ABL p210 quantitative PCR blood
      levels every 3 months to 1 year.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Targeting CML leukemia stem cells is of paramount importance in successfully preventing
      cancer relapse. EPA metabolite, Δ12-PGJ3 may represent a new chemotherapeutic agent for
      leukemia that targets leukemia stem cells. Selective targeting of cancer stem cells may be
      potentially a highly effective treatment for cancer. As most CML patients treated with a TKI
      will reach a complete cytogenetic response, quantification of residual BCR-ABL transcripts by
      quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) is a critical tool to further monitor
      response kinetics. Addition of EPA to TKI may help decrease residual BCR-ABL positive (Ph+)
      leukemia stem cells.
