  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Placental accretion during pregnancy refers to an abnormally deep insertion of the placenta
      into the uterus, leading to the impossibility of removing the placenta without inducting
      uterine or surrounding organs lesions. The management of these patients is complex, with two
      options during caesarean section: hysterectomy or uterine conservative surgery in which the
      placenta is let in the uterine cavity. These are both at risk of complications, including
      severe hemorrhage.

      High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) principle is based on the focusing of ultrasonic
      waves in a focal zone causing a rapid rise in temperature in the targeted area. This focus
      results in the creation of a coagulation necrosis tissue lesion. This procedure is guided in
      real time by an integrated ultrasound imaging cell.

      The investigators hypothesized that HIFU shots would accelerate the process of placental
      involution when the placenta is let in the uterine cavity, increasing the chances of uterine
      preservation and reducing the infectious and hemorrhagic risks in the short and medium term.
      The aim of this study is to confirm the feasibility and safety of the use of HIFU as a
      per-caesarean adjuvant treatment for management of placenta accrete let in the uterus for a
      conservative treatment.

    <description>HIFU shots will be performed on the placental tissue to produce necrotic lesions of approximately 30% of the total volume. A latency time of 2 minutes between each shot will be observed to avoid the accumulative heat effect, and to ensure optimal positioning of the treatment probe. The maximum duration of the operating time for HIFU shooting shall not exceed 60 minutes.</description>
