        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female subjects, 21 years of age or older.

          2. Subjects with a history of degenerative retinal diseases such as RP.

          3. Subjects with a documented history of disease progression.

          4. Willing and able to return for all study visits.

          5. Willing and able to provide written informed consent for the Clinical Study.

          6. Subjects with a BCVA greater or equal to 20/16000 must have consistent fixation
             demonstrated by indirect ophthalmoscopy with a small circle of light and by consistent
             location of remaining central visual field detected by VFA.

          7. Study Arm A: The best corrected visual acuity must be between 20/16000 and HM as
             tested by ETDRS chart and ERG B wave amplitude.

          8. Study Arm B: The best-corrected visual acuity must be between 20/60 and 20/16000 and
             visual field of central 15 degrees (III static 30-2 protocol, 31.5 ASB background)
             greater than 10 dB loss, as determined by a Humphrey Instruments, Inc. Visual Field
             Analyzer (VFA).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with significant lens or corneal pathology (either history of or current) in
             the study eye other than retinal diseases.

          2. Subjects with high myopia in the study eye (axial length greater than or equal to 26.0
             millimeters by ultrasound or spherical equivalent at the spectacle plane greater than
             -8.0 diopters.)

          3. Subjects whose retinal disease status has been stable for more than 90 days.

          4. Subjects with history of iritis or uveitis in either eye.

          5. Subjects who have monocular vision.

          6. Subjects with a history of retinal detachment or tear in either eye.

          7. Subjets with unstable IOP (i.e. &gt; 30 mmHg in the past six months) or IOP of &gt; 24 mm Hg
             at enrollment while under medical control. Subjects may be on topical medications to
             control their IOP.

          8. Subjects with an aphakic study ete or if pseudophakic, cataract extraction surgery
             more than 6 months prior to study enrollment.

          9. Subjects with a history of ocular trauma of any type in the study eye.

         10. Subjects with media opacities or abnormalities that would preclude observation of the
             retina in the study eye, per the investigator's judgement.

         11. Subjects that have undergone any previous vitrectomy (either anterior or pars plana
             vitrectomy in the study eye).

         12. Subjects with a history of cataract surgery complication in the study eye.

         13. Subjects that have undergone previous photocoagulation of the retina in the study eye.

         14. Subjects anticipated requiring cataract extraction in the study eye within the next
             six (6) months.

         15. Subjects with congenital eye malformations.

         16. Recurrent uveitis or history of uveitis in either eye.

         17. Macular edema or history of macular edema in the study eye where central macular
             thickness is greater than 275 microns by OCT at baseline.

         18. Ongoing ocular infection or inflammation in the study eye.

         19. Pregnant or nursing females.
