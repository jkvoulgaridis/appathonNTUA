    <textblock>
      The diabetic population has an increased cardiovascular risk compared to the general
      population.

      Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMG-CoA reductase) inhibitors, or &quot;statins&quot;, are
      considered as the standard treatment for hypercholesterolemia.

      Many patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes are prescribed with statins, both for
      primary prevention, before the first cardiovascular event, and as secondary prevention, to
      avoid recurrence.

      However, compliance to these drugs may be difficult due to polypharmacy, side effects
      (myalgia) or tiredness.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the compliance of diabetic patients with statins
      searching for important factors which could favor adherence.

      The diabetic population has an increased cardiovascular risk compared to the general
      population. The mortality of people with diabetes due to ischemic heart disease is multiplied
      by 2.2, and when is due to cerebrovascular disease by 1.8 compared to those patients without
      diabetes. Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMG-CoA reductase) inhibitors, or &quot;statins&quot;,
      are considered as the standard treatment for hypercholesterolemia.

      Statins have been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of cardiovascular events, each 1
      mmol decrease in LDL cholesterol reduces the risk of cardiovascular events by 21% at 5 years.

      Many patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes are prescribed with statins, both for
      primary prevention, before the first cardiovascular event, and for secondary prevention, to
      avoid recurrence.

      However, compliance with these drugs may be difficult due to polypharmacy, side effects
      (myalgia) or tiredness. Indeed, the persistence of statin use, one year after its
      prescription, is estimated at 70% in the general population. However, there are no data in
      the French population, and in particular on French diabetic patients for whom the
      cardiovascular risk is increased compared to the general population.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the compliance of diabetic patients with statins
      searching for important factors which could favor adherence.

    <description>This is a simple and quick questionnaire, composed of 6 questions with a binary yes/no answer. It allows to assess the degree of compliance with the prescribed treatment and thus to better identify the constraints related to the treatment. The score varies from 0 to 6 depending on the presence of &quot;yes&quot;. 0 &quot;yes&quot;: Good compliance, more than 3 &quot;yes&quot;: non compliance.</description>
