  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) is an alphasynucleinopathy and the second most common form of
      dementia in the elderly. DLB shares striking neuropathological and clinical similarities with
      both Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nilotinib (Tasigna®, AMN107,
      Novartis, Switzerland) is approved by the FDA and is well tolerated for CML treatment at oral
      doses of 600-800mg daily. The Investigators propose to perform a phase II randomized, double
      blinded, placebo controlled study to evaluate the impact of Nilotinib in patients with DLB.

    <textblock>
      A phase II randomized, double blinded, placebo controlled study will be performed to evaluate
      the impact of Nilotinib (Tasigna®, AMN107, Novartis, Switzerland) on safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and clinical outcomes in patients with Dementia with Lewy
      Bodies. Sixty ( 60) participants will be recruited and randomly assigned 1:1 to placebo (arm
      1) or 200 mg Nilotinib (arm 2).This study will be conducted in DLB patients with 2.5≥Hoehn &amp;
      Yahr≤3 and UPDRS I-III ≤50 and 15≥UPDRS III (motor) ≥40 (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating
      Score)and MoCA≥18(Montreal Cognitive Assessment). Eligible participants must be stable on
      MAO-B inhibitors (Rasageline or Selegeline) for 4 weeks and must not be on ≥800mg Levodopa
      daily. Participants must be stable on acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and other medications
      for at least 6 weeks. Participants will be treated for 6 months and monitored every month ( 4
      weeks) in a total of 9 visits that include screening , baseline, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 months
      follow up and 7 month washout. Blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) will be collected at
      baseline and at 6 months to determine Nilotinib effects on CSF biomarkers.

    <time_frame>6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>UPDRS-I-III is used to follow the longitudinal course of Parkinson's disease. The UPDRS is made up of these sections: Part I: evaluation of mentation, behavior, and mood. Part II: self-evaluation of the activities of daily life (ADLs) Part III: clinician-scored monitored motor evaluation. Part IV: complications of therapy. Part V: Hoehn and Yahr staging of severity of Parkinson's disease. Part VI: Schwab and England ADL scale. The greater the score the higher the severity, the lower the score the lower the severity.
