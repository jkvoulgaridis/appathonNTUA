    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the best dose of sonidegib when given together with pembrolizumab
      and to see how well they work in treating patients with solid tumor that has spread to other
      places in the body (advanced). Sonidegib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some
      of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as
      pembrolizumab, may help the body?s immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with
      the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving sonidegib and pembrolizumab may work
      better than standard treatment in treating patients with advanced solid tumors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of sonidegib in combination with
      pembrolizumab in participants with advanced solid tumors as part of the dose escalation
      phase. (Part A) II. To estimate the response rate of sonidegib in combination with
      pembrolizumab in participants with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or pancreas cancer as
      part of the expansion cohort based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)
      criteria. (Part B)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize the safety profile and tolerability of sonidegib and pembrolizumab.

      II. To obtain preliminary estimates of efficacy as measured by response rate (based on RECIST
      criteria), disease control rate at 6 months, duration of response, overall survival (OS), and
      progression free survival (PFS) of sonidegib and pembrolizumab in patients with selected
      advanced solid tumors.

      CORRELATIVE RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the immunologic effects of sonidegib and pembrolizumab by investigating the
      changes in circulating tumor cells, immune cell markers, cytokines, and soluble PD-L1 in
      blood.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of sonidegib.

      Patients receive sonidegib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-8 and pembrolizumab
      intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 24
      cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 30 days.
