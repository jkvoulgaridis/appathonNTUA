    <textblock>
      This study is to investigate the effects of Augmented Reality (AR) combined with Functional
      Electrical Stimulation (FES) intervention on cortical excitability, brain structure, lower
      limbs function, balance, and spasticity in individuals with stroke. Twenty participants will
      be recruited in this study. They will be allocated to two group: AR and FES group (10),
      Traditional physiotherapy group (10).

      Participants will be randomized allocated to two groups: Augmented Reality and Functional
      Electrical Stimulation group , and traditional physiotherapy group. All participants will
      undergo 60 minutes per session, 3 sessions per week for 8 weeks training. Functional Magnetic
      Resonance Imaging (fMRI) with Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), Time up go test (TUG), Berg
      Balance Scale (BBS), Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA), Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), 10 meter
      walking test will be assessed before and after intervention in all participants.

    <measure>Change of Time Up Go test (TUG)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measurement before and after intervention ( week 0 and at the end of week 8) in both groups</time_frame>
    <description>The TUG test will ask participants to stand up, walk for 3 meters, turn, walk back and sit down as fast as they can during the test, and the time requires for each patient to complete the test is recorded.</description>

    <measure>Change of Berg Balance Scale (BBS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measurement before and after intervention ( week 0 and at the end of week 8) in both groups</time_frame>
    <description>Participants performed a series of 14 functional balance tasks, including maintaining a quiet stance, sitting-to-standing, shifting weight and reaching, turning in place, standing on one leg, and maintaining a tandem stance. Each task was scored on a 5-point ordinal scale (from 0 to 4). A score of 0 denotes the inability of the participant to perform the task, and a score of 4 denotes that the participant can complete the task based on a preset criterion. The highest possible score is 56.</description>

    <measure>Change of Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measurement before and after intervention ( week 0 and at the end of week 8) in both groups</time_frame>
    <description>Our study will use 3 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging[GE DISCOVERY MR750w system (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, Wisconsin)] for functional magnetic resonance imaging. Resting-state functional MRI image is an echo-planar Image (EPI) technique, using a parameter time of repetition of 2500 milliseconds, time of echo is 30 milliseconds, 43 axial slices,slice thickness is 3 mm, flip angle is 80 degrees, field of view is 192 x 192 millimeters, and vixen size is 3 x 3 x 3 millimeters. The EPI scan for 525 seconds. All subjects are asked to close their eyes and supine. our study uses the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations analysis to confirm abnormal brain function.</description>

    <measure>Change of Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA)-Lower extremity</measure>
    <time_frame>Measurement before and after intervention ( week 0 and at the end of week 8) in both groups</time_frame>
    <description>Fugl-Meyer Assessment-Lower extremity is used to measure lower-limb recovery in stroke rehabilitation studies.The scale has 6 items ranging from reflex activity to voluntary motor control. Each item further comprises components, with a total of 17. Scoring is done on a 3-point ordinal scale ranges from 0 (no performance) to 2 (faultless performance). The total score range from 0 (no motor function) to 34 (good motor recovery).</description>

    <measure>Change of Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measurement before and after intervention ( week 0 and at the end of week 8) in both groups</time_frame>
    <description>Modified Ashworth scale (MAS) measures resistance during passive soft-tissue stretching and is used as a simple measure of spasticity. Scoring is recorded as follows:
0: No increase in muscle tone
Slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch and release or by minimal resistance at the end of the range of motion when the affected part(s) is moved in flexion or extension 1+: Slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch, followed by minimal resistance throughout the remainder (less than half) of the Range of motion (ROM)
More marked increase in muscle tone through most of the ROM, but affected part(s) easily moved
Considerable increase in muscle tone, passive movement difficult
Affected part(s) rigid in flexion or extension</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of Motor evoked potential (MEP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measurement before and after intervention ( week 0 and at the end of week 8) in both groups</time_frame>
    <description>Motor evoked potential (MEP) is recorded from tibialis anterior muscles following direct transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of motor cortex. All TMS is delivered with the participant seated upright on the chair. Both passive and active conditions, participants are instructed to relax their right leg in the seated position. TMS is delivered over the motor cortex (M1) using a concave double cone coil (Magstim Co., United Kingdom) attached to a BiStim magnetic stimulator (Magstim Co., United Kingdom). To locate the optimal site, stimuli are delivered over various points along the M1. The optimal site is the location on the M1 that evoked the greatest MEP amplitude in the bilateral tibialis anterior muscles. The onset latency and onset to peak amplitude will be assessed.</description>
