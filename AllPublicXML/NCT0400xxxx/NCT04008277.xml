  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, women will be required to wear a heart rate monitor continuously and collect
      daily early morning urine samples for the duration of one complete menstrual cycle. This will
      enable comparisons between data collected from the heart rate monitor and hormone analysis in
      urine samples to be made.

      This pilot study is a prospective observational study of women's heart rate and heart rate
      variability throughout one complete menstrual cycle. A minimum of 10 volunteers aged 18 years
      of age or over will be recruited via a variety of methods according to the criteria detailed
      in section 9. They will be required to wear a heart rate monitor continuously and collect
      daily early morning urine samples throughout one menstrual cycle.

      Urine samples will be returned to SPD on a regular basis for measurement of urinary hormones
      related to pregnancy and fertility. Data collected via the monitor including heart rate and
      heart rate variability will be downloaded for comparison.
