      The Single-arm, multicenter study evaluate the safety and efficacy of Anlotinib Hydrochloride
      combined with EGFR TKIs in treating Advanced NSCLC With acquired Resistance to EGFR TKIs

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      EGFR TKI have been approved as first-line treatment in NSCLC patients harboring EGFR
      mutation. However, the acquired resistance of EGFR-TKI occurs almost constantly. Anlotinib is
      a novel oral multitarget tyrosine kinase inhibitor and primary targeted to Vascular
      Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor (VEGFR), fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) ,
      platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) and c-Kit. The ALTER-0303 trial showed that
      patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who received anlotinib as
      third-line or further therapy had more survival benefit. The Single-arm, multicenter study
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of Anlotinib Hydrochloride combined with EGFR TKIs in
      treating Advanced NSCLC With acquired Resistance to EGFR TKIs
