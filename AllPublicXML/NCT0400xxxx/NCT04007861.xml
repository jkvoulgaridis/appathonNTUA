  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain is common in cancer, affecting between 40 and 60% of patients depending on tumour type
      and stage of disease, and represents a major area of unmet need in cancer survivors. Despite
      advances in treatment, there has been no significant reduction in those who experience pain.
      Breast cancer is common. It represents 10% of newly diagnosed cancers globally and is often
      associated with pain.

      Exact physiological mechanisms for cancer pain are not yet fully established. There is a
      complex relationship between a malignant lesion and its micro-environmentÍ¾ a tumour does not
      exist in isolation but has a dynamic relationship with host cells. There is a growing
      interest in delineating the relationship between tumour manifestations and pain.

      By retrospectively identifying individuals who have been referred to specialist pain clinics
      at a cancer centre and matching them to controls, the investigators can identify two groups
      of patients (those who experienced significant problems with pain and those who did not).
      Accessing paraffin-embedded tissue samples from those that have had surgical resections, will
      allow the investigators to compare tissue samples, in particular the metabolic and genetic
      differences, between the two groups.

      No new tissue samples will be required for this study.

      Pain is a major area of unmet need in cancer survivors. The investigators propose that this
      project would provide valuable knowledge and pilot data regarding the link between pain and
      tumour genetics. It has the potential to identify tumour genes or mutations that are
      associated with greater incidences of pain and ultimately potentially guide targeted
      interventions to help reduce the frequency and impact of pain on patients living with and
      beyond cancer.

      This study will be a retrospective, case-control study. There will be two groups of patients
      identified retrospectively:

      The first group will be patients who have been referred to the pain management team for
      persistent-post surgical pain following breast cancer treatment.

      The second group, will consist of patients who have been matched for age, procedure and
      time-lapsed since operation. These patients will not have persistent post-surgical pain.

      Archived paraffin-embedded tissue samples, that have previously been taken from these
      patients, will be required. Samples accessed will be from patients who have previously
      provided consent for their samples to be used for research purposes. Once appropriate samples
      have been identified by the tissue banks, all data will be pseudonymised. This will include
      details that patients have consented to providing for research purposes via the Pain
      Management Database, which has Trust (CCR 442) and Research Ethics Committee (REC 16/LO/1989)
      approval.

      Laboratory studies will then be conducted to A) investigate the underlying variations of the
      PIK3CA gene of tumours within the two cohorts of patients, B) investigate other genetic
      variations between these two groups and C) establish the key genetic and signalling pathway
      alterations between these two groups.

      The methods by which these investigations will be conducted will be by performing PIK3CA
      genomics, genetic profiling, next generation sequencing and finally immunohistochemistry for
      activation of signalling pathways.

      This study will analyse archived paraffin embedded tissue samples in a laboratory only.

      The anticipated time-scale for this project would be approximately one year.

    <description>This will be the group of patients in whom pain is a significant enough problem, that they have been referred to the specialist Pain Management Team. These patients will be identified retrospectively.
Patients seen in Pain Management Clinics between 1st of January 2016 and 31st of December 2018, who have consented to be included in the Pain Management database and have a clinician specified pain diagnosis of pain persistent post-surgical pain following breast cancer treatment will be identified. If these patients have an unclear pain diagnosis, they will not be included.</description>

    <description>This will be the group of patients in whom pain is deemed not to be a significant problem.
Once again, these patients will be identified retrospectively. Appropriately matched patients to the 52 patients in the &quot;patients with pain&quot; will be identified using records of hospital operating lists by the peri-operative medicine team.
Patients will be matched based upon the following details:
Age (within 5 years of matched case)
Surgical procedure (matched for the following elements:
Surgery to breast tissue (biopsy, lumpectomy, wide-local excision or mastectomy)
+/- Sentinal lymph node biopsy or axillary dissection
+/- Reconstruction
Surgical procedure within 3-months of matched case.
Provided these individuals have not had an appointment with or referral to the Pain Management Team, they will be included in the matched controls.</description>

        Although two groups of patients will be identified retrospectively:

          1. The first group will be patients who have been referred to the pain management team
             for persistent-post surgical pain following breast cancer treatment.

          2. The second group, will consist of patients who have been matched for age, procedure
             and time-lapsed since operation. These patients will not have persistent post-surgical
             pain.

        Ultimately, archived paraffin-embedded tissue samples, that have previously been taken from
        these patients, will be requested. Samples accessed will be from patients who have
        previously provided consent for their samples to be used for research purposes.
