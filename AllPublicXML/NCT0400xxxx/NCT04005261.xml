  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      C-peptide is used to evaluate beta cell reserves. Patients with type 2 diabetes are treated
      with insulin for different indications. Other than beta-cell insufficiency and organ
      failures, insulin treatment is needed for a specified period. The investigators want to
      evaluate beta cell reserves in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with insulin for at
      least six months to see if that is the case. The investigators also want to compare the
      characteristics of these patients according to their beta cell reserves.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In patients with type 2 diabetes, initiation of insulin therapy is indicated in several
      conditions such as severe insulin resistance, acute metabolic decompensations, surgery,
      pregnancy, and progression of diabetic complications, and also when glycemic control cannot
      be achieved with effective lifestyle regulation and non-insulin antidiabetic medications.
      Some of these indications are transient, and patients should be reassessed to choose the
      appropriate treatment options. Clinical inertia is one of the new topics expressed in the
      recent diabetes guidelines. The investigators aimed to investigate the beta cell reserves of
      the patients with type 2 diabetes who are treated with insulin, to see if they have
      insufficient insulin secretion and if not, to compare their characteristics.
