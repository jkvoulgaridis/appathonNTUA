  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate embolization is an alternative treatment to trans urethral prostate resection in the
      context of benign prostatic hypertrophy. This embolization treatment is also of interest in
      patients with chronic anuria surveyed in relation to their prostatic hypertrophy for
      disundation. This survey causes discomfort and urinary tract infection. It is a population
      with tortuous arteries, a severe atherosclerotic overload making embolizations complex and
      long. Often, only unilateral embolization is possible. The purpose of this study is to
      compare the effectiveness in terms of disundation of unilateral vs. bilateral embolization of
      the prostatic arteries

      the prostatic arteries.

      Method of observation or investigation chosen:

      Retrospective, observational collection with division of patients into two groups according
      to unilateral or bilateral embolization of the porstatic arteries.

      Origin and nature of the data Patient's medical record: imaging stored in the PACS to confirm
      unilateral or bilateral embolization, perform measurements of prostate volume, urological
      medical record to see the effectiveness of embolization in terms of disundation, comfort of
      life, tolerance of embolization, effectiveness in terms of urination (IPSS score)

      Data flow mode:

      Data stored in redcap.
