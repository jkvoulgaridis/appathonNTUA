  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study aims to evaluate the effect of a 16-week duration of multistrain probiotic
      product (De Simone Fomulation (DSF), previously known as VSL#3 and now available as Vivomixx
      in EU and Visbiome in USA to reduce anxiety and depression scores in mild to moderate active
      UC. It has been known that gut microbiota is associated with IBD and mental health. In
      addition, IBD patients complicated with psychiatric disorders are rising more and more
      attention. Further, a recent study &quot;Probiotic Bifidobacterium longum NCC3001 Reduces
      Depression Scores and Alters Brain Activity: A Pilot Study in Patients With Irritable Bowel
      Syndrome&quot; was published in Gastroenterology in 2017, thus we wonder if DSF have an effect on
      the depression/anxiety in patients with UC）A total of 60 patients will be randomly allocated
      into two groups, group A will receive standard medical therapy plus placebo (4 sachets/day,),
      and group B will receive standard medical therapy plus DSF (each sachet containing 450
      billion CFU, eight bacterial strains 4 sachets/day) for 16 weeks. The primary endpoint is the
      reduction of anxiety and depression scores after treatment (at 8 weeks and 16 weeks) using
      hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS). The secondary endpoints including clinical
      response after 8-week and 16-week treatment (measured by a ≥3-point reduction in a Simple
      Clinical Colitis Activity Index (SCCAI) score at 16 weeks), and clinical remission (defined
      as SCCAI score ≤5 at 8 weeks and 16 weeks). Changes in fecal-associated microbiota by 16S
      ribosomal RNA sequencing and metabolomics using company service following probiotics therapy
      (at 16 weeks) were also assessed, stratified by both change in SCCAI score following
      probiotics therapy and randomization. Adverse events were evaluated at week 8 and 16 weeks by
      patient survey
