      The POACH study is part of the Cardiosleep research program. It is a prospective,
      observational, multicentre study conducted in Singapore. The recruitment target is 1365
      patients.

      Eligible patients with AF and high cardiovascular risk will be recruited for a home-based
      sleep study using a FDA-approved portable device. The patients will be divided into 2 groups
      based on the presence or absence of OSA using apnoea-hypopnoea index ≥ 15 events/hour. The AF
      will be treated as per local standard practice. Participation in the POACH study will not
      affect the management of AF. Follow-up will be conducted every 6 months until the median
      follow-up duration has reached 2 years. The primary endpoint is a four-component composite of
      all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke and heart failure hospitalisation.

      Antecubital venous blood samples will be taken from the patients in the morning after the
      sleep study for targeted mass spectrometry which will measure 83 circulating metabolites.
      Sparse Principal Component Analysis will be used for data reduction. Identification of
      distinct associations between metabolic perturbations and OSA will be performed.

    <textblock>
      The overarching objective of the POACH study is to determine the impact of obstructive sleep
      apnoea (OSA) on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF).

      AF is the most prevalent sustained arrhythmia. While OSA often co-exists with AF, current
      management of AF does not take OSA status into consideration. This is partly due to the lack
      of data on whether OSA is independently associated with cardiovascular events in patients
      with AF. Besides, metabolomics is an emerging field of 'omics' research focusing on profiling
      and quantifying low-molecular weight components.

      The POACH study is part of the Cardiosleep research program. It is a prospective,
      observational, multicentre study conducted in Singapore. The recruitment target is 1365
      patients.

      Eligible patients with AF and high cardiovascular risk will be recruited for a home-based
      sleep study using a FDA-approved portable device. The patients will be divided into 2 groups
      based on the presence or absence of OSA using apnoea-hypopnoea index ≥ 15 events/hour. The AF
      will be treated as per local standard practice. Follow-up will be conducted every 6 months
      until the median follow-up duration has reached 2 years. The primary endpoint is a
      four-component composite of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke and heart
      failure hospitalisation. Antecubital venous blood samples will be taken from the patients in
      the morning after the sleep study for targeted mass spectrometry which will measure 83
      circulating metabolites. Sparse Principal Component Analysis will be used for data reduction.
      Identification of distinct associations between metabolic perturbations and OSA will be
      performed.

      Results of the POACH study will likely impact the care of patients with AF.
