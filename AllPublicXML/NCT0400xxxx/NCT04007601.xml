  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Long-term survivors of ALL are at-risk for neurocognitive impairment, particularly in the
      area of executive functioning. Relatively limited research has focused on interventions for
      improving neurocognitive outcomes in long-term survivors of ALL. A promising technique for
      cognitive enhancement is Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) which differs from
      conventional cognitive remediation approaches in that it directly stimulates specific brain
      regions responsible for cognitive processes and activates functional networks similar to
      those activated during cognitive training.

      Primary Objective

      To evaluate the efficacy of home-based transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) paired
      with remote cognitive training on direct testing of executive function in survivors of ALL.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of home-based transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)
           paired with remote cognitive training on patient-reported symptoms of executive
           dysfunction in survivors of ALL.

        -  To examine the effects of home-based tDCS paired with remote cognitive training on
           patterns of regional brain activation as measured by functional magnetic resonance
           imaging.

        -  To examine the effects of home-based tDCS paired with remote cognitive training on white
           matter integrity and structure as measured by diffusion tensor imaging.

      Eligible participants will be randomized to receive 1 mA direct current stimulation over the
      left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex or placebo/sham for 20 minutes. All participants will
      receive home-based computerized cognitive training. Participants will complete tDCS paired
      with cognitive training 2 times per week for 6-months.

    <description>Digit Span Backward: Digit Span Backward (DSB), from the Digit Span subtest on the WAIS-IV, is a measure of working memory. The number of digits recalled in the longest span is converted to a standard z-score using age-based norms (Mean=0, SD=1).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and 6-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Patient reported symptoms of executive dysfunction will be evaluated via the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study Neurocognitive Questionnaire (CCSS-NCQ). The CCSS-NCQ is a 32-item questionnaire evaluating 4 domains of executive function. Z-scores (M=0, SD=1) are calculated using sibling data from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study.</description>

    <description>Patient reported symptoms of executive dysfunction will be evaluated via the Behavior Rating Inventory for Executive Function - Adult Version (BRIEF-A). The BRIEF-A is a 75-item measure of executive function that provides age- and sex-specific national normative data for nine domains of executive function (T-Score, M=50, SD=10).</description>

    <measure>Change in Brain Connectivity from baseline to 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>White connectivity will be measured via diffusion tensor imaging and resting state fMRI (rsFMRI). The cortex will be parcellated into anatomical regions based on the high-resolution T1-weighted imaging using the FreeSurfer software (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/). Probabilistic fiber tracking will be performed for individual seed points within the gray matter/white matter surface for each parcellated cortical region to evaluate strength of the connectivity between each individual region and every other region. The current project will focus analyses on the frontostriatal connections from the DLPFC to the striatum. rsfMRI data will be used to construct functional connectomes for each participant at each time point. We will measure several common connectome properties including global and local efficiency. Connectome modularity, degree distribution, and hub characteristics will also be measured.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Regional Brian Activation from baseline to 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Regional brain activation will be assessed using an N-Back Task. This task requires a participant to respond to a presented stimulus only when it is the same as one presented on a trial at a predetermined number prior to the current trial. For this study, we plan to use 1-back and 2-back trials. Improved efficiency will be defined as reduced activation in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during performance on the N-Back task during the fMRI. Using Statistical Parametric Mapping software (SPM12, Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, London), contrast-images from the fixed-effect analysis in each subject will be used for second level random-effect analysis to create group activation maps. These contrasts include pre- v. post-intervention imaging during the N-back task. Participants assigned to active stimulation will then be contrasted to those assigned to sham stimulation.</description>
