    <textblock>
      The FENIX Registry is a multi-center, observational database designed to collect data
      regarding the FENIX™ Continence Restoration System in everyday clinical practice, evaluate
      the clinical course of patients from pre-operative assessment through five years post-surgery
      and Track and monitor effectiveness and safety through the use of a bowel diary, fecal
      incontinence quality-of-life measures and adverse event reporting. Up to 25 sites will
      participate in the Registry. Sites to enroll consecutive eligible patients into the Registry.
      Registry will enroll approximately 200 FENIX patients.

    <description>Proportion of patients with improvement in Fecal Incontinence Quality of Life (FIQOL) score. The Fecal Incontinence Quality of Life Scale consists of 29 items divided into 4 scales:
Lifestyle (10 items)
Coping/Behavior (9 items)
Depression/Self Perception (7 items)
Embarrassment (3 items) Scales range from 1 to 5, scale scores are the average (mean) of all responses to all items in each scale. A lower score indicated a lower quality of life. The scales are not combined for a &quot;composite&quot; or total score but always presented individually.</description>

    <description>The FENIX™ Continence Restoration System is indicated for use for the treatment of chronic fecal incontinence in patients who have failed or are not candidates for more conservative therapy. The FENIX™ System Implant is placed around the external anal sphincter to augment a weak anal sphincter and restore continence.
The FENIX™ System is comprised of the following components:
FENIX™ System Implant
FENIX™ System Anal Sphincter Sizing Tool The FENIX™ System Implant consists of a series of titanium beads with magnetic cores that are connected with independent titanium wires to form an annular shape. The attractive force of the magnetic beads is designed to provide additional strength to keep a weak anal sphincter closed.</description>
