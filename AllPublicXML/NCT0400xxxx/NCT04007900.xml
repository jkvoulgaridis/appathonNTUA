  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the proposed research is to determine the extent to which Positive Affect
      Treatment (PAT), a novel treatment targeting reward mechanisms, can effectively target the
      psychological reward deficits that maintain anorexia nervosa (AN), and thus improve clinical
      symptoms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anorexia Nervosa is a serious disorder associated with high medical and psychiatric
      morbidity, poor quality of life, and the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric illness.
      Although many individuals with AN ultimately achieve remission, this process of recovery is
      slow, with only about 1/3 of individuals recovering in the first decade of illness, and is
      not always associated with an enhanced quality of life. Further, a substantial portion of
      those with AN do not recover; 20-30% of affected individuals maintain a chronic illness
      course or die prematurely. Interventions that enhance the probability of long-term remission
      from adult AN are lacking. Efficacious outpatient treatments have not been identified and,
      although inpatient treatment can restore healthy weight, up to 50% of patients with AN
      relapse within a year of discharge. This paucity of effective treatment may be due to
      existing interventions not targeting key mechanisms of the disorder. Advances in neuroscience
      have contributed promising insights about the processes that promote AN symptoms. However,
      these findings have not been adequately integrated into treatment for AN. It is critical that
      future treatment development utilize emerging research on the mechanisms of AN to develop
      more effectively targeted interventions. The goal of the proposed research is to determine
      the extent to which Positive Affect Treatment (PAT), a novel treatment targeting reward
      mechanisms, can effectively target the psychological reward deficits that maintain anorexia
      nervosa (AN), and thus improve clinical symptoms. To this end, we propose a small,
      randomized, wait-list controlled pilot trial of PAT adapted for AN (PAT-AN) to achieve the
      following aims: To asses the feasibility and acceptability of PAT-AN among individuals with
      AN and to obtain initial data regarding the potential efficacy of PAT-AN compared to waitlist
      control on measures of clinical outcome and putative reward mechanisms in AN to inform a
      future larger randomized, controlled trial of this intervention.

    <description>Body mass index (BMI) will be calculated based on height and weight measure by a stadiometer and calibrated scale during a medical examination. Change in BMI (kg/m2) will be calculated from baseline to 20-weeks. Increase in BMI in the treatment group vs control will be considered a measure of efficacy of the treatment.</description>

    <description>Individuals randomized to the intervention will participate in 20 therapy visits. Before each therapy visit, the participant will meet briefly with a member of the research staff, who will measure weight (blind to the participant) and administer the CHEDS, PANAS, and a pre-session feedback form that will assess how helpful the skills learned in the prior session had been over the past week. After the session, the participant will complete the post-session feedback form, which will assess how helpful the skills he or she perceived the skills from this session to be. These procedures will take approximately 10 minutes. Each intervention session will take approximately 50 minutes to complete. Therefore, each intervention visit will be approximately 1 hour long. Therapy sessions will take place either in the private office of a study therapist or in a consultation room of the Ambulatory Research Center.</description>

    <description>PAT was designed as a 15-week intervention delivered in 3 modules. Module 1 (Pleasant Events Scheduling) uses behavioral activation methods to enhance positive experiencing before, during, and after rewarding events. Module 2 (Attending to the Positive) applies cognitive training techniques to promote shifting attention towards rewarding aspects of daily situations and to learn behavior mood associations. Module 3 (Cultivating the Positive) uses mindfulness approaches to foster reward experiencing. Treatment length has been expanded to 20 sessions to enhance the suitability of the intervention for AN and target the reward mechanisms that characterize AN. Additional adaptations include: 1) An emphasis on a mindful balance between reward and inhibition; 2) Additional module on shifting attention away from AN-specific rewards; 3) Addition of exercises to work towards long-term life goals and enhance healthy experiences; and 4) Further focus on navigating social rewards.</description>
