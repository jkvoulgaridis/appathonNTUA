    <textblock>
      Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) was one of the most common hip disorders disease in
      children. Pemberton osteotomy (PO) was one of the most widely used by the pediatric
      orthopedic surgeons. In our clinical work, the investigators found some defect the operation
      procedure. When the surgeons were not familiar to the PO, it may injured the triradiate
      cartilage or easily be absorbable of the distal iliac. Here, the investigators found a new
      pelvic osteotomy just from the inner &quot;L shaped&quot; iliac osteotomy (ILSO) to treat DDH. This
      approach was in a visible part of the sciatic notch and not presumed to be in the ischium,
      completely out of sight. Comparing to the PO method, the investigators' operation method was
      easy to master and had less complications.
