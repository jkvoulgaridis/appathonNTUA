      The purpose of the study is to examine the prevalence and outcome of sexual harassment in and
      outside sports, including who the perpetrators are, the association between experienced
      sexual harassment and psychological health, if reporting mechanisms and emergency plans exist
      and function, and the participants suggestions for preventive strategies. The knowledge from
      this study will be a good basis to further establish and implement strategies to prevent
      sexual harassment in the future.

      Students, trainers (with more than 20 % employment status) and leaders at elite sport high
      schools and regular high schools in Norway will answer a questionnaire at two measurement
      points. After the first measurement point a sample of randomly selected students who report
      experiences with sexual harassment, in addition to a sample of trainers and leaders, will
      also be invited to participate in an individual in-depth interview.
