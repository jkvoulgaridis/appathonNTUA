      This is a national, multicenter, ambispective, observational post-authorization study (EPA-SP
      for its acronym in Spanish) to describe the incidence, clinical management and outcome of
      aplastic anemia in hospitals throughout Spain.

      The study includes a retrospective chart review to identify all cases of aplastic anemia
      diagnosed between January 2010 and the date of the study initiation and a prospective study
      to detect new cases of aplastic anemia during an 18-month period since the study initiation
      in the participant hospitals. The study is also designed to collect both retrospective and
      prospective data on clinical management and outcome of patients with confirmed aplastic
      anemia. All patients included in the study, including those cases of aplastic anemia
      identified since 2010 until the study initiation through the retrospective chart review that
      are alive at the time of inclusion in the study, will be followed up until death or
      lost-to-follow-up or until 6 months after the last patient is enrolled in the study.

      The study consists of a baseline visit, follow-up visits every 6 months (± 15 days) until
      death or lost-to follow-up or up to 6 months after the last patient is enrolled in the study,
      and a final visit (final/premature withdrawal visit) which will be performed at the study end
      (6 months after the last patient is enrolled) or in case of premature withdrawal, except for
      patient withdrawal of consent, loss-to-follow-up or death.

    <description>Hematological response will be assessed on the basis of hemoglobin, platelet and absolute neutrophil count every 3 months (90 days) according to routine clinical practice.
Hematological response will be classified as response (CR and PR vs. NR). CR and PR to treatment will be defined as follows:
CR: haemoglobin levels ≥120 g/L, platelet count ≥100 x 109/L, and neutrophil count ≥1.5 x 109/L.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients of both sexes and of any age

          -  Confirmed diagnosis of spinal cord aplasia, regardless of its severity (moderate,

             (retrospective study) and during the inclusion period of 18 months in hospitals
             Participants (prospective study).

        Aplasia is defined by a cellularity of the bone marrow &lt;25% and the presence of less than
        the following: (i) hemoglobin &lt;100 g / l (ii) platelet count &lt;50 x109 / l (iii) Neutrophil
        count &lt; 1.5 x 109 / l.

          -  Any severity of the disease according to hematological and spinal criteria (5):
             moderate aplasia (absolute neutrophil count [ANC]&gt; 0.5 x 109 / l), severe (ANC
             0.2-≤0.5) x 109 / l) or very severe (RAN &lt;0.2 x 109 / l).

          -  Patients who voluntarily understand and sign the informed consent (if it can be
             provided), preferably in writing or orally before a witness, or will be obtained from
             the legal representative of the patient (for children under 16 years of age) before
             the start of the study. The deceased patients and the patients with whom they can not
             be contacted or have lost their follow-up, who have been diagnosed since January 1,
             2010 until the beginning of the study, are exempt from the requirement of consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with any medical or psychological alteration that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, could compromise the patient's ability to grant their informed consent.

          -  Evidence of Fanconi anemia, dyskeratosis congenita, congenital spinal cord syndrome,
             and myelodysplastic syndrome.
