  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Meningitis, defined as inflammation of the meninges caused by different pathogens, is a
      serious infection associated with high morbidity and mortality. It occurs more commonly in
      the neonatal period than in any other age group. Neonatal meningitis is a devastating
      infection that occurs more commonly in neonates than in any other age group, and is
      associated with significant morbidity and mortality. In this study, we aimed to evaluate
      epidemiology, treatment and prognosis of neonatal meningitis in a large-scale retrospective
      multicenter cohort study.

      The main objectives of this study were to assess the incidence, temporal trend, risk factors,
      causative organisms, and short term outcomes of neonatal meningitis in a large national
      cohort of newborn infants admitted to Turkey NICUs.

    <description>- Bayley Scales of Infant Development, Second Edition (BSID II), was performed a comprehensive assessment including neurological and developmental evaluation. The mean BSID II score is 100 for Mental Developmental Index (MDI) and Psychomotor Developmental Index (PDI), with a standard deviation (SD) of 15; a score of less than 70 (42 SDs below the mean) indicates a significant delay. Infants who were so severely impaired that testing with the BSID II could not be performed were assigned a MDI and PDI score of 49.</description>

        In this study,

          1. Lumbar puncture performed due to suspected meningitis and

          2. CSF laboratory findings are consistent with meningitis and

          3. Positivity in CSF culture and/or CSF PCR

          4. Neonates hospitalized between 1 January 2014 and 31 May 2019 will be included in the
             study.

               -  The list of all cases diagnosed as on Neonatal Meningitis with growth in CSF
                  culture and / or causative agent by CSF PCR will be obtained from the hospital's
                  database.

               -  Term infants will be included in the study until 1 month and preterm infants will
                  be adjusted until the first month.
