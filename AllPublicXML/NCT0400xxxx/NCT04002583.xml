      Researchers are trying to determine the frequency of seizures and epilepsy in patients with
      Early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) using a 48-hour computer assisted ambulatory
      electroencephalogram.

        Inclusion criteria for EOAD patients will be recruited from the LEADS trial with the
        following:

          -  40 to 64 years of age

          -  Meets NIA-AA criteria for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD or probable AD
             dementia.

          -  Have a global CDR score of â‰¤ 1.0

          -  Have capacity to provide informed consent (ICF) or has a legal authorized
             representative or guardian who provides IC.

          -  Amyloid positive status (PET scan with evidence of elevated amyloid)

          -  Must have a study partner (informant) who spends a minimum average of 10 hours per
             week with the participant (e.g., family member, significant other, friend, and
             caregiver) who is generally aware of the participants' daily activities and can
             provide information about the participant's cognitive and functional performance. If
             the participant does not have a study partner who spends 10 face-to-face hours per
             week, other arrangements for identifying a viable study partner will be granted on a
             case-by-case basis by the Site PI.

          -  Not pregnant or lactating. Women must be two years post-menopausal, be surgically
             sterile, or have a negative pregnancy test prior to each PET scan

          -  Fluent in English.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Meets core clinical criteria for non-AD dementia.

          -  Two or more first degree relatives with a history of EOAD suggestive of autosomal
             dominant transmission, unless known pathogenic mutations in APP, PSEN1, PSEN2 have
             been excluded.

          -  Known mutation in an ADAD gene (APP, PSEN1, PSEN2) or other autosomal dominant genes
             associated with other neurodegenerative disorders.

          -  MRI scans with evidence of infection or focal lesions, cortical strokes, multiple
             lacunes (single lacune is allowable unless it meets criteria for strategic lacune
             affecting cognition)

          -  Any significant systemic illness or unstable medical condition, which could lead to
             difficulty complying with the protocol (at the discretion of the Site PI)

          -  Medical history of a brain disorder other than the disorder causing dementia except
             for headache.

          -  Deemed ineligible by the Site PI for any other reason.
