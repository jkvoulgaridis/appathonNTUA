  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted as a Phase 1, open-label, single dose, randomized, 4-period,
      cross over design in a single cohort of approximately 12 healthy male or female participants
      at a single center. Participants will be randomized into 1 of 4 sequences of treatment.
