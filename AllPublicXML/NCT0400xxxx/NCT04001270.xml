  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Limbic encephalitis associated with anti leucine-rich glioma inactivated-1 LGI1 antibody
      (anti-LGI1) usually presents with seizures and progressive disturbance of memory and
      behavior. But anti-LGI1 associated encephalitis (LGI1-E) could present with a variety of
      features including an elective cognitive form of the disease, which mimicks a
      neurodegenerative condition such as Creutzfeld Jakob disease or rapidly progressive Alzheimer
      disease. In these patients, the appropriate diagnosis could be challenging.

      The primary aim of this study is to describe cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers in a cohort of
      LGI1-E patients as results of these markers are currently not described in LGI1-E. Moreover,
      patients with LGI1-E often present seizures. At this point, the impact on cerebrospinal fluid
      biomarkers has not been described in this condition. The secondary aims of this study are to
      compare cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in LGI1-E patients to these in other
      neurodegenerative conditions ( e.g. creutzfeld Jakob disease, Alzheimer disease), which are
      considered as a possible differential diagnosis in these patients. The last aim of this study
      is to look for correlations between cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers in LGI1-E and clinical
      data in these patients, especially seizure.

    <description>Biomarkers from patients with anti-leucine rich glioma inactivated 1 encephalitis (anti LGI1-E) will be studied. This is a non-interventional study involving biological samples (CSF biomarkers) already stored in biobank repositories. All stored samples were collected as part of the diagnostic process of patients with suspected autoimmune encephalitis, meaning that the standard diagnostic and therapeutic approaches will not be altered in the selected study population.</description>
