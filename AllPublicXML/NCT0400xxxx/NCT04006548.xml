  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We plan to recruit 200 children and adolescents aged between 6 to 17 years old in two years.
      Those patients would receive clinical interview by child psychiatrists to diagnose as ADHD
      and to exclude mental retardation, major psychiatric disorders and medical disorders.
      Moreover, we excluded children who ever received ADHD medication treatment more than one
      year, or received medication in recent 30 days. Initial assessment includes collecting saliva
      sample, and complete questionnaires (SNAP-IV), clinical rating (CGI-S) and psychological test
      (CPT-II, WISC-IV, CANTAB). After 1 month methylphenidate treatment, we would evaluate
      SNAP-IV, CGI-S, CGI-I and Barkley Psychostimulants Side Effects Rating Scale. We also would
      collect saliva samples to perform appetite related gene phenotyping to see the association
      between medication side effect and polymorphism of appetite related genes.
