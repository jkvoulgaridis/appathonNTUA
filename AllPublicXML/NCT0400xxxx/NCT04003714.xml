  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS) is the term of persistent back and/or leg pain after
      surgery for lumbar disk herniation (LDH). Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation
      (r-TMS) is a technique that allows non-invasive and relatively painless stimulation of
      cerebral cortex. It can reduce the experience of chronic pain by using magnetic field to
      produce small electrical currents in the cortex.The aim of this study is to determine the
      effectiveness of r-TMS treatment on patients with FBSS.

      Methods: In this double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, 20 patients (aged
      34-65 years) clinically diagnosed as FBSS, who had a history of surgery for LDH with
      persistent back and leg pain. Patients in r-TMS group received 5 Hz of r-TMS, as a 20-min
      (1000 pulses) daily session, 5 days per weeks, for a total of 10 sessions. R-TMS applied with
      MagVenture device (MagPro X100, Denmark, 2009) and figure eight coil (MMC 140 parabolic,
      MagVenture). Control group received sham r-TMS with the same protocol. Patients were assessed
      at baseline,after 5th and 10th sessions and 1 and 3 months after treatment. Visual Analogue
      Scale (VAS), DN-4 (Douleur Neuropathique-4 Questionnaire), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI),
      Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were used for
      evaluation.

    <description>All groups were evaluated for low back and leg pain with Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for rest, activity, and sleep-disturbing. Patients were instructed to indicate the severity of pain on a 10- point scale, on which 0 meant no pain, 5 meant moderate pain, and 10 meant intolerable pain.</description>

    <measure>Oswestry Disability Index</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Functional status in all groups was evaluated with the Oswestry disability index (ODI). The ODI consists of 10 topics concerning pain, lifting, ability of selfcare, ability to walk, sit, stand and travel, social life, and sleep quality and is intended to assess disability and quality of life related to low back pain. ODI scores range from 0 (no disability) to 100 (maximum disability possible).</description>

    <measure>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the subjective amount of sleep, we used The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The PSQI evaluates the sleep quality of the previous month, and it is clinically useful in the evaluation of several sleep disorders that affect sleep quality. It includes 19 self-administered questions and 5 questions to be answered by bedroom companions.</description>

R-TMS was applied with MagVenture device (MagPro X100, Denmark, 2009) and figure eight coil (MMC 140 parabolic, MagVenture). Control group received sham r-TMS with the same protocol. Lumbar isometric exercises were given to all patients in both groups. Outcome measures were visual analogue scale (VAS) for rest, activity, and sleep-disturbing; Oswestry disability index; DN4-interview questionnaire; Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index; Beck Depression Inventory (BDI).
