  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study will test whether support from a Community Health Worker (CHW) to address
      barriers to annual LDCT screening will result in an increased number of patients who receive
      the annual screening as per the recommended standard of care compared to passive outreach
      using a reminder letter.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a randomized controlled trial comparing phone outreach by a trained
      Community Health Worker (CHW) following a reminder letter to the reminder letter alone for
      patients who are at least a month overdue to have a routine annual low dose CT scan (LDCT)
      screening for lung cancer. CHWs will be able to identify and address barriers to accessing
      screening for those patients randomized to that arm of the study. Outcomes that will be
      measured include scheduling and completing the LDCT as well as agreeing to a referral for
      tobacco treatment.
