      To measure NAC-induced changes to concentrations of glutathione (GSH) in the anterior
      cingulate cortex (ACC) as measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in 36 adolescents
      and young adults with NSSI (12 in each group: high, low, and placebo).

      This study is a double-blind, placebo controlled, 4-week course of two-tiered
      N-acetylcysteine (NAC) dosing focused on identifying the optimal dose to achieve meaningful
      change in measurable biomarkers (glutathione and glutamate).

      This design will allow us to confirm acute biological changes, select the optimal dose for
      achieving biological effects, and examine dose/concentration-response relationships with
      respect to biological markers and pharmacokinetics.

      Brief schedule of activities: Subjects will be recruited through community and clinical
      settings and screened over the phone. There will be a total of 4 in-person visits and two
      sets of on-line study activities.

      Eligible participants will be assigned to one of 3 groups (double-blinded): a low-dose NAC
      group (3600 mg/day), a high-dose NAC group (5400mg/day), and placebo (PBO). The study
      intervention period is 4 weeks. Total participation is up to 8 weeks, depending on the length
      of time between Day 0 and Day 1.

      The investigators will recruit 36 adolescents and young adults aged 16-24 years. There will
      be 12 participants in each group (PBO, 3600mg/day, 5400mg/day). The investigators will use a
      minimization procedure to ensure that the participants in these 3 groups will have similar
      age, clinical severity and medication status.
