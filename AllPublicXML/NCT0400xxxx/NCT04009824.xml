    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of AGS-v PLUS, a universal
      mosquito-borne disease and mosquito control vaccine, in healthy volunteers.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to five groups. Participants in Group 1 will receive
      placebo on Days 1 and 22. Participants in Group 2 will receive unadjuvanted AGS-v PLUS
      vaccine on Days 1 and 22. Participants in Group 3 will receive Montanide ISA-51 adjuvanted
      AGS-v PLUS vaccine on Day 1 and placebo on Day 22. Participants in Group 4 will receive
      Montanide ISA-51 adjuvanted AGS-v PLUS vaccine on Days 1 and 22. Participants in Group 5 will
      receive Alhydrogel® adjuvanted AGS-v PLUS vaccine on Days 1 and 22.

      Participants will be in the study for approximately 12 months. During this time, they will
      attend several study visits, which may include physical examinations, blood collection, skin
      biopsies, and a mosquito feeding procedure. Study staff will also follow up with participants
      by phone several times throughout the study.
