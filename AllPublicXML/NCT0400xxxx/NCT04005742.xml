  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Worldwide, colorectal cancer is the 3rd most common cancer; risk increases with age and is
      modified by lifestyle factors notably diet, physical activity and obesity. The BORICC
      Follow-Up (BFU) Study is a 12+ year follow-up of participants recruited to the Biomarkers of
      Risk of Colon Cancer (BORICC) Study. This longitudinal study will investigate associations
      between ageing and lifestyle factors and a panel of molecular biomarkers linked with
      colorectal cancer risk.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The BORICC Follow-Up (BFU) Study builds on the findings from the BORICC Study where the
      investigators observed associations between age and nutritional factors, including selenium
      and folate, and biomarkers of colorectal health.

      The BFU Study will investigate the relationships between ageing (12+ years) and such
      biomarkers longitudinally. It is anticipated that the project will produce novel data on (i)
      changes in biomarkers of colorectal cancer risk with age and (ii) the effects of obesity and
      lifestyle factors on biomarkers of colorectal cancer risk. These biomarkers include
      differentially expressed proteins, DNA methylation markers and inflammation markers.
