  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      proof-of-principle study of neflamapimod versus matching placebo (randomized 1:1)
      administered with food for 16 weeks in subjects with DLB. The primary objective is to
      evaluate the effect of neflamapimod on cognitive function as assessed in a study-specific
      Cogstate Neuropsychological Test Battery (NTB). Secondary endpoints include the Clinical
      Dementia Rating Scale-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE),
      Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-10), Timed Up and Go Test, and electroencephalogram (EEG) as
      a potential biomarker for DLB.

    <measure>Composite score of a study-specific Cogstate Neurological Test Battery (NTB) including the Cogstate Letter Fluency Test and Category Fluency Test</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change from Baseline to Week 16 in the composite score of a study-specific Cog-state Neurological Test Battery (NTB), including assessments of attention, executive function, and visuospatial function in neflamapimod treated-subjects as compared to the placebo-treated subjects, as analyzed using the Mixed Model Repeated Measures (MMRM) analysis method. The following six tests will be included in the composite: (1) Cogstate Detection test (DET), (2) Cogstate Identification test (IDN), (3) Cogstate One Card Learning test (OCL), (4) Cogstate One Back test (ONB), (5) Letter Fluency Test, (6) Category Fluency Test (CFT). Each score on the individual tests will be converted to a z-score, and then a total z-score will be calculated, in which each test is weighted equally. The change in total z-score in neflamapimod vs. placebo-recipients will be analyzed. As the analysis is based on z-scores, there is no minimum or maximum value.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Dementia Rating Scale-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB)</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in Clinical Dementia Rating Scale-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) score based on semi-quantitative scoring of each domain (box) evaluating cognitive impairment in milder and more progressive forms of dementia, in neflamapimod-treated subjects compared to placebo-recipients. The domain (box) scores will be calculated for a Sum of Boxes score. Secondary efficacy endpoints will utilize the same analysis method and model as the primary endpoint.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) with respect to orientation, memory, concentration, language, and praxis (scores ranging from 0 to 30 with lower scores indicating greater cognitive impairment), in neflamapimod-treated subjects compared to placebo-recipients. Secondary efficacy endpoints will utilize the same analysis method and model as the primary endpoint.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-10)</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-10) domains, specifically depression (dysphoria), anxiety, hallucinations, and agitation/aggression, in neflamapimod-treated subjects compared to placebo-recipients. Responses indicating subject has a problem with a particular sub-domain lead to questions of the caregiver rating the frequency of the symptoms on a 4-point scale, severity on a 3-point scale, and the distress the symptoms cause them on a 5-point scale. Secondary efficacy endpoints will utilize the same analysis method and model as the primary endpoint.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>International Shopping List Test (ISLT)</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in International Shopping List Test (ISLT) immediate and delayed recall and recognition will be used to assess episodic memory in neflamapimod-treated subjects compared to placebo-recipients. Secondary efficacy endpoints will utilize the same analysis method as the primary endpoint.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Timed Up and Go Test (TUG)</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in Timed Up and Go Test (TUG) to assess mobility (score of &gt;15 seconds indicates subject has increased risk of falls) in neflamapimod-treated subjects compared to placebo-recipients. Secondary efficacy endpoints will utilize the same analysis method and model as the primary endpoint.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quantitative Electroencephalogram (qEEG)</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in quantitative electroencephalogram (qEEG) parameters (all waveforms, with particular focus on relative alpha and theta power) with the subject awake in accordance with the 10-20 International System of Electrode placement will be evaluated as a potential biomarker for DLB. Slowing of the dominant frequency band by qEEG over posterior aspects of the brain has been recognized to be prominent in DLB, and various patterns have been identified to differentiate DLB from AD. EEG will be analyzed at an academic center (VU Medical Center, Amsterdam), who will develop the specific parameters during the conduct of the study, and they will specify the analytic approach in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) that will be implemented prior to the completion of subject enrollment.</description>
