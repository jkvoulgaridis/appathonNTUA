  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedures are performed using
      duodenoscopes for the treatment of pancreatic and biliary diseases. Although outcomes in
      endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedures are measured mainly in terms
      of procedural success and complications, currently there are no objective tools to assess the
      technical performance of the duodenoscopes.

      The Center for Interventional Endoscopy has maintained a multicenter database that
      prospectively evaluates the technical performance of duodenoscopes for performing ERCPs. Our
      objective is to analyze the database in order to summarize the technical performance of
      duodenoscopes during ERCPs and evaluate the reliability of the duodenoscope assessment tool.

      Outcomes in ERCP are measured mainly in terms of procedural success and complications.
      Recently, disposable duodenoscopes have been developed to overcome the challenges associated
      with reusable duodenoscope-related infections. While it is important to measure the technical
      performance of the newly developed disposable duodenoscope relative to conventional reusable
      scopes, presently, there are no objective tools to accomplish this task. The aim of this
      registry is to assess the reliability of a newly designed assessment tool to evaluate the
      technical performance of the currently available duodenoscopes. The duodenoscope assessment
      tool will be completed by each endoscopist after performing the ERCP and this data will be
      summarized and analyzed to assess the technical performance of the duodenoscopes and also to
      assess validity of the duodenoscope assessment tool. This is a multicenter study, with data
      collection from multiple centers across the United States.
