  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury (HIBI) is the main cause of death in patients who are comatose
      after resuscitation from cardiac arrest. Current guidelines recommend to target a mean
      arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 mmHg to achieve an adequate organ perfusion. Moreover, after
      cardiac arrest, cerebral autoregulation is dysregulated and cerebral blood flow (CBF) depends
      on the MAP. A higher blood pressure target could improve cerebral perfusion and HIBI.
      Transcranial Doppler (TCD) is a non-invasive method to study CBF and its variations induced
      by MAP.

      The aim of this study is to test the feasibility of an early-goal directed hemodynamic
      management with TCD during the first 12 hours after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC).

    <description>MAP will be increased to 90-100 mmHg with norepinephrine. If TCD is still abnormal with a MAP of 90-100 mmHg, MAP will be increased to 100-110 mmHg. At each step, all CBF determinants will be recorded as well as cardiac output and Veinous jugular oxygen saturation (SvjO2). When TCD is normalized with no complications, MAP will be maintained at 90-100 or 100-110 mmHg during 24 hours.</description>
