  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lumbar pain, or low back pain, may be defined as pain or discomfort located from the lower
      portion of the costal margin to the gluteal folds, with or without referred pain in the legs.
      This pain is classified as non-specific lumbar pain when its cause is unknown, as well as
      chronic when it persists for longer than three months with the appearance of disabilities for
      activities of daily life. Treatments for low back pain are usually pharmacological, focusing
      on analgesics, muscle relaxants and anti-inflammatories. Although protective factors, such as
      exercise, healthy diet and functional training may mitigate the evolution of pain, physical
      disability due to pain and functional loss reduce quality of life. Photobiomodulation (PBM)
      can be defined as the therapeutic use of light sources to reduce inflammation and relief
      pain. In this context, the objectives of this study are to develop and evaluate the
      effectiveness of an application protocol of an LED cluster for the treatment of chronic low
      back pain in a randomized, double-blind clinical trial that will be conducted in the
      outpatient facility of Universidade Nove de Julho (Uninove). Patients with chronic
      nonspecific low back pain, who signs the Informed Consent Form approved by the Uninove
      Institutional Review Board will be included in the study. Treatment sessions will be
      performed with a LED cluster three times a week for 4 weeks (totaling 12 sessions) in the
      lumbar region, and the outcomes will be measured with the following evaluations: VAS - Visual
      Analog Scale; Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ); Schöber test; Modified Oswestry
      Disability Questionnaire and Algometry.

    <measure>Change in disability assessed by Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Before the first application of LED) and 4 weeks after (after the last application).</time_frame>
    <description>This scale assesses physical abilities and psychological factors of patients, inquiring about functional changes of people with low back pain. It presents 24 questions about the conditions of the patient that characterize the presented incapacity. In all questions the phrase &quot;because of my back&quot; is added, and when it comes to answering them, the patient signals only the phrases that best suits him or her at that moment, otherwise the patient should go on to the next sentence. The total count of the marked items can range from a minimum of zero, considered no functional impairment, to a maximum of 24, high functional impairment.</description>

    <measure>Change in range of motion assessed by Schöber test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Before the first application of LED) and 4 weeks after (after the last application).</time_frame>
    <description>the patient will remain in the orthostatic position while the examiner positions his thumbs at the lower margin of the posterior superior iliac spine (PSIS) and draws a horizontal line in the midline between these two structures.
Then, the examiner firmly holds the tip of a measuring tape against the patient's skin on the marked line and marks a second line 15 cm above the first. The patient is then asked to flex the anterior trunk without increasing pain and a new measurement is marked between the lower and upper marks; finally, the patient returns to the neutral position. The difference between the initial distance (between the two marks on the skin in the neutral position) and the new measurement in the flexed position indicates the mobility of the lumbar spine in centimeters, with precision of millimeters.</description>

    <measure>Change in disability assessed by Modified Oswestry Disability Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Before the first application of LED) and 4 weeks after (after the last application).</time_frame>
    <description>The Brazilian version of the Oswestry questionnaire allows the evaluation of the functional disability reported by the patients, based on the level of pain during different activities of daily life. This questionnaire contains ten questions about daily activities for evaluating the impact of pain on the performance of such activities. The results range from zero (minimum disability) to 100 (evident disability).</description>

    <measure>Change in Pressure Pain Threshold</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Before the first application of LED) and 4 weeks after (after the last application).</time_frame>
    <description>The Pressure Pain Threshold (PPT) will be evaluated with the J Tech algometer (XXX). The algometer is a hand device with a 1cm² diameter rod and a rubber cover in its tip. It allows the recording, through the electronic device, the pressure applied on a surface. For this evaluation, a pressure will be applied at a constant rate of 1kg/sec to the level at which pain or discomfort is reported by the volunteer who will be lying on a stretcher. The evaluated muscles will be: gluteus medius; tensor fasciae latae; tibialis anterior; proximal ischiotibial (ischium); paravertebral muscle (lumbar L2-L5 and sacral S1-S3).</description>

    <description>A total of twelve laser applications (3 sessions per week) will be provided to the patients as treatment. A LED board with wavelengths of 660nm and 850nm at 5mW of power will be used for 30 minutes, resulting in a total energy of 3J per point in each session. The application site will be the lumbar region, in contact with the skin. The LED cluster (light-emitting diodes) has 72 LEDs.</description>
