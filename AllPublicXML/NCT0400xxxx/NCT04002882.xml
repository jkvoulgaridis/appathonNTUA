  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nutrition and body composition, the amount of muscle and fat in the body, has a role in
      overall health. This study wants to learn more about how nutrition and body composition
      affects health outcomes like glucose tolerance and lung function in patients with cystic
      fibrosis (CF) who are ages 16-30 years old. 60 adolescents and young adults with CF will be
      recruited, and 30 volunteers without cystic fibrosis. A total of 40 of these study
      participants with CF will be asked to return for annual study visits for 2 years after the
      first visit.

      The long-term goal of this study is to use the information collected to make decisions about
      future nutrition monitoring and interventions which help maintain optimal health for
      individuals with CF.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, observation study to test the central hypothesis that individuals with
      cystic fibrosis (CF) have a higher propensity to increased visceral adipose tissue (VAT)
      accumulation and decreased lean body mass (LBM) compared to healthy controls, and this
      dysregulation in adipose and protein deposition exacerbates glucose intolerance and lung
      function decline. A sub-set of participants with CF will be followed longitudinally for two
      years (n=40). The investigators will conduct detailed body composition, fat distribution,
      metabolic, and nutritional phenotyping in this cohort. Body fat distribution will be assessed
      with MRI. Whole body composition will be assessed with DEXA. Glucose tolerance will be
      assessed with an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and mathematical modeling of the
      C-peptide and insulin response to glucose. Lung health will be assessed by objective clinical
      data and self-reported symptoms.

    <measure>Change in Visceral Adipose Tissue volume (VAT) by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 year, 2 year</time_frame>
    <description>Body fat distribution and body composition in 60 individuals with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) and 30 matched, healthy control will be assessed by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Disposition Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 year, 2 year</time_frame>
    <description>The disposition index (DI) is a measure of the ability of B-cells to compensate for insulin resistance.
A lower DI indicates a loss of B-cell function, which means decreased pancreatic function. The disposition index will be assessed with an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and mathematical modeling of the C-peptide and insulin response to glucose.
This study seeks to determine if glucose intolerance is associated with body composition and fat distribution in CF subjects.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Forced Expiratory Volume in the first second (FEV1%)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 year, 2 year</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical spirometry is a test of lung function that will be used to assess the progression of lung disease with the baseline Forced Expiratory Volume (FEV%) predicted within the past year. Baseline is defined as the average of the best FEV1% for each quarter of the calendar year. FEV1% predicted is a method of determining the severity of pulmonary disease and declines as disease severity increases.</description>

Images will later be analyzed for quantification of VAT volume and lipid content of pancreas will be analyzed</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 year, 2 year</time_frame>
    <description>Hepatic lipid contributes to the Visceral Adipose Tissue volume (VAT) and it will me measured with the MRI.
Participants will lay in the supine position for approximately 30 minutes while in the MRI scanner, and images of the abdominal area (L1-L5 vertebrae) and thigh area will be obtained. Images will later be analyzed for quantification of VAT volume and lipid content of liver will be analyzed</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 year, 2 year</time_frame>
    <description>Thigh PMAT contributes to the VAT and it will me measured with the MRI. Participants will lay in the supine position for approximately 30 minutes while in the MRI scanner, and images of the abdominal area (L1-L5 vertebrae) and thigh area will be obtained. Images will later be analyzed for quantification of VAT volume and Thigh PMAT</description>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Insulin secretion</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 year, 2 year</time_frame>
    <description>Insulin secretion measures the total beta cell response (PhiTot), and will be assessed with an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).
Fasted blood samples will be drawn 30 minutes and 15 minutes before the initiation of glucose consumption. At time &quot;zero&quot;, an oral glucose solution at the dose of 1.75 gm/kg to a maximum of 75 gms will be provided and consumed within 5 minutes of administration. Subsequent blood samples will be drawn at 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min following initiation of glucose ingestion.
Decreased insulin secretion has been associated with lower B-cell function.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Whole body insulin sensitivity index (WBISI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 year, 2 year</time_frame>
    <description>Insulin sensitivity describes how sensitive the body is to the effects of insulin. Whole body insulin sensitivity index (WBISI) is derived from glucose and insulin levels from the full length of the OGTT. The index is calculated using a formula.
Decreased insulin sensitivity index is associated with more advanced CF disease.</description>

      Specimens that remain after completion of the study will be stored for future studies beyond
      the scope of the current study only if subjects denote the appropriate section of the
      informed consent form to grant long term storage of samples. Specimens and data will be
      stored at Emory University within the PI's (Jessica Alvarez) laboratory. Any stored samples
      will be de-identified with a specific code whose identity can only be accessed by authorized
      study personnel appointed by the PI.

      During the conduct of the study, an individual participant can choose to withdraw consent to
      have biological specimens stored for future research. However, withdrawal of consent with
      regard to bio-sample storage may not be possible after the study is completed.
