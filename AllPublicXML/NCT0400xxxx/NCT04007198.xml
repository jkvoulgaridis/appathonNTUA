    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, PD, and clinical
      activity of itolizumab (EQ001) in subjects with moderate-to-severe asthma.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will enroll up to 40 subjects, with up to 5 dose escalating cohorts of 8 patients
      enrolled in a 3:1 ratio. Subjects will receive either itolizumab or placebo administered
      subcutaneously every two weeks (over 8 weeks) for a total of 5 doses with 4 weeks of
      follow-up.

          1. Is male or female, age ≥ 18 and ≤ 75 years

          2. Has a documented clinical diagnosis of moderate-to-severe uncontrolled asthma
             requiring moderate- or high-dose inhaled CS (ICS; ≥ 250 mcg of fluticasone propionate
             twice daily or equipotent ICS daily dosage to a maximum of 2000 mcg/day of fluticasone
             propionate or equivalent) and one or more additional controller medications (inhaled
             LABA or anticholinergic or LTA) for ≥ 3 months, with a stable dose ≥1 month prior to
             the initial Screening Visit

          3. Has a prebronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) ≥ 40% and ≤ 90% of
             predicted value during the Screening Period, despite use of a moderate- or high-dose
             ICS and one or more additional controller medications (inhaled LABA or anticholinergic
             or LTA)

          4. Has FEV1 reversibility of &gt; 12% (% predicted increase) AND ≥ 200 mL (absolute
             increase) after administration of a short-acting beta agonist (200 to 400 mcg
             albuterol/salbutamol or equivalent) during the Screening Period or documented within
             the prior 2 years, or has a history of positive bronchial challenge test within the
             prior 2 years

          5. Has a history of ≥ 1 clinically significant asthma exacerbation (see definition in
             Section 9.2.2) in the 12 months prior to the initial Screening Visit, despite use of a
             moderate- or high dose ICS and one or more additional controller medications at the
             time the exacerbation(s) occurred

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Is a current or former smoker with a smoking history of ≥10 pack-years (number of
             pack-years = number of cigarettes per day/20 × number of years smoked; a former smoker
             is defined as a subject who stopped smoking ≥ 6 months prior to the Screening Visit)

          2. Has a body mass index &gt; 36 kg/m2

          3. Has a documented history or radiological evidence of a clinically important lung
             condition other than asthma (eg, α1 antitrypsin deficiency, bronchiectasis, cystic
             fibrosis, primary ciliary dyskinesia, pulmonary fibrosis, allergic bronchopulmonary
             mycosis, or lung cancer)

          4. Has a respiratory tract infection (RTI) within 4 weeks before the initial Screening
             Visit, or during the Screening Period (these subjects may be re-screened following
             complete resolution of their RTI)

          5. Has an asthma exacerbation within 4 weeks before the initial Screening Visit, or
             during the Screening Period (these subjects may be re-screened following complete
             resolution of their exacerbation)

          6. Has a diagnosis of currently active malignancy; subjects with a medical history of
             basal cell carcinoma, localized squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or in situ
             carcinoma of the uterine cervix are eligible; subjects with a medical history of other
             malignancies are eligible if the subject is in remission and curative therapy was
             completed ≥ 2 years prior to the initial Screening Visit

          7. Has a history or presence of clinically concerning cardiac arrythmias, atrial
             fibrillation, New York Heart Association Class III or IV heart failure, or prolonged
             QT or corrected QT interval &gt; 500 milliseconds (ms) at the Screening Visit

          8. Has any disorder (including, but not limited to, cardiovascular [CV], gastrointestinal
             [GI], hepatic, renal, neurological, musculoskeletal, infectious, endocrine, metabolic,
             hematological, psychiatric, or major physical impairment) that is not stable in the
             opinion of the investigator and/or could:

               1. Affect the subject's safety

               2. Influence the findings of the study or data interpretation

               3. Impede the subject's ability to complete the study

          9. Has undergone bronchial thermoplasty

         10. Has a history of substance abuse (including alcohol) that may, in the investigator's
             judgment, increase the risk to the subject of participation in the study

         11. Has used monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy for the management of asthma or any other
             condition within 3 months prior to the initial Screening Visit (these subjects may be
             re-screened following the 3 month period)

         12. Has required an oral corticosteroid burst within 1 month prior to the initial
             Screening Visit or during the Screening Period (these subjects may be re-screened
             following the 1 month period); maintenance oral corticosteroids ≤ 10 mg/d prednisone
             or equivalent is permitted
