  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are several topical treatment for Pityriasis Versicolor including ketoconazole and
      selenium sulfide. Ketoconazole is a broad spectrum anti-fungal drug from imidazole group that
      has been reported to be effective in PV. The study aimed to reveal the mycological efficacy,
      safety, recurrence and cost-effectiveness of selenium sulfide 1.8% shampoo (SeS2) and
      ketoconazole 2% shampoo in the treatment of pityriasis versicolor. A double blind randomized
      controlled trial was performed in patients with PV during September-December 2018. Patients
      who involved in this study were allocated to SeS2 or ketoconazole 2% based on block
      randomization. Physical examinations, scale provocation test, Wood lamp and potassium
      hydroxide (KOH) examination were conducted to evaluate the treatment response and side
      effects on 7th - 14th day. Intention to treat analysis was performed in this study.
      cost-effectiveness was analyzed by Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER).
