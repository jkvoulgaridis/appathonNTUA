      This study research the similarity of coronary artery lesions according to HLA tissue
      compatibility in fisrt degree relatives of the patients who just admitted clinic as Acute
      coronary syndrome and underwent angiyography before .

      Coronary artery disease (CAD), which is mainly caused by atherosclerosis, is the most
      prevalent illness and the leading cause of death worldwide. Increasing evidence suggests that
      inflammation plays a primordial role in atherogenesis and is closely associated with the
      major histocompatibility complex (MHC) (human leukocyte antigen [HLA] in humans) molecules.
      HLA genes are located in 6p21.3, the proteins encoded by these HLA genes have a major role to
      play in antigen presentation and inflammatory pathways. HLA involvement in inflammation is
      mainly associated with the HLA-dependent activation of T cells. studies reported that the
      susceptibility to CAD is related with the polymorphisms in HLA-DRB1. The above evidence
      indicates that the polymorphisms in HLA class II are associated with the risk of CAD . This
      study research investigate three objects , firstly what is the similarity of the coronary
      artery lesions according to the compatability of HLA alleles between the first degree
      relatives who went angiography before , secondly is there any relation between HLA subtype
      allels and the coronary artery (RCA ?LAD ? ,CX? and can such a relation be responsible from
      the lesions in this artery ,finally is there any relation between HLA subtypes and turkish
      race coronary artery disease
