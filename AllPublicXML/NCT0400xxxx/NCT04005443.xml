  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this pilot study is to evaluate the ability of 68Ga-NODAGA-RGD PET
      imaging to demonstrate, in patients with unilateral AMD, a molecular therapeutic response to
      intraocular antiangiogenic injections at the end of the first phase. induction (after 3
      months of treatment).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To date, no functional imaging modality has been validated to assess the level angiogenic
      activity of choroidal neovascularization in AMD, while the therapeutic use of antiangiogenic
      agents is almost systematically in the form of intraocular injections.

      The therapeutic response is observed anatomically and functionally only after 6 months of
      treatment. Several arguments in the literature suggest that the therapeutic response occurs
      earlier at the molecular level, as soon as the induction phase is complete (after 3 months of
      treatment). The main objective of this pilot study is to evaluate the ability of
      68Ga-NODAGA-RGD PET imaging to demonstrate, in patients with unilateral AMD, a molecular
      therapeutic response to intraocular antiangiogenic injections at the end of the first phase.
      induction (after 3 months of treatment).

    <intervention_model_description>In this study, two 68Ga-NODAGA-RGD PET scans will be performed for each patient included :
The first PET will be carried out within a maximum of one month following the assessment initial ophthalmologic including OCT and measurement of visual acuity (M0);
The second PET scan will be performed at the same time as the ophthalmic assessment including OCT and measurement of visual acuity (at M4), before the 5th intraocular injection antiangiogenic.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Images from the 68Ga-NODAGA-RGD PET scan will be interpreted without results of other examinations and clinical history. Two experienced nuclear physicians unfamiliar with the results of the initial balance sheet examinations will complete a grid listing the quantification of the 68Ga-NODAGA-RGD (SUVmax) signal measured in each eye of each patient.
The signal intensity ratios of the AMD eye / contralateral eye TEP (SUVmax) signal at M0 and M4 will be compared by a comparison test of paired averages.</description>
