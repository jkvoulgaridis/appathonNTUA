  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial studies the safety and how well negative pressure wound therapy works in healing
      the abdominal incision in obese patients undergoing free flap breast reconstruction surgery.
      Using negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) instead of standard dressing (bandages) may
      improve wound healing at the surgical site in the abdomen where tissue was collected for
      breast reconstruction surgery.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the impact of negative pressure wound therapy on wound healing as measured by
      wound dehiscence rate.

      II. Long-term follow-up on wound healing complications.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients receive wound care with a standard dressing (bandage) after surgery for 7
      days.

      GROUP II: Patients receive negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) after surgery for 7 days.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 2 weeks, and at 1 and 3 months.
