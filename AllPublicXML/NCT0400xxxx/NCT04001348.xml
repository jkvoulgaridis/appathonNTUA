  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study was a randomized, single blind, uni-center pivotal study in male and female healthy
      volunteers, to determine capillary blood volume and pain perception obtained in a process of
      puncturing with different safety lancets.

      A group of one hundred (100) healthy Caucasian male and female Subjects (aged &gt; 18 to &lt; 65
      years old was randomized ) who were in good physical and mental condition. The Subjects had 4
      (four) fingers (two fingers from each hand) lanced each with a different type of safety
      lancet. Overall, 4 (four) different safety lancets were investigated per each Subject.

      Overall, 16 (sixteen) different safety lancets (4 different safety lancets per one Subject)
      were investigated, the capillary blood volume and pain were measured.

    <description>The intensity of pain perceived by the patient was assessed with the use of the numeric Visual Analog Scale (VAS). The Subject marked on the scale the number from 0 (&quot;no pain&quot;) to 10 (&quot;worst imaginable pain&quot;) that represented their perception of pain. A higher score indicated greater pain intensity.</description>
