    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the
      effect of dapagliflozin add-on intensive lifestyle intervention for remission of type 2
      diabetes in obese patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. The study consists of a 12-months
      treatment period (in which they will receive either Dapagliflozin plus intensive lifestyle
      intervention or placebo plus intensive lifestyle intervention in addition to the background
      therapy), and a 2-month follow-up period after treatment period.

    <textblock>
      Diabetes remission is an important issue which has not been well studied. Some studies showed
      that bariatric surgery and intensive lifestyle intervention could lead to remission in
      diabetic patients. Our present study aims to assess the effect of dapagliflozin add-on
      intensive lifestyle intervention on remission of type 2 diabetes in obese patients with type
      2 diabetes. This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The
      study consists of a 12-months treatment period (in which subjects will receive either
      dapagliflozin plus intensive lifestyle intervention or placebo plus intensive lifestyle
      intervention in addition to the background therapy), and a 2-month follow-up period after
      treatment period.

    <description>Participants were will be asked to follow a weight management programme, in accordance with the American Diabetes Association guidelines. Weight loss will be induced with a diet replacement phase using an energy restriction diet (energy deficit by 500~750 kcal/day) for 3 months, with &lt;35% as fat, &gt;15% as protein. The minimum energy intake is 1200kcal/day for men and 1000kcal/day for women.. Additionally, participants were encouraged to increase physical exercise (≥150 minutes of brisk walking every week or ≥10000 steps per day).</description>
