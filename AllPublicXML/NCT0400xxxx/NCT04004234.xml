  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Biliary tract cancer (BTC) is a rare heterogeneous collection of malignancies arising within
      the biliary tract, characterized by innate chemoresistance and abysmal prognosis. PD-1
      blockade has been developed to a new class of cancer immunotherapy that could restore an
      adequate immunosurveillance against the neoplasm and enhance T-cell-mediated anticancer
      immune responses. Manganese has been confirmed to activate antigen-presenting cells and
      function as mucosal immunoadjuvants in pre-clinical studies. This open-label, phase I/II
      study is designed to assess the safety and efficacy of Manganese primed combined therapy of
      anti-PD-1 antibody and gemcitabine/cisplatin chemotherapy.
