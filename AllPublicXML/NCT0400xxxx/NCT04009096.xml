  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, Phase IIa, controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) study aimed to
      assess whether the new vivax malaria vaccines ChAd63 PvDBP and MVA PvDBP can protect against
      malaria infection.

      The participants will receive two vaccinations, one dose of each vaccine, administered 8
      weeks apart.

      Approximately 4 weeks after the second vacccination, the volunteers will be challenged
      (deliberately infected) with malaria by intravenous injection blood-stage
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Volunteers will be recruited and vaccinated at the CCVTM, Oxford.

      There will be two vaccinated groups across two phases of the trial, with a total of 15
      volunteers. These will be compared to 15 infectivity controls who will be recruited as part
      of a separate study (VAC069 - NCT03797989).

      Study participants will be involved in this trial for approximately 1 year.
