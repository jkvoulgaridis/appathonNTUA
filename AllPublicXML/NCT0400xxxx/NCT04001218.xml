  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates if/how an experimentally applied neck muscle pain influences head
      repositioning error in healthy participants.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Healthy volunteers will participate in a single session study with a crossover design.

      During the study healthy participants will be randomized to either receive a injection of
      hypertonic saline (painful injection) or isotonic saline (control injection) in a neck
      muscle.

      Head repositioning accuracy will be assessed with and without performing a cognitive task.

    <time_frame>Within session (session lasts approximately 2 hours)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be blindfolded and asked asked to, from a neutral position, to move the head into full range of motion before returning to to a neutral position again. The difference between the start and end position will be used as an estimate of head repositioning error.</description>

    <measure>Change in perceived pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Within session (session lasts approximately 2 hours)</time_frame>
    <description>Pain will be scored using a scale from 0-10 with 0 being no pain and 10 being worst imaginable pain, by drawing on body charts and choosing words from the McGill Pain Questionnaire.</description>
