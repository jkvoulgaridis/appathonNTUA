    <textblock>
      This is a double-blinded randomized study to determine the effects of treatment on
      biochemical markers of bone formation and bone resorption, and bone mineral density (BMD) for
      6 months of treatment with EBP05 or placebo. Approximately 160 postmenopausal women with low
      bone mass (BMD T-score lower than or equal to -2.0 in at least one location: Lumbar Spine,
      Femoral Neck or Total Hip sites) over 50 years of age will receive Study Medication. Protocol
      Version 3.0 described the study design for the initial 103 subjects randomized. The current
      Version 4.0 describes the study design for approximately 60 additional randomized subjects.
      After completion of all screening procedures eligible subjects will come for the first visit
      and will be randomized to one of three treatment arms (EBP05 1.5 mg, 2.5 mg or placebo). A
      randomized allocation schedule will allocate 6 to EBP05 1.5 mg, 36 to 2.5 mg and 18 to
      placebo.

      The screening phase to evaluate subject eligibility may start 56 days prior to the treatment
      phase. BMD screening (DXA scan) will be performed locally on approved vendors standardized
      machines and interpreted locally. If a subject is found to be suitable, the BMD results will
      be sent for central reading. The screening DXA scan should be sent to the central reading
      vendor at least 10 days prior to scheduled potential Day 1 in order to allow timely
      turnaround of results. The site will receive unblinded results.

      A DXA BMD scan performed for medical care unrelated to the study may be used as the screening
      BMD if obtained no more than 14 days prior the start of screening and performed with the same
      scanner which was qualified for the study. If the subject is eligible for randomization, the
      DXA scan does not have to be repeated unless there is a delay in the start of Study
      Medication beyond the 28-day Screening period.

      Protocol Version 3.0 describes the randomization of the first 103 subjects. In Protocol
      version 4.0, after completion of all screening procedures eligible subjects will come for the
      first visit and will be randomized to one of three treatment arms (EBP05 1.5 mg, 2.5 mg or
      placebo). A randomized allocation schedule will allocate 6 to EBP05 1.5 mg, 36 to 2.5 mg and
      18 to placebo.

      Subjects will receive Study Medication and education on Study Medication intake.

      Subjects will visit the clinic once a month for the first three months, and at 6 months for
      the end of treatment or at any time in-between for an Early Termination Visit, if applicable.
      There will be telephone calls at Week 2, Month 4 and Month 5 for a general compliance/safety
      check. The final follow-up visit will also be conducted by phone.

      The 6-month DXA scan will be sent for central reading. Unblinded results will not be released
      to the sites prior to Data Base Lock.

      At the End of Treatment visit, concomitant medications will be reviewed, and outcome of AEs
      recorded, if applicable. The subjects must return all used Study Medication containers.
      Unused medication should also be returned, collected and accounted for.

             with Vitamin D for at least 6 months.

         37. Severe osteoporosis defined as a BMD below -3.5 or previous osteoporotic (low-energy
             trauma) fracture(s) that in the investigator's opinion preclude the use of placebo.

         38. The Investigator should exclude subjects at his own judgement, who are at very high
