      The objective of this retrospective enrollment/prospective follow up study is to collect data
      confirming safety, performance, and clinical benefits of the Biomet Cannulated Bone Screw
      System (Implants and Instrumentation) when used according to the approved Indications for Use
      (IFU).

      The objective of this retrospective enrollment/prospective follow up study is to collect data
      confirming safety, performance, and clinical benefits of the Biomet Cannulated Bone Screw
      System (Implants and Instrumentation) when used according to the approved Indications for Use
      (IFU).

      Safety will be established by recording the incidence and frequency of complications and
      adverse events. Relationship of the events to either implant or instrumentation should be
      specified.

      Performance and clinical benefits will be assessed by analyzing fracture healing/fusion and
      the overall pain and functional performance of subjects who received the Biomet Cannulated
      Bone Screws by recording survey questions. Zimmer Biomet defines the expected performance
      rate for Cannulated Screws for long and small bone fractures to be a union rate of at least
      81% at 8-12 months.

        The study populations will be a consecutive series of subjects that have received the
        Biomet Cannulated Screw. Patients will be enrolled into one of the three identified groups:
        Group 1 (3.0mm and 4.0mm), Group 2 (5.0mm), and Group 3 (6.5mm and 8.0mm).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient must be 18 years of age or older.

        All patients operated on for the following indications:

          -  Group 1, Small Cannulated Screws (4.0mm and smaller diameter) are intended for use in:
