  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immunoglobulin A vasculitis (IgA-V), formerly called Henoch-Schönlein purpura, is an immune
      vasculitis. Relapses are frequent (30%) and most of the time cutaneous (90%). Cutaneous
      involvement in adults is more severe (haemorrhagic blister or necrotic skin lesions) and more
      extensive than in children. Quality of life can be significantly altered by frequent
      cutaneous relapses. Colchicine, historically used for gout flares, is known to be an &quot; old &quot;
      low cost drug inducing very few adverse events. This molecule inhibits polymorphonuclear
      cell-chemotaxis to the site of inflammation explaining colchicine clinical efficacy in
      diseases such as Familial Mediterranean Fever or Behçet disease. Efficacy of colchicine has
      also been reported in cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis including IgA-V, but without
      clinical studies supporting this attitude.

      in cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis including IgA-V, but without clinical studies
      supporting this attitude To assess efficacy of colchicine in adult's cutaneous IgA-V, the
      investigators conduct a prospective, controlled, double blind, randomized clinical trial,
      national, multicenter and multidisciplinary (internal medicine, nephrology and dermatology):
      colchicine 1mg/day versus placebo for 6 months, with a 12 months total follow-up. The primary
      objective is to evaluate efficacy of colchicine versus placebo to prevent cutaneous relapses,
      6 months after inclusion, in adult patients with cutaneous IgA vasculitis alone or associated
      with non-severe digestive or renal involvement.
