  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this survey is to evaluate the long-term safety and effectiveness of
      vedolizumab for intravenous (IV) infusion 300 milligrams (mg) in Crohn's disease (CD)
      patients in the routine clinical setting.

      The drug being tested in this survey is called vedolizumab for IV infusion 300 mg. This drug
      is being tested to treat patients who have CD.

      This survey is an observational (non-interventional) study and will look at the long-term
      safety and effectiveness of vedolizumab for IV infusion 300 mg in the routine clinical
      setting. The planned number of observed patients will be approximately 300.

      This multi-center observational trial will be conducted in Japan.

    <description>The SIBDQ is an instrument used to assess quality of life and is a disease-specific health-related quality of life questionnaire, that consists of 10 questions, each question is scored on a scale from 1 (poor quality of life) to 7 (good quality of life). The total score will be reported and is ranging from 10 to 70 with a higher score indicates a better health-related quality of life.</description>

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available for all interventional studies after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received (or program is completely terminated), an opportunity for the primary publication of the research and final report development has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>
