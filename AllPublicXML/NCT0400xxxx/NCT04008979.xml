  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Active-control crossover study randomizing 32 healthy volunteers to receive one of two dose
      levels, 325 mg or 650 mg, of either PL-ASA or immediate release aspirin within a two week
      washout period between treatments. The primary objectives are to assess PK and PD
      bioequivalence and safety over a twenty four hour period for PL-ASA and immediate release
      aspirin at 325 mg and 650 mg dose strengths.

    <intervention_model_description>32 subjects to be randomized to treatment with either immediate release aspirin or PL-ASA at one of two doses (325 mg or 650 mg) administered orally. After completion of the first treatment and a minimum of a two week washout period(14-17 days) subjects are to cross over and receive treatment with the alternative compound at the same dose level.</intervention_model_description>
