  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a lack of knowledge among patients concerning their treatment with bDMARDs, which
      could lead to low adherence.

      The objective of this study is to assess the impact of a pharmacist's intervention on the
      adherence to bDMARDs in patients with Spondyloarthritis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an interventional, controlled, open-label and monocentric study. 80 patients are
      planned to be included.

      After written informed consent will be obtained, the patients will be randomized in two arms:

        -  Intervention arm: intervention of a pharmacist who will explain bDMARDs management.

        -  Control arm, without intervention.

      Two primary end-points are defined:

        1. the changes from baseline to M6 in the patients' knowledge score about subcutaneous
           bDMARD management

        2. the changes from baseline to M6 in Medication Possession Ratio (MPR)

      As secondary end-points, the changes in disease activity and patients' satisfaction regarding
      the pharmacists' intervention are evaluated.

    <description>MPR score comparison between the two arms after 6 month of follow up. MPR represents the number of subcutaneous bDMARDs supplied by a pharmacy divided by the number of theorical subcutaneous bDMARDs that the patient should have taken within the observation period (e.g. during the 4 months preceeding the baseline or the M6 visit), expressed in percentage.</description>
