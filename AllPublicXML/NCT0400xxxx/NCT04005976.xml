  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Montalcino Aortic Consortium (MAC) will provide the infrastructure to assemble large
      cohorts of patients with Heritable Thoracic Aortic Disease (H-TAD) with and without mutations
      in known H-TAD genes, define the phenotype associated with these genes, determine genetic and
      environmental modifiers of H-TAD, as well as rapidly and efficiently identify novel genes.

      The Montalcino Aortic Consortium (MAC) will provide the infrastructure to assemble large
      cohorts of patients with H-TAD with and without mutations in known H-TAD genes, define the
      phenotype associated with these genes, determine genetic and environmental modifiers and
      other biomarkers of H-TAD, as well as rapidly and efficiently identify novel genes.
      Recruitment of large numbers of patients world-wide will improve the precision of data used
      to predict disease risks. Retrospective and prospective study designs will be used to fully
      characterize the different stages of H-TAD (i.e. susceptibility, presymptomatic, and
      symptomatic) and other complications associated with the H-TAD genes, and examine clinical
      and environmental factors that define risk of aortic dissections. The data from MAC will
      provide the critical clinical information for precise management of thoracic aortic disease
      and other complications caused by mutations of these genes and improve the medical management
      and outcome of patients with genetically triggered, lethal vascular diseases.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients and their relatives with a confirmed pathogenic, likely pathogenic variant,
             or variant of unknown clinical significance in at least one of the H-TAD genes (i.e.
             TGFBR1, TGFBR2, SMAD3, TGFB2, TGFB3, ACTA2, MYH11, MYLK, PRKG1, MAT2A, MFAP5, LOX,
             COL3A1, FOXE3, and FBN1).

          -  Patients of all ages, sex and race for which informed consent can be obtained.

          -  Patients with H-TAD without a known mutation, i.e., individuals with thoracic aortic
             disease and similarly affected relatives or patients with the onset of disease before
             the age of 30 years.

          -  Affected and unaffected relatives of patients with H-TAD without a known mutation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  No evidence of H-TAD.
