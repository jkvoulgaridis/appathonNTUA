    <textblock>
      This is a study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Losmapimod in treating patients with
      Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy (FSHD) over 48 weeks.

      This study is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group,
      multicenter study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of losmapimod in treating
      patients with Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy (FSHD) over 48 weeks. Patients will
      participate in this study for approximately 53 weeks. This will include a 4-week screening
      period, a 48-week, placebo-controlled treatment period and a 7 day safety follow-up period.
      Patients must have a confirmed diagnosis of FSHD1 and genetic confirmation must be obtained
      prior to the screening MRI and baseline muscle biopsy. Patients will be randomized to receive
      15 mg of losmapimod or placebo twice daily given as two 7.5 mg tablets per dose by mouth; for
      a total of 4 pills or 30 mg daily for 48 weeks. All patients will be asked to attend the
      study clinic for each scheduled visit.

      The primary endpoint of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of losmapimod in inhibiting or
      reducing expression of DUX4, as measured by a subset of DUX4-regulated gene transcripts in
      skeletal muscle biopsies of FSHD patients. Secondary endpoints include evaluation of the
      safety and tolerability of losmapimod, the plasma concentrations of losmapimod, levels of
      losmapimod in skeletal muscle and losmapimod target engagement in blood and skeletal muscle
      in FSHD patients.
