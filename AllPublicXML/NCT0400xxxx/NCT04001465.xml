  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study investigates the inspiratory duty cycle in subjects with and without airway
      hyper-responsiveness both at rest and during a bronchoprovocation challenge. The primary goal
      is to determine an average inspiratory duty cycle for standard use in the calculation of
      bronchoprovocation test results.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At least fifteen subjects with airway hyper-responsiveness and fifteen without airway
      hyper-responsiveness will be recruited to participate in this randomized, crossover study.
      Subjects will complete 2 methacholine challenges at least 24 hours apart. One methacholine
      challenge will entail the volumetric method using a vibrating mesh nebulizer. The second
      methacholine challenge will be performed identically except that the nebulizer will be fitted
      onto an ultrasonic nebulizer so as to measure the inspiratory duty cycle throughout the
      bronchoprovocation challenge.
