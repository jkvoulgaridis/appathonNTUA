  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will aim to determine whether 6-weeks of using a SaeboGlove independently (with or
      without help from a carer) improves upper limb function (measured using the Action Research
      Arm Test score) in comparison to usual care alone in people with reduced active finger
      extension, severe upper limb disability and severe hand impairment after recent stroke.

      Severe arm and hand weakness causes disability and reduces quality of life after stroke.
      Recovery is best when people practice high numbers of movements based on everyday function
      such as reaching and grasping. People with severe weakness are often given treatments known
      to lack benefit and are frequently excluded from arm rehabilitation trials. This is because
      they don't have enough movement and often can't open their hand enough to carry out
      functional based therapy. This will be limiting recovery for those who need it most.

      A clinical trial is proposed of a new rehabilitation device called a SaeboGlove. It is worn
      on the weak hand to assist the hand to open. It can help people to grasp and release objects
      such as cutlery, clothes or a hairbrush during everyday activities, even when weakness is
      severe. This means it may enable people with severe weakness to practice beneficial movements
      based on everyday functional tasks and may increase their chance of a better recovery.

      In this study people with severe hand and arm weakness early after stroke will receive
      6-weeks of usual National Health Service (NHS) care or 6-weeks of usual NHS care with
      additional self-directed SaeboGlove therapy. Carers or hospital staff can help participants
      receiving SaeboGlove therapy. Participants who do not receive SaeboGlove therapy initially
      will be offered it after the trial ends.

      This study will assess hand and arm movement and function, and quality of life at the start
      of the study, and 6-weeks and 14-week later. Participant, carer and clinician views and
      additional costs of SaeboGlove therapy will be assessed.

      A SaeboGlove therapy resource that stroke survivors could use independently after discharge
      from NHS stroke services will also be created.

    <description>Change in Barthel Index (BI) score: measures performance in activities of daily living, includes 10 items of activities of daily living (feeding, bathing, grooming, dressing, bowel control, bladder control, toileting, chair transfer, ambulation and stair climbing). Items are rated in terms of whether individuals can perform activities independently, with some assistance, or are dependent. Scores for each item vary between 0-1, 0-2 or 0-3 with the overall score ranging from 0-20 and the highest number being the best performance</description>

    <description>Change in score on Stroke Impact Scale (SIS) (version 3.0): measures quality of life after stroke. It includes 59 items and assesses 8 domains (strength, hand function, ADL/IADL, mobility, communication, emotion, memory and thinking, and participation/role function). The SIS uses a 5-point Likert Scale. Summative scores for each domain range from 0-100. Total scores range from 0 to 800. A higher score reflects better function.</description>

Each dimension has five response levels (1-5, with 1 being the best outcome); and the responses to 5 dimensions can be combined to provide a 5 digit profile describing the respondent's health state with a single index value. An EQ-5D-5L index score of 1 represents full health.</description>
