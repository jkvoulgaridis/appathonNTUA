  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical activity and exercise have traditionally not been much of a focus in treatment of
      postconcussion symptoms and posttraumatic headache. On the contrary, patients have often got
      advice to rest until they were free from symptoms. This approach, however, is challenged, and
      complete rest should probably be discouraged after the first 24-72 hours. Moderate aerobic
      exercise has been found promising in the early phase after sports-related concussion, and in
      the treatment of patients with headache. This study is an open pilot-study of guided,
      home-based exercise in a clinical sample with postconcussion symptoms and posttraumatic
      headache after mixed-mechanism mild traumatic brain injury and minimal head injuries. The
      study will result in data about the feasibility and possible effects of exercise as treatment
      for prolonged postconcussion symptoms and posttraumatic headache.
