  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the accuracy of an investigational, non-invasive device for measuring
      heart rate and respiratory rate. The device emits radiowaves that allows it to pick up subtle
      changes in a person's chest wall, which allows it to calculate the heart rate and respiratory
      rate. We propose to study whether the device's measurements are accurate and reproducible in
      patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma. The device undergoing
      study has been evaluated in healthy volunteers, but its accuracy in vital sign monitoring in
      patients with respiratory conditions has not yet been established. This study will serve as
      the foundation for additional work to assess the device's accuracy in measuring a patient's
      overall &quot;work of breathing&quot; or respiratory effort. Future work will examine the device's
      accuracy in measuring work of breathing in patients having an exacerbation of their
      underlying respiratory condition.

      The primary aim of this study will be to assess the validity of heart rate and respiratory
      rate measurements in patients with either COPD or asthma.

    <description>Once consented for the study, participants will undergo testing with the investigational device for a one hour period. Testing will entail the participant wearing an EKG monitor, a respiratory rate monitor, a pulse oximeter, and being positioned next to the investigational device. The investigational device is contactless and captures chest movement of participants which allows it to estimate real time heart rate and respiratory rate. Additional data collected with the EKG monitor, respiratory rate monitor, and the pulse oximeter will be used to validate the vital sign data collected by the investigational device. After data collection is complete, participant involvement will then be over. Participants will have the option to return on a later date for additional testing (up to a maximum of three sessions total), within the six month window of the study. Participants will continue their standard of care therapies for their respiratory condition.</description>

Upon enrollment each participant will be assigned a unique study number. Any study data collected will be linked to the patient solely through the study number. The document that contains the patient information and their study numbers will by kept on Stanford RedCap and will only be accessible by the study PI and the faculty sponsor. De-identified data of vital sign measurements will be shared between the Stanford research team and industry collaborators. Data will be downloaded to an encrypted USB key and hand-delivered between members of the research team.
