  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given the lack of scientific data on the effect of the antiseptic application technique on
      reducing the number of microorganisms present during application, this pilot study will
      provide data on the initial level of microorganisms in this population of healthy volunteers
      and on the difference before and after antiseptic application according to both techniques.
      These data will be useful to then calculate the study size suitable for a formal comparative
      study.

      During their care, many patients benefit from invasive procedures. These treatments involve a
      break-in of the healthy skin which, without the application of preventive measures, can be at
      the origin of an infection starting from the micro-organisms present on the skin.

      Cutaneous antisepsis, which objective is to reduce or even eliminate commensal and transient
      flora microorganisms, is an essential preventive measure during an invasive act on healthy
      skin. The choice of antiseptic most suitable in this context has been the subject of numerous
      publications and recommendations (including: French Society of Hospital Hygiene - SF2H-
      2016). But there is no consensus on application technique.

      In France, there is two application techniques : the &quot;snail&quot; and the &quot;back and forth&quot;
      techniques. These two techniques have never been compared in clinical trials. This study will
      bring preliminary evidence on empirical practices, in order to complement the recommendations
      of good antiseptic practices and ultimately reduce infections.

      This brings us to the following question: what are the effects of the application of an
      alcoholic antiseptic by &quot;back and forth&quot; and &quot;snail&quot; techniques on healthy skin? We'll
      conduced a monocentric non-comparative, randomized, matched pilot study, to provide data on
      the initial level of microorganisms in this population of healthy volunteers and on the
      difference before and after antiseptic application according to both techniques. These data
      will be useful to then calculate the study size suitable for a formal comparative study
      between application techniques.
