      Background: Post stroke Scapular dyskinesia leads to scapulohumeral pain &amp; dysfunction were
      associated with decreased motor function, somatosensory function, limited range of motion,
      and spasticity.

      Objective: to investigate the effect of Scapular dyskinesia on the scapular balance angle &amp;
      upper extremity Sensorimotor Function in spastic stroke patient.

      Methods: sixty patients from both sexes were participated in this study. All the patients
      were diagnosed as spastic stroke patients. The patients were divided into two equal groups;
      group A (30 patients): with high scapular dyskinesia scores, group B (30 patients): with low
      or no scapular dyskinesia scores. The patients were diagnosed with the Lateral scapular slide
      test using Palpation meter (PALM) device, Fugl-Meyer upper extremity (FMUE) Scale scores &amp;
      scapular balance angle test (SBA).

    <description>for the measurement of scapular dyskinesia, the Lateral scapular slide test using Palpation meter (PALM) device,
marked inferior angles of scapula and the other arm was moved to reach the marked corresponding spinous process Both sides' readings were recorded and the differences between them were calculated
Bilateral difference of 1.5 cm considered the threshold for deciding whether scapular asymmetry is abnormal A distance 1.5 cm greater than the contralateral side in any position suggests scapulothoracic weakness with secondary scapulothoracic protraction</description>

    <measure>Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) scale</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Fugl-Meyer upper extremity (FMUE) Scale scores is an index to assess the sensorimotor impairment in individuals who had stroke.
The motor section score ranges from 0 to 66, and the score related to exteroceptive and proprioceptive sensitivity ranges from 0 to 12. The lowest and highest scores correspond to worse and better function, respectively FMUE Scale scores &lt; 31 corresponded with 'no to poor' upper extremity capacity, while 32 to 47 represented 'limited capacity', 48 to 52 represented 'notable capacity' and 53 to 66 represented 'full' upper extremity capacity</description>

    <description>for Measurement of scapular balance angle
The inferior angle of the scapula was marked bilaterally and a line was drawn connecting these marks. Another vertical line between C7 and T10 spinous processes was drawn. The angles formed by the line joining both inferior angles of the scapula with the vertical line running through the spine were measured (The difference between these two angles corresponded to the scapular balance angle The values for the SBA in healthy population were 2.505±2.340° while the abnormality criteria were with an angle greater than 7.185°</description>
