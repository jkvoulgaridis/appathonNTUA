    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well topical afimoxifene works in treating patients with
      breast cancer who have undergone radiation therapy on one breast. Topical afimoxifene is a
      quick-drying medicated gel that may block the growth of breast cancer cells when applied to
      the breast skin. The purpose of this research is to determine what effect, if any,
      differences in skin type between women have on the delivery of topical afimoxifene to the
      breast tissue, and whether radiation affects the delivery of topical afimoxifene to breast
      tissue.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To identify the skin features that drive inter-individual variation in dermal drug
      permeation between individuals.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To relate breast tissue drug concentration to skin histology, skin vascularity, skin
      transporter proteins, and skin features measured using confocal reflectance microscopy.

      II. To assess the feasibility of transdermal drug delivery to the radiated breast.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients apply afimoxifene gel topically once daily (QD) to both breasts for 4 weeks and then
      undergo core needle biopsies of both breasts.

      Patients receive follow up phone call 21-35 days after biopsy.

    <time_frame>Up to 35 days post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Tissue drug concentrations will be compared between radiated and non-radiated breasts using a mixed linear model, with breast radiation status as a fixed effect of interest and person as a random effect. Analyses will also be done to compare the skin data (histology, immunohistochemistry [IHC], protein expression, CRS) between radiated and non-radiated breasts.

             breast carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or invasive cancer (&gt;= 12 weeks after the end of RT),
             and have an intact unradiated (non-RT) breast.

               -  Note: The upper limit for interval since RT will be 5 years, since oral endocrine
                  therapy (OET) for DCIS is usually administered during the 5 years that follow the
                  end of RT.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt; 1 (Karnofsky &gt;= 70%).

             drugs (NSAIDs).

          -  A prior history of malignancy is allowed, as long as the patient is considered to have
             ?no evaluable disease? and cancer treatment has been completed.

          -  Females of child-bearing potential (FOCBP) and male partners of female participants
             must agree to use TWO effective forms of birth control (abstinence is not an allowed
             method) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation, and for two
             months following the last dose of study medications. Effective birth control methods
             are: copper IUD (intrauterine device), diaphragm/cervical cap/shield, spermicide,
             contraceptive sponge, condoms. Should a female patient become pregnant or suspect she
             is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating
             physician immediately.

               -  NOTE: A FOCBP is any woman (regardless of sexual orientation, having undergone a
                  tubal ligation, or remaining celibate by choice) who meets the following
                  criteria:

                    -  Has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy

                    -  Has had menses at any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months (and
                       therefore has not been naturally postmenopausal for &gt; 12 months).

          -  FOCBP must have a negative urine pregnancy test within 7 days prior to registration on
             study.

          -  Willingness to avoid exposing breast skin to natural or artificial sunlight (i.e.
             tanning beds) for the duration of the study drug use.

          -  Patients must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written
             informed consent prior to registration on study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients receiving any other investigational agents within 30 days of registration are
             not eligible.

          -  Patients currently using oral selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMS)
             (tamoxifen, raloxifene, bazedoxifene) are not eligible.

               -  Note: Prior or current endocrine therapy other than SERMs are allowed.

          -  Patients who have a history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar
             chemical or biologic composition afimoxifene (4-OHT) are not eligible.

               -  Ongoing or active infection requiring systemic treatment

               -  Symptomatic congestive heart failure

               -  Unstable angina pectoris

               -  Cardiac arrhythmia
