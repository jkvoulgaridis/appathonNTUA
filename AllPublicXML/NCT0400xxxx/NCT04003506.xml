  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to population ageing, osteoarthritis of knees and hips become major orthopaedic problems
      in Hong Kong. Osteoarthritis of knees and hips are associated with significant pain problems
      and functional disability. Total joint replacement is the ultimate surgical procedure to deal
      with these problems.

      However, total joint replacement is associated with significant tissue damage and
      post-operative pain problems, which would affect post-operative recovery and rehabilitation.

      The primary aims of total knee replacement are improvement in functional activities and
      reducing pain due to degenerated knee joints. However, there are around 20-30% of patients
      who would develop significant pain problems after undergoing uncomplicated total knee
      replacement. It accounts for major post-operative problems and burdens.

      Procedure-specific analgesic method with multi-model analgesia technique is well-known to be
      useful in post-operative pain management, which reduces the post-operative pain score.
      Despite the use of multi-modal analgesic technique, pain after total joint replacement
      remains unsolved. It prolongs the recovery period and increases post-operative analgesic
      consumption.

      Multimodal analgesia which includes periarticular local infiltration of analgesia (LIA),
      regional nerve block, opioid and non-opioid have been shown to be effective in managing
      postoperative pain.

      Periarticular LIA has been shown to be an effective way of pain management. Regional nerve
      block using femoral nerve block or adductor canal block (ACB) is also a well-established
      anlagesic technique for total knee replacement. Compared with femoral nerve block, it
      involves more sensory blockade. Hence, it has the advantage of quadriceps sparing. Moreover,
      post-operative mobilization is less affected.

      Recent meta-analysis and systemic review suggests that periarticular LIA is associated with
      better pain control and reduced opioid consumption compared to using ACB alone. However,
      duration of action and efficacy of a single-dose LIA may not be sufficient for total knee
      replacement. Whether the combination use of ACB and periarticular LIA has additional benefit
      of prolonging analgesia or comes with synergistic effect remains controversial. Although
      recent meta analysis has shown that combined ACB with LIA could significantly reduce pain
      score and morphine consumption compared with LIA alone after TKA, only 7 RCTS were involved
      in this analysis. It is essential to have more RCTs to further evaluate the usefulness of
      combining both LIA and ACB.

      Plain bupivacaine or ropivocaine were used in ACB in all previous studies. They are local
      anaesthetics with half-life ranging from 3-6 hours. With the availability of liposomal
      bupivacaine, analgesic effect of ACB may be prolonged. It is because the therapeutic level of
      bupivacaine is below the toxic range and sustained for 72 hours after injection. Only one
      study evaluated the effect of adductor canal block using liposomal bupivacaine. However, it
      was a retrospectively study which compared ACB using liposomal bupivacaine and 0.1 %
      Ropivociane infusion. It didn't evaluate the efficacy of combining ACB using LB and
      periarticular LIA.

      The primary aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of combining periarticular local
      infiltration of analgesia and adductor canal block using liposomal bupivacaine
