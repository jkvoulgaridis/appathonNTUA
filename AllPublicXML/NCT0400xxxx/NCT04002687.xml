  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to determine the tolerability and safety of ATV-PG + AQ, ATV-PG + AQ
      placebo, ATV-PG placebo + AQ, and ATV-PG placebo + AQ placebo administered once daily for 3
      days to healthy adult male and female subjects.This study in healthy adults is the first step
      towards establishing the tolerability and safety of the approved doses of ATV-PG and AQ when
      co-administered. If considered acceptable based on the findings of this study, the
      tolerability, safety and PE will subsequently be assessed, within the target geographical
      areas.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although the tolerability and safety of ATV-PG and AQ alone are well established, additive
      tolerability signals are possible on co-administration. Four treatment arms will be used:
      ATV-PG + AQ placebo, ATV-PG placebo + AQ, ATV-PG placebo + AQ placebo, as well as ATV-PG +
      AQ. This will facilitate discrimination of the contribution of the treatments to any
      tolerability signal. In the event that ATV-PG + AQ is not considered sufficiently well
      tolerated, data on the individual agents will provide an indication of whether ATV-PG or AQ
      are suitable partner drugs for other combinations.

      Thus, this study will evaluate in healthy adults, whether the tolerability and safety profile
      of once daily administration of ATV-PG + AQ for 3 days supports future use in Seasonal
      Malaria Chemoprevention (SMC), which will entail administration on a monthly basis to an
      apparently healthy population of children of 3 months of age and older, for the duration of
      the malaria season.

      This study will also determine the pharmacokinetics of ATV, PG, CG (active metabolite of PG),
      AQ and DEAQ (active metabolite of AQ).

      Given the ultimate target population (children in Southern and Easter Africa in areas in
      which SMC with SPAQ is not currently deployed due to SP resistance), the study will be
      carried out in healthy subjects of sub-Saharan African origin (defined as subjects whose
      parents were both born in sub-Saharan Africa).

    <masking_description>This study will be conducted in a double-blind fashion whereby subjects and clinical study site staff are blinded. Because the placebo tablets are not an exact match for the active treatment, tablets will be administered by an un-blinded member of clinical study staff, who will protect the blinding from both subjects and all other site staff. Dosing will take place behind a curtain and during IMP administration the subjects will be blindfolded. The pharmacy staff preparing the investigational products will not be blinded to study drug assignment. During the study, the individual randomisation codes will be kept in the site's clinical trials pharmacy, accessible to the pharmacy personnel only. Upon completion of the study, after the database lock and after the blind is revealed, the randomisation list will be filed in the Trial Master File. Sponsor staff involved in clinical decision-making (such as those involved in SRC decisions) will be blinded to study drug assignment.</masking_description>

        aged ≥18 to ≤45 years at the date of signing informed consent which is defined as the
        beginning of the Screening Period.

        2. Female subjects of childbearing potential and male subjects with female partners of
        childbearing potential must be willing to follow the following contraception requirements.
        Contraception must start one complete menstrual cycle prior to the first day of dosing and
        continue until at least 90 days after the end of the systemic exposure of the study drug
        (90 days after the last study drug administration).

        Female subjects who are documented as being of non-childbearing potential are exempt from
        contraception requirements. Documentation of non-childbearing potential must include at
        least one of the following criteria:

          -  Postmenopausal - evidence of menopause based on a combination of amenorrhea for at
             least one year and increased serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level (&gt; 30

        All female subjects of childbearing potential and all male subjects with female partnersof
        childbearing potential, who are pregnant or breastfeeding must practice highly effective or
        acceptable methods of contraception (defined below) when having heterosexual intercourse.

        Sexual abstinence, defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire
        period of risk associated with the study drug treatment can be considered a highly
        effective method of contraception for female and male subjects. Reliability of sexual
        abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical study and the
        preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject.

        Contraception methods for female subjects in this study:

          -  Hormonal contraception:

               -  Combined i.e. oestrogen- and progestogen-containing (oral, intravaginal or
                  transdermal)

               -  Progestogen-only (oral, injectable or implantable)

               -  Intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS)

                  27. Subjects have veins unsuitable for intravenous puncture or cannulation on
                  either arm (e.g. veins that are difficult to locate access or puncture veins with
                  a tendency to rupture during or after puncture).

                  28. Prior screen failure (where the cause of the screen failure is not deemed to
                  be temporary), randomisation, participation, or enrolment in this study. Subjects
                  who initially failed due to temporary non-medically significant issues are
                  eligible for rescreening once the cause has resolved.
