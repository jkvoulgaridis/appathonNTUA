  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Limited utilizations of date seeds have previously been explored, and so previously wastage
      has often been the normality. However, research now indicates that several fruit seeds
      contain higher concentrations of beneficial total phytochemicals within their seeds in
      comparison to the flesh. As well as high nutritional values of date seeds for fibre, protein
      and micronutrients, this increased phytochemical content has been proven to be true for date
      seeds, with mainly phenolic acids (24.6 g k GAE) 3 and total flavonoids (3.67 g k RE). With
      the seeds presently being used to produce new coffee products, it raises questions on whether
      consumption of date seeds can alter mood and cognitive behaviour and therefore research into
      investigate the acute effect of date seeds coffee on mood and cognitive function on healthy
      young volunteers. However, to the best of the research team knowledge, this is the first
      human trial to investigate these effects.

      Introduction

      Seeds of the date palm (P. dactylifera) are a very rich source of bioactive compounds, thus
      constituting strong candidates for functional food additives and nutraceuticals. Many
      promising results were observed when the effect of date flesh and seeds consumption have been
      studied in animals, for their role as either a protective1 against neurodegenerative 2,4,5
      diseases, or as a cure for it 2. Most of the observed effects were attributed to the
      antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties in dates flesh and seeds fruit due to it high
      content of phenolic compounds 3.

      Rational For years, date seeds were considered a waste, having no other uses except for
      feeding animals. However, as has already been demonstrated in other fruits and corresponding
      seeds, total phytochemical content of the date seeds was higher than in the edible flesh9.
      Date seeds have also been shown to have an excellent nutritional quality due to high amounts
      of fibre (676-742 g/kg) 3 depending on variety, considerable amounts of minerals, vitamins,
      lipids and protein. Additionally, date seeds were shown to be rich in antioxidants containing
      mainly phenolic acids (24.6 g k Gallic Acid equivalent) 3 and total flavonoids (3.67 g k
      Rutin Equivalent).

      Nowadays, and on sight of the aforementioned findings, date seeds are used to make a new
      coffee product. This ''coffee alternative'' is commercially available and is becoming more
      popular.

      Although, many studies have demonstrated that date seeds possess high antioxidant activities,
      due to their high content of flavonoids and phenolic compounds, no human trial has
      investigated the effect of the consumption of date seeds on humans and especially on mood and
      cognitive behaviour. Therefore, this study, for the first time, to the best of the research
      team knowledge will investigate the acute effect of date seeds coffee on mood and cognitive
      function on healthy young volunteers.

      Aim The aim of this study is to investigate the acute effects of a coffee made of date seeds
      on mood and cognitive performance.
