  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incentive spirometer (IS) is a mechanical device that helps lung expansion. It is
      commonly used to prevent postoperative lung atelectasis and decreased pulmonary complications
      in patients who received cardiac, lung, or abdomen surgery.This study aimed to explore the
      effect of the IS on the improvement of lung function and decrease in pulmonary complication
      rate in rib fractures patients.

      Adult patients (&gt;18 years old) seen at our institution between June, 2014 until May, 2017
      with traumatic rib fractures were included. For inclusion, a patient had to have at least one
      rib fracture as detected by chest X-ray (CXR) or computed tomography scan. We excluded
      patients with unconsciousness, history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, or
      an Injury Severity Score (ISS) ≥ 16. Patients were divided into two groups using a randomized
      envelope technique: in the study group, patients were advised to use the IS and in the
      control group patients did not received the IS. All patients were managed with the same oral
      analgesic protocol. A CXR was obtained on the 1st and 5th day of admission and performed by a
      radiologist. The Pulmonary Function Test (PFT) was administered on the 2nd and 7th day of
      admission and performed by a pulmonologist. A numeric rating scale (NRS) was used to define
      the severity of chest pain on the 1st and 5th day of admission.
