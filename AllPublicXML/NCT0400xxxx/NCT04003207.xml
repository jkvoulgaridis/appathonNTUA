  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phelan McDermid syndrome (PMS) is a rare genetic form of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) due
      to deletions or mutations in the SHANK3 gene. This is a pilot open labeled trial of growth
      hormone therapy in children with PMS targeting social withdrawal and repetitive behavior.
      This research study will include children with PMS between 2-12 years of age who will receive
      growth hormone daily for 12 weeks, if found to be eligible. The aim of this study is to
      evaluate the effect of growth hormone on behavioral outcomes such as the aberrant behavior
      checklist social withdrawal subscale (ABC-SW) and repetitive behavior scale- revised (RBS-R).
      The effects of growth hormone on visual evoked potentials will also be assessed. Growth
      hormone increases insulin like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels and a previous trial of IGF-1
      therapy in PMS children showed improvement in these behavioral scales. Growth hormone has
      been studied for decades with an excellent safety profile and fewer adverse effects compared
      to IGF-1 therapy in other conditions. Hence, this may be a viable therapeutic option. There
      is no treatment currently available for PMS and this trial is therefore extremely important.

      BACKGROUND: Phelan-McDermid syndrome (PMS) is a genetic form of autism spectrum disorder
      (ASD) associated with developmental delay and hypotonia. IGF-1 promotes brain vessel growth,
      neurogenesis, and synaptogenesis.

      The research team previous clinical trial of IGF-1 in patients with Phelan McDermid Syndrome
      has shown improvement in core ASD symptoms using the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) and
      the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R). Growth hormone (GH) binds to its receptor and
      initiates a cascade of events which directly increases synthesis and release of IGF-1 levels.
      HYPOTHESIS: The study team hypothesize that rise in IGF-1 stimulated by growth hormone (GH)
      administration should produce improvement in behavior in children and adolescents with PMS as
      previously demonstrated with use of IGF-1.

      RESEARCH PLAN: The study team seek to recruit 10 patients with PMS and administer growth
      hormone as once daily subcutaneous injections for 12 weeks at standard doses. The study team
      will monitor baseline anthropometric measures, laboratory parameters for growth, IGF-1
      levels, and bone age prior to therapy and continue to monitor safety laboratory parameters
      during and after therapy. The goal of therapy would be to maintain IGF-1 levels between 1-2SD
      above the mean for age and puberty. Evaluations will include validated behavioral scales.
      Visual evoked potentials (VEPs) will be used as biomarkers of visual sensory reactivity.

    <measure>ABC - Social Withdrawal subscale</measure>
    <time_frame>After 12 weeks of growth hormone therapy</time_frame>
    <description>A caregiver report symptom checklist. 58-item instrument into 5 subscales: Irritability (score 0-45); Lethargy/Social Withdrawal (score 0-48); Stereotypic Behavior (score 0-21); Hyperactivity (score 0-48); Inappropriate Speech (score 0-12). Total scale 0-174, with higher score indicating more aberrant behavior.</description>

    <measure>Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R)</measure>
    <time_frame>After 12 weeks of growth hormone therapy</time_frame>
    <description>A 43 item instrument with total score from 0-129, with higher score indicating more restricted, repetitive and stereotyped behaviors.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The Sensory Profile</measure>
    <time_frame>After 12 weeks of growth hormone therapy</time_frame>
    <description>The full Sensory Profile has 125 items and the short version contains 38 items. Irritability; Lethargy/Social Withdrawal; Stereotypic Behavior; Hyperactivity; Inappropriate Speech. Parents use a Likert scale to rate how frequently their child demonstrates a particular behavior (ranging from 1 = always to 5 = never). Total scale for the Short Sensory Profile 38-190, with a lower score indicates greater deviation from typically developing children and indicates more sensory reactivity symptoms.</description>

    <measure>The Sensory Assessment for Neurodevelopmental Disorders (SAND)</measure>
    <time_frame>After 12 weeks of growth hormone therapy</time_frame>
    <description>a clinician-administered assessment and corresponding caregiver interview that is not dependent on verbal or cognitive ability and is therefore appropriate for severely affected or nonverbal individuals with PMS. Responses are rated by a trained examiner on an algorithm. Scores are dichotomous, 0 (not present) or 1 (present) and are based on a summary of observed sensory behaviors throughout the duration of the observation. A total SAND score ranging from 0 to 90. Higher scores represent a higher level of sensory reactivity symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual evoked potentials (VEP)</measure>
    <time_frame>After 12 weeks of growth hormone therapy</time_frame>
    <description>A noninvasive technique to evaluate the functional integrity of visual pathways in the brain from the retina to the visual cortex via the optic nerve/optic radiations. The VEP is recorded from the head's surface, over the visual cortex, and is extracted from ongoing EEG through signal averaging. VEPs reflect the sum of excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials occurring on apical dendrites (Zemon et al., 1986) which modulate excitatory and inhibitory signals received by the pyramidal cells.</description>

    <measure>Change in Auditory event related potentials (AERP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks of growth hormone therapy</time_frame>
    <description>AERP is useful for characterizing early processing of auditory tones and habituation to rapidly repeated stimuli as in speech processing. AERP amplitudes are measured at 12 weeks and compared to baseline.</description>
