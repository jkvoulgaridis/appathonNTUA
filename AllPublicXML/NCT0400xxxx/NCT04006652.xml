  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Finding a donor remains a challenge for patients in need of an urgent hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation (HSCT). The ability to obtain half matched stem cells from any family member
      represents a significant breakthrough in the field. Haploidentical haplo-HSCT is
      characterized by the nearly uniform and immediate availability of a donor and the
      availability of the donor for post-transplant cellular immunotherapy. However, haplo-HSCT has
      a high risk of Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD) and poor immune reconstitution when GvHD is
      prevented by all existing methods of vigorous ex vivo or in vivo T-cell depletion. Different
      treatment approaches are currently being explored to mitigate complications such as graft
      rejection, severe GvHD, and prolonged immune suppression. Novel experimental utilization of T
      regulatory cells, alloreactive natural killer (NK) cells, and other T cell subsets hold great
      promise. Cellect Biotherapeutics' platform technology, ApoGraft, is based on the findings
      that GvHD can be prevented by Fas receptor mediated selective depletion of T cell subsets, ex
      vivo. The investigators hypothesize that the use of ApoGrafts for haplo-HSCT will be safe,
      and reduce rates of GVHD without affecting Graft-versus-Leukemia (GvL).
