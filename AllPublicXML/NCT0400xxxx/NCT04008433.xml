  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Propofol is widely used in general anesthesia induction, but the occurrence of peripheral
      intravenous pain is relatively high, causing anxiety, fear and other adverse emotions in
      patients , aggravating the stress response, and even leading to adverse events of
      cardiovascular system . The use of mediate-long chain fat emulsion propofol partly reduces
      the incidence of injection pain but patients can still suffer from different degrees of pain.
      Advanced intravenous injection of lidocaine can alleviate the pain of propofol injection, but
      its application method and dose are controversial. It is worthy of further discussion on how
      to select the appropriate dose of advanced intravenous injection of lidocaine to effectively
      prevent the injection pain of mediate-long chain fat emulsion propofol, and simultaneously
      avoid the adverse reactions of intravenous lidocaine, thus improving patient satisfaction and
      perioperative safety. In this study, in order to provide clinical references, sequential
      method was used to find the median effective dose (ED50) by means of pre-intravenous
      injection of lidocaine to suppress pain in mediate-long chain fat emulsion propofol
      injection.

    <description>The intravenous injection pain in this study was divided into the following 5 levels according to its severity: level 0: After repeated questioning, the patient did not feel any abnormal sensation; level 1: upon inquiry, the patient felt swelling at the intravenous injection site; Level 2: Upon inquiry, the patient felt pain and had no body movement reaction (facial pain expression, arm withdrawal, tears, etc.); Level 3: Upon inquiry, the patient had pain and body movement reaction. Or complain of pain without inquiry; Level 4: the patient has a strong reaction and body movement reaction. Level 2 and above is defined as injection pain.</description>

    <description>The initial dose of lidocaine for pre-injection was set at 0.5mg /kg according to previous literature and preliminary test results. The dose of lidocaine was according to the patients' pain level. If there is no pain (negative reaction), the dose of lidocaine in the next patient will be reduced until the patient has pain. If there is pain (positive reaction), the dose of lidocaine will be increased in the next patient until the patient is painless.</description>
