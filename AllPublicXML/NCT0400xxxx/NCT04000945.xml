      This study will evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of the BTL-899 device for
      non-invasive lipolysis and circumference reduction of abdomen. The study is a prospective
      single-blinded two-arms study. The subjects will be enrolled and assigned into a two study
      groups. All subjects will complete three (3) treatment visits and will be invited to four (4)
      follow-up visits 1, 2, 3 and 6-months after the final treatment. 6-months follow-up visit is
      the optional one.
