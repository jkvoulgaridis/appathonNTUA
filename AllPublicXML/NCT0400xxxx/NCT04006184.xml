  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a retrospective, chart review of treatment of patients with symptomatic
      varicose veins. Treated limbs must have the Great Saphenous Vein and/or Small Saphenous Vein
      treated with either cyanoacrylate closure (VenaSeal) or Endothermal Ablation (either
      Radiofrequency Ablation or Endovenous Laser Ablation).

      This single site, retrospective, comparison study aims to review up to 400 treated limbs with
      symptomatic varicose veins to compare the need for/utilization of adjunctive phlebectomy
      performed as a concomitant or staged procedure in conjunction with either cyanoacrylate
      closure versus endothermal ablation of incompetent saphenous veins through 6 months of the
      index procedure. The overall cost of treatment for both groups will be compared.

      Some of the secondary aims of this study include:

        1. To assess changes in Clinical, Etiology, Anatomy, and Pathology (CEAP) clinical class
           after completion of treatment.

        2. To assess changes in revised Venous Clinical Severity Score (rVCSS) and compare the two
           groups.

        3. To assess the need for adjunctive therapies.

        4. To record and compare retrospectively the adverse events between the two groups.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Limb with saphenous vein incompetence, treated with one of the following:

             VenaSeal â„¢ Endovenous Laser Ablation Radiofrequency Ablation

          2. CEAP Clinical Class between 2-5

          3. Limb treated from October 1st, 2015-present

          4. At least 2 months of follow-up post index procedure

          5. Treatment of either the great saphenous vein (GSV), the small saphenous vein (SSV), or
             both. Treatment of accessory saphenous veins (ASV) is allowed as long as either the
             GSV, SSV, or both the GSV and SSV were treated as well in that limb at the index
             procedure.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Limb treatment of the accessory saphenous vein (ASV) without concomitant great
             saphenous vein (GSV) and/or small saphenous vein (SSV) treatment

          2. Limb treatment for reasons other than symptomatic varicose veins

          3. Limbs without follow-up information at least 2 months following the index procedure

          4. Subjects who participated in another clinical trial as part of their saphenous vein
             treatment

          5. Investigator decision (concurrent condition that would make inclusion inappropriate,
             protected subject population) -
