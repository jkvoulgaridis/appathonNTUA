  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for women in menopause with hot flashes. Menopause, a normal part of aging, is
      the time of a woman's last period. Hot flashes can interrupt a woman's daily life.

      The purpose of this study is to find out how safe it is for these women to take fezolinetant
      long term (up to 52 weeks). To do that, the study will look at the number and severity of the
      &quot;adverse events.&quot; Those are the side effects that study participants have while they are in
      the study.

      The study treatments are fezolinetant low dose (1 tablet of fezolinetant and 1 placebo
      tablet) once a day, fezolinetant high dose (2 tablets of fezolinetant) once a day or placebo
      (2 tablets) once a day. (Placebo is a dummy treatment that looks like medicine but does not
      have any medicine in it.) Women in this study will be picked for 1 of the 3 study treatments
      by chance alone. The study participants will take study treatment for 52 weeks.

      This study is &quot;double-blinded.&quot; That means that the study participants and the study doctors
      do not know who takes which of the study treatments (fezolinetant low dose, fezolinetant high
      dose or placebo).

      At weeks 2 and 4 and then once a month, the study participants will go the hospital or clinic
      for a check-up. They will be asked about medications, side effects and how they feel. Other
      checks will include physical exam and vital signs (heart rate, temperature and blood
      pressure). Blood and urine will be collected for laboratory tests. At some study visits,
      study participants will complete questionnaires that are about their quality of life. At the
      first and last study visits, they will have a dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA for
      short) test done. To measure bone loss in the hips and spine, DXA creates pictures of the
      inside of these areas with low-dose x-rays. (The dose is approximately one-tenth of the
      amount of a normal chest x-ray.) Study participants who still have their uterus will have 2
      more tests done at the first and last study visits. One of the 2 tests is endometrial biopsy.
      This test involves removing a small amount of tissue from the inside lining of the uterus.
      The tissue is then checked under a microscope. The other test is transvaginal ultrasound. It
      uses sound waves to create pictures of the organs in the pelvis. The sound waves are
      transmitted by a probe (transducer), which is placed inside the vagina. Study participants
      may have a screening mammogram done at the first and/or last study visit. A mammogram is an
      x-ray picture of the breasts used to screen for breast cancer. Study participants who did not
      have this test done in the last 12 months will have it done at the first study visit. They
      will have it done at the last study visit if they are due for their screening mammogram and
      their own doctor agrees.

      The last check-up at the hospital or clinic will be 3 weeks after the last dose of study
      treatment.

             normal. Patients with mildly elevated ALP (up to 1.5 x ULN) can be enrolled if
             cholestatic liver disease is excluded and no cause other than fatty liver is
             diagnosed. Patients with Gilbert's syndrome with elevated total bilirubin may be
             enrolled as long as direct bilirubin, hemoglobin and reticulocytes are normal.

             Rating Scale [C-SSRS]), or who is at significant risk to commit suicide, as assessed

             in an interventional study within 28 days prior to screening, or received any
             investigational drug within 28 days or within 5 half-lives prior to screening,
             whichever is longer.

          -  Subject is unable or unwilling to complete the study procedures.

          -  Subject has any condition which makes the subject unsuitable for study participation.
