  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the feasibility of a low-cost, movement tracking video game (Bootle
      Blast) to 1) sustain engagement in children with cerebral palsy (CP) during a 12-week
      intervention; and 2) generate changes in upper limb functional motor outcomes following the
      intervention.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children with Cerebral Palsy (CP) can benefit from home-based practice of therapy exercises.
      However, sustaining engagement in home-based therapy is challenging. Bootle Blast is a
      low-cost video game that uses the Microsoft Kinect sensor to track upper limb movements and
      interactions with real-life objects (e.g. musical instruments, building blocks). To play
      Bootle Blast, the child needs to use the hemiplegic arm/hand to play unilateral game
      activities, and highly involve it in bilateral activities.

      This study will answer our research questions: 1a) to what extent can Bootle Blast sustain
      engagement in children with CP over a 12-week home intervention? 1b) from the perspective of
      children with CP and their parents, what are the intervention features influencing
      engagement? and 2) to what extent can the use of Bootle Blast lead to improvements in UL
      motor function when the playtime goal is family-identified? As measures of feasibility we
      hypothesize that 1a) 75% of children will achieve their weekly play time goal and complete
      the 12-week intervention and 2) 75% children who achieve their weekly play time goal will
      improve in one or more UL motor outcome measures.

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will undergo a clinical assessment at 3-time points: baseline, post-intervention, and one-month follow-up. Clinical assessments will take approximately 2 hours and will be carried out at the Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital by an occupational therapist. A research assistant will visit the child's home 3 times throughout the duration of the intervention (week 1, 6 and 12). During the first and last home visits, semi-structured interviews will be conducted individually with the parent and child.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Video game logs</measure>
    <time_frame>Through out the 12-week intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Addresses research question 1a. Every time the computer is turned on to play the video game, a video game log is automatically generated. The game logs active play time (i.e. time in minutes spent actively engaging in therapeutic movements) and passive play time (e.g. time spent navigating menus). Additional data that is recorded in game logs includes: game scores, games played and time in each game, rewards collected, and location of the joints (e.g. elbow, shoulder) as tracked by the Microsoft Kinect sensor. Data recorded in the video game will be used to identify the percentage of children that met their weekly play time goal, and on how many weeks this goal was achieved.</description>

    <description>Bootle Blast is a series of 13 mini-games targeting different upper limb motor therapy goals. Bootle Blast is designed with many of the features of mainstream video games known to be appealing to young people. Game rewards are linked to meeting therapeutic objectives, such as daily play targets that are customizable to each child. Bootle Blast is played through movements of the upper limbs tracked via a low-cost camera/sensor (Microsoft Kinect, no hand-held controls needed). The movements required to play are customizable to each child's range of motion. Some of the mini-games are &quot;mixed reality&quot;, where children interact and manipulate real-life objects (e.g. musical instruments, coloured building blocks) to play the game. The use of skeletal tracking and mixed reality enables both gross and fine motor skills to be practiced in line with each child's therapy goals and motor abilities.</description>

    <description>During the baseline assessment, an occupational therapist will calibrate the video game to the child's therapy needs and functional abilities. Within a week of the first assessment, the research team will set up the video game in the participant's home where it will remain for 12 weeks. Training on how to play the game and a user manual will be provided. The researcher will work with each family to establish a play objective (minutes/day and days/week) that considers the family's schedule. Five-minute telephone check-in calls will be done weekly.</description>
