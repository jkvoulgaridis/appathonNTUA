  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fusion imaging is a technique that facilitates endovascular navigation but is only available
      in hybrid rooms. The goal of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of fusion imaging with
      a mobile C-arm in a conventional operating room through the use of an angio-navigation
      station.

      The study include all patients who underwent an aortic stent graft procedure in a
      conventional operating room with a mobile flat-panel detector (Cios Alpha, Siemens) connected
      to an angio-navigation station (EndoNaut, Therenva). The intention is to perform preoperative
      3D CT/perioperative 2D fluoroscopy fusion Imaging using an automatic registration process.
      Registration is considered successful when the software was able to correctly overlay
      preoperative 3D vascular structures onto the fluoroscopy image. For EVAR, contrast dose,
      operation and fluoroscopy time were compared to those of a control group drawn from the
      department's database who underwent a procedure with a C-arm image intensifier.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients eligible for endovascular treatment of aneurysm disease of the aorta. Procedure
        performed in a conventional operating room equipped with a mobile flat-panel detector
        (30´30 cm) (Cios-Alpha, Siemens®, Munich, Germany) and a floating table.

        Patients who received written and verbal information about the protocol and did not object
        to participating in the trial.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients who also required a conventional surgical revascularisation procedure or who
        required an endovascular revascularisation procedure in another site.

        Patients who underwent MR angiography during preoperative evaluation. Non-analysable CT
        angiogram (no or poor injection). Procedure performed in a hybrid room or in an operating
        room not equipped with a mobile flat-panel detector.
