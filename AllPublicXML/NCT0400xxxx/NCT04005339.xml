  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to evaluate the clinical activity of the combination of fluorouracil,
      leucovorin, and nanoliposomal irinotecan as second-line treatment in patients with advanced
      biliary tract cancers following gemcitabine and platinum chemotherapy.

    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, open label, multicenter phase II study to evaluate the clinical
      activity of the combination of fluorouracil, leucovorin, and nanoliposomal irinotecan as
      second-line treatment in patients with advanced biliary tract cancers following gemcitabine
      and platinum chemotherapy. Patients with advanced biliary tract cancers who have adequate
      performance status and adequate hepatic and renal function will be eligible. Patients may
      have received adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy prior to enrolling in the trial,
      but a minimum of 6 months between adjuvant chemotherapy and this current therapy are
      required. Patients may continue on study as long as they are tolerating treatment and do not
      have progression of disease by RECIST v1.1 criteria. Response assessments will occur using
      imaging (CT or MRI) every 8 weeks.
