    <textblock>
      This is a follow-up study to investigate the long-term safety and efficacy of PNEUMOSTEM®
      versus placebo, for the treatment of BPD in premature infants. Subjects who participated in
      and completed the initial stage of the Phase II trial (NCT03392467) will be followed-up until
      60 months of corrected age
