  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is commonly observed in southern China, particularly in the
      Pearl River delta area and the Xijiang River basin in the Guangdong and Guangxi provinces,
      with an incidence rate as high as 25‑50 per 100,000. The National Comprehensive Cancer
      Network guidelines (version 1, 2018), have recommended use of induction chemotherapy followed
      by CCRT as category 2A for NPC, especially the TPF regimen as category 1 for EBV-associated
      disease. The nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (Nab-paclitaxel) is a promising new agent
      with more efficient entry to the tumor microenvironment and preferential uptake by cancer
      cells. Superior activity of Nab-paclitaxel regimens without the necessity for
      antianaphylactic pretreatments has been shown in various solid tumors compared with the
      traditional solvent-based paclitaxel-based ones. However, the safety and efficacy of
      combination of Nab-paclitaxel, cisplatin and Fluorouracil (APF) has not been determined in
      patients with locoregionally advanced NPC. In this prospective, Multi-centeric, Open,
      Non-controlled phase II clinical trial, investigators perform an exploratory study to the
      efficacy and Safety of APF.
