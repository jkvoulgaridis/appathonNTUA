      The primary aim of this study was to examine weight reduction in primary care in obese or
      overweight subjects with a comorbidity that would benefit from weight loss during 1-year
      comprehensive lifestyle management programme including medical examinations, personalized
      dietary and exercise advice, guidance on shopping behaviour and food preparation, and group
      discussions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is associated with altered glucose and lipid metabolism, and elevated blood pressure
      (BP) increasing the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Obesity-induced
      complications are increasingly encountered in the health care system and especially in
      primary care. Thus, there is a growing need for individually tailored weight management
      programs aiming to permanent lifestyle and dietary changes for the prevention and treatment
      of obesity-related health hazards.

      The study investigated weight reduction during 1-year comprehensive lifestyle programme in
      134 obese or overweight subjects (BMI&gt;30, or BMI&gt;25 with a comorbidity including diabetes,
      hypertension, arthrosis, asthma, chronic obstructive lung disease, sleep apnoea). The
      participants were recruited from the local diabetes centre and health care providers. The
      programme aimed at 5-10 % weight reduction utilizing exercise program supervised by personal
      trainer, advice on diet and on-location shopping behavior by a registered dietician, hands-on
      cooking classes by a professional chef, examinations by a medical doctor, and group
      discussions. The efficacy of the program was followed by measuring change in weight, BMI,
      waist circumference, fat and muscle percentage, visceral fat, and systolic and diastolic BP.

      The study protocol has been approved by the ethics committee of the Pirkanmaa Hospital
      District (R12099).

    <description>The programme consisted of 1) the initiation phase (1-3 months), 2) the establishment phase (3-6 months), and 3) the maintenance phase (7-12 months). Guidance was given altogether on 25 separate occasions with special emphasis on the motivation and education. The goal for weight loss was 5-10 %. The programme included four visits by medical doctor, an educational lecture by medical doctor and personal trainer, five sessions by registered dietician, two cooking classes by professional chef, two group discussions, and exercise as follows: personalized exercise program tailored by personal trainer, one-year gym access with four guided group sessions, and two guided group Nordic walking sessions, and three individual exercise sessions by personal trainer.</description>
