      Retrospective review of 492 patient from a small community hospital who did not qualify for
      participation in the Connect HF study sponsored by DCRI.

    <textblock>
      Retrospective review of adults above the age of 18 with a primary diagnosis of HFpEF between
      August 2017 and March 2018. Subjects had to fall into one of two classifications (NYHA Class
      II-IV or ACC/AHA Stage B-D) and had a life expectancy greater than 6 months are included.
      Individuals with a terminal illness other than HF, prior heart transplant or on a transplant
      list, or current/ planned left ventricular assist device excluded. The primary objective of
      this study is to identify risk factors for readmission in patients discharged with a
      diagnosis of HFpEF.
