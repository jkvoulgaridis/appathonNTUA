  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Higher rates and severity of tobacco dependence in people with schizophrenia, as compared
      with the general population, contribute to the lower life expectancy seen in this population.
      Dependent tobacco smoking is controlled by how different aspects of cigarette smoking are
      perceived. There is evidence suggesting that people with schizophrenia differ in how they
      perceive cigarette smoking, which, if confirmed, would have implications for tailoring
      treatment interventions for smoking cessation in schizophrenia.

      The aim of the present study is to determine whether tobacco smoking in people with
      schizophrenia is governed by different aspects and effects of cigarette consumption. Smokers
      participating in this study either have no psychiatric diagnosis, or a diagnosis of
      schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Over four study visits, participants will sample
      and compare different research cigarettes, complete questionnaires and concentration tasks,
      and smoke one type of research cigarette for eight hours while wearing a nicotine patch. By
      shaping our understanding of tobacco dependence in schizophrenia, the present project may
      redirect treatment development toward strategies tailored to the specific vulnerabilities of
      this population, which is among the most severely affected by its detrimental impact on
      health and life.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in exhaled carbon monoxide</measure>
    <time_frame>One day (in the Ad Libitum Smoking Session), over an 8-hour time frame.</time_frame>
    <description>The concentration (ppm) of carbon monoxide (CO) in breath is measured by exhalation into a CO breathalyzer at the beginning of the Ad Libitum Smoking Session (baseline), and at the end eight hours later. The change value is obtained by subtracting each participant's baseline value from the end-of-session value.</description>

    <measure>Cigarette Discrimination Accuracy</measure>
    <time_frame>One day (in the Cigarette Discrimination Session), over a 6-hour time frame.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants sample 4 cigarettes of type A and 4 cigarettes of type B in a double-blind manner and indicate for each cigarette if they think it is of type A or B. Two reference trials with cigarette type unblinded will be performed before the first and fifth sample cigarette. For each sampled cigarette, the score is either 1 (correct) or 0 (incorrect). Discrimination accuracy is calculated by averaging the eight scores for each participant.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the number of research cigarettes smoked</measure>
    <time_frame>One day (in the Ad Libitum Smoking Session), over an 8-hour time frame.</time_frame>
    <description>In the Ad Libitum Smoking Session, participants can smoke as many research cigarettes as they wish. We quantify the number of cigarettes smoked in the first two hours and in the last two hours of the session and calculate the difference score by subtracting the number in the last two hours from that in the first two hours.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference in subjective state composite score</measure>
    <time_frame>One day (in the Cigarette Discrimination Session), over a 6-hour time frame.</time_frame>
    <description>The difference in subjective state composite score is derived by transforming each subject's score on the Minnesota Nicotine Withdrawal Scale, the Affect-based Withdrawal Scale, the Questionnaire for Smoking Urges, and the modified Cigarette Evaluation Questionnaire into standard z-scores, calculating the difference between Research Cigarette A and B for each scale, and averaging the absolute values across scales.</description>

    <description>Participants sample two research cigarettes, which differ in typical tobacco smoke constituents such as tar, nicotine, carbon monoxide, etc. In the Cigarette Discrimination Session, participants sample both types of cigarettes repeatedly, guess their identity (A or B) with regard to reference cigarettes, and rate their subjective effects. In the Ad Libitum Smoking Session, participants can smoke one of these cigarette types as much or as little as they like for eight hours.</description>
