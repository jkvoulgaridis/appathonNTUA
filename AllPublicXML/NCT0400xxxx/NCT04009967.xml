  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Various approaches are currently being developed for prostate cancer immunotherapy. However,
      a major challenge facing the development of cancer immunotherapy is the identification of
      tumors that would best respond to this type of treatment. Different studies suggest that
      prostate cancer more likely to progress are more infiltrated by exhausted T cells expressing
      the cell surface protein PD1 (Programmed cell death 1). Therefore, there is a strong
      rationale for selecting patients at higher risk of progression for testing the efficacy of
      anti-PD1 therapy.

      High glucose metabolism as detected by fludeoxyglucose F18 (FDG)-positron emission tomography
      (PET) (18FDG-PET) imagery is an innovative biological biomarker-based method to identify
      patients at higher risk of recurrence and early failure to hormonotherapy. Recent study
      demonstrated that high intra-prostatic 18-FDG-uptake was associated with higher Gleason
      grades. Therefore the one third of Gleason ≥ 8 prostate cancer patients with higher 18FDG
      uptake would be ideal candidates for early immunotherapy treatments based on anti-PD-1 such
      as pembrolizumab.

      The study aimed to identify biomarkers predictive the response to Pembrolizumab given prior
      to radical prostatectomy in participants with primary prostate cancer at high risk of
      progression.

      This is a Phase II, single-arm and open-label trial of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in localized
      prostate cancer patients with newly diagnosed non-metastatic prostate cancer (Gleason grade
      ≥8 on biopsy) with positive tumor by FDG-PET (SUV max &gt;4) who chose to undergo radical
      prostatectomy and lymph node dissection as primary treatment.

      The trial will meet its endpoint if a reduction in cancer extent, proliferative index and
      increased apoptosis, as well as an induction of favorable immune cell infiltration and immune
      checkpoint expression profiles are observed after treatment compare to baseline..

    <description>Participants will receive 3 cycles of pembrolizumab regardless of PD-L1 status. After completion of the second cycle of pembrolizumab treatment, and just before the third injection of pembrolizumab an 18FDG-PET/CT scan will be performed to assess a potential metabolic response. Then between 2 to 4 weeks after the third treatment, subjects will undergo radical prostatectomy. Subjects will be followed every 3 months during the first year post-surgery and according to physician decision during the following years.</description>
