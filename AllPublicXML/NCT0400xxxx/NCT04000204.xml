  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The change from baseline VAS pain score at 6 months post-injection.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months post-injection</time_frame>
    <description>The VAS scale uses a 100 mm line labelled at '0' with 'no pain' and '100' with 'worst pain'</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual analog scale (VAS) score for pain change</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1, 3, 9 and 12 months post-injection</time_frame>
    <description>The change from baseline VAS pain score at 1, 3, 9 and 12 months post-injection. The VAS scale uses a 100 mm line labelled at '0' with 'no pain' and '100' with 'worst pain'</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adverse events reported from the baseline and during the study period</measure>
    <time_frame>1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months post-injection</time_frame>
    <description>The safety assessment was based on reports of adverse events, defined as any unwanted events whether it was thought to be related to the study drugs or not, were recorded during each follow up and at any time the patient reported an event to the investigator during the study period.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Likert scale score change</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months post-injection</time_frame>
    <description>The change from baseline WOMAC score at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months post-injection. A 24-item questionnaire with 3 subscales measuring pain, stiffness, and physical function. Total score is 96 and lower scores indicate better outcomes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual analog scale (VAS) score for stiffness change</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months post-injection</time_frame>
    <description>The change from baseline VAS stiffness score at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months post-injection. The VAS scale uses a 100 mm line labelled at '0' with 'no stiffness' and '100' with 'worst stiffness'.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual analog scale (VAS) score for satisfaction change</measure>
    <time_frame>1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months post-injection</time_frame>
    <description>The change from baseline VAS satisfaction score at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months post-injection. Patients rate their treatment satisfaction based on a 100 mm VAS. The VAS scale uses a 100 mm line labelled at '0' with 'least satisfaction' and '100' with 'highest satisfaction'.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Timed Up-and-Go test (TUG) change</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months post-injection</time_frame>
    <description>The change from baseline TUG time at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months post-injection. A simple measurement of time in seconds for a subject to rise from an armchair, walk 3 meters, turn around, walk back to the chair, and sit down.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Single-leg stance test (SLS) change</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months post-injection</time_frame>
    <description>The change from baseline SLS time at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months post-injection. A simple measurement of time in seconds for a subject raising one foot up without touching it to the supported lower extremity with knee OA and maintain balance for as long as possible.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Knee joint inflammatory state change by ultrasonic inspection</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months post-injection</time_frame>
    <description>The change from baseline of the subject knee inflammatory state at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months post-injection through ultrasonic inspection.</description>
