  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm open trial of Comprehensive Behavioral Intervention for Tics (CBIT)
      delivered to pediatric and adult patients with persistent tic disorders in their homes via
      videoconferencing (i.e., teleCBIT). All participants who enroll will receive teleCBIT.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Comprehensive Behavioral Intervention for Tics (CBIT) is a behavioral therapy with proven
      efficacy for treating persistent tic disorders (e.g., Tourette Syndrome) in youth and adults.
      Lack of access to a local CBIT provider prevents treatment access for many patients who could
      benefit from CBIT. Providing CBIT to patients in their homes via videoconferencing technology
      (i.e., teleCBIT) is a promising approach to increasing CBIT access. This study investigates
      treatment uptake, acceptability, feasibility, and clinical effectiveness of teleCBIT among
      pediatric and adult patients enrolled as patients in a state-of-the-art medical tic program.

    <description>CGI:I scores (range: 1-7) describe the global level of change in clinical severity of a disorder. Lower scores indicate more favorable change over time. Following common practice, we will also dichotomize CGI:I scores to evaluate Clinical Responder Status according to CGI:I score (i.e., responder: CGI:I=1 or 2; non-responder=CGI:I&gt;2)</description>
