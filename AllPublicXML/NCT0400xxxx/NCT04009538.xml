    <textblock>
      Patients with COPD who participated in the second rehabilitation program in the Pulmonary
      Rehabilitation unit will be included in the study. Pulmonary function tests, arterial blood
      gases, mMRC dyspnea perception, 6-minute walking distance, disease-specific (SGRQ) quality of
      life and hospital anxiety depression scale values will be compared.

    <textblock>
      Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) program in patients with COPD reduces dyspnea perception,
      increases exercise capacity, improves quality of life, and reduces psychological symptoms.
      Unfortunately, these gains are not permanent, but disappear within 12-24 months. The aim of
      this study is to compare the gains of the second PR program with the first program.

      Patients with COPD who participated in the second rehabilitation program in the Pulmonary
      Rehabilitation unit will be included in the study. Pulmonary function tests, arterial blood
      gases, mMRC dyspnea perception, 6-minute walking distance, disease-specific (SGRQ) quality of
      life and hospital anxiety depression scale values will be compared.

    <description>We used &quot;Modified Medical Research Council (MMRC)&quot; dyspnea scale, which consists of 5 items ranging between 1 and 5, to determine the severity of patients' shortness of breath. The score &quot;1&quot; represents the best level, where the score &quot;5&quot; indicates the poorest.</description>

    <description>We used St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) to determine disease-specific quality of life. At this scale, high scores define worsened disease and increased symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Anxiety and Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>20 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) Inventory was used for assessment of anxiety and depression. In this scale; scores of anxiety and depression are calculated separately. The maximum score for both is 21 and high scores correspond to high degree anxiety and depression. Cut-off scores for anxiety and depression were determined as 10/11 and 7/8 respectively.</description>
