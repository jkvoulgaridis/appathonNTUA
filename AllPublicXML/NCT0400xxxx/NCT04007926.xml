    <textblock>
      This study determines the effect of aerobic and resistance exercise training on whole-body
      and skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity in south Asians and evaluate the mechanisms which
      contribute to improvements in insulin sensitivity after exercise training.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      South Asians (SA) have 2-4 fold higher risk of type 2 diabetes and develop the disease at
      lower body weights and younger ages than white Europeans. Lower cardiorespiratory fitness and
      capacity for muscle fat oxidation contributes substantially to SAs' greater insulin
      resistance, the extent to which this can be improved by exercise training is unclear. This
      randomised controlled trial will investigate the effects of a 12-week aerobic or resistance
      exercise training intervention on insulin sensitivity (hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp)
      in South Asian adults (22 control, 22 aerobic exercise group and 22 resistance exercise
      group). The study will also explore the mechanisms within skeletal muscle which mediate these
      changes by evaluating aerobic and resistance exercise-training induced changes: in basal and
      insulin-stimulated microvascular blood volume (using contrast-enhanced ultrasound); skeletal
      muscle mitochondrial function; and lipid droplet morphology and spatial interaction with
      mitochrondria, muscle fibre capillarisation, endothelial content of key enzymes controlling
      dilation/constriction and GLUT-4 translocation (using confocal immunofluorescence microscopy
      and transmission electron microscopy methods). Thus, this work will integrate physiological
      and molecular data to determine the extent to which exercise training can improve insulin
      sensitivity in SA and the mechanisms underpinning this improvement. This knowledge is
      important for optimising diabetes prevention interventions in SAs and identification of
      potential novel therapeutic targets.

    <description>Participants will undertake two supervised sessions per week. The exercises performed during each session will consist of leg press, calf press, leg extension, leg curl, chest press, shoulder press, lateral pull down and seated row. Exercises will be performed at 60-80% 1RM. In weeks 1-2 participants will perform, during each session, a single set of 5-10 repetitions of each exercise (tiring but comfortably achievable) to ensure they are comfortable with the exercises and are performing these in the correct form. In weeks 3-4 participants will perform, during each session, two sets of each exercise to voluntary muscular failure - defined as not being able to perform single another repetition. In weeks 5-12 this will progress to 3 sets of each exercise to voluntary muscular failure, in each session.</description>
