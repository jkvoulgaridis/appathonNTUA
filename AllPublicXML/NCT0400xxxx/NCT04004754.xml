  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cutaneous Leishmaniasis in Ethiopia causes severe dermatological mutilations. Forms that
      require systemic treatment are cLCL, MCL, and DCL. National guidelines recommend equally all
      drugs that are also used for VL treatment. Miltefosine is one of these recommended
      medications but remains underused due to scarcity of drugs.

      Outcomes of patients receiving miltefosine have never been documented systematically in
      Ethiopia until today. This is needed to provide evidence to advocate for increased access to
      miltefosine in Ethiopia, and to establish baseline data for future research on CL treatment
      options. The aim of this study is to document treatment outcomes of patients with cLCL, MCL,
      and DCL receiving systemic treatment using miltefosine within a routine care setting located
      in an endemic area in Ethiopia.

      Routinely collected skin slit smears from the lesions were stored. Scrapings of these skin
      slit smears were analyzed by PCR and a selected group will be analyzed for species typing.

      Patients could opt out of biospecimen storage and use for study purposes.
