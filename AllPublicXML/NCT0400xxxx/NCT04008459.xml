  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to improve understanding of the relationship between spinal alignment and
      walking and balance in people who have degenerative spinal conditions.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This prospective cohort study will include people who are attending physiotherapy to address
      a degenerative spinal condition and measure them longitudinally. The investigators will
      measure spinal alignment, walking capacity and pattern, dynamic balance, and back muscle
      strength along with self-reported measures that reflect the person's functional
      self-efficacy, quality of life, and general health. Physical and self-reported outcome
      measures will be assessed at baseline before the physiotherapy-led exercise class commences,
      after completion at 6 weeks, and 6 months post baseline.

    <measure>36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Health survey measuring aspects of quality of life. The questionnaire contains 36 questions which form 8 subscales: physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health, role limitations due to emotional problems, energy/fatigue, emotional well-being, social functioning, pain, and general health. Each question is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale with the lower the score the more disability.</description>

    <time_frame>6 weeks and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measurement of pain in a participant's back. The scale is along a horizontal 10 cm line with markings from 0 to 10, 0 indicating no pain and 10 indicating the worst pain imaginable.</description>

    <measure>Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire measuring balance confidence in various situations. It contains 16 questions in which participants rate their confidence in performing the activities on a scale from 0-100, 0 representing no confidence and 100 representing complete confidence. The total score is calculated to be on a similar 0 to 100 scale.</description>
