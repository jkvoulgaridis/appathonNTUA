  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of this study is to explore the safety and therapeutic effect of
      CD30-targeted chimeric antigen receptor T(CAR-T) cells in the treatment of
      Refractory/Relapsed lymphocyte malignancies.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified T cells (CAR-T cells) have the capabilities to
      recognize tumor associated antigen and kill tumor cells specifically. CD30 is originally
      described as a marker of Hodgkin's and R-S cells in Hodgkin's lymphoma. CD30 antibody has
      been applied to treat lymphocyte derived malignancies. To explore the potency of CD30 in
      CAR-T therapy, this trial is designed and conducted to test the safety and efficacy of
      CD30-targeted CAR-T in Refractory/Relapsed lymphocyte malignancies.
