  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BRITEPath (BP) aims to support co-located mental health clinicians in the development of a
      high quality, effective, and personalized safety plan for referred patients who screen
      positive for depression and/or suicidal ideation.

      BRITEPath utilizes BRITE, a safety planning and emotion regulation app that is loaded on the
      patient's smart phone and has previously been shown to be well accepted and to reduce suicide
      attempts compared to usual care in psychiatric inpatients (HR = 0.49). To support mental
      health clinicians in the development of effective safety plans, study investigators will
      develop Guide2Brite (G2B), which provides step-by-step instructions for the mental health
      clinician on how to populate BRITE onto the patient's smartphone and BRITEBoard, a clinician
      dashboard that tracks patient symptoms, app use, and rating on helpfulness of different
      interventions assessed through BRITE.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Delivery of Interventions:

      BRITEPath has 3 components:1) BRITE, an emotion regulation and safety planning phone app that
      is delivered by a co-located mental health (MH) clinician to adolescents at the time of their
      first therapy appointment; 2) Guide2Brite, which will guide the co-located MH clinician in
      working with the adolescent to population content onto BRITE; and 3) BRITEBoard, which is a
      clinician dashboard delivered to the MH clinician and PCP.

      Assignment of Interventions:

      Throughout Phase 1, study investigators will utilize a stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial
      design. This stepped wedge design involves the sequential random rollout of an intervention
      over 2 time periods. Following a baseline period in which no clusters (= practices) are
      exposed to the intervention, the crossover is typically in one direction, from control to
      intervention and continues until both of the clusters have crossed-over to receive the
      intervention, with observations taken from each cluster and at each time period. The
      BRITEPath study will utilize this design during this feasibility phase testing.

      Study investigators will pilot BRITEPath in two community pediatric practices using a stepped
      wedge design (n =50 adolescents).

      Hypothesis: The use of BRITEPath will decrease depressive symptoms, distress, and suicidality
      (any self-injurious ideation, urges, or behavior) as well as improve overall functioning
      compared to TAU.

    <description>Satisfaction to BRITEPath will be assessed through questions developed by investigators to understand experience with the program. Questions investigators have adapted from literature reviews on satisfaction include: &quot;If a friend were in need of mental health care for depression or suicidal thoughts or behaviors, would you recommend BRITEPath to help him/her manage symptoms?; How satisfied are you with the amount of help you received?; Have the services you received helped you to deal more effectively with your problems?.
