  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sometimes when people wear braces, the combination of dental plaque and diets high in sugar
      and acids can lead to white spots on the teeth surrounding the braces. These are commonly
      found in people with braces depending on their diet and care of their teeth. The white spots
      will still be present when the braces are removed. These white spots are the beginning signs
      of cavities and show that mineral has been lost from the tooth. This study will be testing a
      new varnish that is painted on the tooth around the braces to prevent these white spots from
      forming.

      This study will enroll patients who wear braces and have planned teeth extractions. A calcium
      and fluoride releasing varnish will be painted on the teeth planned to be extracted. Braces
      will then be placed on the teeth. In 3-6 weeks, the extraction will occur and the teeth will
      be collected for analysis.

      This is a randomized split mouth double blinded clinical trial. The CPP-ACP-NaF varnish is
      commercially available and is used for the treatment of tooth hypersensitivity under FDA 510K
      K102808. The placebo for this study is the same product without the CPP-ACP-NaF component.
      Patients with planned orthodontic therapy that include tooth extractions will have
      orthodontic brackets attached to the to-be-extracted teeth. Each patient will have the
      CPP-ACP-NaF varnish and the varnish base (without CPP-ACP-NaF) applied to teeth immediately
      after orthodontic brackets have been applied. The specific teeth (left or right) will be
      randomly determined as to the application of the varnish or placebo. In this experimental
      design each patient has CPP-ACP-NaF applied to one side and placebo applied to the other
      side.

      When the teeth are extracted they are transferred to the Carey Laboratory for in vitro
      evaluations.
