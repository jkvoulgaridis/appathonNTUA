  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A five-year, Phase III, multi-site, cluster randomized controlled clinical trial will
      evaluate the efficacy of the CenteringPregnancy (CP) Oral Health Promotion (CPOP)
      intervention. Intervention and control groups will be drawn from 6 CP sites. Prenatal care
      facilitators will conduct the intervention in group prenatal care sessions. With an average
      of 4 CP facilitators per site (24 facilitators), conducting 2-3 CP groups each (48-72 CP
      groups with 8 mother/child dyads per group), the total study population will be approximately
      384 dyads. CP facilitators will be randomly assigned to either the: 1) intervention arm and
      deliver the CPOP intervention; or 2) control arm and deliver the usual CP curriculum. The
      CPOP intervention consists of two 15-minute modules: 1) maternal oral health (OH) and 2)
      infant OH. The data collection will continue through 12 months postpartum. For the maternal
      OH module, pre- and post-intervention dental exams of gingival OH and Plaque Levels, and
      knowledge, attitudes and behavior (KAB) questionnaires during the prenatal period will be
      used to assess maternal OH outcomes. For the infant OH module, pre and post-module KAB
      questionnaires will be completed during the prenatal period. Infant OH risk status - the
      presence of caries-causing bacteria (mutans streptococci and Lactobacilli) in saliva of both
      mother and infant will be assessed when the infant is 12 months of age to determine
      differences in study arms.

    <description>The intervention consists of two 15-minute interactive modules (maternal and infant OH), integrated into 2 group prenatal care sessions. Led by trained prenatal care providers (facilitators), the maternal module includes discussion of common OH problems during pregnancy, importance of OH, importance and safety of OH care during pregnancy, hands-on skills-building activities of learning and practicing proper tooth brushing and self-assessment of gum health, and presentation of illustrated flossing and OH promotion guides. The infant module includes discussion of infant oral hygiene, avoiding saliva sharing, proper nutrition, and importance of a dental visit by the first birthday. Activities in both modules utilize separate tool kits including tooth brushes, fluoride toothpaste, and other supplies.</description>
