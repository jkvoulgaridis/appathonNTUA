    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to investigate the aesthetic performance of the Hyaluronic
      acid (HA)-based dermal filler Profhilo® injected by a novel bio aesthetic point technique
      (&quot;BAP&quot; techinique ) in woman aged 40-65 years with skin flaccidity and roughness of the neck.

    <description>Skin electrical capacitance value was measured mono-laterally on the neck with Corneometer CM825 (Courage - Khazaka, Köln, Germany). The measure of the skin capacitance properties is an indirect expression of its hydration level.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline of skin density</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (T0), 1 month (T1), 4 months (T2)</time_frame>
    <description>A little skin area of about 7 cm2 at level of neck was pinched, in standardized conditions, using a specific device. Because of this &quot;pinch&quot; the skin profile changes depending on cutaneous density; when the skin is slack the &quot;pinch&quot; forms a lot of wrinkles. A picture of the skin pinched was taken thanks to Primos compact portable device (GFMesstechnik); Primos software is able to measure skin principal profilometric parameters.</description>

    <description>The 1st treatment was performed during T0 visit, after the basal evaluations planned by the study procedure and repeated after 1 month (T1).
2 mL of Profhilo® was injected into the middle-deep dermis by needle (29 G) using a bolus technique called &quot;BAP&quot; (Bio Aesthetic Point technique); this technique involves a series of 10 micro-wheals on 3 vertical-lines (3-4-3 ). The amount of product injected was 0.2 ml for each injection point.</description>
