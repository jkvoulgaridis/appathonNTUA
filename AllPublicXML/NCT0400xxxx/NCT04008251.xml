      This is a single arm, open-label study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of humanized
      anti-CD19 CAR-T cells in patients with relapsed or refractory B cell Malignancies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified T cells (CAR-T cells) have the capabilities to
      recognize tumor associated antigen and kill tumor cells specifically. CAR-T therapy showed
      great effect on patients with relapsed or refractory B cell malignancies. To improve the
      efficacy and safety, the researchers designed a second-generation humanized CAR, consisting
      of humanized CD19 single chain variable fragment (scFv) and CD137 costimulatory domain. This
      study aims to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of humanized anti-CD19 CAR-T cells in
      patients with relapsed or refractory B cell Malignancies.
