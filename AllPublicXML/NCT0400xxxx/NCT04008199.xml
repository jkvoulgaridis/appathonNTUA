      The investigators have developed, piloted, and propose to expand and to experimentally
      evaluate a speech-based service that connects expectant fathers to doctors and to each other
      over a simple phone call. This service, dubbed Super Abbu (Super Dad in English), addresses
      the challenges faced by existing efforts in several new and important ways:

        -  The service targets fathers. Currently, the entire public health infrastructure in
           Punjab is geared towards providing information to women.

        -  It supplements LHWs by providing information between LHW visits.

        -  It does so in a manner appropriate for those who are illiterate and do not have
           smartphones.

        -  It does not require synchronous phone calls. Expectant fathers can leave questions to be
           answered. And they can access past questions and answers asked by themselves and other
           users.

        -  Through experience developing, publicizing, and driving adoption of speech-based
           services, the investigators believe they can overcome the slow adoption rate faced by
           the Punjab Health Line. Principal investigator Raza previously developed and launched
           Baang in Punjab, an entertainment speech-based social service, similar to Reddit, which
           accumulated 42,500 calls by 1,550 users within 71 days of its launch. These users
           listened to 393,448 speech posts.

      Problem: Pakistan has the highest neonatal mortality rate in the world (44.2 per 1000 live
      births), accounting for 7% of the world's neonatal deaths, and among the worst maternal
      mortality rate in the region (178 per 100,000 live births). These indicators remain high
      despite the best efforts of the government and NGOs to leverage modern practices and
      technology to improve maternal, newborn, and child health (MNCH). To this end, the province
      of Punjab, Pakistan has hired 48,000 Lady Health Workers (LHWs), has introduced multiple
      information communication technology (ICT)-based health monitoring systems, and has launched
      the Punjab Health Line staffed by 150 doctors 24/7. LHW effectiveness has been limited,
      however, given the size of Punjab (100+ million people). LHWs are expected to visit nine
      homes per day and in 40 minutes cover a long syllabus and perform several tasks. Similarly,
      high deployment costs, low smartphone penetration, and low literacy rates in rural areas have
      limited the effectiveness of ICT-based interventions. The Punjab Health Line has been
      ineffective for more mundane reasonsâ€”its adoption has been very slow despite extensive
      publicity.

      Research goals and expected outcomes: Super Abbu itself will generate useful information on
      frequently asked questions for public health professionals. In addition, the investigators
      seek to evaluate the effectiveness of Super Abbu at reducing maternal and infant mortality
      rates, and key drivers of these rates, in Punjab, Pakistan. In order to do so, the service
      must first be expanded to accommodate a new base of users. The investigators will then
      conduct a careful, large-scale randomized control trial of the service to understand its
      impacts on drivers of maternal and infant mortality rates, such as the number of antenatal
      visits, tetanus injections administered before birth, iron supplements consumed, and
      breastfeeding during neonatal days, and attitudes about vaccination, breastfeeding, and
      delivery.

      Impact on research fields: Current speech-based health services in the developing world
      either depend on the functionality of a smartphone, involve synchronous contact with a
      healthcare provider, only target women, are costly, or are any combination of these. Super
      Abbu pushes the envelope. In addition, a careful evaluation of the service conducted by an
      interdisciplinary team would impact future research in public health, in computer
      science/language technologies, as well as in development economics.

        Primary study subjects The target study population are households in Punjab, Pakistan, with
        a pregnant woman with a male spouse. The researchers will identify households that fit
        these criteria village-by-village, through community-based Lady Health Workers (LHWs) that,
        among other things, are charged with knowing which women are pregnant in her catchment
        area. LHWs are appointed by Punjab's Department of Health at the village level, and are
        supervised by Lady Health Supervisors (LHSs) at the sub-district level, who are in turn
        supervised by district coordinators and assistant district coordinators at the district
        level. The research team has relationships with LHSs and district coordinators in several
        districts in Punjab through prior work and it is these districts from which the study
        sample will be selected.

        From all of the selected districts, the researchers will draw a random sample of 40 LHWs,
        stratified on sub-district. The team will then work with each of these 40 LHWs to identify
        all of the households in their catchment area that meet the study requirements. Note that
        these LHWs will share location and pregnancy status of households with the researchers,
        with permission of their supervisors, which the researchers have verified does not break
        any confidentiality rules within Pakistan, Punjab, and/or Punjab's Department of Health. It
        is discussed below how the researchers will maintain confidentiality of the research
        subjects once they are in the sample.

        The researchers expect each LHW to have 1000 households in her catchment area on average.
        It is expected that four percent of households will have a pregnant woman at any given
        time. This implies that each LHW will have forty pregnant women in her catchment area. The
        researchers thus expect 1600 pregnant women across the sample catchment areas.

        Once all of these 1600 households have been identified across 40 LHW's catchment areas, the
        researchers will randomly select 20 catchment areas for &quot;treatment&quot; and 20 to be &quot;control&quot;.
        While all 1600 households will then be administered identical baseline and endline surveys,
        as described below, spouses in households in &quot;treatment&quot; catchments will also be invited to
        join Super Abbu at the conclusion of their baseline survey. What Super Abbu entails is
        described below.

        Before enrolling households into the study during the baseline survey, the research team
        will verify that the household does in fact have a pregnant woman with a male spouse. The
        woman and her spouse will then be enrolled into the study. The only additional criteria
        will be that the subject is an adult who gives consent, where adult in this setting is 18
        years or older.

        There will be no other inclusion or exclusion criteria for primary study subjects.

        Preliminary study subjects The researchers will conduct a preliminary study with
        approximately 100 subjects prior to beginning the primary study, to pilot the service and
        to test different versions of Super Abbu. These participants will be selected following the
        same procedure as with the primary study subjects, with one exception---they will all be
        invited to join Super Abbu. They will also be in a geographically distinct location from
        the primary study participants.

        Focus group subjects The research team will also conduct focus groups prior to the primary
        study. Separate focus groups will be conducted with: gynecologists, LHWs, pregnant mothers,
        expectant fathers, fathers that were invited to be preliminary study subjects, fathers that
        were invited to be primary study subjects who were also invited to Super Abbu, and fathers
        that were invited to be primary study subjects who were not invited to Super Abbu. In all
        cases, the researchers will only include adults (18 years or older) who give consent.
        Selection criteria will be that subjects must match the group for which each given focus
        group is being conducted, with no additional criteria. Groups of 1-10, identified ad-hoc
        based on referrals, will be invited in-person to join a focus group at a central location.
        The researchers expect to conduct two focus groups per group, except four for preliminary
        study subjects, for a total of 16 focus groups and up to 160 participants. Note while the
        researchers expect discussion to differ based on the background and perspectives of those
        being focus grouped they plan to ask very similar questions of the group and, as such, only
        have one consent form for all focus group participants.
