      A randomized control trial study was conducted in Islamic International University Islamabad
      from 1st August 2017 to 31st January 2018 according to the set criteria. A total number of 29
      athletes age between 18-35 and playing as part time/ domestic level included in this study.
      Data were divided into experimental group (n=15) and control group (n=14) by random sampling
      technique. Post isometric relaxation technique was used in experimental group and static
      stretching was given in control group. Baseline reading was taken before intervention and
      post intervention reading taken immediately after application of intervention. Data analyzed
      through SPSS 20.

      Vertical jump is defined as the ability of athlete to elevate off the ground from
      standstill.There are two types of vertical jump which re squat vertical jump and vertical
      stop jump. There was a strong correlation between maximal strength in half squats and sprint
      performance and jumping height.

      Muscle energy technique(METS) is the procedure which involves voluntary contraction of muscle
      in specific direction with different angles against a counterforce applied by clincian.METS
      is used to enhance strength of group of muscle, increase afferent input to facilitate
      reflexive stabilization and increase endurance in coordinated movement patterns.

      Athletes perform dynamic stretching before sports involvement. Study shows that three 30
      seconds stretch enhance muscle length immediatley after stretching.

      A study conducted in 2003 to see the effects of muscle energy technique on hamstring
      extensibility, the conclusion of this study that muscle energy technique produced an
      immediate increase in passive knee extension.

      A study conducted on immediate effect of two muscle energy techniques on quadriceps muscle
      during vertical jump. The study suggests concentric muscle energy technique on quadriceps
      muscle is the most appropriate technique to potentiate height jump performance and
      stretch-shorten cycle function in counter-movement jump.

      Athletes ususully perfrom stretching exercises in warm up before involvement to sports.Study
      suggest that dynamic stretching is more suitable for use as part of warmup in young athletes.
      Athletes invlve in high intensity exercise demand stretch shorten cycle, stretching may be
      important for injury prevention. Stretching also reduce the peak torque and mean power
      output.
