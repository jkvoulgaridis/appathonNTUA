      The goal of this prospective, single-arm, multi-site, feasibility study is to develop data to
      evaluate the safety and effectiveness of unilateral focused ultrasound thalamotomy using this
      ExAblate Transcranial System in the treatment of medication-refractory tremor resulting from
      idiopathic Parkinson's disease.

      The Indications for Use claim for this system is: treatment of medication-refractory tremor
      in subjects with idiopathic Parkinson's disease.
