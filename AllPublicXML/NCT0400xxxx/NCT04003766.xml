  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate and directly compare the technical success, tissue quality,
      diagnostic efficacy and safety profile of Percutaneous and Endoscopic Ultrasound-guided Liver
      Biopsy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Liver biopsy (LB) is essential for the diagnosis and evaluation of a variety of hepatic
      conditions, such as grading/staging of chronic liver disease secondary to alcohol,
      non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, viral hepatitis, hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease,
      cholestatic liver disease, as well as in elucidating the etiology of elevation in liver
      tests.1 Since it was first performed in 1883, percutaneous (PC) liver biopsy has become
      routine practice and is usually performed under the guidance of real-time imaging using
      transabdominal ultrasound (US) or computed tomography (CT).1,2 However, in recent times,
      liver biopsy has been increasingly performed via transgastric or transduodenal routes under
      endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) guidance. The perceived advantages of performing EUS-LB compared
      to PC-LB are the ability to simultaneously assess other organs such as common bile duct and
      pancreas, access to both left and right lobes of the liver and the routine use of conscious
      sedation during EUS procedures.3 Although single arm cohort studies and retrospective
      comparative studies assessing the technical success, tissue quality and safety of these
      different liver biopsy modalities exist, currently there are no randomized trials comparing
      PC and EUS-guided LB.4-7

    <description>The subject would undergo the standard of care procedure for a percutaneous biopsy of the liver.
All percutaneous biopsies will be performed after administration of local anesthetic. No pre-procedure antibiotics will be administered. Subcostal or subxyphoid area will be cleaned and draped in the standard manner. 2% lidocaine solution will be injected subcutaneously using a 25-gauge needle and then administered into the subcutaneous tissue up to the liver capsule. A 16-gauge biopsy needle is inserted into the liver parenchyma under US or CT-guidance, with the location of needle placement left to the discretion of the performing radiologist. One or two core biopsy samples will be obtained. All procured specimens will be placed in a single specimen container of 10% formalin for tissue processing. When biopsy samples have been obtained, the patient will be taken to the recovery area for post-procedure monitoring.</description>

    <description>The subject would undergo the standard of care procedure for an endoscopic-guided biopsy of the liver.
The left lobe of the liver is identified from the gastric lumen, EUS-guided fine needle biopsy (FNB) will be performed using a 19-gauge FNB needle, with the choice of needle type at the discretion of the performing endoscopist. Stylet will only be used to puncture the liver at the time of the first pass and then subsequently removed. No suction will be used. Fanning technique will not be used. A total of 10 to-and-fro needle movements will be performed during each pass. A total of two passes will be performed.All tissue specimens procured will be placed in a single specimen container of 10% formalin for tissue processing. When two passes are complete under EUS-guidance, the echoendoscope will be withdrawn from the patient and the patient will be taken to the recovery area for post-procedure monitoring.</description>
