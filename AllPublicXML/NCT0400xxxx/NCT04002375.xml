  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pectouteropexy surgery has lower complication rates compared to other sling operations.
      Sacrocolpopexy is another common procedure for hanging the uterus. Small bowel obstruction,
      ileus or defecation problems are observed in percentages ranging from 0.1 to 5%. Mesh placed
      between sacrum and vagina often causes narrowing of the pelvis, adhesions may occur and
      traumas may occur in hypogastic nerves. However, presacral bleeding, which is the most feared
      complication of these operations, is a rare but life-threatening condition. In
      pectouteropexy, it is located away from the bladder, intestine and hypogastric vessels by
      placing the iliopectineal ligament laterally and eliminates the risk of presacral hemorrhage.

      In pectouteropexy surgery, the mesh is placed anterior to the cervix. The points emphasized
      in the criticisms about this technique, inadequate support of the posterior compartment mesh
      placed in anterior in a future pregnancy is a possible cesarean section and the negative
      effects on the delivery process.

      Therefore, a new technique of pectouteropexy surgery to the posterior of the cervix instead
      of the anterior cervix of the cervix, the sacrouterine ligament to reduce the complications
      that may occur due to this procedure and this study was planned to increase the
      effectiveness.

      The study was planned prospectively. The research is planned to be conducted between
      30.06.2019 and 30.12.2019. Study Kartal İstanbul Prof. Dr. Lütfi Kırdar Training and Research
      Hospital Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology. Under the responsibility of Prof. Dr. Ahmet
      Kale, it will be conducted by Kazibe Koyuncu. The study was planned as a pilot study since it
      was planned to investigate the results of performing the surgical method with the posterior
      approach instead of the anterior approach and it was calculated that the inclusion of 20
      patients would be sufficient. It is planned to include 20 patients between 30-60 years of age
      who applied to hospital with prolapse complaint and completed fertility request. Patients'
      symptoms and physical examinations will be recorded in accordance with international
      standards and questionnaires will be applied to the files in order to make objective
      evaluation before and after surgery. Pre-and post-operative POP-Q classifications will be
      recorded in the files, PFDI-20 questionnaire evaluating the severity of prolapse before and
      after the surgery, and PGI questionnaire evaluating postoperative satisfaction. In the
      pectouteropexy operation we applied to the patients, the support of the uterus posterior was
      insufficient in the sling fixation with mesh suture to the anterior and iliopectineal
      ligaments of the uterine cervix. We aimed to increase the efficiency of the operation by
      hanging the uterine cervix posterolaterale to the iliopectineal ligament with the anterior
      uterine cervix in order to get better results with this method, which can be applied more
      safely and easily than the other sling methods. Consent form is attached.

      There are validity-reliability studies of the questionnaires to be used in Turkish.

    <description>The surgical procedure was initiated after adhesiolysis had been performed by opening the peritoneal layer along the round ligament toward the pelvic side wall. Preparation started at the right external iliac vein and was performed in the medial and caudal direction. A segment of area approximately 3- 4 cm2 of the right lateral part of the iliopectineal ligament (Cooper ligament) adjacent to the insertion of the iliopsoas muscle was exposed.The peritoneum of the bladder was dissected, and the anterior parts of the distal uterus were prepared for mesh fixation. The uterus was elevated to the intended tension-free position using the transvaginal probe (POP-Q level 0-1). The mesh was fixed anteriorly to the cervix using four polyester permanent sutures (Ethibond Excel®; Ethicon). Finally, the mesh was covered with peritoneum using a continuous monofilament absorbable suture (Maxon™; Medtronic).</description>
