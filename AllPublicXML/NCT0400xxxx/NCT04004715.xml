  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The optimal EAA-containing protein format necessary to maximally stimulate muscle protein
      synthesis and optimize whole-body net protein balance during caloric deprivation has not been
      determined. This study will address that gap in knowledge by examining post, whole-body
      exercise muscle and whole-body protein kinetic responses to ingesting varying EAA-containing
      protein formats after a 5 day period of negative energy balance. This study will provide the
      initial evidence to support the development of a recovery-based food product for military
      combat rations.

      Ten resistance-trained adults will complete this ~55-d randomized, cross-over study.
      Participants will participate in three, non-consecutive 5-d controlled energy deficit
      periods, each separated by a 14-d washout period (i.e., sufficient time to restore nitrogen
      and metabolic homeostasis after moderate weight loss). Post-exercise (whole-body exercise
      model) muscle protein synthesis (MPS) and whole-body protein turnover responses to varying
      EAA-containing protein formats will be determined the morning after completing the 5-d energy
      deficit.
