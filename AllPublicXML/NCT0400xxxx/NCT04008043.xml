  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the pilot study is to investigate the process that includes recruitment
      (to estimate the rate of enrollment), feasibility, protocol refinement, and willingness of
      the subject to be randomized. To provide a sample estimate of the population parameter which
      is the true value in the target population to be used in the planning of a larger
      confirmatory study.

      Secondary objectives include:

      To examine the efficacy of pre/post-operational administration of dexamethasone vs Vicodin
      (acetaminophen and hydrocodone) for post-operative pain control following periodontal surgery
      at the Henry M. Goldman School of Dental Medicine.

      To examine how BMI alters the response to dexamethasone and hydrocodone following periodontal
      surgery since obese patients have shown higher pain scores and increased pain sensitivity in
      previous experimental models of pain.
