  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      In foreign countries, mobile x-ray already is being used where transfer to the radiology
      department at the hospital may be an obstacle. Using mobile x-ray, the x-ray examination is
      performed in the patients own home with transportable equipment that reminds of the
      transportable x-ray equipment that is being used in the intensive care units. At The
      Department of Radiology (DOR), Aarhus University Hospital there is an ongoing project mobile
      x-ray for patients living in nursing homes in Aarhus. The project will be evaluated inspired
      by the Triple Aim Approach in three sub studies.

      Overall aim:

      The overall aim is to conclude if mobile x-ray improves healthcare for fragile patients.

      Hypotheses:

        -  Patients examined with mobile x-ray have fewer number of hospital admissions compared
           with patients examined with x-ray at DOR.

        -  Patients examined with mobile x-ray are more satisfied with their examination compared
           with patients examined with x-ray at DOR.

      Sub study 1 - Population health

      Aim:

      The primary aim is to study if mobile x-ray improves the health of the defined population
      measured in hospital admission. Also to study challenges conducting a RCT.

      The outcome measures:

      The primary outcome is hospital admissions.

      Sub study 2 - Experience of care

      Aim:

      The aim is to study the satisfaction with mobile x-ray compared the satisfaction to x-ray at
      DOR.

      Methods:

      Observations, interview and questionnaires.
