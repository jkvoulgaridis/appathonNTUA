  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The clinical trial was conducted in a cohort of young, high-risk myeloma patients who were
      designed to receive a combination of high-dose chemotherapy with allogeneic or autologous
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The objective was to assess the progression free
      survival (PFS), overall survival (OS),and overall response rate (ORR) of the overall
      treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      50 cases of HR-NDMM patients were divided into two groups nonrandomizedly. TE group received
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation after induction therapy. Allo-sct for the young
      patients with suitable donors, Asct for the others. TNE group received consolidation therapy
      after induction therapy. All patients received PI-based maintenance therapy.

    <description>aGVHD The diagnosis of aGVHD is identified through various stages and grading of the disease related to Skin (Rash), Gut (Diarrhea, Nausea/vomiting and/or anorexia) and the liver (Bilirubin) assessed by severity and grading scale outlined in the section Grafts vs Hosts by Sullivan (1999).
GVHD Grades Grade I: 1-2 Skin Rash; No gut or liver involvement Grade II: Stage 1-3 Skin rash; Stage 1 gut and/or stage 1 liver involvement Grade III: Stage 2-4 gut involvement and/or stage 2-4 liver involvement with or without rash Grade IV: Pattern and severity of GVHD similar to grade 3 with extreme constitutional symptoms or death cGVHD The diagnosis of cGVHD requires at least one manifestation that is distinctive for chronic GVHD as opposed to acute GVHD. In all cases, infection and others causes must be ruled out in the differential diagnosis of chronic GVHD.</description>
