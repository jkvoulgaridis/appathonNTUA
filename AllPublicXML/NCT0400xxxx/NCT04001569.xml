  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AZD8186 is an orally-dosed, selective Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) β/δ inhibitor that
      binds to PI3Kβ and PI3Kδ, and inhibits kinase activity and downstream pathways in vitro and
      in vivo. AZD8186 has shown significant anti-tumor activity in PTEN-deficient preclinical
      models, including prostate, triple negative breast cancer, squamous lung and germinal center
      diffuse large B-cell lymphoma models. PTEN deficiency is reported in approximately 20% of
      patients with gastric cancer and in 35-48% of those with human epidermal growth factor
      receptor 2(HER2)-positive gastric cancer. To date, there have been no clinical trials with
      AZD8186 alone or in combination with paclitaxel in advanced gastric cancer. Therefore, it is
      very important to conduct clinical trials of combination therapy of AZD8186 and paclitaxel in
      patients with metastatic/recurrent gastric cancer who have failed previous therapy, and to
      identify the clinical factors and biomarkers that predict effects of the combination therapy.

      The purpose of the study is to define the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase
      2 dose (RP2D) of paclitaxel and AZD8186 combination therapy in patients with advanced tumors
      and to evaluate the efficacy of paclitaxel and AZD8186 combination therapy as a second-line
      therapy in patients with advanced gastric cancer with PTEN aberrations. This study is divided
      into Phase 1b and Phase 2.

             appropriate phase will be enrolled.

             A. Phase 1b: Subjects with a histologically confirmed metastatic solid tumor that have
             progressed after treatment with approved therapies or for which there is no standard
             effective therapy available.

             B. Phase 2b: Subjects with histologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic
             gastric cancer that have progressed after treatment with first-line
