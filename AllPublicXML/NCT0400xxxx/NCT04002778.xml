  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) is a highly sensitive and
      specific method in diagnosing solid pancreatic lesions. Rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) of
      the aspirate by a cytopathologist improves specimen adequacy and diagnostic accuracy while
      reducing the number of needle passes. As this increases costs and implicates availability
      issues, the investigators aimed to evaluate the utility of ROSE by the endosonographer in
      guiding EUS-FNA of solid pancreatic lesions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Consecutive patients with a solid pancreatic lesion were included. Endosonographer was
      submitted to a basic pancreatic cythpatology training programme at two institutitions. The
      patients were randomly allocated to the ROSE group - in which the number of needle passes
      required to obtain a sample suitable for cytopathologic categorization was established by the
      endosonographer's on-site evaluation - or to the non-ROSE group - in whom adequacy of the
      specimen was evaluated macroscopically and up to five needle passes could be performed,
      assuring sample adequacy. The gold standard was the final cytopathologist's diagnosis. The
      number of needle passes, procedure duration, specimen adequacy, diagnostic yield and adverse
      events rates were compared between groups and the performance measures of ROSE by
      endosonographer were determined.
