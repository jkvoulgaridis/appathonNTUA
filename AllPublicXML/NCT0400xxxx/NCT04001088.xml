  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase II study is designed to evaluate the potential effects of a novel probiotic
      supplement on the severity of global menopause symptoms (e.g., psychological, somatic,
      urogenital symptoms) and on bone health in postmenopausal women.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Menopause is a natural phase in which a woman's menstrual cycle permanently cease. During
      this time, women undergo many biological changes, including a decline of estrogen level or
      alterations in the vaginal microflora. This can result in the onset of various physiological
      and psychological menopause-related symptoms which may continue into postmenopausal years.

      The present study aims to evaluate the potential effects of a probiotic supplement on global
      menopause symptoms including psychological, somatic and urogenital symptoms. It is
      hypothesized that this probiotic, consumed over a 12-week period, will help reduce the
      symptoms of menopause by modulating the mucosal microflora of the vaginal linings.
      Additionally, it is hypothesized that the continued consumption of this probiotic combination
      over a total of 48 weeks will aid in the overall maintenance of bone health and may
      ameliorate bone density loss.

      144 healthy postmenopausal women (â‰¥ 40 to &lt; 60 years old) in the U.S. who are experiencing
      menopause-related symptoms will be randomized to the study (12-week period), and a subset (72
      postmenopausal women) will continue the study for an additional 36 weeks (Bone Health Study).
