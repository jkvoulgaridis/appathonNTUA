    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to test the preliminary safety and efficacy of a two-day
      peri-operative course of treprostinil in reducing ischemia-reperfusion injury in adult
      patients receiving a deceased donor kidney transplantation. Treprostinil, a prostacyclin
      analog, is expected to facilitate the restoration of blood supply to the revascularized
      kidney graft via its vasodilatory actions, well characterized protective effects, and longer
      elimination half-life. These properties and actions of treprostinil make it a strong drug
      candidate to reduce kidney graft dysfunction during kidney transplantation. An anticipated 20
      participants undergoing deceased donor kidney transplant will be hospitalized and intensively
      monitored during an entire two-day Treatment Phase. An IV infusion using a dedicated central
      venous line will be used to administer treprostinil commencing approximately 2-3 hours before
      transplantation of the kidney graft and will continue for approximately 48 hours after
      completion of the transplant surgery. The primary endpoints include the safety and efficacy
      of treprostinil, with secondary endpoints including the evaluation of both biochemical and
      clinical endpoints post-transplantation.

    <intervention_model_description>Treprostinil will be administered intravenously by a standard 3 + 3 dose-escalation approach. The first three patients will receive a starting rate of 1.25 ng/kg/min and if all three patients safely tolerate the first dose, the next three patients will receive a dose of 2.5 ng/kg/min. If any patients experience side effects, additional patients will receive the previous lower dose. This dosing model will be followed until a target dose of 15 mg/kg/min is achieved or if it is medically determined that side effects prevent dose escalation.</intervention_model_description>
