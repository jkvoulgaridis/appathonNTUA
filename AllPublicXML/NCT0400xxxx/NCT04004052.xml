  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Meralgia paresthetica (MP) is an entrapment mononeuropathy of the lateral femoral cutaneous
      nerve (LFCN), where conservative treatment options are not always sufficient.

      The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of ultrasound (US) guided lateral femoral
      cutaneous nerve injection in the management of meralgia paresthetica by comparing with
      transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) therapy and sham transcutaneous electrical
      nerve stimulation therapy.

    <textblock>
      In this prospective, randomized, sham-controlled study, fifty four patients (23 female and 31
      male, the mean age 53.61±11.99 years) with lateral femoral cutaneous nerve compression with
      clinical and electrophysiological findings were enrolled. Patients were randomly assigned to
      three groups: 1) Ultrasound-guided injection group, 2) TENS group, 3) Sham TENS group. The
      blockage of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve was performed for therapeutic meralgia
      paresthetica management in group 1. Ten sessions of conventional TENS were administered to
      each patient 5 days a week for 2 weeks, for 20 minutes per daily session in Group 2, and sham
      TENS was applied to group 3 with the same protocol.

      Visual Analog Scale (VAS), painDETECT questionnaire (PD-Q), Semmes Weinstein monofilament
      test (SWMt), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and health-related quality of life (SF
      36), at onset (T1), 15 days after treatment (T2) and 1 month after treatment (T3) were used
      for evaluation.

    <description>The VAS was used to record each patient's current level of pain with 0 indicating no pain and 10 indicating the worst pain that the patient had ever experienced. Using a ruler marked in centimeters, the examiner obtained the exact values along a 10-cm VAS line.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>painDETECT questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>1 months</time_frame>
    <description>It consists of seven items evaluating pain qualities, one evaluating the course of pain, and one evaluating pain radiation. Additionally, the questionnaire contains three numerical rating scales (NRSs) of 0-10 for current, worst, and average pain severity. An overall score is generated that summarizes everything but the pain intensity NRS, which ranges between -1 and 38. An overall score of &gt;18 indicates likely Neuropathic pain, 13-18 possible Neuropathic pain, and &lt; 13 unlikely Neuropathic pain.</description>

    <measure>Semmes-Weinstein monofilament test</measure>
    <time_frame>1 months</time_frame>
    <description>Cutaneous pressure threshold was measured by touch test using a device with nylon Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments (SWMt) embedded in a plastic handle. A small pushing force is applied anterolateral femoral skin area for 1-1,5 seconds to push the filaments. A medical staff member presses the filaments at an angle of approximately 90° against the patient's thigh. This test is useful for medical staff because it is simple and easy. The threshold was defined as the lightest filament that the subject responses correctly at least two out of the three trials. The filaments are labeled with a numerical marking, which is a log to the base ten of the force in tenth of milligrams. Applications was made where the most symptoms has been observed in the patient's anterolateral thigh.</description>

    <measure>Short Form (SF-36) Health Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>1 months</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of health-related quality of life Health status was measured using the 36-Item Short Form (SF-36) Health Survey, version 2 (SF-36v2), which assesses eight different aspects of health. Item scores can be aggregated into physical component (PC) summary and mental component (MC) summary score.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Months</time_frame>
    <description>PSQI is a 19-item self-reported instrument designed to measure a person's sleep quality and sleep patterns over 1-month time interval. It consists of seven items evaluating sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction over the last month. The 7 component scores are evaluated between 0 and 3 points. 3 reflects the negative extreme on the Likert Scale. The global score ranges from 0 to 21 points. Higher scores indicate worst sleep quality. A global score of &gt;5 indicates poor sleep quality.</description>
