      Combination immune checkpoint inhibitor and DNA vaccine will result in clearance of HPV DNA
      biomarkers (oral and/or plasma) for patients with persistent HPV-16 E6/E7 DNA (HPV biomarker)

      Objectives:

      Primary Objectives:

      To determine whether combination immune checkpoint inhibitor, alone or together with a DNA
      vaccine will result in clearance of HPV biomarkers for patients at risk of disease
      progression.

      Secondary Objective(s):

        1. To evaluate the time to progression among patients with detectable HPV DNA when treated
           with the durvalumab/MEDI0457 versus durvalumab monotherapy versus observation.

        2. To assess the toxicity of durvalumab and MEDI0457 in the adjuvant setting.

      Exploratory Objective(s):

        1. To determine whether anti-PD-L1 alone or together with an HPV DNA vaccine will enhance
           HPV E6/E7-specific and/or mutation-associated neoantigen (MANA)-specific T cell
           responses and whether these responses correlate with enhanced clearance of HPV as
           measured by DNA in oral rinses and/or plasma.

        2. To determine whether anti-PD-L1 alone or together with an HPV DNA vaccine will enhance
           HPV 16 E6/E7-specific IgG and whether these responses correlate with enhanced clearance
           of HPV as measured by DNA in oral rinses and/or plasma
