  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Identification of an effective disease-modifying intervention (e.g. pharmaceutical, surgical
      or behavioral) is an unmet need in Parkinson's disease (PD). Increasing evidence indicates
      high intensity aerobic exercise is a candidate to alter PD progression. The primary aim of
      this study is to examine the disease-altering capabilities of a long-term, high-intensity
      aerobic exercise intervention. A multi-site pragmatic randomized controlled trial design has
      been selected. Individuals with PD will be randomized into 1) a home-based aerobic exercise
      program, or 2) a usual and customary care (UCC). Subjects in the home exercise group will
      receive an indoor stationary bicycle delivered to their home for a 12 month exercise period.
      Individuals in the UCC group will continue their current level of physical activity. Motor
      and non-motor assessments will be conducted at the main campus of the Cleveland Clinic or the
      University of Utah at enrollment, 6 months, and 12 months. Each assessment will last
      approximately one hour.

      Overview of Experimental Design: The study is a randomized controlled clinical trial designed
      to examine the disease-altering capabilities of a 12 month aerobic exercise program for
      individuals with PD. A total of 250 individuals with PD will be randomized into 1) a
      home-based aerobic exercise program, or 2) a usual and customary care (UCC). Subjects in the
      home exercise group will receive a commercially available Peloton indoor stationary bicycle
      delivered to their home for a 12 month exercise period. Individuals in the UCC group will
      continue their current level of physical activity. Both groups will undergo a series of motor
      and non-motor assessments at enrollment, 6 months, and 12 months to measure disease
      progression of the 12 month period. Additionally, data will be used to develop a prognostic
      model to predict 12-month change in Movement Disorder Society - Unified Parkinson's Disease
      Rating Scale III (MDS-UPDRS III) for patients participating in a home-based high-intensity
      aerobic exercise program.

    <description>Change in MDS-UPDRS III Motor Score will be compared between the exercise arm and the UCC group . Administered by a blinded rater, used to examine global motor function and disease severity. The change in Motor Score from the MDS-UPDRS III will be utilized. A lower score indicates improvements in motor function.</description>

Participants will be asked to cycle 3x/week for 12 months on their bike with their heart rate monitor at an aerobic intensity between 60-80% of heart rate reserve with a target cadence between 80-90 revolutions per minute (RPMs). Additionally, participants (both groups) will receive activity monitors to monitor their daily activity levels.</description>
