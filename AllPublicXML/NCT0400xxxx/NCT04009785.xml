  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nowadays, resistance to anti-infectives has become a global public health problem and its
      increased prevalence threatens human health.

      To date, few studies have focused on drug compliance in the paediatric population and it
      varies according to the pathology This drug adherence in the paediatric population is
      directly linked to outpatient care by the parents or the child's immediate family. In
      addition, there are no studies on adherence to antibiotics prescribed at the end of
      hospitalization in the paediatric population.

      In this context, it seems urgent to seek an intervention capable of leading to responsible
      and appropriate use of antibiotics in order to improve efficiency in the drug management of
      acute paediatric infections.

      This pilot study would characterize pediatric patients and determine the compliance rate in
      this population.
