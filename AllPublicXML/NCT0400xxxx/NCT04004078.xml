      This was a prospective clinical study that all voriconazole-treated adult Chinese patients
      with invasive pulmonary infection admitted to Zhengzhou Central Hospital affiliated to
      Zhengzhou University from March 2018 to April 2020. Patients were included who met the
      following criteria:(1)age≥18 years old, (2)Diagnosis of invasive fungal infection,(3)written
      informed consent was obtained from each patients,(4)At least one steady trough concentration
      blood sample was taken from each patient.

      Patients were excluded who fulfilled any of the following criteria:(1) patients who are
      allergic to voriconazole or have poor compliance, (2) use other antifungal drugs during the
      use of VCZ, (3) do not qualify for blood sampling monitored by blood concentration, (4)
      patients with severe liver function impairment (ALT and AST before VCZ treatment are greater
      than 5 times the normal upper limit, TBIL is greater than 3 times the normal upper limit), 5)
      pregnant or lactating women, (6) with incomplete clinical data collection, (7) have
      participated in other clinical trials in the past three months.

      Grouping: 1) The patients were grouped according to CYP2C19 gene detection, they were divided
      into gene-directed group and non-gene-directed group; 2) According to the effect of
      treatment, the patients were divided into effective group and ineffective group; 3) According
      to whether patients had adverse reactions, they were divided into group A (adverse reactions)
      and group B (no adverse reactions). The clinical indicators and detection values of each
      group were recorded, respectively.

      Loading Dosage of administration and treatment regimen : All the selected patients were
      treated with VCZ. Dose of administration is shown for gene-directed group and
      non-gene-directed group below. The maintenance dosage was increased or decreased
      appropriately up to target Cmin range (0.5μg/ml~5.0μg/ml).

      According to CYP2C19 gene detection, phenotypes were classified as ultrarapid
      metabolisers(UMs)，extensive metabolisers(EMs) ，intermediate metabolisers(IMs) and poor
      metabolisers(PMs).

      Dose of administration and treatment regimen according to CYP2C19 gene detection:(1)Non- gene
      directed group：Voriconazole was intravenously administered 2 times at the loading dose of
      6mg/Kg at 12h intervals , followed by maintenance dosing 4mg/Kg at 12h intervals .
      Voriconazole was oral administered 2 times at the loading dose of 400mg or 200mg（weight&gt;40Kg
      or &lt;40Kg）at 12h intervals , followed by maintenance dosing 200mg or 100mg（weight&gt;40Kg or
      &lt;40Kg）. Voriconazole was sequential therapy administered 2 times at the loading dose of
      6mg/Kg at 12h intervals , followed by maintenance dosing 200mg or 100mg（weight&gt;40Kg or
      &lt;40Kg）. (2) Gene directed group: The dosage of the drug was the same as that of the
      non-gene-directed group for patients with UMs，EMs and IMs. For the patients with
      PMs，Voriconazole was intravenously administered 2 times at the loading dose of 4mg/Kg at 12h
      intervals , followed by maintenance dosing 3mg/Kg at 12h intervals . Voriconazole was oral
      administered 2 times at the loading dose of 200mg or 100mg（weight&gt;40Kg or &lt;40Kg） at 12h
      intervals , followed by maintenance dosing 100mg . Voriconazole was sequential therapy
      administered 2 times at the loading dose of 4mg/Kg at 12h intervals , followed by maintenance
      dosing 100mg.

    <description>If all patients were administrated by loading dose, voriconazole trough samples were taken immediately 30 minutes before Voriconazole administration on the Third day. If all patients were not administrated by loading dose, voriconazole trough samples were taken immediately 30 minutes before Voriconazole administration on the sixth day. Blood samples for 2-3 mL were collected in blood-collection tubes without any additives and centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 10min. Serum trough concentrations (Cmin) were determined by a high-performance liquid chromatography method as previously described. The detections were completed in Translational Medicine Center of Zhengzhou Central Hospital affiliated to Zhengzhou University.</description>
