  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Older adults with chronic low back pain (LBP) are at a greater risk for disability, loss of
      independence, and lower quality of life. Experts agree that LBP is not a homogeneous
      condition, and treatments should differ based upon clinical presentation. One particular
      subgroup of older adults with chronic LBP are those that also have hip pain and muscle
      weakness; in addition, many of these individuals have limited and painful movement of the
      lumbar spine. Our past work indicates that all of these hip and lumbar spine impairments may
      contribute to worse physical function and greater disability, but the relative importance of
      each impairment is unclear. Thus, clinicians have limited evidence to draw on for treatment
      decisions, for this patient population. This randomized clinical trial is designed to explore
      two different interventions: one that addresses these hip issues (HIP+) and one that focuses
      more directly on the lumbar spine (SFR). We aim to recruit a sample of 180 older adults who
      have chronic LBP, as well as hip impairments (i.e. pain and muscle weakness). To ensure our
      findings are generalizable, the study will be conducted across three sites in different
      geographical regions: University of Delaware, University of Pittsburgh, and Duke University.

    <measure>Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)-29</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8-weeks (i.e. post-intervention), and 6-months</time_frame>
    <description>A 29-item short form questionnaire developed by the National Institutes of Health that assesses the following domains of health-related quality of life: physical function, anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep disturbance, ability to participate in social roles and activities, pain interference, and pain intensity. Higher scores indicate better health-related quality of life.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Low Back Activity Confidence Scale (LOBACS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8-weeks (i.e. post-intervention), and 6-months</time_frame>
    <description>A 15-item questionnaire that measures a person's confidence in their ability to perform different activities, including carrying, pushing, sitting, walking, and exercising, which may be directly affected by low back pain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8-weeks (i.e. post-intervention), and 6-months</time_frame>
    <description>A 13-item questionnaire that that assesses how a person perceives pain. Items can be scored as three subscales to evaluate constructs of rumination, magnification, and helplessness. Higher scores indicate greater levels of pain catastrophizing.</description>

    <measure>Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8-weeks (i.e. post-intervention), and 6-months</time_frame>
    <description>A 40-item questionnaire that contains five domains (pain, symptoms, activity of daily living, sport and recreation function, and hip-related quality of life). Higher scores indicate lower hip-related disability.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score - Pain (HOOS-Pain)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8-weeks (i.e. post-intervention), and 6-months</time_frame>
    <description>A 10-item subscale of the HOOS that measures different hip pain frequency and interference related to different activities, including walking, stair climbing, and sitting. Higher scores indicate less hip pain interference.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hip Strength</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8-weeks (i.e. post-intervention), and 6-months</time_frame>
    <description>A series of strength testing measurements will be conducted using a hand-held dynamometer. All participant and examiner body positions are standardized using study protocols, and measurement locations are standardized using anatomical landmarks (e.g. greater trochanter). Because strength is impacted by lever arm length, all strength measures are normalized to landmark distance. Strength measurements are taken for the following hip motions: abduction, adduction, extension, external rotation, internal rotation, and flexion.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Timed Up-and-Go (TUG)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8-weeks (i.e. post-intervention), and 6-months</time_frame>
    <description>A performance test where participants rise from a chair, walk 3 meters at their regular pace, and return to a seated position in the same chair. One practice trial is performed followed by three timed trials; performance times are averaged. Greater times indicate worse physical function.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Six-Minute Walk Test (6MWT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8-weeks (i.e. post-intervention), and 6-months</time_frame>
    <description>A performance test where participants are asked to walk as far as they can in six minutes around a continuous track. Greater distances indicate better mobility and exercise tolerance.</description>
