    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, prospective trial of men who are scheduled for radical
      prostatectomy for treatment of prostate cancer, or repeat biopsy for localized prostate
      cancer as standard of care and who will undergo a series of pre-operative multi-modality
      imaging studies. Post intervention, hybrid imaging maps (HIM) will be generated and the
      predictions of the HIM (3D location, volume and grade of cancer) will be correlated with
      actual pathology results to gauge the performance of the HIM in both radical prostatectomy
      and biopsy settings.

      This study was built on our first study (IGPC-1, REB number 15551) which acquired
      multi-modality imaging in 36 patients undergoing radical prostatectomy. We successfully
      demonstrated the ability to accurately co-register pre-operative multi-modality images (MRI:
      T1, T2, Diffusion Weighed (DW), Dynamic Contrast enhanced (DCE); Dynamic Contrast Enhanced
      CT, 3D Ultrasound with post-operative whole mount pathology specimens. We have developed a
      platform for the segmentation of prostate cancer on the whole mount pathology specimens and
      are in the process of analyzing the data to develop a hybrid imaging map (HIM) of prostate
      cancer distribution (location and grade) based on the correlation of the pre-operative
      imaging signals and the post-operative pathology (citation provided below). The HIM will need
      subsequent validation in a separate cohort of radical prostatectomy patients and evaluated as
      to its ability to be incorporated as a targeting tool for prostate interventions such as
      prostate biopsy and this is the purpose of this follow-up study.

      On the IGPC-2 study, pre-operative imaging panels were successfully obtained in 24 patients
      accrued to cohort 1. The protocol was then amended to include [18-F]-DCFPyl instead of
      [18F]-FCH. [18-F]-DCFPyl was a newer PET probe that may possess superior performance because
      it is directed against prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA), a protein commonly
      expressed on prostate cancer cells. Imaging-pathology correlations in the first 6 patients
      imaged with [18-F]-DCFPyl were compared to the correlations obtained with [18F]-FCH imaging
      in the first 24 patients.

      IGPC-2 Cohort 1 (Radical Prostatectomy) was expanded to provide an additional 20 men imaged
      with [18-F]-DCFPyl as part of the imaging panel. The goal was to acquire 24 complete imaging
      datasets with [18-F]-DCFPyl as the PET imaging agent to enable us to draw comparisons with
      the 24 [18F]-FCH imaging data sets acquired.
