  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective cohort study linking data from Finnish Biobanks (Helsinki Biobank,
      Auria Biobank and THL Biobank), laboratory databases, and national registries of Social
      Insurance Institution of Finland (Kela) and the National Institute of Health and Welfare
      (THL) to investigate pharmacogenomics of antithrombotic drugs in the Finnish population. The
      purpose of the study is to assess clinical and economic aspects of using genomic data in the
      context of antithrombotic drug therapy.

      Based on earlier research, data regarding variant alleles in CYP2C9 and VKORC1 will be used
      in the primary analyses. Individuals with and without specific variant alleles are compared
      in respect to their clinical response to warfarin therapy. Warfarin-treated individuals are
      also analysed in relation to other clinical outcomes and a wide range of healthcare
      encounters.

      The explorative part of the study will employ data-driven classification methods to explore
      genotype-phenotype associations for a larger group of antithrombotic drugs including direct
      oral anticoagulants, clopidogrel and heparins and possible interactions with other drugs. In
      this part, 26 gene variants identified in literature will be used.

      The retrospective follow-up time for the study participants is from January 2007 to December
      2018, or 2 years prior the first anticoagulant drug is purchased until 6 months after the
      last purchase.
