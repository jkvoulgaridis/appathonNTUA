      This study will be a prospective, open-label, multi-center study that will collect safety
      data for the minimally invasive PerQdisc Nucleus Replacement Device (NRD). The NRD is used
      for surgical replacement of a single nucleus pulposus between spinal lumbar discs L1-S1 using
      an anterior or lateral transpsoas approach. Currently the surgical gold standard involves
      spinal fusion of the affected vertebral bodies, reducing range of motion and increasing
      stress on other vertebral bodies. The goal of nucleus replacement is to reduce chronic low
      back pain by maintaining disc height while preserving range of motion.
