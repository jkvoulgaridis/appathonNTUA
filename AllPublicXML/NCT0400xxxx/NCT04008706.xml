  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a global, Phase 3b, multicenter, open-label, single-arm study to evaluate the safety
      and efficacy of acalabrutinib 100 mg bid in approximately 600 participants with chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Participants will be enrolled into 3 cohorts: treatment-naive
      (TN), relapsed/refractory (R/R), and prior Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor (BTKi) therapy.
      Participants will remain on study treatment until completion of 48 cycles (28 days per
      cycle), disease progression, toxicity requiring discontinuation, withdrawal of consent, lost
      to follow-up, death, or study termination by the sponsor whichever occurs first. The duration
      of the study will be approximately 72 months from the first participant enrolled. This
      duration includes an estimated 24-month recruitment time and an assumed 48 cycles of study
      treatment (28 days per cycle); additional study time will be accrued during the follow-up
      period for those participants remaining on study treatment after completion of 48 cycles (the
      amount of time will vary by participant).

      This is a Phase 3b, multicenter, open-label, single-arm study to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of acalabrutinib 100 mg bid in approximately 600 participants with chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Participants will be enrolled into 3 cohorts: treatment-naive
      (TN) (minimum of 300 participants), relapsed/refractory (R/R) (approximately 200
      participants), and prior bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor (BTKi) therapy (up to 70 to 100
      participants). Assessment of response and progression will be conducted by the investigator
      in accordance with the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (IWCLL) 2018
      criteria. Overall response assessments will be based on evaluation of physical examinations,
      recording of symptoms, radiologic evaluations, and hematologic evaluations. Study treatment
      (acalabrutinib 100 mg bid) will be administered until disease progression, unacceptable
      toxicity, 48 cycles of study treatment, withdrawal of consent, loss to follow-up, death, or
      study termination by the sponsor, whichever comes first (each cycle is 28 days). In-clinic
      visits will occur every cycle for the first 6 cycles, and then every 3 cycles for the next 6
      cycles. After 12 cycles &quot;in-clinic visits&quot; will occur every 6 cycles. Safety follow up visits
      will occur approximately 30 days from the last dose of study treatment. If a participant
      continues to derive benefit from treatment at the end of 48 cycles, they will continue to be
      provided with study treatment. This may include, but not be limited to, transition to a
      long-term extension trial, continuous supply in this trial (for eg in countries where
      regulatory approval is not obtained, or drug is not reimbursed) or switching to commercial
      drug as permitted by local regulations. Participants who remain in the trial after the
      completion of 48 cycles will be followed for disease progression, description of all
      subsequently administered anticancer therapies, and IWCLL indication for initiation of
      subsequent anticancer therapies q24w via standard practice until transition to regulatory
      approved off-study acalabrutinib, withdrawal of consent, lost to follow-up, death, or study
      termination by the sponsor. Participants who switch to off-study acalabrutinib will be
      considered as having completed the study and therefore will not have any additional study
      assessments, including the disease follow-up period. The duration of the study will be
      approximately 72 months from the first participant enrolled. This duration includes an
      estimated 24-month recruitment time and an assumed 48 cycles of study treatment (28 days per
      cycle).

Patient-reported outcomes (PROs), an umbrella term referring to all outcomes and symptoms, are directly reported by the participant. Around 81 symptoms of the CTCAE v4 have been identified to be amenable to participant reporting. These symptoms have been converted to participant terms (e.g., CTCAE term &quot;myalgia&quot; converted to &quot;aching muscles&quot;). For several symptoms, like fatigue and pain, additional questions are asked about symptom frequency (never to almost constantly), severity (none to very severe, and interference with usual activities (not at all to very much). For this study, the following items are considered relevant and will be assessed: headache, diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, rash, muscle pain, nose bleed, heart palpitations, bruising, joint pain, and constipation.</description>

             which the study is taking place)

               1. Monoclonal B-cells (either kappa or lambda light chain restricted) that are
                  clonally co-expressing ≥1 B-cell marker (CD19, CD20, and CD23) and CD5

               2. Prolymphocytes may comprise &lt;55% of blood lymphocytes

               3. Presence of ≥5 × 109 B lymphocytes/L (5000/μL) in the peripheral blood (at any
                  point since the initial diagnosis)

               2. Massive (i.e., ≥6 cm below the left costal margin), progressive, or symptomatic
                  splenomegaly.

                  lymphocyte counts of &lt;30x109/L (30,000/μL), LDT should not be used as a single
                  parameter to define indication for treatment. In addition, factors contributing
                  to lymphocytosis or lymphadenopathy other than CLL (e.g., infections) should be
                  excluded.

             reflecting the presence or absence of del(17p), 13q del, 11q del, and trisomy of
             chromosome 12 along with the percentage of cells with the deletion, along with TP53

                  hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) negative will need to have a negative
                  hepatitis B virus PCR result before enrollment. Those who are hepatitis B surface
                  antigen (HBsAg) positive or hepatitis B virus PCR positive will be excluded.

               2. Subjects who are hepatitis C virus antibody positive will need to have a negative
                  hepatitis C virus PCR result before enroll.lment. Those who are hepatitis C virus

             Gilbert's, the subject must have a documented unconjugated bilirubin being &gt;80% of the
             total bilirubin number. The investigator must also document that hemolysis has been
