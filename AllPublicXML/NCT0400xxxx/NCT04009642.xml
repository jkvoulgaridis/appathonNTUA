  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The number of people with diabetes is rising. One of the major causes of premature death in
      diabetes is heart failure (HF). This is when the heart cannot pump blood effectively, and
      this may be related to abnormalities in energy production in the heart muscle. In healthy
      people, the heart muscle cells show flexibility and can use both sugar and fat molecules for
      energy production. Although burning fat provides more energy, this process requires more
      oxygen than burning sugars. As a result, fat is a less efficient fuel for the heart compared
      to sugars, especially in situations where the energy and oxygen needs are higher, such as
      during exercise. The investigators propose that the heart muscle in patients with type 2
      diabetes relies heavily on fat for energy provision, and fails to burn more sugar molecules
      for energy provision during exercise to more efficiently use oxygen. Fat and sugar uptake by
      the heart can be detected by the difference between the blood sugar and fat levels delivered
      to the heart and returning from the heart, both at rest and also when the heart is working
      faster during Dobutamine infusion. Dobutamine is a drug frequently used to mimic exercise,
      and get the heart running faster during medical tests. To test the hypothesis, the
      investigators will assess fat and sugar uptake by the heart at rest and when the heart is
      running faster, in patients with type 2 diabetes undergoing investigations to rule out
      coronary disease. Heart function, and blood supply to heart muscle, at rest and during
      Dobutamine infusion, will also be measured using MRI scanning. The same tests will be
      performed in people without diabetes for comparison. It will help understand diabetic heart
      disease and which aspects may be targeted with new treatments.
