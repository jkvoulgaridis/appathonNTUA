  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this single center, double-blind, randomized clinical trial, patients diagnosed with FD
      using Rome III criteria were allocated to either test group (300 mg of BST-104, containing
      175 mg of Flos Lonicera extracts, twice daily) or placebo group (300 mg placebo, twice
      daily). Male and female patients &gt; 19 years of age who had mild to moderate FD were eligible.
      They had baseline endoscopic screening, and patients without active lesions (peptic ulcer
      disease or gastric erosions) were enrolled. Written informed consent was obtained from all
      participants.

    <intervention_model_description>This study is a single center, random assignment, double blind placebo human application study. If a subject agrees in writing to participate in the human aptitude test, the medical examination required in accordance with the human aptitude test plan were conducted and randomly assigned only to those who are suitable for the selection criteria. The randomly assigned target was given a Lonicera Flos extract (BST104) 250 mg/day or placebo for eight weeks.</intervention_model_description>
