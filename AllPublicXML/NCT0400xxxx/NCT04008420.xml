  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The World Health Organization (WHO) has proposed the use of 80% high-dose inhalation oxygen
      (FiO2) during surgery to reduce postoperative infection in adult patients undergoing general
      anesthesia. However, high-dose inhaled oxygen increases the risk of oxygen toxicity by
      increasing reactive oxygen species, and according to a recent research, hyperoxia in the ICU
      is one of the causes of mortality. In patients with general anesthesia requiring intubation,
      high-dose inhaled oxygen was associated with postoperative pulmonary complications in a
      dose-proportional manner and was significantly associated with mortality within 30 days after
      surgery. Therefore, it is necessary to study the optimum oxygen concentration during surgery
      to reduce postoperative pulmonary complications in general anesthesia patients who require
      intubation. Esophagectomy for esophageal cancer still has higher morbidity and mortality
      rates than other common procedures. There are several factors such as aneurysmal leakage,
      esophageal substitute necrosis, cardiac complications, and pulmonary complications. Pulmonary
      complications have been reported to be a very important factor. Therefore, various methods
      have been proposed to reduce pulmonary complications after esophageal cancer surgery. One of
      them is minimally invasive surgery. However, even in the case of a thoracoscopic operation
      using a robot, one lung ventilation is inevitable for securing the visual field during
      surgery, and hypoxia and hyperoxia are known to be associated with postoperative acute lung
      injury. Therefore, in order to reduce postoperative pulmonary complications in the
      esophagectomy using robots, it is necessary to study the optimum oxygen concentration during
      surgery. The recently developed oxygen reserve index (ORI) uses a non-invasive sensor
      attached to the finger, similar to pulse oximetry, to detect persistent hyperoxia of more
      than 100 mmHg and less than 200 mmHg. Therefore, if the oxygen reserve index is used for
      robotic esophagectomy, which requires one lung ventilation, the degree of oxygenation of the
      patient can be monitored continuously and accurately. The authors will measure the oxygen
      reserve index in robotic esophagectomy, which requires one-way lung ventilation, and analyze
      the correlation between oxygen reserve index and postoperative pulmonary complications.
      Furthermore, the cut-off value of the oxygen reserve index, which can reduce pulmonary
      complications, will be calculated.
