    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase Ib, multi-center, open-label study of TNO155 in combination with
      spartalizumab or ribociclib with a dose escalation part followed by a dose expansion part in
      adult subjects with advanced solid tumors.

      These two treatment arms will enroll subjects in parallel to characterize the safety,
      tolerability, PK, PD and preliminary antitumor activity.

      The study treatment will be administered until the subject experiences unacceptable toxicity,
      progressive disease, and/or has treatment discontinued at the discretion of the Investigator
      or the subject, or due to withdrawal of consent.

      Rationale The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary
      efficacy of the combination of TNO155 with spartalizumab and of TNO155 with ribociclib, and
      to identify dosing regimens for further study. Data from preclinical models have demonstrated
      anti-tumor activity for the combinations of TNO155 with spartalizumab and of TNO155 with
      ribociclib that is superior to the activity observed with each of the drugs as single agents.
      These data suggest that these combinations may provide clinical benefit to patients with
      advanced malignancies.

      Study Design This study is a Phase Ib, multi-center, open-label study with a dose escalation
      part followed by a dose expansion part in adult subjects with advanced solid tumors to
      characterize the safety and tolerability TNO155 in combination with spartalizumab and of
      TNO155 in combination with ribociclib and to identify the MTD and/or recommended regimen
      (dose and schedule) for each combination. The study treatment will be administered until the
      subject experiences unacceptable toxicity, progressive disease, and/or has treatment
      discontinued at the discretion of the Investigator or the subject, or due to withdrawal of
      consent.

      Objectives

      Primary objective:

      To characterize the safety and tolerability TNO155 in combination with spartalizumab and of
      TNO155 in combination with ribociclib, and to identify the MTD and/or recommended regimen
      (dose and schedule) for each combination.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of TNO155, spartalizumab and ribociclib
           when administered as a combination of TNO155 plus spartalizumab or of TNO155 plus
           ribociclib.

        -  To evaluate the preliminary anti-tumor activity of TNO155 in combination with
           spartalizumab and of TNO155 in combination with ribociclib.
