  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subbrow blepharoplasty combined with double eyelid surgery excising the subbrow skin and the
      supratarsal upper eyelid skin, lifting and fixing the OOM flap, meanwhile restoring the
      natural and symmetrical appearance, is a safe, effective, and durable way for treating
      patients presenting with dermatochalasis.

    <description>An upper incision is made along the inferior margin of the eyebrow. A lower incision is determined according to necessary amount of skin excision. Then the skin and subcutaneous tissue were excised. The orbicularis oculi muscle (OOM) was separated and an OOM flap dissection was extended to the width of 15mm. A dissected OOM flap was lifted up and three transverse 3-0 nylon sutures were placed to fix it to the periosteum and then covered by the upper myocutaneous flap of the supraorbital rim. Through eyelid-crease approach the supratarsal upper eyelid skin and orbital fat was excised, adjusted and reshaped double-fold eyelids at the same time.</description>
