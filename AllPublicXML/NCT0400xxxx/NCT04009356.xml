      The main objective is to compare the prevalence of anal incontinence (AI) before and after
      bariatric surgery in obese patients.

      Inclusion: Patients who are scheduled for a bariatric surgical procedure after a
      multidisciplinary evaluation for about 1 year (following french national recommendations).

      Primary objective: After inclusion, all patients will fill in a specific self-questionnaire
      evaluating AI (PFDI-20 score) before surgery and at 6 months after surgery.

      Investigators will evaluate the prevalence of anal incontinence before and at 6months after
      surgery using this PFDI- 20 score.

      In those patients with preoperative anal incontinence (only in patients with 3 positive
      answers to question n°9,10, and 11 of PFDI-20 score self-questionnaire), a pelvic MRI will be
      performed before and at 6 months after surgery. Consequently, no further imaging exam will be
      performed in patients without preoperative anal incontinence (less than 3 positive answers to
      question n°9,10, and 11),

      Secondary objectives:

        -  to evaluate the AI severity variation before and at 6 months after bariatric surgery
           regarding the percentage of postoperative weight loss.

        -  to compare the quality of life (PFIQ-7 score) related to AI day before and at 6 months
           after bariatric surgery.

      This study is proposed to all obese patients evaluated for potential bariatric surgery during
      a multidisciplinary evaluation for about 1 year following current french national
      recommendations.

      Demographics are collected from medical records (age, sex, weight, height, diabetes, sleep
      apnea syndrome, hypertension, lipid disorders, distal neuropathy, depression, number of
      pregnancies, history of vaginal delivery, traumatic delivery, caesarean section,
      hysterectomy, urinary incontinence surgery, proctologic surgery, presence of rectal prolapse
      (operated or not), cholecystectomy, digestive resection, menopause, history of urinary or
      fecal or gaseous leakage, current treatments, tobacco consumption, diet.

      Data are collected by self-questionnaire to all included patient during the preoperative
      consultation (about 6 weeks before bariatric surgery) and during the 6-months postoperative
      clinical visit scheduled during the regular follow-up.
