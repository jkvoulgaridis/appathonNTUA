      This phase I trial will assess primarily the safety and secondarily anti-inflammatory effect
      of Episcleral Dexamethasone in patients suffering from refractory diabetic macular edema.
      Numerous studies have documented the anti-inflammatory activity of Dexamethasone in macular
      edema associated with diabetes, branch retinal vein occlusion, and non-infectious posterior
      uveitis. The investigators hypothesize that Episcleral Dexamethasone is safe, tolerable and
      that its anti-inflammatory activity will reduce macular edema and improve vision in patients
      with diabetic macular edema.

             equivalent 20/32 to 20/320);

          -  Ophthalmoscopic evidence of center-involved DME, within the central subfield (CSF);

          -  OCT CSF thickness value (microns):

               -  Zeiss Cirrus: ≥290 in women; ≥305 in men

               -  Heidelberg Spectralis: ≥305 in women; ≥320 in men

          -  Previous treatment with laser, anti-VEGF therapy and/or intravitreal steroids;

          -  No previous history of glaucoma or steroid-induced intraocular pressure response in
             either eye.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of chronic renal failure requiring dialysis or kidney transplant;

          -  Retinal or optic nerve neovascularization on clinical exam, fundus photographs, or
             fluorescein angiograms;

          -  Evidence of external ocular infection;

          -  History of open-angle glaucoma or intraocular pressure &gt;= 25 mmHg;

          -  History of steroid-induced IOP elevation that required IOP-lowering treatment;

          -  History of prior herpetic ocular infection;

          -  History of intravitreal or periocular corticosteroids within 3 months prior to
             enrollment;

          -  History of macular laser photocoagulation within 4 months prior to enrollment;

          -  History of antiangiogenic therapy within 4 weeks prior to enrollment;

          -  History of panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) within 4 months prior to enrollment or

             following enrollment that in the opinion of the investigator would substantially and
             adversely affect assessment of safety and toxicity during the study;

          -  Participation in another clinical trial of non-approved medical treatment within 3
             months prior to enrollment;

          -  Degenerative myopia;

          -  Malignant intraocular disease;

             up visits; Pregnant or lactating women; Co-existent ocular disorder of the cornea,
             lens or media that will interfere with assessment of safety or efficacy.
