  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, tolerability, and safety of
      single and multiple doses of exenatide once-weekly suspension via subcutaneous (SC) injection
      using a pre-filled, single-dose autoinjector in male and female Chinese with type 2 diabetes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single- and multiple-dose, PK study in Chinese subjects with type 2
      diabetes mellitus. Up to 30 patients may initially be enrolled to target at least 20 patients
      completing the study. Up to 10 more patients (ie, 40 in total) may be subsequently recruited
      to replace patients who discontinue, provided such discontinuations are not due to
      significant (based on PI and Sponsor judgment) safety or tolerability issues. Eligible
      patients will receive their first 2.0-mg dose of exenatide once-weekly suspension via
      subcutaneous (SC) injection using a pre-filled, single-dose autoinjector at Visit 3 (Day
      1).Blood samples will be drawn for up to 168 hours after the first dose on Day 1 to assess
      single-dose PK for exenatide once-weekly suspension. Patients will receive the second dose of
      the investigational product (IP) at Visit 6 (Day 8). Thereafter, patients will receive weekly
      (±1 day) doses of IP up to Visit 18 (Week 14). Intensive and extended PK sampling will be
      conducted after administration of the final dose (Dose 14) to assess multiple-dose PK for
      exenatide once-weekly suspension. Follow-up observations will be conducted at Visits 22 to 29
      (Weeks 15 to 26), with the final follow-up at/after Visit 29 (Week 26 ±2 days). During
      follow-up period, Blood samples will be collected for PK analyses. Subjects will be monitored
      closely for adverse events throughout the study.

         18. An abnormality in the 12-lead ECG that, in the opinion of the PI, increases the risks

             situation arises, inclusion of an otherwise suitable patient may occur if permitted by
             the PI and Sponsor.
