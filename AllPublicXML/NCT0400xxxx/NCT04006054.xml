      The aim of the study is to investigate whether dexmedetomidine could suppress catecholamine
      release into peripheral blood to prevent PSH attacks and to achieve neuroprotection.

      Paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity (PSH) is a syndrome typically recognized in patients
      suffering from traumatic brain injury, characterized by paroxysmal increases in sympathetic
      activity such as elevated heart rate, increased blood pressure and respiratory rate, high
      temperature, excessive sweating and abnormal motor (posturing) activity.

      This prospective study will include patients with traumatic brain injury,who will be divided
      into two groups, evaluated by the Paroxysmal Sympathetic Hyperactivity-Assessment Measure
      (PSH-AM). Patients will also be evaluated with head CT.

      The aim of the study is to investigate whether dexmedetomidine could suppress catecholamine
      release into peripheral blood to prevent PSH attacks and to achieve neuroprotection.
