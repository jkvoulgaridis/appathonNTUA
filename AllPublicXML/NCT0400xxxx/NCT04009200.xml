      Investigation of the effect of preoperative anxiety on postoperative delirium in children who
      will undergo circumcision operation

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In order to determine the effect of circumcision on preoperative anxiety and postoperative
      delirium, patients will be divided into two groups who will undergo circumcision surgery and
      who will undergo inguinal hernia surgery.

      Modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scores (m-YPAS), Visual Analogue Scale Anxiety
      (VAS-anxiety) will be evaluated when patients are taken to the preoperative waiting room.

      After awakening, patients will be taken to the postoperative wake-up room where Pediatric
      Anesthesia Recovery Delirium Scores (PAED), Recovery Agitation 5-point Scores (EA), FLACC
      scores will be evaluated every 5 minutes and mean arterial pressure, pulse, SPO2 values will
      be recorded. Duration of stay in recovery unit will be recorded

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Preoperative anxiety difference between groups</measure>
    <time_frame>Before premedication, in operating room</time_frame>
    <description>Preoperative anxiety will be evaluated by mYPAS (modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale). The mYPAS consists of 22 items in five categories (activity, emotional expressivity, state of arousal, vocalization and use of parents). The highest behavioral level observed in each of the five mYPAS categories is the score for that category. Partial weights were calculated and then added to a total score that ranged from 0 to 100. Cut off points were set to classify: a score of 23.4 to 30 for no anxiety, any score greater than 30 for anxiety.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>emergence agitation difference between groups</measure>
    <time_frame>postoperative every 5 minutes during 20 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Emergence agitation will be evaluated by PAED scale (pediatric anesthesia emergence delirium). The PAED scale involves five items: eye contact, purposeful actions, awareness of the surroundings, restlessness, inconsolability. First three items are scored as follows: 4= not at all, 3= just a little, 2= quite a bit, 1= very much, 0= extremely. Last two items are scored as follows: 0= not at all, 1= just a little, 2= quite a bit, 3= very much, 4= extremely. The scores of each item will summed to obtain a total score. PAED scale score of 10 or more will be defined as emergence delirium.</description>
