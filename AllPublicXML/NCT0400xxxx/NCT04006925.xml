    <textblock>
      This study is the first clinical trial using sodium oxybate for the treatment of REM sleep
      behavior disorder (RBD). Sodium oxybate is a drug approved by FDA for the treatment of
      narcolepsy which has been used &quot;off label&quot; to treat patients with severe RBD. This drug has
      shown to be effective and well tolerated in patients with RBD (Shneerson, 2009; Liebenthal,
      2016; Moghadam, 2017).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a condition resulting in violent
      dream-enactment during sleep which affects millions of individuals in the United States,
      however therapies for RBD are limited and cause significant side effects. As a result,
      despite using a combination of drugs, a large number of patients with RBD continue to act out
      violent dreams causing severe self-injuries or injuries to their bed partners. Prior studies
      and our experience have shown that sodium oxybate can be effective in these cases of
      treatment-resistant RBD. This study would therefore evaluate the efficacy and tolerance of
      sodium oxybate in this patient population.

      This study is an 8-week trial comparing sodium oxybate versus placebo randomly assigned to
      patients with treatment-resistant RBD, i.e. individuals who have insufficiently responded or
      tolerated melatonin and clonazepam. The study uses a double-blind design (participants,
      staff, and investigators will not know which drug between active drug and placebo is given to
      participants), and will measure treatment efficacy based on patients, partners and clinicians
      report, and objective outcomes based on in-home actigraphy and in-lab polysomnography before
      and after intervention.

    <description>Patients record any episode of dream enactment, such as talking, shouting, kicking, or punching, etc. Severity is scored from 1 to 3 (1: least severe, 3 most severe):
non injurious behaviors: facial expressions, non-aggressive vocalizations (mumbling, gentle talking, casual conversation, singing, laughing...), twitches, gentle shaking, non-aggressive movements of fingers, arms or legs...;
potentially injurious: punching, kicking, arm flailing or thrashing around, at least one limb or head out of bed, sitting up in bed, crawling, attempting to stand up or leave bed, near falls, cursing, screaming, shouting, yelling, or any behavior requiring bed partner to wake up participant;
injurious: any contact with bed partner (hitting or grabbing), wall or furniture, any fall or leaving bed (doving out, walking, jumping).</description>

    <time_frame>last month of treatment compared to 1-month baseline (28 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical Global Impression-Efficacy index (CGI-E) is a 4x4 rating scale that assesses the therapeutic effect (Marked, Moderate, Minimal, Unchanged or worse) of treatment medication and associated side effects (none, do not significantly interfere with patient's functioning, significantly interfere with patient's functioning, Outweigh therapeutic effect). Therapeutic effect: Marked and Side effects: None is the best. Therapeutic effect: Unchanged or worse and Side effects: outweigh therapeutic effect is the worst. Each combination of an estimated therapeutic effect and side effect is assigned a score from 1-16, 1 being the best, 16 being the worst.</description>

    <description>Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale (CGI-I) is a 7-point scale that requires the clinician to assess how much the patient's illness has improved or worsened relative to a baseline state at the beginning of the intervention and rated as: 1. Very much improved, 2. Much improved, 3. Minimally improved, 4. No change, 5. Minimally worse, 6. Much worse, 7. Very much worse. 1 is the best and 7 is the worst.</description>
