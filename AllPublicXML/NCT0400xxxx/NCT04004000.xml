    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is a study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and changes in biomarker
      and clinical outcome assessments of Losmapimod for patients with Facioscapulohumeral Muscular
      Dystrophy 1 (FSHD1).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase 2, single-centre, open-label pilot study that will investigate the
      safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and target engagement during long-term dosing
      with losmapimod tablets in adult subjects with Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy 1
      (FSHD1). Patients will participate in this for approximately 68 weeks. The total treatment
      duration will be approximately 52 weeks. Subjects will be evaluated during an 8-week
      pre-treatment period (Visits 1 through 3) to establish pre-treatment baseline assessments.
      Subjects will then be treated with losmapimod for approximately 52 weeks (Visits 4 through 9)
      and assessed at relatively regular intervals for change from pre-treatment in various
      assessments. Patients must have a confirmed diagnosis of FSHD1 and genetic confirmation must
      be obtained prior to the screening MRI and baseline muscle biopsy. Patients will receive 15
      mg of losmapimod twice daily given as two 7.5 mg tablets per dose by mouth; for a total of 4
      pills or 30 mg daily for 52 weeks. All patients will be asked to visit the study clinic for
      each scheduled visit.

      The primary endpoint of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of long-term
      dosing of losmapimod tablets in subjects with FSHD1. Secondary endpoints include assessment
      of target engagement of losmapimod in blood and skeletal muscle and repeated dose
      pharmacokinetics in subjects with FSHD1 over long-term dosing.

             duration of the study (list of drugs presented in Section 15). Changes to the dose or
             treatment discontinuation during the study can only be done for strict medical reasons
             by the treating physician with clear documentation and notification to the sponsor.

          -  Subject has a history of sensitivity to any of the study medications or components
             thereof, or a history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the
             investigator or Medical Monitor, contraindicated their participation.

          -  Subject is unwilling or unable to follow the procedures outlined in the protocol.

          -  Subject has any contraindication for MRI (including severe claustrophobia and any
