    <textblock>
      The objective of this retrospective/prospective consecutive series PMCF study is to collect
      data confirming safety, performance and clinical benefits of the Comprehensive Versa-Dial
      Reverse Ti Glenosphere when used for primary total shoulder arthroplasty, fractures and
      revision total shoulder arthroplasty (implants and instrumentation) at a 1,2,3,5,7 and
      10-year follow-up* to meet EU Medical Device and other regulatory requirements for post
      market surveillance. Because Comprehensive Reverse Ti Glenospheres have only been on the
      market since 2009, a prospective aspect to the study will be utilized as well in order to
      collect long-term data.

      The objective of this retrospective/prospective consecutive series PMCF study is to collect
      data confirming safety, performance and clinical benefits of the Comprehensive Versa-Dial
      Reverse Ti Glenosphere when used for primary total shoulder arthroplasty, fractures and
      revision total shoulder arthroplasty (implants and instrumentation) at a 1,2,3,5,7 and
      10-year follow-up* to meet EU Medical Device and other regulatory requirements for post
      market surveillance. Because Comprehensive Reverse Ti Glenospheres have only been on the
      market since 2009, a prospective aspect to the study will be utilized as well in order to
      collect long-term data.

      The primary objective is the assessment of safety by analyzing implant survivorship. This
      will be established by recording the incidence and frequency of revisions, complications, and
      adverse events. Relation of the events to either implant or instrumentation should be
      specified.

      The secondary objective is the assessment of performance and clinical benefits by recording
      patient-reported clinical outcomes measures (PROMs).

      *The most recent available data will be used. If any of the listed time points are not
      available, data will be used from last available time point and follow-up will move forward
      at the closest available time point.

    <description>The secondary objective is the assessment of performance and clinical benefits by recording patient-reported clinical outcomes measures (PROMs) using the Oxford Shoulder Scale or Oxford Shoulder Questionnaire. The Scale ranges from 0-48 with 48 indicating a satisfactory joint function score. A score of 30-39 indicated moderate to mild arthritis, a score of 20-29 indicates moderate to severe arthritis and a score of 0-19 indicates severe arthritis.</description>

    <description>The secondary objective is the assessment of performance and clinical benefits by recording patient-reported clinical outcomes measures (PROMs). This will be accomplished through the use of the Patient Assessment Questionnaire where adverse events and/or complications (yes or no- if yes, an Adverse Event Report would be completed), patient's activity level with regard to operative side (wholly inactive, mostly inactive, sometimes participates in mild activities, regularly participates in mild activities, sometimes participates in moderate activities, regularly participates in moderate activities, regularly participates in active events, regularly participates in very active events, sometimes participates in impact sports, regularly participates in impact sports, or not recorded), and the Reported Score if Individual Scores are not available. (This would be the reported score of the Oxford Shoulder Scale as described above in Outcome 2).</description>

        Consecutive series of subjects implanted with the Comprehensive Versa-Dial Reverse Titanium
        (Ti) Glenosphere in primary, fracture and revision total shoulder arthroplasty according to
        the approved indications. Inclusion/exclusion criteria are identical to the indications and
        contraindications in the IFU.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Biomet Comprehensive Reverse Shoulder products are indicated for use in patients whose
             shoulder joint has a grossly deficient rotator cuff with severe arthropathy and/or
             previously failed shoulder joint replacement with a grossly deficient rotator cuff.
             The patient must be anatomically and structurally suited to receive the implants and a
             functional deltoid muscle is necessary.

        The Comprehensive Reverse Shoulder is indicated for primary, fracture, or revision total
        shoulder replacement for the relief of pain and significant disability due to gross rotator
        cuff deficiency Glenoid components with Hydroxyapatite (HA) coating applied over the porous
        coating are indicated only for uncemented biological fixation applications. The Glenoid
        Baseplate components are intended for cementless application with the addition of screw
        fixation.

        Interlok™ finish humeral stems are intended for cemented use and the MacroBond™ coated
        humeral stems are intended for press-fit or cemented applications. Humeral components with
        porous coated surface coating are indicated for either cemented or uncemented biological
        fixation applications.
