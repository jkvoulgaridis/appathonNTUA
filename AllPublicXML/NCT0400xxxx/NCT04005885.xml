      This double-masked, randomized, bilateral, crossover, direct refit study will compare the
      clinical performance of two daily disposable contact lenses (somofilcon A and stenfilcon A)
      when fitted to existing wearers of comfilcon A monthly lenses.

      This double-masked (subject and investigator), randomized, bilateral, crossover, direct refit
      study will compare the clinical performance of two daily disposable test contact lenses
      (somofilcon A and stenfilcon A) when fitted to existing wearers of comfilcon A monthly
      lenses. After a month of re-useable lens wear in the comfilcon A lenses, subjects will wear
      each daily disposable lens type for one week, in random order.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects will only be eligible for the study if:

          -  They are between 18 and 40 years of age (inclusive).

          -  They understand their rights as a research subject and are willing and able to sign a
             Statement of Informed Consent.

          -  They are willing and able to follow the protocol.

          -  They are an existing soft reusable spherical contact lens wearer in both eyes.

          -  They have a contact lens spherical prescription between -0.50 to -6.00D (inclusive)
             based on the ocular refraction.

          -  They have a cylindrical correction of -0.875DC or less in each eye based on the ocular
             refraction

          -  They own a wearable pair of spectacles and wear them on the day of the initial visit.

          -  They have distance high contrast logMAR visual acuity of 0.2 or better in each eye
             with their habitual spectacles.

          -  They agree not to participate in other clinical research for the duration of the
             study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  They have an ocular disorder which would normally contra-indicate contact lens wear.

          -  They have a systemic disorder which would normally contra-indicate contact lens wear.

          -  They are using any topical medication such as eye drops or ointment.

          -  They are aphakic.

          -  They have had corneal refractive surgery.

          -  They have any corneal distortion resulting from previous hard or rigid lens wear or
             have keratoconus.

          -  They are pregnant or breastfeeding.

          -  They have any infectious disease which would, in the opinion of the investigator,
             contraindicate contact lens wear or pose a risk to study personnel; or they have any
             immunosuppressive disease (e.g. HIV), or a history of anaphylaxis or severe allergic
             reaction.

          -  They have taken part in any other contact lens or care solution clinical trial or
             research, within two weeks prior to starting this study.
