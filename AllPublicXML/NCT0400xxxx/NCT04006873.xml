  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) have problems digesting their food properly. More than 8 in
      10 people with CF must take medication to assist their digestion. In spite of this,
      complications such as bowel blockage occur.

      Finding out how already licenced drugs for CF work in the gut is the first step in
      repurposing medications. Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor with Ivacaftor is a drug combination which
      corrects the basic defect in CF an has shown improvements on lung function.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate, using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and
      patient-reported outcomes, whether Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor with Ivacaftor has an effect on
      improving gastrointestinal problems in CF.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a small pilot study to compare the effects of active drug (Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor with
      Ivacaftor) on the gut in people with CF.

      Participants will be randomised to take active drug or matched placebo for 28 days then
      switch to the alternate drug after a 28 day washout period. Before participants commence
      treatment, they will have blood pressure and baseline blood tests.

      Participants will attend once per treatment period for MRI scanning at the Sir Peter
      Mansfield Imaging Centre, after an overnight fast. On this day, participants will be asked to
      withhold any medicines directly altering bowel habit such as laxatives. They will continue to
      take pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy and other medications for CF.

      The Investigators will use the same MRI protocol as described in GIFT-CF (NCT03566550).
      Participants will have their first MRI scan fasted. After the first scan, they will eat a
      first standardised meal . They will then have 7 MRI scans at half hourly intervals and 3 MRI
      scans at hourly intervals. Participants will be given a second standardised meal after their
      ninth MRI scan. Each MRI scan will last approximately 15 minutes. After each MRI scan,
      participants will complete a validated gastrointestinal symptom questionnaire
      (Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale). In between scans, participants will have access to
      an adjacent room with Wifi and television access.

      During the day, participants will have their lung function, blood pressure and blood tests
      taken. They will also provide a sputum and stool sample.

      Infection control requirements mean that only 1 participant will attend for MRI scanning per
      day.
