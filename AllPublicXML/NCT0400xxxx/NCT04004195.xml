  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BAY2327949 is currently under clinical development for chronic kidney disease. The goal of
      this study is to learn more about how the body absorbs, distributes and excretes the study
      drug when taken once per mouth as 30mg tablet. An additional important goal of this study is
      to gain more information on how well the study drug is tolerated and its effect on the human
      body functions. The study will enroll healthy participants or patients with mild, moderate or
      severe reduced kidney functions matched for age, weight and gender. The results of this study
      will help researchers to select the best dosing of the study drug for future studies in
      patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant must be ≥18 years of age

          -  The study enrolls healthy participants and participants at different stages of renal
             impairment (mild to severe renal impairment).

          -  Race: White

          -  BMI (body mass index): above or equal 18.5 and below or equal 35 kg/m*2 at the first

        the pre-study visit should not vary by more than 25% from the serum creatinine value
        determined at the pre-study visit confirmed by nephrologist or general practitioner the
        patient is under care.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinically relevant findings in the physical examination affecting the objectives of
             the study.

          -  Systemic use of the following co-medications from 2 weeks before administration until
             end of follow-up:

               -  Moderate and strong inhibitors of CYP3A;

               -  Moderate and strong CYP3A inducers;

               -  Moderate and strong inhibitors of P-gp transport;

               -  UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) inhibitors probenecid and valproic acid.

          -  Regular daily consumption of more than 10 cigarettes.

          -  Acute renal failure.

          -  Active nephritis.

          -  Impairment of any other major organ system other than the kidney.

          -  Change in chronic medications for renal disease (or its consequences) less than 4
             weeks prior to dosing.
