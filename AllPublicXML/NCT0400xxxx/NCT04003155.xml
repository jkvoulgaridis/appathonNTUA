  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for women in menopause with moderate to severe hot flashes. Menopause, a normal
      part of aging, is the time of a woman's last period. Hot flashes can interrupt a woman's
      daily life.

      The study treatments are fezolinetant low dose (1 tablet of fezolinetant and 1 placebo
      tablet) once a day, fezolinetant high dose (2 tablets of fezolinetant) once a day or placebo
      (2 tablets) once a day. (Placebo is a dummy treatment that looks like medicine but does not
      have any medicine in it.) The study will compare fezolinetant and placebo after 4 and 12
      weeks of dosing. The study will see if fezolinetant reduces the number of hot flashes. And
      the study will see if fezolinetant reduces the severity of the hot flashes.

      Women in the study will receive an electronic handheld device at the first study visit. (It
      is similar to a smart phone.) Each day of the study, study participants will use this to
      record their hot flashes. Their record for the 10 days before the start of study treatment
      will be checked. They can remain in the study if their record shows 7 or 8 moderate to severe
      hot flashes per day (50 or more per week). Next, they will be picked for 1 of the 2 study
      treatments (fezolinetant or placebo) by chance alone. It is like flipping a coin.

      The study participants will take study treatment for 52 weeks. The first 12 weeks of study
      treatment are &quot;double-blinded.&quot; That means that the study participants and the study doctors
      do not know who takes which of the study treatments (fezolinetant low dose, fezolinetant high
      dose or placebo) during that time. The last 40 weeks of study treatment are &quot;noncontrolled.&quot;
      That means that each study participant and the study doctors know which study treatment that
      study participant takes during that time. Women who take fezolinetant during the first 12
      weeks will continue to take the same dose. Women who take placebo during the first 12 weeks
      will start taking fezolinetant. Their dose will be either low dose or high dose fezolinetant.

      At weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 14, 16 and then once a month, the study participants will go to the
      hospital or clinic for a check-up. They will be asked about medications, side effects and how
      they feel. Other checks will include physical exam and vital signs (heart rate, temperature
      and blood pressure). Blood and urine will be collected for laboratory tests. Study
      participants will complete questionnaires that are about how hot flashes affect their daily
      life. Study participants who still have their uterus will have the following 2 tests done at
      the first and last study visits. One of the 2 tests is endometrial biopsy. This test involves
      removing a small amount of tissue from the inside lining of the uterus. The tissue is then
      checked under a microscope. The other test is transvaginal ultrasound. This test uses sound
      waves to create pictures of the organs in the pelvis. The sound waves are transmitted by a
      probe (transducer), which is placed inside the vagina. Study participants may have a
      screening mammogram done at the first and/or last study visit. A mammogram is an x-ray
      picture of the breasts used to screen for breast cancer. Study participants who did not have
      this test done in the last 12 months will have it done at the first study visit. They will
      have it done at the last study visit if they are due for their screening mammogram and their
      own doctor agrees.

      The last check-up at the hospital or clinic will be 3 weeks after the last dose of study
      treatment.

    <description>The PROMIS is a National Institutes of Health Roadmap initiative designed to improve PRO measures using state-of-the-science methods. The PROMIS SD SF 8b [PROMIS SD, 2015] assesses self-reported sleep disturbance over the past 7 days and includes perceptions of restless sleep; satisfaction with sleep; refreshing sleep; difficulties sleeping, getting to sleep or staying asleep; amount of sleep; and sleep quality. Responses to each of the 8 items range from 1 to 5, and the range of possible summed raw scores is 8 to 40. Higher scores on the PROMIS SD SF 8b indicate more of the concept measured (disturbed sleep).</description>

             inhibitors, hormone replacement therapy [HRT], hormonal contraceptive or any treatment
             for VMS [prescription, over the counter or herbal]) or is not willing to wash out and
             discontinue use of such drugs for the full duration of study conduct.

          -  Subject has known substance abuse or alcohol addiction within 6 months of screening.

          -  Subject has previous or current history of a malignant tumor, except for basal cell
             carcinoma.

          -  Subject's systolic blood pressure is â‰¥ 130 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure is â‰¥ 80
             mmHg based on the average of 2 to 3 readings, on at least 2 different occasions within
             the screening period.

               -  Subjects who do not meet these criteria may be re-assessed after initiation or
                  review of antihypertensive measures.

                  medically clear (stable and compliant).

          -  Subject has history of severe allergy, hypersensitivity or intolerance to drugs in
             general, including the study drug and any of its excipients.

          -  For subjects with a uterus: Subject has an unacceptable result from the TVU assessment
             at screening (i.e., full length of endometrial cavity cannot be visualized or presence
             of a clinically significant finding).

          -  For subjects with a uterus: Subject has an endometrial biopsy confirming presence of
             disordered proliferative endometrium, endometrial hyperplasia, endometrial cancer or
             other clinically significant findings at screening. A biopsy with insufficient
             material for evaluation, or unevaluable material, is acceptable provided the
             endometrial thickness is less than 4 mm.

          -  Subject has a history within the last 6 months of undiagnosed uterine bleeding.

          -  Subject has a history of seizures or other convulsive disorders.

             [including cognitive], hepatic, renal, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, pulmonary
             [e.g., moderate asthma], endocrine or gynecological disease) or malignancy that could
             confound interpretation of the study outcome.

          -  Subject has active liver disease, jaundice or elevated liver aminotransferases
             (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] or aspartate aminotransferase [AST]), elevated total
             or direct bilirubin, elevated international normalized ratio (INR), or elevated
             alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Patients with mildly elevated ALT or AST up to 1.5 times
             the upper limit of normal (ULN) can be enrolled if total and direct bilirubin are
             normal. Patients with mildly elevated ALP (up to 1.5 x ULN) can be enrolled if
             cholestatic liver disease is excluded and no cause other than fatty liver is
             diagnosed. Patients with Gilbert's syndrome with elevated total bilirubin may be
             enrolled as long as direct bilirubin, hemoglobin and reticulocytes are normal.

          -  Subject has creatinine &gt; 1.5 Ã— ULN; or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)
             using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula â‰¤ 59 mL/min per 1.73 m^2 at
             screening.

             question 4 or 5 on the suicidal ideation portion of the Columbia Suicide Severity
             Rating Scale [C-SSRS]), or who is at significant risk to commit suicide at screening
             and at randomization.

          -  Subject has previously been enrolled in a clinical trial with fezolinetant.

          -  Subject is participating concurrently in another interventional study or participated
             in an interventional study within 28 days prior to screening, or received any
             investigational drug within 28 days or within 5 half-lives prior to screening,
             whichever is longer.

          -  Subject is unable or unwilling to complete the study procedures.

          -  Subject has any condition which makes the subject unsuitable for study participation.
