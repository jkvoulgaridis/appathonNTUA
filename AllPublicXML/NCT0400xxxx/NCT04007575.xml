  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Caroli disease is a very rare pathology that can be revealed early in childhood or in
      adulthood, whose diagnosis is based on Magnetic Resonance CholangioPancreatography, which
      shows the communication of these malformations with the rest of the biliary tree and allows
      to eliminate biliary stenosis. The radiologist has a central role in the diagnostic
      orientation between malformative intra-hepatic bile duct dilatation and obstructive benign or
      malignant intra-hepatic bile duct dilatation dilatation. However, imaging of Caroli disease
      is polymorphous and therefore subject to misinterpretation. The benefit of this research is
      to reduce diagnostic errors by highlighting imaging criteria specific to the Caroli disease

      The Magnetic Resonance CholangioPancreatography will have been performed in all patients
      using different Magnetic Resonance Imaging systems (Gyroscan Intera, Philips Medical Systems,
      Best in the Netherlands, Magnetom Avanto, Siemens Medical Solutions, and Signa Hdxt, General
      Electric Medical Systems) with a free-breathing three-dimensional high-spatial-resolution
      Fast Spin Echo sequence and/or a breath-hold two-dimensional single-shot sequence. Magnetic
      Resonance CholangioPancreatography may also include a Fast Spin Echo weighted T2-weighted
      sequence with fat-spectral saturation, a T1-weighted breath-suppressed gradient echo pulse
      sequence and a chemical shift sequence in phase and opposite phase, in the axial plane, and a
      weighted three-dimensional T1 saturated fat sequence after intravenous administration of
      gadolinium chelate. Images will be analyzed in consensus by two abdominal radiologists on a
      Picture Archiving and Communication System station and compared with the pathological
      results.
