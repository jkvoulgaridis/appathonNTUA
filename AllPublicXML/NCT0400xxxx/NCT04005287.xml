      This is a randomized outpatient, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-site study of the
      safety, tolerability, and exploratory efficacy of topically administered WST-057 (4%
      pirenzepine free base monohydrate) for 24 weeks in subjects with T2DM with peripheral
      neuropathy. Subjects will attend visits at screening (day -45 to -28); day 1 (baseline);
      weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24; and follow-up (week 26). Approximately 60 subjects with T2DM
      with peripheral neuropathy will be randomized to 1 of 4 treatment groups in a 1:1:4:4 ratio:
      placebo control 2 mL (n = 6 subjects), placebo control 4 mL (n = 6 subjects); low dose (2 mL)
      WST-057 (73 mg pirenzepine free base monohydrate) (n = 24 subjects); and high dose (4 mL)
      WST-057 (146 mg pirenzepine free base monohydrate) (n = 24 subjects), with the assumption
      that a total of 50 subjects will complete the study.

      This study is designed with 4 periods: screening, baseline/day 1, outpatient treatment, and
      safety follow-up.

    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluate the efficacy of WST-057 to increase IENFD present in punch biopsies collected in the calf. The nerves will be counted in these punch biopsies and the change in the density will be measured between screening and the week 24 visit. The more nerves or a higher nerve density correlates with better sensation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Norfolk Quality of Life Measure (QOL) Patient Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>24 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Determine the impact of once-daily topical dosing of WST-057 on a QOL measurement. The score from the QOL questionnaire will be tabulated from each visit to determine if an improvement in the quality of life could be measured using this scale between screening and the week 24 visit.All symptoms (1-7) are scored as either a 1 or a 0, indicating a presence or absence of the symptom. With the exception of Questions 31, and 32, the other items are scored according to the 5-point Likert Scale (0-4, &quot;No Problem&quot; to &quot;Severe Problem&quot;). In Question 31, &quot;Good&quot;, the middle item, is scored as O. &quot;Very Good&quot; is scored as -1, Excellent&quot; is scored as -2. &quot;Fair is scored as 1, and &quot;Poor&quot; is scored as 2. In Question 32, &quot;About the Same&quot;, the middle item, is scored as 0. &quot;Somewhat better&quot; is scored as -1, &quot;Much better&quot; is scored as -2. &quot;Somewhat worse&quot; is scored as 1, and &quot;Much worse&quot; is scored as 2. A higher score indicates worse neuropathy-related quality of life score than a lower number.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Quantitative Thermal Threshold (QST) Quantitative Vibration Threshold (QVT)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Determine the impact of once daily dosing of WST-057 on QST and QVT. Sensory and vibration probes attached to an instrument that measures response will be applied to the feet of patients to determine if there is an improvement from the screening visit until 24 weeks post dosing. The lower the threshold for thermal and vibration sensation indicates better feeling or less neuropathy.</description>
