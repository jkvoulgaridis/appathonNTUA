  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as a randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Parallel-Group Proof
      of Concept Study (section A) with a conditional dose finding follow up (Section B) to
      Evaluate the Efficacy on Cervical ripening, Safety, Tolerability and dose response of
      Subcutaneously Administered Tafoxiparin in Term Pregnant, Nulliparous Women with an unripe
      cervix undergoing Labor Induction. If the efficacy and safety profiles of Section A are
      conclusive in favor of tafoxiparin, the study will continue by adding two additional
      tafoxiparin dose groups in Section B.

      Primary objective:

      To assess the efficacy of tafoxiparin on cervical ripening.

      Secondary objective:

      To assess the maternal and neonatal safety, tolerability and dose response of tafoxiparin as
      a supplement therapy in term pregnant, nulliparous women with an unripe cervix undergoing
      labor induction

      Methodology:

      Term pregnant, nulliparous women with unripe cervix and planned for labor induction are
      potential study patients unless enrolled in another study. Subjects may be preinformed about
      the stuyd through the use of advertisement or information at the physician/midwife visits
      during pregnancy and at the hospital admission.

      The whole study includes the following steps:

      Screening and Baseline including informed consent and randomization Study treatment and
      Induction of Labor Labor Discharge
