  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of ischemic myocardium has been the subject of intense research in recent years and
      stem cell therapy is one of the great promises. The InCor laboratory has studied cells from
      different backgrounds as candidates for cell therapy in the context of myocardial infarction.
      Evidence in preclinical studies of the application of stromal (mesenchymal) adipose tissue
      (hASC) in the ischemic heart by both the InCor group (in the animal model in rodents and
      pigs) and others in the literature suggest relevant benefits on the decrease of deterioration
      post-infarction. More recently it has been demonstrated that it arises mainly from the
      formation of new vessels due to paracrine factors, which are secreted by the injected cells.
      There are currently no studies in Brazil in which the safety of injecting different doses of
      hASC cells into the heart has been particularly evaluated. Recently, two studies have
      demonstrated the clinical applicability of hASC in patients with peripheral ischemic disease
      and stroke.

      Thus, the objective of this work will be to test the hypothesis that the implantation of
      autologous stromal cells derived from adipose tissue combined with myocardial
      revascularization surgery in patients with coronary artery disease

    <textblock>
      To test the hypothesis that the implantation of adipose-derived autologous cells derived from
      adipose tissue (hASCs) combined with coronary artery bypass grafting in patients with
      coronary artery disease is safe and well tolerated, besides being able to promote regional
      perfusion increase in the injected segments.
