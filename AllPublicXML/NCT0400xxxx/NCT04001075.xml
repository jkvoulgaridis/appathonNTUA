      This is a two-part study to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics of TJ107 in Chinese patients with advanced solid tumors. Approximately a
      total of 36 ~ 60 patients will be enrolled into the dose escalation cohorts (Part A), and
      expansion cohorts (Part B).
