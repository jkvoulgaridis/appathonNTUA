  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled trial to determine the effectiveness of either morning or evening
      time-restricted feeding on body composition in sedentary, breakfast eating overweight and
      obese adults. Three parallel groups were assigned to either morning fasting (MF), evening
      fasting (EF), or a control group and asked to do the intervention for 6 weeks. Changes in
      body composition (change in weight, percent body fat percent, and percent lean body mass) are
      the primary outcome, and hunger and satiety ratings and physical activity are secondary
      outcome measures.
