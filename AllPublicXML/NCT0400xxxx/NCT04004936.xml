    <textblock>
      This research is being conducted to learn which implementation strategy of EQUIPPED is most
      effective to improve prescribing practices of ED providers toward older Veterans and
      determine the factors influencing implementation of this program to reduce the prescribing of
      PIMs to older adults upon discharge from the ED. The study has three research aims. The
      procedures for these research aims are described below:

        -  Aim 1 - Examining the Impact of Passive Provider Feedback vs. Active Provider Feedback
           Through a Randomized Trial

        -  Aim 2 - Determination of Factors Affecting Organizational Adoption of EQUIPPED

        -  Aim 3 - Micro-Costing the Active and Passive Feedback Versions of the EQUIPPED
           Intervention

      Enhancing Quality of Prescribing Practices for Older Adults Discharged from the Emergency
      Department (EQUIPPED is a multi-component program to reduce the prescribing of potentially
      inappropriate medications (PIMs) to older adults upon discharge from the Emergency Department
      (ED). It has three core components: 1) provider education, 2) Electronic Health Record
      (EHR)-based clinical decision support (CDS) including pharmacy quick order sets to facilitate
      provider order entry, and 3) provider audit and feedback with peer benchmarking. In order to
      inform a Veterans Affairs (VA) system-wide approach to improve prescribing safety for older
      Veterans, the investigators will conduct a study to determine best practices for influencing
      provider prescribing behavior in order to decrease PIMs prescribed for older Veterans at the
      time of ED discharge. The overall goal of this project is to determine which EQUIPPED
      implementation strategy (active or passive feedback) is most effective to reduce prescribing
      of PIMs for older Veterans discharged from the ED.

The overall goal of this project is to determine which EQUIPPED implementation strategy (active or passive feedback) is most effective to reduce prescribing of PIMs for older Veterans discharged from the ED. Eight sites will be randomized to either active feedback with individual, in-person academic detailing or passive feedback delivered via an individualized electronic dashboard.</intervention_model_description>
