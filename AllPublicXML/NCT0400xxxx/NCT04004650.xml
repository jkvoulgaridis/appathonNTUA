    <textblock>
      Background:

      About 700 patients per year undergo an abdominoperineal resection (APR) for distal rectal
      cancer (Dutch Colorectal Audit 2016).Neoadjuvant (chemo)radiotherapy is often used to further
      improve locoregional control. Morbidity after APR is substantial and mainly consisting of
      perineal wound problems in about 35% of the patients. lf primary healing of the perineal
      wound after APR doesn't occur, secondary healing can take up to one year, and there is even a
      small proportion of patients in whom a chronic perineal wound or fistula persists after one
      year. During this long period, intensive wound care is necessary. This results in a heavy
      burden on both patient and health care resources.

      Objective:

      The high morbidity rate of the perineal wound has resulted in a continuing discussion on how
      to close the perineal defect after APR. Our research group recently published the
      BIOPEX-study (NL42094.018.12), in which 104 patients were randomized between primary perinea!
      wound closure and biological mesh closure of the pelvic floor after APR with preoperative
      radiotherapy for rectal cancer. Similar uncomplicated perineal wound healing rate at 30 days
      (Southampton wound score &lt; 2) was found: 63% versus 66%, respectively. The hypothesis behind
      this negative trial result is related to the perineal dead space between the skin and the
      biological mesh. Fluid will accumulate in this dead space with the risk of secondary
      contamination and abscess formation, leading to wound dehiscence and purulent discharge.
      Autologous tissue flaps have been suggested to improve perineal wound healing based on
      several cohort studies. At least in the Netherlands, these flaps are used only for selected
      patients with the large defects and highest risk of wound problems, because of the more
      extensive surgery with added surgical trauma and operative time, and associated donor site
      morbidity. For these reasons, primary perineal closure (control arm of BIOPEX) is still the
      standard of care in the Netherlands.

      A gluteal turnover flap (GT flap) is a small transposition flap trom the unilateral adjacent
      perineal skin and subcutaneous fat, which is flipped into the perineal dead space, and
      stitched with the de-epithelialised dermis to the contralateral pelvic floor remnant.
      Subsequently, the perineal subcutaneous fat and skin are closed over the flap in the midline,
      thereby not adding a donor site scar. A small pilot study trom our group showed that this is
      a promising solution for routine perineal closure after APR.

      Study design:

      In this multicenter single blinded study, eligible patients will be randomized between pelvic
      floor reconstruction using a GT flap (intervention arm) and primary closure of the perineal
      defect (standard arm). The perineal wound healing will be evaluated at 14 days and 1, 3, and
      6 months post-operatively using the Southampton wound scoring system by an independent
      observer.
