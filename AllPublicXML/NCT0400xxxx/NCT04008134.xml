      The Cholera Hospital Based Intervention for 7 Days (CHoBI7) randomized controlled trial for
      transition to scale aimed to: (1) Develop and evaluate scalable approaches to integrate the
      CHoBI7 intervention into the services provided for hospitalized diarrhea patients at health
      facilities in Bangladesh; and (2) Evaluate the ability of the CHoBI7 intervention to lead to
      a sustained uptake of the promoted hand washing with soap and water treatment behaviors and
      significant reductions in diarrheal disease over time.

    <textblock>
      The findings from the recent randomized controlled trial of The Cholera Hospital Based
      Intervention for 7 Days (CHoBI7) demonstrated that this intervention was effective in
      significantly reducing symptomatic cholera infections in intervention households, and had
      significant sustained impacts on hand washing with soap behaviors and improved water quality
      12 months post intervention. Next steps to transition to scale were: (1) Develop and evaluate
      scalable approaches to integrate the CHoBI7 intervention into the services provided for
      hospitalized diarrhea patients at health facilities in Bangladesh; and (2) Evaluate the
      ability of the CHoBI7 intervention to lead to a sustained uptake of the promoted hand washing
      with soap and water treatment behaviors and significant reductions in diarrheal disease over
      time.

    <intervention_name>CHoBI7 health facility program</intervention_name>
    <description>The CHoBI7 health facility program focuses on promoting handwashing with soap and water treatment to diarrhea patients and their household members during the one-week period after the patient is admitted to the health facility, when their household is at highest risk for diarrheal diseases. The CHoBI7 program includes: (1) a WASH pictorial module delivered by a health worker bedside to diarrhea patient and their household members in a health facility on handwashing with soap, water treatment, and safe water storage; and (2) a diarrhea prevention package containing chlorine tablets for water treatment, a soapy water bottle (water and detergent powder), a handwashing station, and a water vessel with a lid and tap for safe drinking water storage. Households are instructed to boil their water once their supply of chlorine tablets is completed.</description>

    <description>The CHoBI7 mHealth (mobile health) program targets five key behaviors: (1) preparing soapy water using water and detergent powder; (2) handwashing with soap at food and stool related events; (3) treating household drinking water using chlorine tablets during the one week high risk period after the diarrhea patient in the household was admitted to the health facility; (4) safe drinking water storage in a water vessel with a lid and tap; and (5) heating of household drinking water until it reaches a rolling boil after the one week high risk period. Participant households receive bi-weekly voice and text messages from the CHoBI7 mHealth program over a 12-month period. These mobile messages are sent using the VIAMO platform (www.viamo.io).</description>
