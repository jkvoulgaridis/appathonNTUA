  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chromosomal aneuploidies are linked with spontaneous miscarriages and abnormal offspring in
      human pregnancies. In addition, some types of aneuploidy are reported to prevent
      implantation. Thus, there is a need to identify the embryos with highest implantation
      potential on in vitro fertilization (IVF) programs.

      Since embryo morphology and kinetics have a weak association with embryo ploidy,
      trophectoderm biopsy plus Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) is becoming a very popular
      approach to determine the embryo chromosomal status. This technique is called Preimplantation
      Genetic Testing for Aneuploidy (PGT-A). Although shown to be efficient, it is invasive for
      the embryo, requires specific technical skills and it remains expensive. Therefore, the
      development of a non-invasive, rapid and cheaper method for assessing embryo ploidy status
      would represent a progress in the field of IVF.

      The non-invasive approach has been explored by some groups that analyzed the Spent Blastocyst
      Medium (SBM) where the embryo was incubated up to the time of transfer or freezing. In daily
      routine, this media is discarded after finishing the culture of the embryo. Importantly,
      though, this media reportedly contains traces of embryonic cell-free DNA (cfDNA) that can
      represent the genetic load of the embryo.

      On the basis of that, the hypothesis of this study is that embryo prioritization according to
      the analysis of the embryonic cfDNA in the SBM could improve ongoing pregnancy rate in 10
      percentual points compared to standard blastocyst transfer based on morphology.

      Current Preimplantation Genetic Testing for Aneuploidy (PGT-A) techniques analyze the full
      chromosome content of a single or few cells with high sensitivity and specificity using
      Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS). Although shown to be efficient, the technique suffers from
      some limitations. It requires an embryo biopsy, specific technical skills and it still
      remains expensive. Therefore, non-invasive techniques for assessing embryo ploidy status are
      sought as an alternative. Such non-invasive approaches would have various advantages over
      current strategies, including the elimination of a costly micromanipulation biopsy procedure
      and the avoidance of risks associated with cell removal. Furthermore, it would be more
      advantageous, especially for those patients who undergo in vitro fertilization (IVF)
      treatment but do not have PGT-A indication or they are not willing to have their embryos
      tested with invasive techniques.

      One of the recent advances in the field is the identification of embryonic cell-free DNA
      (cfDNA) during embryo culture in the lab. It is released to the culture drop (SBM) and
      represents the chromosome content of the embryo. In a recent pilot study, we analyzed the
      concordance rates between trophectoderm (TE) biopsy and SBM. In SBM collected on day 6/7 of
      development, the results were concordant with TE biopsies in 84% of samples, with a
      false-positive rate of 8.6% and a false-negative rate of 2.5%. These findings are encouraging
      and were the base for the design of the current RCT study.

      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the potential clinical benefits of a new
      non-invasive method for PGT-A, based on the analysis of the embryonic cfDNA released into
      SBM.

      Considering a dropout rate of around 30% (treatment or monitoring failures and no day 6/7
      blastocysts to transfer), a total of 872 participants will be randomized before the ovum
      pick-up. They will be allocated on a balanced way (1:1 ratio) in one of the two arms: 1)
      Single Embryo Transfer (SET) on day 6/7 with deferred blastocyst transfer based on the
      chromosomal status according to the analysis of the SBM; 2) SET on day 6/7 with deferred
      blastocyst transfer based on embryo morphology. Reproductive outcomes (defined following The
      International Glossary on Infertility and Fertility Care, 2017) will be compared between the
      two groups.

      Data exported from the clinical histories and source documents will be duly codified to
      protect the clinical and personal information of patients in accordance with the current
      legislation. This information will be exported to an electronic Case Report Form (eCRF). An
      interim analysis of this data is planned once 30% of the recruitment has been reached.
      Besides, the study will be overseen by an independent Data Monitoring Committee after 30% of
      patientsÂ´ recruitment.

    <description>Two scenarios should be considered according to the results in the SBM analysis:
The couple decides to transfer the blastocyst selected according to the SBM result (blastocyst prioritization system).
The couple decides to biopsy the blastocysts (if SBM results show low euploidy score). This PGT-A analysis will be offered for free but the outcome of these transfers will be excluded for the analysis per completed protocol. However, all transfers will be included in the intention-to-treat analysis.</description>
