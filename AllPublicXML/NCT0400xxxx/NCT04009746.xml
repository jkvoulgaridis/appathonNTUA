    <textblock>
      Retrograde Perendoscopic Colangio-Pancreatography (ERCP) is a procedure used for the
      diagnosis and treatment of diseases of the biliary tract, pancreas and papilla of Vater. The
      ERCP allows an indirect vision of the ductal and pancreatic system by means of the endoductal
      injection of contrast medium and the evaluation of these by X-rays. Recently, cholangioscopy
      has been developed using the Spy Glass system, introduced on the market in 2007. This allows
      a direct visualization of the bile duct and pancreatic pathway through the introduction of an
      optical probe inside the ductal system. SpyGlass was developed to overcome the limitations of
      traditional cholangioscopy and allow optically guided therapies for the treatment of stenoses
      and calculations. This is the first cholangioscopy system performed by a single disposable
      operator (SOC), with two dedicated irrigation channels, an optical channel and a therapeutic
      channel with a diameter of 1.2 mm. Everything is placed inside a 10 Fr Spy Scope ™ access and
      delivery catheter (3.3 mm), which allows the tip to flex in 4 directions to facilitate
      maneuverability and directionality in small ducts.

      The irrigation channels of the SOC system allow a fluid flow rate of four to five times
      higher than that which can be obtained through the operating channel of conventional systems.
      In bench simulations with loaded Spy Bite ™ biopsy forceps, the SOC system presented a
      success rate in obtaining access to sites of double interest compared to that of a
      conventional 2-way limited bending choledocoscope.

      Some studies have confirmed the adequacy of the Spy Glass system in providing adequate
      samples for histological diagnosis and successfully facilitating the treatment of stones.

      The new single-use Spy Glass digital display system was introduced in 2014 and no
      multi-center experience on the use of this device is described to date.
