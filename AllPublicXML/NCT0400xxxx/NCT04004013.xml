      A Randomised, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Effect of
      Lifenol® in Improving Bone Status in Postmenopausal Osteopenic Women. 100 postmenopausal
      women will be enrolled to investigate the effect of a 12 month supplementation with Lifenol®
      on bone density DXA parameters and plasma bone biomarkers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osteoporosis is a skeletal disorder characterized by reduced bone mass and deterioration in
      bone architecture leading to an increased bone fragility and fracture risk. Postmenopausal
      women are a particularly at-risk population as the maintenance of bone homeostasis is
      influenced by estrogens. Recently, phytoestrogens have drawn attention as an interesting
      natural way to prevent oestrogen-deficient osteoporosis. Hops contain one of the most potent
      phytoestrogen known to date: 8-prenylnaringenin (8-PN). Lifenol® is a polyphenolic powdered
      extract obtained by a patented process from the female hop flowers (Humulus lupulus L.),
      standardized in 8-PN content.

      Therefore, the present clinical trial aims to determine whether long-term consumption of
      Lifenol® can reduce bone mineral density loss in postmenopausal women with osteopenia taking
      traditional recommended calcium and vitamin D supplementation (1000 mg of calcium and 800 IU
      of vitamin D per day).

      100 postmenopausal women (&gt;1 year post-menopause) will be enrolled to consume during 12
      months either Lifenol® (dose of 100µg of 8-PN per day) or a placebo. Effect of
      investigational product will be measured notably on bone density DXA parameters and plasma
      bone biomarkers.
