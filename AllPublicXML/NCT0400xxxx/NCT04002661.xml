    <masking_description>Study medication (flibanserin 100 mg or identically matched placebo) will be provided in a randomized fashion. Randomization will be 1:1 with a block size of 4. Each individual kit will contain three bottles of 30 tablets of study medication. Each individual bottle within the kit will be labeled sequentially, for example kit 201 will include three bottles of 30 tablets labeled 201A, 201B, 201C. Kits will be numbered consecutively in the randomized order. Once a patient is confirmed eligible to participate in the study, the site will select the lowest numbered kit that has not been assigned to a subject. Subjects will be provided with the &quot;A&quot; bottle at their first visit. The site will mark the subject's study number on the kit and document which subject received that kit number. As subjects return for interim visits, they will be provided the &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; bottles from their previously assigned kit.</masking_description>
