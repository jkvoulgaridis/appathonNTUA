  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter observational clinical study in patients with acute ischemic stroke.
      The main objective is to evaluate the impact of glycemic variability (GV) on stroke outcome
      (mortality, functional recovery) of patients with acute ischemic stroke. Glycemic variability
      will be assessed using a subcutaneous device for continuous glycaemia motorization during 96
      hours; also capillar glycaemia will be measured every 6 hours.

      10 different hospitals in Spain will participate in this study, recruiting a total of 340
      patients. Once the informed consent form is signed, the subcutaneous device for continuous
      glycaemia motorization will be implanted and demographic, comorbidities and treatments of
      every patient will be registered. During the first 96 hours, capillar glycaemia, NIHSS scale,
      HbA1C levels, cerebral recanalization treatment and glycaemia correcting treatments will also
      be reported. In the following days (7, 30 and 90 days after stroke) modified Rankin Scale,
      NIHSS scale and stroke secondary prevention treatments will be evaluated. At day 90, a new
      measure of HbA1C will be done.
