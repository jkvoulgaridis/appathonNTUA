  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD), particularly common in women, has been
      associated with impaired quality of life and risk of recurrent hospitalizations. Several
      studies have also demonstrated increased risk of incident acute coronary events and
      mortality.

      The main objective of the project is to assess the association between coronary artery plaque
      features by coronary CT angiography and long term prognosis in a large unselected population
      undergoing CT coronary angiography due to stable angina and suspected myocardial ischemia
      from the Norwegian Registry for Invasive Cardiology (NORIC) diagnosed with non-obstructive
      CAD by coronary CT angiography.

      Patients with stable angina and non-obstructive coronary artery disease by CT coronary
      angiography will be selected from the Norwegian Registry of Invasive Cardiology (NORIC). This
      is a national quality control registry run and controlled by the Norwegian Institute of
      Public Health (www.fhi.no). All CT coronary angiograms will be reanalyzed using advanced
      post-processing analysis software to assess coronary artery plaque burden, distribution and
      composition. Through linking with the Norwegian Cardiovascular Disease Registry and the Cause
      of Death Registry (www.fhi.no) we will be able to assess the association between long-term
      prognosis (5 years) and coronary artery plaque features.
