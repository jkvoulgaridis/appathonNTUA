  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients and volunteers both with and without medical problems will be recruited; vital sign
      measurements are taken twice with normal equipment and while recording video data at the same
      time. The data collected will allow the Artificial Intelligence to develop the LifeLight
      algorithm to to improve measurement accuracy of its video data based vital signs monitor.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vital signs such as heart rate, blood pressure, breathing rate and oxygen levels currently
      need several pieces of equipment and trained staff in order to be measured properly. The
      LifeLight app measures the same vital signs using a camera in a phone, tablet, laptop or
      smart TV. By using very small changes in the colour of your skin, LifeLight's AI system can
      calculate these values without any extra equipment or training, and without contact.

      The aim of this research study is to improve the accuracy of the LifeLight system with a view
      to a subsequent Validation study to prove the level of accuracy. The investigators will
      recruit patients, staff and visitors, both with and without medical problems, and take vital
      sign measurements twice with normal equipment and while recording video data at the same
      time. This will allow the AI which develops the LifeLight algorithm to make it more accurate,
      prior to a subsequent study which will validate the results.
