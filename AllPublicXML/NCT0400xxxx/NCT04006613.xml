  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the effects of a circuit training rehabilitation program
      on the perceived impact of fatigue in daily life situations and on gait and balance. Half of
      the participants will follow the circuit training program, while the other half will follow
      usual care rehabilitation programs.

    <textblock>
      Approximately 80% of Persons with Multiple Sclerosis rates fatigue among the three most
      disabling symptoms. Aerobic, balance and strength training have already been proved effective
      in rehabilitation, especially for Persons with Multiple Sclerosis. Fifty-two Persons with
      Multiple Sclerosis will be randomly allocated to an experimental group or to a control group
      following usual care rehabilitation programs. Experimental group will follow a circuit
      training rehabilitation program which combines high intensity aerobic training with balance
      and strength training. The study aims to verify the effects of the circuit training program
      on fatigue and on balance in different contexts with respect to usual care rehabilitation
      programs and to investigate effects of rehabilitation on immunological markers.

    <measure>Change from Baseline Modified Fatigue Impact Scale at 6-8 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at 6-8 weeks (after the completion of 16 training sessions)</time_frame>
    <description>Provides an assessment of the effects of fatigue in terms of physical, cognitive and psychosocial functioning. Participant rates on a 5 point Likert scale (from 0=&quot;never&quot; to 4= &quot;Almost Always&quot;) their agreement with 21 statements. Higher numbers indicate greater fatigue.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline Modified Dynamic Gait Index at 6-8 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at 6-8 weeks (after the completion of 16 training sessions)</time_frame>
    <description>Assesses individual's ability to modify balance while walking during 8 specific tasks. Scoring system for each task is based on 3 aspects of walking performance: time to complete (min 0, max 3 points), gait pattern (min 0, max 3 points) and level of assistance (min 0, max 2 points). Total score ranges from 0 to 64 with greater scores indicating better performance.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and at 6-8 weeks (after the completion of 16 training sessions)</time_frame>
    <description>Assesses distance walked over 6 minutes as a sub-maximal test of endurance capacity.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and at 6-8 weeks (after the completion of 16 training sessions)</time_frame>
    <description>Is used to quantify functional lower limb strength. Time taken to stand up and sit down for 5 consecutive times.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline 12 item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale at 6-8 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at 6-8 weeks (after the completion of 16 training sessions)</time_frame>
    <description>Is a self report measure of the impact of MS on walking ability. The scoring gives a 1 (no limitation) to 5 (extreme limitation) option for each item.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale at 6-8 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at 6-8 weeks (after the completion of 16 training sessions)</time_frame>
    <description>A two dimension scale to identify depression and anxiety. 14 items divided inti two 7 items subscales. The respondent rates each item on a 4 point scale (ranging from 0 to 3).Higher scores indicates greater anxiety and/or depression.</description>
