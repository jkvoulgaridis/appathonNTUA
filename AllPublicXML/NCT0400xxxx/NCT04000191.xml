  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine, among patients receiving elective anorectal
      surgery, does application of ice to the perianal area prior to the procedure, lead to use of
      decreased amounts of intravenous (IV) anesthesia? Anorectal surgeries for hemorrhoids,
      fistulas and fissures are done on an outpatient basis under monitored anesthesia care. This
      means patients get sedating medications through an IV but often do not require intubation.
      The difficulty with monitored anesthesia is balancing patient comfort against the risk of
      apnea (not breathing due to over sedation). Application of ice to the perianal area may help
      increase patient comfort, decrease the amounts of medications given for sedation and
      therefore decrease risk and increase recovery from the anesthesia.

      The study design will be a randomized control trial of adults undergoing elective surgery for
      hemorrhoids, fistulas, perianal/perirectal abscess and anal fissure. Participants will be
      randomized in a 1 to 1 ratio using a random number generator to two arms to the study - usual
      care vs. usual care plus ice to numb the anal area prior to incision.

      The outcomes will be measured the same day as the surgery. Prior to leaving the operating
      room the anesthesia team will share with the surgeon the amount of each drug they
      administered. A comfort score will be recorded by the study personnel in the recovery area
      prior to discharge for each participant.

    <description>A validated instrument that consists of a 10cm line will be used to assess post-operative discomfort. Each participant will be asked to make a mark on the line to indicate their level of pain. The left end of the line indicates a score of &quot;No Pain&quot; and the right end of the line indicates &quot;Worst Pain.&quot; The location of the mark will be measured and the pain score will be a ratio of the distance of the mark measured from the &quot;No Pain&quot; end over the total length of the line (10cm).</description>
