  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune, demyelinating disease of the central nervous system
      that causes different levels of disability with motor and sensory loss. Although the signs
      and symptoms of the disease vary according to the location of the lesion; loss of strength,
      spasticity, sensory disturbances, fatigue, ataxia, autonomic dysfunction and decreased visual
      acuity are frequently seen. One of the most important causes of loss of function is balance
      problems. Balance problems, on the other hand, result in falls that cause severe injuries.
      One of the most important goals in the rehabilitation of individuals with MS is to increase
      their performance by minimizing the risk of falling in their daily lives. For medical
      professionals, many medical history questionnaires, self-assessment measures and
      performance-based tests have been developed to determine the risk of falls. Performance-based
      functional assessments consist of a timed walk and walk test, functional skill, balance and
      fall risk, 5 times sit-and-go test and Berg Balance Test, 4 square step test and gait speed
      measurement tests. These tests include the ability to walk forward and revolve around ones
      priorities. However, walking is a more difficult activity as it involves neuromuscular
      control and is dependent on proprioception and protective reflexes. In daily life activities,
      there is a need to walk backwards to perform tasks such as leaning against a chair and
      opening the door. This movement can be quite challenging especially for elderly people with
      neurological deficits. It has been noted that the mechanical measurements of the back
      support, in particular the speed, the step length, and the double support surface are
      significantly reduced in older adults. In a study conducted in geriatric individuals, it was
      shown that walking backward was more sensitive to detect age-related changes in mobility and
      balance than walking forward. The aim of this study is to determine the validity and
      reliability of the 3-meter backwards walk test for evaluating performance-based fall risk in
      individuals with MS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gait and mobility are frequently affected functions in MS and have a negative impact on
      quality of life. Approximately 40% of patients describe walking problems and 70% of
      individuals in this group are reported to be affected by daily living activities. One of the
      most important causes of loss of function is balance problems. Balance problems, on the other
      hand, result in falls that cause severe injuries. One of the most important goals in the
      rehabilitation of individuals with MS is to increase their performance by minimizing the risk
      of falling in their daily lives. Therefore, determining the performance-based fall risk of
      these patients is important in terms of establishing a rehabilitation program and evaluating
      the treatment results. In this context, researchers have recently reported that assessment of
      backward gait may be an important clinical tool to determine the risk of falling, especially
      in individuals with balance problems. However, it has not been investigated whether backward
      gait is often associated with performance and balance tests in individuals with MS who have
      balance problems. The aim of this study is to determine the validity and reliability of the
      3-meter backwards walk test for evaluating performance-based fall risk in individuals with
      MS.

    <time_frame>First and second days</time_frame>
    <description>465/5000 A distance of 3 m is measured and marked with black tape. Individuals are asked to follow the heel and black band. With the 'start' command they are asked to walk backwards quickly. When the distance of 3 m is completed, a stop is instructed. Individuals are not allowed to run during the test. They are allowed to look back if they wish. The assessor walks behind individuals throughout the test. The test is repeated 3 times, the averages are recorded</description>

    <measure>Timed up and go test</measure>
    <time_frame>First day</time_frame>
    <description>At the beginning of the test, individuals sit in a chair. A distance of 3 m is determined in front of it. With the start command, he gets up from his seat and walks for 3 m and turns around and walks back and sits. With the Start command, the time in seconds until the seat is fully seated. A shorter duration means that functional mobility is good.</description>

    <measure>12 Items MS Walking Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>First day</time_frame>
    <description>It is a 12-item questionnaire that questions the effect of gait in MS. The difficulties experienced by individuals during walking activity during the last 2 weeks are questioned. Each item contains 5 points (1; I am not affected at all; 5; I am fully impressed). Low scores indicate better gait disturbance</description>

    <measure>2 min walk test</measure>
    <time_frame>First day</time_frame>
    <description>Individuals are asked to walk as fast as possible without running in a 25 m corridor. The distance they walk for 2 minutes is recorded.</description>

    <measure>25 foot walk test</measure>
    <time_frame>First day</time_frame>
    <description>It is an evaluation to evaluate mobility and leg functions. Individuals are asked to walk safely on a flat surface at the highest speed of 7.62 m. Individuals are allowed to use walking aids if necessary. Individuals are asked to walk 3 times. The average of the times is recorded.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>4 square step test</measure>
    <time_frame>First day</time_frame>
    <description>It aims to evaluate dynamic balance and to step forward, sideways and backwards of objects. The square drawn on the floor is divided into 4 equal parts. The number 1 is written in the lower right corner, up to 4 clockwise. With the Start command, individuals are asked to press on the numbers respectively. It is first asked to take a step forward (number 1 and 2) then left (number 3), then backward (number 4). It is then asked to take steps 4 through 1 again. The time is saved.</description>
