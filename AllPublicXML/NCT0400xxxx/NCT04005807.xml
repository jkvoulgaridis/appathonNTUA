        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject is male or female (not of childbearing potential), 18 to 65 years of age,
             inclusive, at screening.

          -  The subject voluntarily consents to participate in this study and

          -  provides written informed consent before the start of any study-specific procedures.

          -  The subject is willing and able to remain in the study unit for the entire duration of
             the confinement period and return for outpatient visits.

          -  Female subjects must be of non-childbearing potential (defined as surgically sterile
             [i.e., had a bilateral tubal ligation, hysterectomy, or

          -  bilateral oophorectomy at least 6 months before the dose of study drug] or
             postmenopausal for at least 1 year before study drug administration confirmed by FSH
             test at screening).

          -  Male subjects must be surgically sterile (i.e., vasectomy) for at least 3 months
             before screening; or agree to use a condom with spermicide when sexually active with a
             female partner. Male subjects must also agree to refrain from sperm donation for 90
             days after study drug administration.

          -  The subject has a body mass index (BMI) of 18 to 30 kg/m2, inclusive, at screening and

          -  The subject is considered to be in stable health by the investigator

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Any significant acute or chronic medical illness including history or presence of
             clinically significant cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic, renal, hematologic,
             gastrointestinal, endocrine, immunologic, dermatologic, neurologic, oncologic, or
             psychiatric disease

          -  Any recent viral or bacterial infection.

          -  Participated in any clinical study in last 6 weeks.

          -  History of significant drug allergy

          -  History of significant vision, ocular or retinal disorder.

          -  Recent surgery, blood transfusion, drug or alcohol abuse and use of tobacco or
             nicotine containing products in past month.

          -  Evidence of organ dysfunction or any clinically significant deviation from normal in
             physical examination, vital signs, ECGs, or clinical laboratory determinations

        Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria could apply.
