  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) is a heterogeneous group of rare connective tissue hereditary
      diseases responsible for fragility and bone deformity. OI is caused by an autosomal dominant
      mutation of COL1A1 or COL1A2, encoding α1 and α2 of the collagen, regardless of their
      phenotypic severity (1 to 5 OI type).

      This observation suggests the existence of a undetermined mechanism that may be found in
      epigenetic regulation, including particularly micro Ribonucleic Acids (miRs).

      Indeed, these small non-coding miRs are involved in the regulation of major steps of cellular
      processes in different pathologies, especially in bone disease.

      Currently, no study can provide a satisfactory answer.

      This is an etiologic study to reveal the correlation between micro-RNAs (miR) expression and
      the type I or III of the Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI).

      The aim of this study is therefore to identify miRs significantly associated with the
      severity of OI.

    <description>The objective is to validate expression of miRs identified by NGS (Next Generation Sequencing) in blood samples of patients from 3 groups: an Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) type 1 cohort and an OI type 3 cohort, recruited for the study, and a pre-existing group of control patients (issued from cohorts OFELY and MODAM for women, STRAMBO for men).
Expression of the significant miRs identified by NGS will be measured by Reverse Transcription Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) and then these results will be compared with same analysis on blood samples of control patients.</description>
