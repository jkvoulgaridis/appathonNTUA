  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to investigate the effects of robot-assisted hand with visual feedback
      intervention on cortical excitability, brain structure, spasiticity, gross and fine motor of
      upper limb and hand in individuals with stroke. Twenty participants will be recruited in this
      study. They will be allocated to two group: robot-assisted hand combined with traditional
      occupational therapy group (10), only traditional occupational therapy group (10).

    <textblock>
      Participants will be randomized allocated to two groups: robot-assisted hand combined with
      traditional occupational therapy (OT) group and traditional OT group. All participants
      underwent six weeks, 3 sessions per week, and 60 minutes per session training program. Motor
      Evoked Potential (MEP), Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA), Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), Box and
      Block Test (BBT) and Purdue Pegboard Test (PPT) will be assessed before and after
      intervention in all participants.

    <time_frame>Measurement before and after intervention ( week 0 and at the end of week 6) in both groups</time_frame>
    <description>Box and Block Test is composed of a wooden box divided in two compartments by a partition and 150 blocks. The BBT administration consists of asking the client to move, one by one, the maximum number of blocks from one compartment of a box to another of equal size, within 60 seconds.
The box should be oriented lengthwise and placed at the client's midline, with the compartment holding the blocks oriented towards the hand being tested. In order to practice and register baseline scores, the test should begin with the unaffected upper limb.</description>

    <measure>Change of Motor evoked potential (MEP)</measure>
    <time_frame>[Time Frame: Measurement before and after intervention ( week 0 and at the end of week 6) in both groups]</time_frame>
    <description>Motor evoked potential (MEP) is recorded from abductor pollicis brevis muscles following direct transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of motor cortex. All TMS is delivered with the participant seated upright on the chair. Both passive and active conditions, participants are instructed to relax their one hand in the seated position. TMS is delivered over the motor cortex (M1) using a concave double cone coil (Magstim Co., United Kingdom) attached to a BiStim magnetic stimulator (Magstim Co., United Kingdom). To locate the optimal site, stimuli are delivered over various points along the M1. The optimal site is the location on the M1 that evoked the greatest MEP amplitude in abductor pollicis brevis muscles. The onset latency and onset to peak amplitude will be assessed.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of Purdue Pegboard Test (PPT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measurement before and after intervention ( week 0 and at the end of week 6) in both groups</time_frame>
    <description>Purdue Pegboard Test is composed of a board with pins, collars and washers. The board contains two parallel rows with 25 holes in each row and the pins, collars and washers are located in cups at the top of the board. Four subtests constitute the Purdue Pegboard test. In the first three the subject has, within 30 seconds, to place the maximum number of pins: first with the dominated hand, then with the other hand and finally with both hands simultaneously (symmetric task). In the last subtest the subject uses alternate hands in order to make assemblies consisting of pins, collars and washers, in a 60-second period.
The score on the two first pins subtests is the number of pins inserted in the holes. The number of pairs of pins constitutes the score on the third subtest and finally the assembly score consists of the number of pins, collars and washers assembled. Another score is deduced by adding the scores obtained in the first three subtests (right hand + left hand + both hands).</description>

    <measure>Change of Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measurement before and after intervention ( week 0 and at the end of week 6) in both groups</time_frame>
    <description>Modified Ashworth scale (MAS) measures resistance during passive soft-tissue stretching and is used as a simple measure of spasticity. Scoring is recorded as follows:
0: No increase in muscle tone
Slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch and release or by minimal resistance at the end of the range of motion when the affected part(s) is moved in flexion or extension 1+: Slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch, followed by minimal resistance throughout the remainder (less than half) of the Range of motion (ROM)
More marked increase in muscle tone through most of the ROM, but affected part(s) easily moved
Considerable increase in muscle tone, passive movement difficult
Affected part(s) rigid in flexion or extension</description>

    <measure>Change of Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA)-Upper extremity</measure>
    <time_frame>Measurement before and after intervention ( week 0 and at the end of week 6) in both groups</time_frame>
    <description>Fugl-Meyer Assessment-Upper extremity is used to measure upper-limb recovery in stroke rehabilitation studies.The scale has 8 items ranging from upper extremity to coordination/speed. Each item further comprises components, with a total of 33. Scoring is done on a 3-point ordinal scale ranges from 0 (no performance) to 2 (faultless performance). The total score range from 0 (no motor function) to 66 (good motor recovery).</description>
