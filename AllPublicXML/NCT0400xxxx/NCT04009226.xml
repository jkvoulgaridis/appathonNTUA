  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GNE myopathy, an ultra-rare disease, is a severe progressive myopathy that typically presents
      in early adulthood as weakness in the distal muscles of the lower extremities and progresses
      proximally, leading to a loss of muscle strength and function, and ultimately a
      wheelchair-bound state. The rate of progression is gradual and variable over the course of
      10-20 years or longer.

      There is a need to understand the world wide epidemiology of this ultra-rare condition,
      better understand a long-term disease course and the progression of disease-specific
      features, support translational research by evaluating burden illness and support clinical
      research recruitment. Therefore, the study will longitudinally collect information via an
      online patient registry platform.

    <textblock>
      GNE myopathy is an ultra- rare condition. Most of the knowledge is coming from case reports
      or small cohort observations. There is a need to more precisely understand the long-term
      disease course and the progression of disease-specific features of GNE myopathy, and in turn
      characterise the overall burden of this illness. Also, to better understand the disease,
      describe it variability, genotype-phenotype correlation, quality of life, epidemiology,
      health-economics aspects and need for assistive walking devices. Collected data needs to be
      harmonised to be compatible collaborative work with Remudy (Japanese patient registry). This
      collaborative effort will enable the analysis of the largest GNE myopathy data set in the
      world. To this end, this study will collect patient information longitudinally. Upon
      patient's agreement, the registry curator can contact nominated clinicians to request
      additional data or data validation.

      Study Objectives

      The objectives of the study are to:

        -  Longitudinally characterize disease-specific features of GNE myopathy

        -  Characterize the burden of illness and quality of life in patients with GNE myopathy

        -  Support recruitment in research activities

        -  Inform registry participants via newsletters about scientific developments in the GNE
           myopathy field
