  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Developmental Hip Displasia (DDH) can cause various degenerations or compensatory adaptations
      in the spine and knee joint, especially in the hip joint. As a result of adaptations and
      degeneration, these individuals may experience difficulty in walking and functional
      activities, lack of stabilization, decreased muscle strength and activation, and loss of
      balance at varying levels. This situation necessitates a holistic, multifaceted
      rehabilitation in individuals with hip dysplasia. There is no study in the literature that
      shows a specific physiotherapy and rehabilitation program applied to individuals with DDH.
      The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of classical physiotherapy method in
      patients with DDH and to compare the efficacy of classical physiotherapy and core
      stabilization exercise training in treatment.

    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in two groups. Individuals with DDH will be divided into two
      groups as conventional physiotherapy group and core stabilization group. It will be ensured
      that the distribution of the individuals in the groups in a randomized manner, with the
      disease stages of the two treatment groups being the same and the clinical characteristics
      are similar. The population of the study, individuals diagnosed with DDH by the orthopaedic
      surgeon, routinely directed to physiotherapy and rehabilitation, examined by the responsible
      investigator and who were referred to our clinic for the research, will be evaluated
      twice(before and after treatment) and will be treated for 3 times a week for 6 weeks. The
      study will consist of female individuals aged 20-60 who voluntarily agree to participate in
      the study (2 times evaluation and 18 times treatment). It is planned to involve at least 16
      individuals. Individuals who meet the criteria for inclusion in the study and volunteers will
      be included in the study by signing the Informed Voluntary Consent Form. In Hacettepe
      University, Department of Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation, pain severity of subjects with
      DDH will be evaluated with Digital Analogue Scale (SAS) and algometer, joint range of motion
      with goniometer, muscle strength with digital dynamometer, walking with GaitRite device,
      balance with Bertec device and hip functions, kineyophobia, questionnaires will be given to
      evaluate quality of life and mood. After the first evaluation, individuals will be treated 3
      times a week for 6 weeks and then the first evaluations will be done again. The data obtained
      before and after treatment will be compared between the two treatment groups.
