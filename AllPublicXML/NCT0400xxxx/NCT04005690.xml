      This phase II trial feasibility study aims to determine how cobimetinib or olaparib works in
      patients with pancreatic cancer. Validation of cobimetinib and olaparib molecular targets
      will be explored by comparing pre-treatment biopsies with post-treatment specimens. This
      knowledge will help design future biomarker driven trials to determine whether giving
      cobimetinib plus olaparib will work better than standard treatments in patients with
      pancreatic cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Assess the feasibility of collecting tumor tissue for biomarker evaluation prior to and
      after window therapy with either cobimetinib or olaparib.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess preliminary safety and tolerability of cobimetinib. II. Assess preliminary safety
      and tolerability of olaparib.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Identify predictive biomarkers of sensitivity to cobimetinib or olaparib. II. Identify
      emerging mechanism(s) of resistance to cobimetinib or olaparib. III. Determine cellular and
      molecular changes in pancreatic tumor cells exposed to cobimetinib or olaparib.

      IV. Identify tumor markers suggestive of combinatorial therapy that could overcome resistance
      to therapy.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive cobimetinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-10 in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Within 12-24 hours, patients undergo biopsy
      or surgery as clinically appropriate per institutional standards for management of patient's
      disease.

      ARM II: Patients receive olaparib PO twice daily (BID) on days 1-10 in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Within 12-24 hours, patients undergo biopsy or surgery
      as clinically appropriate per institutional standards for management of patient's disease.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
