      This trial studies the impact of early mobility tracked with a 3-dimensional (3D) motion
      tracking technology (XSENS) on post-surgery recovery in patients undergoing oncologic
      surgeries. Xsens uses wireless measurements which could be used in clinical settings to
      objectively measure movement patterns (the joint range of movement and the distance of
      movement) during functional activities. Post-surgery mobility tracking may help doctors to
      identify the minimum required level of mobility after inpatient oncologic surgeries to
      enhance early post-surgery recovery and decrease early post-surgery complications.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate objectively using evidence based randomized controlled trial the impact of
      early mobility (first day after the surgery) after any inpatient oncologic procedures on
      early recovery of postoperative course.

      II. Try to find out the minimum level of postoperative mobility that needed for early
      postoperative course recovery by objective assessment of range of movement for each
      participant using 3D motion tracking system (Xsens).

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients walk one to two laps around the ward twice per day, and have mobility tracked
      with Xsens over 5-10 minutes, until discharge from hospital. Patients also mobilize (walk out
      of the bed) on first day post-surgery under supervision and assistant of attending nurse in
      the floor if the clinical situation allows.

      ARM II: Patients walk for minimum 30 minutes per day and mobility is tracked with Xsens over
      5-10 minutes up to discharge from hospital. Patients also mobilize (walk out of the bed) on
      first day post-surgery under supervision and assistant of attending nurse in the floor if the
      clinical situation allows.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 30 days post discharge.
