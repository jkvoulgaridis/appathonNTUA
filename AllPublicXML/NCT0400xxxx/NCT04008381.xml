      This study investigates the potential curative properties of ex-vivo expanded gamma delta
      T-cells obtained from a blood-related donor for patients with relapsed or refractory acute
      myeloid leukemia.

      This is a single-center, open-label, single-arm study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      ex-vivo expanded γδ T-lymphocytes in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid
      leukemia. PBMCs will be separated from peripheral blood of suitable donors. After making them
      potential cancer killer γδ T Cells, they will be infused to the patients as an immunotherapy
      treatment.
