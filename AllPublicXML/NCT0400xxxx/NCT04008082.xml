  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From date of study drug administration until date of death from any cause (approximately 2.8 years)</time_frame>
    <description>OS is calculated as the period from the day of starting administration to the day of death from any cause.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Presence or absence of factors with a possible influence on OS</measure>
    <time_frame>From date of study drug administration until date of death from any cause (approximately 2.8 years)</time_frame>
    <description>Factor analysis is performed according to the category of participant background (aetiology of chronic liver disease, baseline alpha-fetoprotein concentration etc), lenvima administration status and treatment situation before and after administration of lenvima, and factors affecting OS are examined. Appropriate statistical methods (Cox regression analysis, etc.) will be used to examine the relationship of OS with various factors in order to identify the factors affecting survival.</description>
