  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed research study will assess the impact of a newly developed, breath-controlled
      app and custom-designed tablet (equipped with a breathing sensor) on the patient and parent's
      preoperative anxiety and anesthesia induction experience.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aim 1: Determine whether induction distress differs between patients using the
      breathing-controlled app and those using standard care interventions: The investigators will
      measure patient compliance with induction using the Child Induction Behavioral Assessment
      (CIBA). The investigators predict that patients using the breathing-controlled app will
      demonstrate significantly better induction compliance. Older children (ages 6-8) are
      typically more cooperative with induction than younger children (ages 3-5 years). Both age
      groups will be studied to determine whether there are age-related differences impacting
      receptiveness to the app.

      Aim 2: Compare patient anxiety between the breath-controlled app and control group. The
      investigators will measure child preoperative anxiety (modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety
      Scale, the &quot;mYPAS-SF&quot;). The investigators predict there will be significantly lower anxiety
      (mYPAS-SF) during induction for children in the breath-controlled app group.

      Aim 3: Compare parent anxiety between the breath-controlled app and control group. The
      investigators will measure parental anxiety using the Visual Analog Scale for Anxiety, the
      &quot;VAS-A&quot;. The investigators predict there will be significantly lower anxiety (mYPAS-SF)
      during induction for parents in the breath-controlled app group.

      Aim 4: Determine overall family satisfaction with the induction experience. A survey will be
      administered to assess satisfaction levels with induction behavioral interventions and
      determine whether these scores differ between the intervention and standard care group. The
      investigators predict that satisfaction scores will be higher in the intervention group than
      the control group.
