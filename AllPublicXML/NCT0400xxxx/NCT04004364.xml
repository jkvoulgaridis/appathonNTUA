      first episode psychosis.

      The RAISE ETP study, designed and conducted by our group, signaled that a Coordinated
      Specialty Care (CSC) model could be feasibly delivered in community mental health clinics in
      multiple states and was effective. Since then, with the support of SAMSHA block grants to
      states, there are CSC programs across the nation.

      The goal of this project is to develop a learning health system with sites providing CSC
      treatment of first-episode psychosis (FEP). Sites are drawn from five states: Connecticut,
      Florida, Michigan, Oklahoma and South Carolina. They vary in populations served, levels of
      funding available and research experience. All are committed to advancing the development of
      CSC using a health learning system model, to implementing a practical assessment strategy to
      enhance outcome assessment and to conducting research to improve outcomes that will be
      meaningful to the full range of stakeholders.
