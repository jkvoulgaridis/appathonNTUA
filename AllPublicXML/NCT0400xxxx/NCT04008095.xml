  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A lot of studies have demonstrated the prognostic value of post therapy 18F-FDG PET/CT in the
      management of uterine cervical cancer. Post therapy 18F-FDG PET/CT is usually requested by a
      lot of clinicians.

      Whereas 18F-FDG PET/CT is useful for prognosis in the follow-up, data are yet insufficient to
      clearly establish a formal recommendation.

      This prospective multicenter observational study will evaluate the interest of post therapy
      18F-FDG PET/CT in clinical management (within 2 months of treatment) in patients with
      cervical cancer at an advanced stage.

      Main outcome :

      The therapeutic impact of post therapy 18F-FDG PET/CT (within 2 months after the end of
      therapy) will be evaluated on the complete results included MRI.

      Investigators will compare :

        -  decision of clinicians without 18F-FDG PET/CT results

        -  and decision of clinicians knowing entire results included results of 18F-FDG PET/CT.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With approximately 3000 new cases estimated in France on 2017, the uterine cervical cancer is
      the twelfth cancer cause in women, responsible for 1000 deaths per year.

      Management of uterine cervical cancer is well defined before treatment, especially for
      imaging including systematically pelvic MRI and 18F-FDG PET/CT.

      A lot of studies have demonstrated the prognostic value of post therapy 18F-FDG PET/CT, due
      to semi quantitative parameters study, like the SUV max and delta SUV between pre and post
      therapy 18F-FDG PET/CT or qualitatively with the persistence of positive 18F-FDG PET/CT at
      the end of therapy.

      Whereas 18F-FDG PET/CT is useful for prognosis in the follow-up, data are yet insufficient to
      clearly establish a formal recommendation.

      Nevertheless, post therapy 18F-FDG PET/CT is still usually requested by a lot of clinicians.

      Furthermore, the group of Parisian public hospital (AP-HP) has established a guide for the
      management of cervical cancer (2016) and recommends to systematically realize a 18F-FDG
      PET/CT after treatment for advanced cervical cancer.

      Main purpose :

      Evaluate the role of post therapy 18F-FDG PET/CT in clinical management (within 2 months of
      treatment) in patients with uterine cervical cancer at an advanced stage.

      Main outcome :

      The therapeutic impact of post therapy 18F-FDG PET/CT (within 2 months after the end of
      therapy) will be evaluated on the complete results included MRI.

      Investigators will compare

        -  decision of clinicians without 18F-FDG PET/CT results

        -  and decision of clinicians knowing entire results included results of 18F-FDG PET/CT.
