      Primary Objectives:

        -  Dose Escalation Part A: To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SAR442085
           administered as a single agent in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma
           (RRMM), and determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for the subsequent Expansion
           Part B

        -  Dose Expansion Part B: To assess the antitumor activity of single agent of SAR442085 at
           the RP2D in patients with RRMM

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To characterize the safety profile of SAR442085

        -  To characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) profile of SAR442085 when administered as a
           single agent

        -  To evaluate the potential immunogenicity of SAR442085

        -  To assess preliminary evidence of antitumor activity in the Dose Escalation Part A

      toxicity, withdrawal of informed consent, or other reason why investigator considers it
      appropriate to discontinue study medication. Once permanently discontinued, study medication
