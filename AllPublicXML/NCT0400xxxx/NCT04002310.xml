      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Men and women with Geographic Atrophy (GA) secondary to Age-related Macular
             Degeneration (AMD): the GA lesion at least 0.75 disk areas in size

          -  Fellow eye is not required to have GA

          -  Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) of 20/100 to 20/400 Snellen in the study eye
             equivalent measured by the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study protocol.

          -  Age ≥ than 50 years

          -  Best-corrected VA in the non-study eye must have a better best-corrected VA compared
             to the study-eye, if both eyes are eligible and have identical VA the investigator may
             select the study eye

          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) cannot be included. Men able to father a child
             must be ready and able to use highly effective methods of birth control per
             International Council on Harmonisation (ICH) M3 (R2) that result in a low failure rate
             of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly. A list of contraception
             methods meeting these criteria is provided in the patient information.

          -  Signed informed consent consistent with International Council on Harmonisation Good
             Clinical Practice (ICH GCP) guidelines and local legislation prior to participation in
             the trial, which includes medication washout and restrictions

          -  Not under any administrative or legal supervision or under institutionalization due to
             regulatory or juridical order

        Exclusion criteria

          -  GA in either eye because of causes other than AMD

          -  History of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in the study eye and in the fellow eye

          -  Previous treatment in the study eye for GA secondary to AMD within 6 months prior to
             screening visit (ongoing therapy with vitamin and mineral supplements is allowed)

          -  Additional eye disease in the study eye that could compromise

               -  best corrected VA (BCVA) with visual field loss,

               -  uncontrolled glaucoma intraocular pressure (IOP&gt;24),

               -  clinically significant diabetic maculopathy,

               -  anterior segment and vitreous abnormalities in the study eye that would preclude
                  adequate observation with Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT)

          -  Any prior intraocular surgery in the study eye other then uneventful lens replacement

             capsulotomy permitted, more than 3 month prior to enrollment in the study eye

          -  Current or planned use of medications known to be toxic to the retina, lens or optic
             nerve (e.g. desferoximine, chloroquine/hydrochloroquine, chlorpromazine,
             phenothiazines, tamoxifen, nicotinic acid, and ethambutol)

          -  Significant disease or other medical conditions (as determined by medical history,
             examination and clinical investigations at screening) that may, in the opinion of the
             investigator result in the any of the following:

               -  Put the patient at risk because of participation in the study

               -  Influence the results of the study,

               -  Cause concern regarding the patient's ability to participate in the study, e.g.
                  cardiac (including tachycardia), gastro-intestinal, hepatic, renal, metabolic,
                  dermatologic, neurological, haematological, oncological and psychiatric.

          -  Patients with malignancy for which the patient has undergone resection, radiation or
             chemotherapy within past 5 years. Patients with treated basal cell carcinoma or fully
             cured squamous cell carcinoma are allowed.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients used in the Investigational Medical
             Product (IMP) formulation, or any of the medications used

          -  Active intraocular inflammation in the study eye

          -  Active infectious conjunctivitis in either eye
