      Patients with diagnosis of spontaneous abortion are enrolled in the cohort, in the cohort of
      patients who met the criteria, 3ml of whole blood intravenous and 5ml of urine were taken for
      heavy metal level examnation. Part of the villi tissue was sent for genetic testing, and the
      results were traced. In addition, about 10g of villi tissue was frozen for testing. Patients
      with normal genetic results of villi tissue will have villus samples go through oxidative
      stress level detection.

      From May 1, 2019, patients with diagnosis of spontaneous abortion are enrolled in the cohort,
      exclusion criteria were: not long-term residents in Peking; Inconvenient for following up;
      Long-term of drug use; Cesarean section scar pregnancy and other high-risk pregnancy;
      Diagnosis of pregnancy beyond 12 weeks.

      In the cohort of patients who met the criteria, 3ml of whole blood intravenous and 5ml of
      urine were taken on the day of admission for curettage and suction, and the levels of heavy
      metals were tested. Part of the villi tissue was sent for genetic testing, and the results
      were traced. In addition, about 10g of villi tissue was frozen for testing. Patients with
      normal genetic results of villi tissue will have villus samples go through oxidative stress
      level detection.
