      This trial is a single-center two arm, open label observational prospective study, that will
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of crisaborole ointment, 2% alone compared to a combination
      therapy of crisaborole and a topical corticosteroid (Triamcinolone Acetonide Ointment, 0.1%)
      over a 8 week period for the treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis.

    <textblock>
      Male and female subjects, ages 2 to 79 with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis and having an
      Investigator's Global Assessment Score on a five point scale of 2 or 3 will be enrolled.

      Sixteen subjects will be enrolled and randomized 1:1. Eight subjects will be randomized to
      receive crisaborole alone which will be applied twice daily, once in the morning and once in
      the evening for 8 weeks. Eight subjects will be randomized to receive a combination therapy
      of a topical corticosteroid (Triamcinolone Acetonide Ointment, 0.1% and crisaborole ointment,
      2% which will be applied twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening for the
      first two weeks, followed by crisaborole alone for the following six weeks.

      Subjects who meet the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria at the Screening
      visit will return to the clinic on Week 0 for Baseline measures and to start treatment which
      will continue for a period of 8 weeks. Subjects who do not need to undergo a wash-out period
      may combine the Screening visit and Baseline visit.

      Screened subjects requiring a wash-out period (up to 4 weeks) prior to baseline measurements
      and beginning treatment will attend a total of 4 visits.

      Following the Baseline (Week 0) visit, all subjects will report to the clinic for efficacy
      and safety evaluations at weeks 2, 4 and at the end of study at week 8.
