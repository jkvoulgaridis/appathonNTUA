  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During the first four weeks of the trial, participants will be randomly assigned to one of
      four groups: three groups will receive fixed doses of TransCon PTH and one group will receive
      placebo. TransCon PTH or placebo will be administered as a subcutaneous injection using a
      pre-filled injection pen. Neither trial participants nor their doctors will know who has been
      assigned to each group. After the four weeks, participants will continue in the trial as part
      of a long-term extension study. During the extension, all participants will receive TransCon
      PTH, with the dose adjusted to their individual needs. This is a global trial that will be
      conducted in, but not limited to, the United States, Canada, Germany, Denmark, and Norway.

             risk from the investigational product or procedures, including treated malignancies
             that are likely to recur within the approximate 1-year duration of the trial.
