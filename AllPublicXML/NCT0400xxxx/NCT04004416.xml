  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to better understand mental illness and will test the hypotheses
      that while viewing affective stimuli, patient groups will show increased blood oxygenation
      level dependent (BOLD) signal by fMRI after lorazepam.

      This study will enroll participants between the ages of 16 and 60, who have a psychotic
      illness (such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and schizoaffective disorder). The study
      will also enroll eligible participants without any psychiatric illness, to compare their
      brains.

      The study will require participants to have 3-4 sessions over a few weeks. The first session
      (may be over two visits) will include a diagnostic interview and several questionnaires
      (qols) to assess eligibility. Subsequently, there will will be two separate functional
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) sessions in which lorazepam or placebo will be given prior
      to the MRI. During the fMRI the participants will also be asked to answer questions.
      Additionally, the participants will have their blood drawn, women of child bearing potential
      will have a urine pregnancy test, vital signs taken, and asked to complete more qols.

The PI will also upload data gathered in this proposal to an National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)-designated central data, NIMH Data Archive (NDA), as prescribed by NOT-MH-15-012, working with NIMH program to determine the timing and extent of data sharing. This includes formulation of an enrollment strategy that will obtain the information necessary to generate a Global Unique Identifier (GUID) for each participant.
The consent form will include language indicating the intention to upload de-identified data into the central archive, and permission will be obtained from University of Michigan Institutional Review Board to do so. The budget includes a data manager to cover the costs of managing the data, building the data dictionary and harmonizing it with data structures.</ipd_description>
