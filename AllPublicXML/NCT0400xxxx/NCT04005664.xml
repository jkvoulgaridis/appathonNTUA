    <textblock>
      This single centre prospective alternating intervention study will aim to compare
      prophylactic phenylephrine given in the first litre of Ringers lactate as co-load in healthy
      patients having an elective caesarean section under spinal anaesthesia at Edendale Hospital
      to the existing national protocol guideline - for the treatment of obstetric spinal
      hypotension.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Spinal anaesthesia is currently standard of care for patients undergoing caesarean section.
      Obstetric spinal hypotension is a common and important problem, related to important maternal
      and foetal outcomes. The prevention and treatment of spinal hypotension has been well
      researched in resource-rich settings, a context different from that encountered in the South
      African setting. It has been previously shown that a prophylactic phenylephrine infusion is
      effective in resource-limited settings, but this method is still dependent on the
      availability of an infusion pump.The ideal dose offering the best risk to benefit profile is
      25 to 50 mcg/min. It has recently been shown that a prophylactic phenylephrine infusion,
      administered by an infusion pump, appears safe and effective in resource-constrained
      environments. However, some institutions in South Africa are limited by a lack of available
      infusion pumps. There is an urgent need to translate these research findings into a pragmatic
      management strategy that is safe and effective where this equipment is lacking. A 18g Jelco
      allows flow of approximately 100 ml/min in the absence of a pressure bag: therefore with 500
      mcg in 1000 ml of ringers lactate and a fully opened line, a maximum dose of 50 mcg.min-1
      will be achieved. If the rate is 50 ml/min (20 minutes for the first litre) the dose will be
      25 mcg.min-1. This dose range will offer maximum benefit with low risk of side effects.

      This exploratory study will establish if a phenylephrine (500 mcg) bolus, added to the first
      litre of Ringers lactate given as a co-load, is an effective and safe means to prevent post
      obstetric spinal hypotension. This regime will be compared to the existing South African
      national protocol of the management of obstetric spinal hypotension. The findings of this
      study will provide valuable information regarding a safe and potentially effective means to
      prevent obstetric spinal hypotension.

    <description>Hypotension occurring under spinal anaesthesia (SBP &lt; 90mmHg) requires pharmacological treatment. The pharmacological management of hypotension, once diagnosed, will be the same regardless of the protocol being used. If the heart rate is greater than 70 beats per minute, phenylephrine will be administered in a dose of 50-100 mcg as an intravenous bolus. If the heart rate is less than 70 beats per minute, ephedrine will be administered in a dose of 5-10 mg. The dose within this range will be decided by the attending anaesthetist. In both arms, Ringers Lactate fluid should run fast if hypotension occurs.</description>

    <description>Phenylephrine 500ug will be added to the first litre of ringer's lactate infused on initiation of spinal anaesthesia. If the phenylephrine infusion protocol is being used, and the mean arterial pressure (MAP) rises to greater than 20% of the initial MAP, and where this rise in MAP is not due to a recent bolus of either phenylephrine or ephedrine (within 2 minutes), the Ringers Lactate infusion will be switched off. The pharmacological management of hypotension, once diagnosed, will be the same regardless of the protocol being used. If the heart rate is greater than 70 beats per minute, phenylephrine will be administered in a dose of 50-100 mcg as an intravenous bolus. If the heart rate is less than 70 beats per minute, ephedrine will be administered in a dose of 5-10 mg. In both arms, Ringers Lactate fluid should run fast if hypotension occurs.</description>
