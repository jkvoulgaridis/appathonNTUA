  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A common procedure in children with cancer is the spinal tap, or lumbar puncture (LP), in
      which a needle is inserted into the spinal canal. In this population, LPs are most commonly
      performed to collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF, the liquid surrounding the brain and spinal
      cord) for diagnostic testing, and to inject medications including chemotherapy. Local
      analgesic (pain control medicine) during pediatric LP procedures is underutilized and not
      standardized. The first local analgesic routinely used for LP procedures was lidocaine
      injection. The discovery of the topical EMLA (lidocaine 2.5%/prilocaine 2.5%) cream, approved
      by the FDA for local skin use in pediatric patients, has provided an additional option for
      local LP analgesia. A comparison between topical EMLA vs lidocaine injection for LP pain
      control in the pediatric population has not been performed. Pediatric oncology patients often
      require serial LPs for diagnostics purposes and/or chemotherapy delivery. Due to a lack of
      standardization of LP analgesia in this population, the investigators have designed a
      prospective, single-blind, randomized control crossover trial to examine EMLA vs. lidocaine
      injection in reducing pain associated with LP in children being treated for leukemia or
      lymphoma.
