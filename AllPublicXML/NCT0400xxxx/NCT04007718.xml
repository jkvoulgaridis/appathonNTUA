  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High rates of anxiety and worry has been observed in people with Parkinson's (PwP). Previous
      research outside of PwP has shown that individuals with anxiety have a habit of interpreting
      ambiguous information in a negative manner (i.e., interpretation bias), and that it is
      possible to encourage a more positive interpretation bias through an online training.

      In the current study, the aim is to test the acceptability and feasibility of an online
      training program that aims to encourage more positive interpretation bias in high worrying
      PwP. Participants complete an online baseline assessment, and are then invited to complete
      ten training sessions over a period of three weeks followed by another assessment and
      follow-up assessments (at 1 month &amp; 3 months). Participants are randomized into either the
      active condition or control condition. Across both conditions, participants will listen to
      short, everyday scenarios which are ambiguous (could end positively or negatively). In the
      active condition, a positive ending is given in half of the scenarios. In the other half,
      participants are instructed to imagine positive endings to ambiguous scenarios. In the
      control condition, all scenarios end ambiguously and no instructions are given about
      imagining positive endings.

      The primary aim of the study is to test the acceptability and feasibility of the online
      training platform. Participants will complete a feasibility interview after completing the
      training. Specifically, the acceptability of the following will be tested: i) the online
      nature of the training (and lack of face-to-face contact); ii) being randomised into one of
      the two conditions; iii) the number and duration of the assignments; and iv) the text
      messages/e-mail/phone call reminders to complete the assignments. The feasibility of the
      online training platform will be judged on the i) rate of recruitment; ii) retention rates
      during the training; iii) adherence to the study (i.e., number of assignments completed); iv)
      retention rates at follow-up. The secondary aim is to estimate the effect size of the active
      condition (vs. control; on worry scores post-training, and at follow-ups) to inform power
      analyses for a future randomised control trial.

      It is hypothesised that the training will be acceptable and feasible in a high worrying PwP
      sample. It is also hypothesised that the training will be effective in reducing worry and
      improving interpretation bias.

    <description>Whether scores on the scrambled sentences task have changed specifically in the training condition.

    <time_frame>Comparing baseline scores to post-training (assessment 2; completed approximately 3 weeks later) scores</time_frame>
    <description>Whether scores on the recognition test have changed specifically in the training condition. The recognition test involves reading ten (ambiguous) scenarios and subsequently rating 4 sentences per scenario on how similar in meaning the (positive and negative) sentences are to the original scenario. Scores are based on how highly negative sentences are scored compared to positive sentences (i.e., higher scores = more negative interpretation bias).</description>
