  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to investigate the limited efficacy of these innovative
      surgical solutions in treatment of Early Onset Scoliosis (EOS) in terms of maintaining
      reduction while maintaining spinal growth. The secondary aim is to compare both devices for
      these and other parameters as well as safety.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: EOS is a severe and potentially life-threatening disorder since a disturbance of
      spinal development leads to impaired development of the trunk, with cardio-respiratory
      failure as a result, often early in adult life. Several innovative solutions have been
      developed to treat growing children with severe EOS. The SDS device was developed internally
      at the dpt. of orthopedics at the UMC Utrecht, the Netherlands, the MID-C device was
      developed by the company ApiFix Ltd.

      Objective: The primary aim of this study is to investigate the limited efficacy of these
      innovative surgical solutions in treatment of early onset scoliosis in terms of maintaining
      reduction while maintaining spinal growth. The secondary aim is to compare both devices for
      these and other parameters as well as safety.

      Study design: A feasibility study using two prospective cohorts according to an open label
      randomized clinical trial (RCT) design. The study will be done in two tertiary referral
      centers (UMC Utrecht and Amsterdam UMC). Primary endpoints are maintenance of curve
      correction as well as complications. These data will be compared to a recently described
      cohort of patients that received a &quot;standard treatment&quot; (Magnetically controlled growing rod
      (MCGR)). The same endpoints as well as secondary outcomes, will be compared between the two
      new treatments.

      Study population: Children with idiopathic(-like) early onset scoliosis with an indication
      for a growing rod implant.
