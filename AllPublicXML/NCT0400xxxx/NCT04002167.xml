  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is to test and validate a novel intervention that integrates computerized
      cognitive training with real-time neuromonitoring and neurofeedback to enhance working memory
      by probing the individualized neural systems underlying working memory. We will test the
      proposed intervention on children with ADHD with working memory deficits. The R61
      proof-of-concept phase will assess the target engagement, effective dose and feasibility.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF), Working Memory t-score</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>BRIEF assesses everyday behavior associated with specific domains of the executive functions. BRIEF working memory t-score ranges from &lt;30 to &gt;100 with higher scores indicating larger impairment in working memory.</description>

    <measure>Change in Wide Range Assessment of Memory and Learning 2 (WRAML-2), General Memory Index score</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>WRAML-2 assesses clinical issues in learning and memory functions. WRAML-2 Working Memory Index score ranges from 50 to 150 with higher scores indicating better working memory performance</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Conners 3rd Edition ADHD Index and Inattention t-score</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Conners 3 will be used to measure changes in clinical ADHD symptoms. Conners 3 ADHD index score ranges from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating more ADHD symptoms. Inattention t-score ranges from &lt;30 to &gt;100 with higher scores indicating more inattention problems.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Developmental NEuroPSYchological Assessment II (NEPSY-II) composite score</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>NEPSY-II consists of a set of subtests measuring cognitive functions required for success in school. The subtests include auditory attention &amp; response, inhibition, word-list interference, and comprehension of instructions. The scaled scores on all subtests range from 0 to 20. The composite score will be quantified using principal component analysis on accuracy across these subtests.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Continuous Performance Test (CPT) accuracy</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>CPT is standard test for measuring vigilance, sustained attention and inhibitory control.</description>
