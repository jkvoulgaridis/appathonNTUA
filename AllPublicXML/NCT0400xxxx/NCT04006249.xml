  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects tissues surrounding the teeth.
      It is strongly associated with the major pathogenic &quot;red complex&quot;, including Porphyromonas
      gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia and Treponema denticola1 and thus is considered an
      infection. Recent advances in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease have suggested that
      polymicrobial synergy and microbiota dysbiosis together with a dysregulated immune response
      can induce inflammation-mediated damage in periodontal tissues2-4. Interestingly, currently
      periodontitis is associated with a growing number of systemic diseases, including
      cardiovascular diseases, adverse pregnancy outcomes, diabetes5-7 and hereditary
      haemochromatosis8.
