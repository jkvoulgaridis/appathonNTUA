  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research project incorporates a series of studies to investigate the relationship
      between physical performance (e.g. tests of strength, balance and walking distance) and
      physical activity (activity measured in day to day life) in people with COPD and other
      chronic lung diseases.

      The research project incorporates the following components:

      Study 1) A prospective, observational study, to assess the relationship between a
      comprehensive set of measures of walking ability, strength and balance, and daily physical
      activity in people with chronic lung disease. Patients will attend a single assessment
      session to evaluate physical capacity. They will also wear a physical activity monitor for a
      week following completing these tests to assess physical activity and aspects of physical
      performance. Participants will also be invited to return two months later to provide evidence
      about the repeatability of measurements.

      Study 2) A parallel study comparing assessment of performance during six-minute walk tests by
      an observer to a semi-automated assessment using an activity monitor worn by the patient.
      This will involve a single visit and be carried out during walking tests carried out as part
      of routine clinical care.

      Study 3) A qualitative study to investigate experiences and perceptions of participants of
      dance groups for people with chronic lung disease, as a novel form of physical activity. This
      will be used to inform the design of subsequent trials of dance interventions for chronic
      lung disease.

    <description>Assessed using the Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) scale. This is a self completed measure of balance confidence during common activities of daily living. It includes 16 questions which participant give a percentage confidence response with 0% being not confident at all and 100% being completely confident. There is also a total score out from 0% (least confident) to 100% (most confident) for overall balance confidence, which average created by combining the scores given for the separate questions.</description>
