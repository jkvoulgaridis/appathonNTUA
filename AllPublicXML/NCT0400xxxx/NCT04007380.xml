  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial will examine the efficacy of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)
      therapy in improving psychosocial, neurocognitive and behavioral consequences of
      moderate-to-severe sleep-related breathing disorders (SRBDs) in people living with spinal
      cord injury (SCI).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SCI is a potentially catastrophic event for individuals who may sustain motor, sensory, and
      autonomic deficit, as well as secondary conditions including SRBDs. The SRBDs include
      central, obstructive and mixed sleep apnea that can occur in up to 50% of the paraplegics and
      up to 91% of the motor complete tetraplegics. Although the frequency of SRBDs after SCI is
      much greater than in able-bodied people, this condition is still a largely under-recognized
      in the SCI population.

      With this, the investigators hypothesize that regular use of CPAP for treatment of
      moderate-to-severe SRBDs in individuals living with SCI significantly improve their fatigue,
      depressive symptoms, anxiety, cognitive impairment, quality of life, and social and work
      participation. This research project will include: (i) a single-arm clinical trial to
      evaluate the efficacy of nightly use of CPAP for 4 consecutive months in the management of
      moderate-to-severe SRBDs among 24 adults with subacute to chronic, cervical or thoracic,
      complete or incomplete SCI; and (ii) a qualitative study of the challenges experienced by the
      24 people with SCI who undergo an unattended-hospital or home-based sleep study for diagnosis
      of SRBDs followed by CPAP therapy.

      Overall, this clinical study has the potential to ultimately improve fatigue, mood,
      cognition, quality of life, and social and work participation of people living with SCI, by
      examining under-explored links with the SRBDs.

    <description>Self-reported scale that consists of 12 Likert-type items assessing six dimensions of sleep problems: sleep disturbance (i.e. difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep), snoring, respiratory problems, sleep quantity, sleep adequacy, and daytime somnolence). Higher scores for the domains of sleep disturbance, somnolence and sleep indices indicate worse sleep disturbances, whereas lower scores for sleep quantity and sleep adequacy indicate worse sleep disturbances.</description>

    <description>Self-reported (or administered by an interviewer) scale where participants rate questions on depression, anxiety and stress. Depression subscale varies from 0 (best outcome) to 21 (worst outcome). Anxiety subscale varies from 0 (best outcome) to 21 (worst outcome).
