  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many patients suffer from chronic diarrhoea after surgical treatment for cancer in the right
      side of the colon.

      The investigators' main hypothesis is that colon cancer patients with chronic diarrhoea have
      a higher risk of bile acid malabsorption compared with colon cancer patients without
      diarrhoea.

      The investigators also expect that a part of the cases of bile acid malabsorption is caused
      by underlying bacterial overgrowth in the small bowel.

      The investigators assume that patients with severe bile acid malabsorption have a lower value
      of FGF19 in the blood compared to patients with moderate or none bile acid malabsorption.

      Furthermore, it is assumed that patients with chronic diarrhoea and documented bile acid
      malabsorption after surgical treatment for right-sided colon cancer will get improved bowel
      function when treated with a bile acid binder, or antibiotics in case of bacterial
      overgrowth.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with chronic diarrhoea after surgical treatment of right-sided colon cancer will be
      compared to patients without diarrhoea after right-sided colon cancer treatment.

      All patients will be asked to answer a short questionnaire regarding bowel function, and they
      will all have standard blood tests taken to exclude non-cancer related causes of diarrhoea.
      Besides these standard tests, the value of FGF19 will be measured in a blood sample from the
      fasting participants. All participants will undergo SeHCAT scan to determine the presence of
      bile acid malabsorption among right-sided colon cancer patients with and without diarrhoea.
      In addition, a glucose breath test will be performed to examine, if the patients have small
      intestinal bacterial overgrowth.

      Patients with a positive glucose breath test, and thus bacterial overgrowth, will be treated
      with antibiotics, followed by another SeHCAT scan, glucose breath test, and measurement of
      gastrointestinal transit time. In addition, they will be asked to complete the questionnaire
      regarding bowel function again. All cases with an abnormal SeHCAT scan will be treated with a
      bile acid binder, and the patients will be asked to complete the questionnaire one more time,
      and the GITT measurement will be repeated.
