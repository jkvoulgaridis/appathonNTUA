    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of
      JNJ-73763989 in healthy Japanese adult participants following single-dose subcutaneous
      administration of 3 different doses of JNJ-73763989, Dose Level 1 (Panel A), Dose Level 2
      (Panel B) or Dose Level 3 (Panel C).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant must be a Japanese participant who has resided outside Japan for no more
             than 10 years and whose parents and grandparents are Japanese, as determined by
             participant's verbal report

          -  Participant must have a body mass index (BMI; weight in kilogram [kg] divided by the
             square of height in meters) of 18.0 to 30.0 kilogram per square meter (kg/m^2)
             extremes included, and body weight not less than 45.0 kg

          -  Participant must be healthy on the basis of physical examination, clinical laboratory
             tests, medical history, and vital signs performed at screening. In case of
             abnormalities (except for those listed in the exclusion criteria) a participant may be
             included after all if the investigator judges the abnormalities not clinically
             significant or appropriate and reasonable for the population under study. This
             determination must be recorded in the participant's source documents and initialed by
             the investigator

          -  A female participant of childbearing potential must have a negative highly sensitive
             serum (beta-human chorionic gonadotropin [beta-hCG]) at screening and a negative urine
             pregnancy test on Day -1

          -  A male participant must agree not to donate sperm after enrollment (Day 1) in the
             study until at least 90 days after receiving the study drug

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant with a history of cardiac arrhythmias (for example, premature ventricular
             contractions), history of risk factors for Torsade de Pointes syndrome (for example,
             hypokalemia, family history of long QT Syndrome)

          -  Female participant who is pregnant, breast-feeding, or planning to become pregnant
             during the study or within 90 days after receiving the study drug (or longer, if
             dictated by local regulation)

          -  Male participants who plan to father a child during the study or within 90 days after
             receiving the study drug (or longer, if dictated by local regulation)

          -  Participant with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) or type 2 (HIV-2)
             infection (confirmed by antibodies) at screening

          -  Participant with current hepatitis A infection (confirmed by hepatitis A antibody
             immunoglobulin M [IgM]), or hepatitis B infection (confirmed by Hepatitis B surface
             antigen [HBsAg]), or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (confirmed by HCV antibody), or
             hepatitis E infection (confirmed by hepatitis E antibody IgM) at screening
