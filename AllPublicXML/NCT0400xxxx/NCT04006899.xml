  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A device for measuring body composition with a small electric current, at 200 Î¼A,
      (bioelectrical impedance analysis, or BIA) was designed. The goal of this study is to
      validate the device against several existing devices using the same method of measuring body
      composition with a small electric current.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The measurement of individual segments, instead of the body as a whole, with BIA has not been
      fully explored. The prototype device is capable of directly measuring multiple body segments
      (arm, trunk, and leg) simultaneously, and the final version will be able to provide
      composition about each segment and the body as a whole. Current devices on the market are not
      capable of this.

      The reference devices will be used to measure segments as well, and the raw measurements will
      be compared. The Multiscan 5000 provides segmental body composition for the arm or leg, but
      requires measuring it separately. The SFB7 is designed only for measuring the whole body, but
      the raw impedance measurement data from the SFB7 can be used for comparison, as the impedance
      magnitudes of individual segments will be within its measurement range. The Seca 514 doesn't
      directly measure segments, but it can provide segmental data by measuring from hand to foot,
      then from hand to hand, and finally from foot to foot. It then uses these measurements, and
      assumptions about the subject to provide segmental composition data.
