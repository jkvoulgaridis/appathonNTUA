  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study focuses on patients who have already been diagnosed with an arrhythmia. This is a
      randomized control trial that will use measurements from the implanted devices to quantify
      changes in the number of cardiac events experienced. Subjects will present to the Long Island
      Heart Rhythm Clinic (LIHRC) at the New York Institute of Technology (NYIT) Academic Health
      Care Center for their scheduled appointment with Dr. Cohen. These patients are generally
      coming in for their electrophysiology cardiology checkup, postsurgical visit, or consultation
      concerning their cardiac health. Once confirmed the patients meet the inclusion criteria,
      they will be informed about this proposed study and asked if they would like to participate.
      They will then be consented and randomized according to the randomization procedure outlined
      below.

      Once enrolled, the patients will complete the study as outlined in the procedures below. They
      will have a baseline EKG taken, and then proceed to either Osteopathic manipulative medicine
      (OMM) treatment or control somatic dysfunction (SD) evaluation. The investigators will then
      analyze the CareLink data, or the web-based management service for the respective device, to
      quantify the effects the OMM or control SD evaluation had on any arrhythmia events.

      All investigators delivering OMM will be neuromuscular medicine/osteopathic manipulative
      medicine (NMM/OMM) board certified attending physicians and trained in the specific
      techniques that have been associated with arrhythmia SDs and treatment modalities to have
      consistency when treating subjects. Subject confidentiality will be maintained throughout the
      process as delineated in Question 5 of the protocol document.

    <description>The authors believe that OMT will change the number of cardiac events in arrhythmic patients, as measured on CareLink system for those with Medtronic devices, or the comparable online system for the other various manufacturers as detailed below, via the patient's implanted devices.</description>

    <description>Group A will receive osteopathic treatment by NMM/OMM board certified attending physicians. The protocol for the OMT intervention group is based on the guidelines set forth previously in textbooks. The protocol will last 25 minutes total, with 10 minutes for the evaluation and 15 minutes for treatment. The protocol will start in ribs so as to not exacerbate any tachyarrhythmias with rib raising, thoracic myofascial release, and a pectoralis lift. The investigator will then proceed with opening the thoracic inlet, cervical myofascial release, suboccipital release, and then end by checking for and treating Chapman's points. The physician will submit their osteopathic evaluation and fill out a form in order to determine if certain arrhythmias have an associated trigger point.</description>

    <description>Group B will receive a light touch treatment, based on previous research done studying heart rate variability and OMM, where sham treatment was utilized. The protocol consisted of contacting the right ankle, left knee, right hip, diaphragm, right shoulder, neck, and cranium for precisely two minutes each, with the goal of preventing placebo autonomic nervous system stimulation. The protocol is 25 minutes long, with 10 minutes for the evaluation and 15 minutes for treatment.</description>

    <description>The purpose of this research is to investigate the effect of osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) focused on somatic dysfunctions commonly associated with arrhythmias on the amount of quantifiable arrhythmias as recorded on a diagnostic device.
It is known that OMT has a stabilizing effect on the autonomic nervous system, which plays a key role in regulating heart rate and blood pressure. This increases parasympathetic tone and decreases sympathetic tone, which generally stabilizes the heart with an antiarrhythmic effect.
Previous work has been done showing that osteopathic treatment is a beneficial adjunctive therapy for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and decreased symptoms, though has not been proven to be helpful for patients with heart failure.
While the effect of OMT on the neurology has been studied, we would like to further research the effect OMT specifically has on arrhythmias using more quantifiable data from implanted devices.</description>
