  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Millions of Americans are suffering from underactive bladder (UAB). The impact of severe UAB,
      i.e. non-obstructive urinary retention (NOUR) on quality of life is significant because
      current treatment for non-obstructive urinary retention requires intermittent
      self-catheterization or an indwelling suprapubic catheter. Currently an effective drug for
      non-obstructive urinary retention does not exist. It is a therapeutic challenge for
      clinicians to successfully treat non-obstructive urinary retention. Sacral neuromodulation
      has been approved by the FDA since 1999 to treat non-obstructive urinary retention. It
      achieves &gt;50% improvement in bladder emptying (reducing the frequency of self-catheterization
      or increasing voided volume) in just over half of the patients. Sacral neuromodulation
      requires surgical implantation of a stimulator and a lead with 4 electrodes. The surgery and
      implant are invasive and expensive, preventing a broad application of this effective therapy
      to many non-obstructive urinary retention patients. The goal of this study is to develop a
      novel non-invasive neuromodulation therapy for non-obstructive urinary retention as an
      alternative. Specifically, the investigators will explore the possibility to translate into
      humans a recent discovery in cats of an excitatory reflex from the superficial peroneal nerve
      to the bladder to treat non-obstructive urinary retention. Therefore, in this study the
      investigators propose to develop a non-invasive, transcutaneous neuromodulation therapy for
      non-obstructive urinary retention that can be administered at home.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypothesis: Electrical stimulation of the superficial peroneal nerve using transcutaneous
      skin electrodes attached on the dorsal foot can treat non-obstructive urinary retention
      either by enhancing bladder sensation thereby reducing bladder volume needed for initiating
      voiding and/or by enhancing bladder contraction, thereby increasing voiding efficiency and
      reducing post-void residual (PVR) volume.

      Rationale: The investigators conducted preliminary studies in cats that have demonstrated an
      excitatory reflex to the bladder elicited by stimulation of afferent axons in the superficial
      peroneal nerve. Activating this excitatory reflex in cats reduced bladder capacity (the
      minimal volume for initiating a micturition reflex), enhanced bladder contractions and
      overcame bladder inhibition emanating from somatic (tibial) afferent activation. Since the
      superficial peroneal nerve innervates the dorsal skin of the foot in humans, it can be
      stimulated non-invasively by skin surface electrodes. Transcutaneous stimulation of this
      nerve, should it prove efficacious, would likely be more acceptable to patients with
      non-obstructive urinary retention (NOUR) than invasive sacral neuromodulation therapy.
      Therefore, in this study, the investigators propose to test the superficial peroneal nerve
      neuromodulation in non-obstructive urinary retention patients.

      Specific Aim: Determine the efficacy of superficial peroneal nerve stimulation (SPNS) in the
      treatment of patients with non-obstructive urinary retention using skin electrodes attached
      to the dorsal surface of the foot.

      Rationale: Based on a preliminary discovery in cats, the investigators propose to further
      investigate the effect of superficial peroneal nerve stimulation (SPNS) on voiding
      efficiency, post-void residual (PVR) volume, and bladder capacity (voided volume + post-void
      residual) in patients with non-obstructive urinary retention. A reduced bladder capacity
      indicates more normal bladder filling sensations, thereby allowing voiding at more normal
      volumes. The investigators plan to test superficial peroneal nerve stimulation in 20
      non-obstructive urinary retention patients by collecting voiding diary during a 3-week
      period. Baseline voiding diary will be collected during the first week before superficial
      peroneal nerve stimulation initiation. During the second week, superficial peroneal nerve
      stimulation will be administered to each patient for 3 hours/day before sleep and it will
      also be administered immediately prior and throughout each void. The 3-hour stimulation is
      designed to modulate bladder sensory pathways to enhance bladder sensation, thereby reducing
      the bladder volume required to initiate voiding. The acute stimulation during each void is
      designed to enhance bladder contraction, thereby increasing voiding efficiency and reducing
      post-void residual. During the third week, superficial peroneal nerve stimulation will not be
      applied, and a voiding diary will be collected to determine any post-stimulation effect.
      Since the superficial peroneal nerve is a cutaneous nerve innervating the skin of the dorsal
      foot, superficial peroneal nerve stimulation will be applied non-invasively by attaching skin
      surface electrodes to the dorsal side of the foot.

    <description>A commercially available FDA-approved transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulator (TENS) and skin surface electrodes will be used to stimulate the foot. The electrodes will be attached to the dorsal surface of the foot and a sock will be placed over the foot to prevent detachment of the electrodes. Based on our animal studies, foot stimulation parameters of 2 Hz frequency and 0.2 ms pulse width will be used at the maximal intensity comfortable for each patient. It is expected that superficial peroneal nerve stimulation in patients can increase bladder sensation so that micturition can be initiated at a small bladder volume, or it can initiate bladder contraction at a small bladder volume and enhance the contraction or prolong the duration of contraction. Any of these excitatory effects, if occurs in human patients, will certainly improve the condition of non-obstructive urinary retention.</description>
