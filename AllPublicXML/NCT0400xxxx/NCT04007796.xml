  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a behavioral sleep treatment improves
      functioning and sleep in Veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled trial of a behavioral sleep treatment to improve
      functioning and sleep in Veterans with PTSD, sleep apnea, and insomnia. The treatment is
      delivered partially in person and partially via telehealth (video to home). The primary
      outcome for this study is quality of life. Other outcomes include sleep-related functioning,
      PTSD symptom severity, insomnia symptom severity, and CPAP adherence. Participants will also
      provide treatment feedback to aid in assessment of treatment feasibility and acceptability.

    <measure>World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL-BREF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 1 week post-treatment (after 6 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>This 26-item self-report questionnaire measures the following four broad domains: physical health, psychological health, social relationships, and environment. Each item has five response options, with higher scores indicating greater health. Mean scores are calculated for each domain and then multiplied by four (range of 4-20 for each domain) to enable comparisons with the WHOQOL-100. The primary outcome is the psychological domain.</description>

    <measure>Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ-10)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 1 week post-treatment (after 6 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>This 10-item self-report measure evaluates functional status. In particular, items prompt participants to rate the extent to which they experience difficulty completing various tasks due to sleepiness or fatigue. Responses to items range from 0 to 4. Total scores range from 5-20. Higher scores indicate better functioning.</description>

    <measure>Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 1 week post-treatment (after 6 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>This 30-item semi-structured interview provides a dimensional and categorical measure of PTSD. The severity score is based on frequency and intensity of PTSD symptoms. Categorically, it determines presence of both lifetime and current PTSD. Current and lifetime PTSD will be assessed at pre-treatment. Only current PTSD will be assessed at post-treatment. This interview also assesses the onset and duration of symptoms, distress, impact of symptoms on functioning (social and occupational), change in symptoms since a previous administration, response validity, and dissociative subtype of PTSD.</description>
