      Postoperative ileus (POI) is a common disorder of gastrointestinal motility characterized by
      abdominal distension, nausea, vomiting and delayed passage of flatus or stool, which develops
      after every abdominal surgical procedure. POI increases risk of developing postoperative
      complications, decreases the bed turnover rate and prolongs the average duration of
      hospitalization, increasing the expense of both patients and hospitals. Although the
      Pathophysiological mechanism of POI remains unclear, recent researches suggests the
      inflammatory responses after surgery might be responsible for the gastrointestinal motility
      disorder. Acupoint application is a traditional chinese intervention which has been used in
      treating gastrointestinal motility disorder resulted from other causes. In this study, we
      aims to verify the therapeutical effect and mechanism of acupoint application on
      postoperative ileus.
