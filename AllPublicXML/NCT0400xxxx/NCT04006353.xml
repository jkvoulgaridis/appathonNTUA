  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to estimate the drug interaction between RIF and ABT. This will be a
      single-center, open-label, parallel study in healthy adult subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe and compare RIF and ABT pharmacokinetics following
      administration of 320mg ABT and 600mg RIF.12 subjects will receive 320mg ABT on Days 1、2、3、8
      (Treatment 1). And 12 subjects will receive 600mg RIF daily for 16 days from Day 1 to 16, and
      receive 320mg ABT on Days 7、8、9 and 14 (Treatment 2).
