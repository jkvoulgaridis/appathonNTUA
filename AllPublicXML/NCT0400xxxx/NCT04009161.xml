      Objectives High-dose radiotherapy (RT) for head and neck cancer has significant adverse
      effects on maxillofacial tissues, among which osteoradionecrosis (ORN) is the most severe and
      potentially life-threatening. Although tooth extractions seem to be the main risk factor, few
      perspective studies evaluated protocols to minimize the ORN risk due to extractions. The aim
      of this study is to evaluate incidence and risk factors of ORN in a cohort of patients
      receiving tooth extractions before RT and evaluate an algorithm about extraction decision.

      Methods One-hundred ten patients were consecutively recruited in this study: impacted third
      molars with radiographic sign of pericoronitis, teeth with periapical lesions, unrestorable
      teeth, periodontally compromised teeth (pocket probing depth &gt;5 mm, clinical attachment loss
      &gt; 8 mm, grade 2 tooth mobility, II grade furcation involvement) were extracted under
      antibiotic prophylaxis. A 15-days interval between the last tooth extraction and the
      beginning of RT was recommended. Patients were visited at 15 days, 1, 3 and 6 months after
      the beginning of RT. Data of patients with a minimum of 6 months follow-up are presented in
      this report. ORN was defined as irradiated exposed necrotic bone, without healing for 3
      months, in absence of cancer recurrence. The protocol was approved by the Ethic Committee of
      Catholic University - Fondazione Policlinico Gemelli (Prot. OHHN-1, ID-2132).
