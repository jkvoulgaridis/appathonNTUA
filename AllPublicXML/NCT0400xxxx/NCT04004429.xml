    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, two-part, randomized, double-blind, placebo-kontrolled, 4-week study
      with repeated doses of AP1189. The study population will consist of newly diagnosed subjects
      with severe active Rheumatoid Arthritis, defined with a Clinical Disease Activity score
      (CDAI) &gt; 22, who are to start up-titration with methotrexate.

      A multicenter, two-part, randomized, double-blind, placebo-kontrolled, 4-week study with
      repeated doses of AP1189. The study population will consist of newly diagnosed subjects with
      severe active Rheumatoid Arthritis, defined with a Clinical Disease Activity score (CDAI) &gt;
      22, who are to start up-titration with methotrexate.

      The study will be conducted in two parts separated by an interim analysis.

      Part 1: The subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio into: .

        -  AP1189 dose 50 mg

        -  AP1189 dose 100 mg

        -  placebo

      INTERIM ANALYSIS

      Part 2: All subjects will be randomized into either design 1, 2 or 3 based on data from the
      interim analysis.

        -  Design 1: AP1189 dose 50 mg or placebo in a 2:1 ratio

        -  Design 2: AP1189 dose 100 mg or placebo in a 2:1 ratio

        -  Design 3: Continue with the same doses as in Part 1

      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of 2 doses of AP1189
      compared with placebo after 4 weeks of treatment.
