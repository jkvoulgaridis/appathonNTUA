  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Critically ill patients with high-risk nutrition are often at risk of refeeding
      syndrome(RFS), that the incidence of RFS is as high as 30-50%. It is sure that patients with
      refeeding syndrome were treated with restrictive enteral nutrition, but the definition of
      refeeding syndrome is not uniform, and there is still a lack of awareness high-risk patients
      of RFS to receiving early empirical low-calorie feeding intervention. So, we designed the
      study which is divided into three stages. Firstly, the monitoring rate of RFS was reviewed to
      evaluate the incidence of RFS in general ICU. Secondly, the best diagnostic criteria of RFS
      were prospectively defined. Finally, on this basis, it is assessed whether early low-calorie
      feeding could improve prognosis in high-risk patients with RFS.

      Stage 1: the monitoring rate of re-feeding syndrome in our department was reviewed to
      evaluate the incidence of re-feeding syndrome in severe patients,which is not described in
      detail; Stage 2:This part is a prospective observational study，divided into two group,that
      is, RFS group(their serum phosphate concentration decreased to below 0.87 mmol/L within 72 h
      after starting nutritional support and the biological variation needed to be greater than 30%
      decrease from any concentration previously recorded), which is divided into three
      sub-group(Group 1 that a drop of &gt;0.16 mmol/L from any previous measurement, to below 0.65
      mmol/L within 72 h after starting nutritional support, Group 2 that their serum phosphate
      concentration decreased to below 0.87 mmol/L within 72 h after starting nutritional support
      and the biological variation needed to be greater than 30% decrease from any concentration
      previously recorded, and Group 3 that their serum phosphate concentration decreased to below
      0•32 mmol/L within 72 h after starting nutritional support.), and nRFS group(non-RFS that the
      serum phosphate do not up to the criteria). And the RFS group will be receiving the
      low-calorie feeding intervention, the nRFS group will be receiving the standard feeding
      according to the ASPEN guideline of 2016.

      Stage 3: On this basis of stage 2, it is assessed whether early low-calorie feeding could
      improve prognosis in high-risk patients with RFS who was defined in NICE(National institute
      for the health and care excellence).The part of stage 3, divided into two groups that
      standard calorie feeding group and low calorie feeding group, aims to assess whether early
      low-calorie feeding could improve prognosis in high-risk patients with RFS.
