  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is a detailed investigation of the effect of High Flow Nasal
      Oxygenation (HFNO) on respiratory system characteristics and ventilation parameters in
      healthy adult subjects and the subsequent use of measured data to answer the following
      questions:

      What level of positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) causes a HFNO with different flow
      rates? Does HFNO work as pressure support or does it act more like a Continuous Positive
      Airway Pressure (CPAP) ventilation?

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      High Flow Oxygen through nasal cannula is widely used in the setting of hypoxemic respiratory
      failure of heterogenous etiology with very good patients compliance.

      However, the evidence of what level of PEEP or pressure support (if any) with different flow
      rates is weak.

      Our goal is to determine these effects and compare them with standard approach with
      non-invasive ventilation via full face mask.

    <description>10-12 young healthy volunteers. Placed on semi-sitting position on the bed (40 deg.elevation). Calibration of electrical impedance tomography (EIT) on defined tidal volume 500ml, done with 500ml syringe connected to closed breathing circuit using full face mask as an interface.
Insertion an esophageal and nasopharyngeal catheter for pressures measurement. In the first phase - spontaneous breathing with full face mask at 0, 5 and 10 cm H20 levels of PEEP.
In the second phase - high flow oxygenation through nasal cannula, start with flow rate 10 L/min with gradual increase up to 60 L/min.
Spirometry to determine functional residual capacity (FRC) before and after procedure is planed.</description>
