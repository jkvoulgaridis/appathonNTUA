      The objective of this retrospective enrollment/prospective follow-up consecutive series PMCF
      study is to collect data confirming safety, performance and clinical benefits of the
      Comprehensive Primary Micro Stem and Comprehensive Anatomic Versa-Dial Titanium Humeral Heads
      when used for primary and revision total shoulder arthroplasty (implants and instrumentation)
      at 1,3,5,7 and 10 years*. Comprehensive Primary Micro Stem and Comprehensive Anatomic
      Versa-Dial Titanium Humeral Heads have been on the market since 2007, but have insufficient
      data to support 10 years of clinical history. Therefore, a prospective aspect to the study
      will be utilized in order to collect long-term data.

      The objective of this retrospective enrollment/prospective follow-up consecutive series PMCF
      study is to collect data confirming safety, performance and clinical benefits of the
      Comprehensive Primary Micro Stem and Comprehensive Anatomic Versa-Dial Titanium Humeral Heads
      when used for primary and revision total shoulder arthroplasty (implants and instrumentation)
      at 1,2,3,5,7 and 10 years*. Comprehensive Primary Micro Stem and Comprehensive Anatomic
      Versa-Dial Titanium Humeral Heads have been on the market since 2007, but have insufficient
      data to support 10 years of clinical history. Therefore, a prospective aspect to the study
      will be utilized in order to collect long-term data.

      The primary objective of this study is the assessment of safety by analyzing implant
      survivorship. This will be established by recording the incidence and frequency of revisions,
      complications, and adverse events. Relation of the events to either implant or
      instrumentation should be specified.

      The secondary objective is the assessment of performance and clinical benefits by recording
      patient-reported clinical outcomes measures (PROMs).

      *The most recent available data will be used. If any of the listed time points are not
      available, data will be used from last available time point and follow-up will move forward
      at the closest available time point.

    <description>The secondary objective is the assessment of performance and clinical benefits by recording patient-reported clinical outcomes measures (PROMs), through the use of the Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS). The OSS is a 12 item questionnaire, each with 5 potential answers. Patients rate their symptoms from 1 (minimal symptoms) to 5 (severe symptoms). The combined total gives a minimum score of 12 and a maximum of 60. Higher scores in the OSS imply worse functionality.</description>

    <description>The secondary objective is the assessment of performance and clinical benefits by recording patient-reported clinical outcomes measures (PROMs), through the use of the Patient Assessment Questionnaire where adverse events and/or complications (yes or no), patient's activity level with regard to operative side, based on the UCLA Activity Score(wholly inactive 10, mostly inactive 9, sometimes participates in mild activities 8, regularly participates in mild activities 7, sometimes participates in moderate activities 6, regularly participates in moderate activities 5, regularly participates in active events 4, regularly participates in very active events 3, sometimes participates in impact sports 2, regularly participates in impact sports 1, or not recorded), and the Reported Score if Individual Scores are not available of the Oxford Shoulder Score. The UCLA Activity score rating is from 10 being the best outcome score, and 1 being the worst.</description>
