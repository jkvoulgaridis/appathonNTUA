  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nearly 50 million people in the U.S. experience tinnitus, of which about 20 million people
      have burdensome chronic tinnitus. Tinnitus can be very debilitating as many aspects of daily
      life can be affected, such as sleep, mood, and concentration. Currently, there is no cure for
      tinnitus. Pharmacological or sound-therapy based interventions are sometimes provided, but
      may be of limited value to certain individuals. Research suggests that Cognitive Behavior
      Therapy (CBT) based approaches have the most evidence of effectiveness in the management of
      tinnitus. However, CBT is rarely offered in the U.S. (less than 1%), partly attributed to a
      lack of trained professionals who can deliver CBT. To improve access to CBT for tinnitus, and
      online CBT program has been developed. The purpose of this study is to determine the
      feasibility and efficacy of a CBT Internet-based intervention for adults with tinnitus in the
      United States.

      Objective: This study aims to determine the feasibility and efficacy of an Internet-based
      Cognitive Behavior Therapy (ICBT) in reducing the impact associated with tinnitus in the
      United States.

      Hypothesis: It is hypothesized that ICBT will result in reduced tinnitus-related distress,
      decreased sleep disturbance, decreased anxiety and depression, and improved health-related
      quality of life in a treatment group as compared with adults in the weekly check-in
      control-group in the U.S. population. The investigators also hypothesize that these results
      will be stable in both short- and long-term post-intervention.

      Design: A two-armed Randomized Control Trial (RCT), with a one-year follow-up design will be
      used to evaluate the efficacy of ICBT on tinnitus distress.

      Setting: This will be an Internet-based study for adults with tinnitus living in the State of
      Texas, USA.

      Participants: Eligible participants will include adults with tinnitus for a minimum period of
      3 months with internet access and no major medical or psychiatric conditions. 80 participants
      will be recruited for each group and will be randomly assigned using a computer-generated
      randomization schedule by an independent research assistant after being pre-stratified for
      language and tinnitus severity.

      Intervention: The intervention offered is a guided CTB-based internet intervention (ICBT),
      providing an opportunity to learn about new ways of coping with tinnitus during everyday
      life. It is 8-week long e-learning intervention, with new modules introduced weekly and
      assignments are given to practice techniques learned.

      Outcome measures: The main outcome measure is the Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI). Secondary
      outcome measures are the Tinnitus and Hearing Survey (THS), Tinnitus Cognition Questionnaire
      (TCQ), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7), Insomnia
      Severity Index (ISI), and EuroQol EQ-5D-5L.

    <measure>Change in Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks [Baseline; 2 month (last treatment session)]</time_frame>
    <description>The TFI is a 25-item questionnaire that evaluates treatment responsiveness (i.e., changes in functional effects of tinnitus over time). Total possible score ranges from 0-to-100 (scores &gt;25 indicate tinnitus is a significant problem).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Tinnitus and Hearing Survey (THS)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks [Baseline; 2 month (last treatment session)]</time_frame>
    <description>THS is a 10-item questionnaire that helps in determining how much of a patient's complaint about tinnitus is due to a hearing problem and how much is due specifically to the tinnitus. THS has three sections/subscales (A, B, and C). Section A consists of four items that address common tinnitus problems. Section B contains four items that address hearing. Section C, which includes two items, which focus on sound tolerance problem and ability to participate in group therapy. Responses for each item can range from 0 (not a problem) to 4 (very big problem). The total THS score can range from 0 to 40 (sections A and B range 0 to 16 and section C range from 0 to 8).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Tinnitus Cognition Questionnaire (TCQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks [Baseline; 2 month (last treatment session)]</time_frame>
    <description>TCQ is a 26-item questionnaire that assesses positive and negative cognitions associated with tinnitus. The first 13 items refer to negative thoughts and the second 13 items refer to positive thoughts. Responses are marked on a five-point Likert scale (0 to 4). The negative items (1-13) are scored 0-4, whereas the positive items (14-26) are reverse-scored: 4-0. The scoring procedure involves the simple addition of the number circled by the respondent for items 1-13 and the addition of reverse-scored items 14-26. The total score of the TCQ has a potential range from 0 to 104. A high score represents a greater tendency to engage in negative cognitions in response to tinnitus and low engagement in positive cognitions.</description>

    <measure>Change in Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks [Baseline; 2 month (last treatment session)]</time_frame>
    <description>PHQ-9 is a 9-item questionnaire that assesses depression severity. Responses are marked on a four-point Likert scale (0 to 3). The total score can range from 0 to 27 with higher scores indicating more severe depression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks [Baseline; 2 month (last treatment session)]</time_frame>
    <description>GAD-7 is a 7-item questionnaire that assesses the severity of anxiety. Responses are marked on a four-point Likert scale (0 to 3). The total score can range from 0 to 21 with higher scores indicating more severe anxiety.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks [Baseline; 2 month (last treatment session)]</time_frame>
    <description>ISI is a 7-item questionnaire that evaluates insomnia. Responses are marked on a five-point Likert scale (0 to 4). The total score can range from 0 to 28 with higher scores indicating more severe insomnia.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in EuroQol EQ-5D-5L</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks [Baseline; 2 month (last treatment session)]</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D-5L is a 5-item questionnaire that evaluates health-related quality of life. Responses are marked on a five-point scale: no problems (Level 1); slight; moderate; severe; and extreme problems (Level 5). The total score can range from 0 to 28 with higher scores indicating more severe insomnia. Possible health states is defined by combining one level from each dimension, ranging from 11111 (full health) to 55555 (worst health). EQ-5D-5L health states are converted into a single index 'utility' score using a scoring algorithm based on public preferences.</description>
