      Background. Major Depression (MD) will move into the first place of cause of the global
      burden of disease by 2030. Conventional treatments (antidepressants) are only partly
      effective with frequent side effects. More specifically, MD is underdiagnosed and
      undertreated in schizophrenia (SZ) despite its high impact on prognosis and quality of life
      in SZ patients. Even when treated, 44% of the patients remain major depressed under
      conventional antidepressants.

      FEMADSZ makes the hypothesis that this is due to the fact that the source of MD relies
      outside the brain, in the gut microbiota. The associations between microbiota disturbances
      are now well demonstrated in rodent models (&gt;60 studies) and indirect data in humans clearly
      suggest that the microbiota hypothesis of MD is the most promising track in psychiatry. The
      primary objective will be to evaluate effectiveness, safety and acceptability of FMT on
      depressive symptoms at 2 months follow-up in SZ patients with resistant MD. Methods: This is
      a pilot, single-arm, prospective, open-label proof-of-concept trial, including SZ patients
      with resistant MD. Fifteen patients will be enrolled and administered a Fecal Microbiota
      Transplantation. The main outcome measure will be depressive score at 2 months, adverse
      events and acceptability. Each patient will receive a FDG-PET scan, a routine blood draw and
      a metagenomic microbiota analysis before and after intervention. Expected results. This pilot
      study will help determining the effectiveness of FMT and the neurobiologic and microbiologic
      mechanisms associated with response to treatment.
