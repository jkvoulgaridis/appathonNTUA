    <textblock>
      Bicentric phase 1b dose escalation trial including 6 to 36 patients diagnosed with peritoneal
      carcinomatosis from pancreatic, oeso-gastric, epithelial ovarian cancers or primitive
      peritoneal mesothelioma.

      After registration, the patient will receive intraperitoneal Nab-paclitaxel (escalated dose
      from 7.5 mg/m2 to 70 mg/m2) and Cisplatin (10.5 mg/m2) administered by pressurized
      intraperitoneal aerosol chemotherapy (PIPAC) every 4-6 weeks for 3 cycles.

      All Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT) will be permanently monitored in order to evaluate de
      Maximum Tolerated Dose. Assessment of plasmatic and urinary concentration of paclitaxel and
      cisplatin will be performed. The efficacy will be assessed by the objective histological
      regression and objective tumor response rate (OTR) according to the new regression system for
      peritoneal cancer. The quality of life will be evaluated based on the EORTC questionnaire
      quality of life questionnaire-C30 Version 3.0 and visual analogic scale for pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intraperitoneal dissemination of malignant tumors is a major problem in the management of
      digestive and gynecological cancers resulting in very poor prognosis and a rapid marked
      deterioration in the quality of life of these patients. Malignancies most likely to spread to
      the peritoneum include gastric (60%), pancreatic (50%), ovarian (40%), colorectal (35%),
      peritoneal mesothelioma and pseudomyxoma peritonei.

      Maintaining the quality of life of patients in palliative oncology is of great importance.
      Surgical and / or systemic treatments have limited efficacy in the palliation of symptoms
      related to peritoneal carcinomatosis at the cost of systemic toxicities, which are usually
      significant. Intravenous chemotherapy efficacy is usually short lived due to poor penetration
      into the peritoneal cavity. The role of intraperitoneal chemotherapy (IP) is to maximize
      tumor penetration and optimize cell death while minimizing systemic toxicity. Intraperitoneal
      chemotherapy retains several advantages:

      i) the dose intensity delivered to peritoneal carcinomatosis increases as half-life is longer
      ii) intraperitoneal concentration is higher iii) systemic toxicity reabsorption is weaker
      than with the intravenous route Pressurized intraperitoneal aerosol chemotherapy (PIPAC) is a
      new laparoscopic procedure with a 90 minutes duration used for the intraperitoneal
      application of a pressurized aerosolization of chemotherapy which increases the therapeutic
      ratio of the substance administered between the local and systemic concentrations by
      2-3-fold, resulting in an improvement of the local efficacy and reduction of the systemic
      toxicity. The application of repeated four weeks intervals cycles increases the efficacy
      compared to systemic treatments. With a standardized surgical approach and dedicated safety
      checklist, PIPAC could be safely introduced in clinical routine with minimal learning curve.

      Current practice of the new drug administration method was studied within an international
      expert panel showing excellent standardization of PIPAC among expert centers (NCT03294252,
      NCT03172416, NCT03210298, NCT03280511, NCT02735928, NCT03100708, NCT03287375, NCT02604784,
      NCT03304210). Nowadays doxorubicine, cisplatin, oxaliplatin, mitomycin C and irinotecan have
      been used with PIPAC.

      Nab-paclitaxel is a next-generation taxane that has been specifically designed to overcome
      the limitations of conventional paclitaxel formulations, including the barriers to effective
      drug delivery of highly lipophilic agents. It is an albumin-drug complex of about 130 nm in
      diameter and is distributed similarly to endogenous albumin. By exploiting the natural
      interactions between albumin and the gp60/caveolin-1 receptor pathway, it has been associated
      with rapid and preferential delivery and accumulation of paclitaxel at the tumor site.
      Pharmacokinetic studies have shown that, compared with paclitaxel, nab-paclitaxel is
      associated with a 9-fold greater penetration of paclitaxel into tissues via
      transporter-mediated pathways, a 33% higher intratumoral drug concentration, a 10-fold higher
      mean maximal concentration of free paclitaxel, and a 4-fold lower elimination rate.

      Here investigators postulate that nab-paclitaxel could be a good candidate for
      intraperitoneal administration by PIPAC in patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis, as this
      route allowed reduced systemic toxicity and increased intratumoral drug concentration. This
      local intervention might rebalance favorably the immune environment and lead to a prolonged
      local control and potentially a survival benefit. As PIPAC procedure is usually repeated
      three times, it would be a great chance to observe changes in the tumor mutation profile and
      the immunological responses of the microenvironment in vivo.

      The study aims to demonstrate that the administration of new chemotherapy components, in
      particular nanomedicine is safer and more effective than the standard molecules currently
      used to further develop clinical trial protocols in association with novel immunotherapies.
