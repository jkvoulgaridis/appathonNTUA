  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this research is to improve the effectiveness of buprenorphine
      maintenance treatment (BMT) within primary care.

      Investigators propose that providing BMT as part of a group medical visit (instead of an
      individual visit) will improve treatment outcomes for patients with persistent opioid abuse,
      because members become accountable to the group, are exposed to beneficial habits of others
      (i.e. positive deviance), and can receive efficacious behavioral interventions concomitantly
      with medical management
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators have developed a preliminary model of BMT group medical visits, conducted focus
      groups with BMT patients and providers, and will use this data to develop a manualized
      group-based BMT intervention (G-BMT). Investigators will then conduct a randomized controlled
      trial (RCT) of the G-BMT intervention within primary care to preliminarily test its efficacy,
      acceptability, and feasibility. Participants who have persistent opioid abuse while receiving
      BMT in primary care will be randomized to the G-BMT intervention (40 participants in 5
      groups) or to intensify BMT (treatment as usual) with their individual primary care physician
      (40 participants).

      Hypothesis: In a 16-week RCT of G-BMT, participants who receive the G-BMT intervention (vs.
      treatment as usual) will have higher abstinence rates (primary outcome, efficacy), fewer HIV
      risk behaviors (efficacy), and greater satisfaction with treatment (acceptability) and
      adherence to medical visits (feasibility).

    <measure>Number of Participants With Opioid Abstinence at 8 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Opioid abstinence will be based on self-reported opioid use in the prior 30 days at the 8 week visit and the results of urine toxicology test at the 8 week visit. Abstinence (yes) will require no self-reported opioid use and negative urine toxicology test for opiates, methadone, and oxycodone.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Who Were Retained in Buprenorphine Treatment at 3 Months and 6 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Retention is defined as having a medical visit or active buprenorphine prescription 12-16 weeks (3 month retention) and 24-28 weeks (6 month retention) after protocol initiation.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Who Reported Sharing Injection Equipment at 8 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>We used the HIV risk measure from the NIDA Seek, Test, Treat, and Retain for Vulnerable Populations study. Items for sexual risk behavior are from the Women's Health CoOp Baseline Questionnaire. Items for injection risk behavior are from the STTR Criminal Justice instrument. We will report the number of participants reporting sharing of injection equipment at 8 weeks following enrollment.</description>

    <measure>Acceptability (Scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Satisfaction with BMT will be measured on a 5-point Likert scale for participants following completion of the intervention. We used 17 items from the Primary Care Buprenorphine Satisfaction Scale. Each item addressed satisfaction with a specific component of buprenorphine treatment, which participants rated on a scale from 1 (very unsatisfied) to 5 (very satisfied). A higher score indicates greater satisfaction.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Feasibility (Percentage of Visits Attended)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Visit adherence will be measured as the number of buprenorphine visits attended divided by the number of buprenorphine visits required per protocol and multiplied by 100 to give a percentage</description>

        <description>We used the HIV risk measure from the NIDA Seek, Test, Treat, and Retain for Vulnerable Populations study. Items for sexual risk behavior are from the Women's Health CoOp Baseline Questionnaire. Items for injection risk behavior are from the STTR Criminal Justice instrument. We will report the number of participants reporting sharing of injection equipment at 8 weeks following enrollment.</description>
