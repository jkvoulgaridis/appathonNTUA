      This Phase 3 pivotal efficacy trial will examine the effects of HLD200 (methylphenidate) in
      patients aged 6-12 years with ADHD in a naturalistic setting. Following a screening/washout
      period (Visit 1), subjects will randomized to double-blind placebo or HLD200 for a period of
      3 weeks (Visits 2-5) before assessing clinical study endpoints at last study visit.

    <measure>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale Based on DSM-IV Criteria (ADHD-RS-IV) Total Score.</measure>
    <time_frame>Last week of 3-week treatment period assessed at Visit 5.</time_frame>
    <description>The ADHD-RS-IV was developed to measure the behaviors of children with ADHD (DuPaul et al., 1998). The scale consists of 18 items designed to reflect current symptomatology of ADHD. Each item is scored in a range from 0 (reflecting no symptoms or a frequency of never or rarely) to 3 (reflecting severe symptoms or a frequency of almost always), with a range of total scores ranging from 0 to 54. In this study, a site clinican (required to be an MD, PhD, DO, licensed social worker, or any trained mental health professional approved by the sponsor) completed ADHD-RS-IV assessments at each visit using a structured interview format.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Before School Functioning Questionnaire (BSFQ) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Last week of 3-week treatment period assessed at Visit 5.</time_frame>
    <description>The BSFQ was developed as a hybrid measure completed by a clinician or parent/legal guardian to assess commonly reported areas of morning dysfunction - both behaviors and functions associated with the post-waking, early morning period (from approximately 6:00 am to 9:00 am) - in children and adolescents with ADHD (Wilens et al., 2010; Wilens et al., 2013). Symptom severity and functional impairment were rated from 0 (none) to 3 (severe - different from peers all days, all settings) with total scores ranging from 0 to 60. Ratings were completed by a site clinician (MD, PhD, DO, licensed social worker, or trained mental health professional approved by the sponsor) at Visits 2 through 5 using a structured interview format.</description>

Following a minimum 72-hour washout, subjects will be randomized (1:1) to double-blind HLD200 to be taken once daily during the evening for a period of 3-weeks prior to testing.</description>

             clinical response to MPH.

          6. Parental or legal guardian confirmation of the child's before-school functional
             impairment and/or difficulties performing a morning routine of at least 30 minutes

          7. Subject body weight must be ≥20 kg.

          8. Subject must be considered clinically appropriate for treatment with MPH and HLD200,
             including ability to swallow treatment capsules.

          9. Subject must be in general good health based upon the medical history, physical, and
             laboratory examinations (including urine drug screen).

         10. Subject and parent or legal guardian must be able to read, write, and/or understand at
             a level sufficient to provide informed consent (parent/legal guardian) and assent

             Subject and parent or legal guardian must plan to be available for the entire study
             period.

             study and study-related procedures.

          2. Serious structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious heart rhythm

             study-related procedures.

          5. Active suicidal ideation as evidenced by an ideation score of 2 or greater on the

          9. Use of prescription medications (except per protocol allowed medications) within 7
             days of Baseline (Visit 2), except for ADHD stimulant medication (72 hours) and
             monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) (14 days), and over-the-counter medications
             (except birth control and allowed medications) within the 3 days preceding Baseline
             (Visit 2). Medications not covered in allowed medications or prohibited medications
             must be cleared by the medical monitor prior to enrolling the subject.

             the subject.

         14. In the opinion of the investigator, the subject may have problems complying with the
             protocol or the procedures of the protocol, or for which the study could pose
             unnecessary safety risks. This includes current health conditions or use of
             medications that might confound the results of the study or increase risk to the
             subject.

        <title>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale Based on DSM-IV Criteria (ADHD-RS-IV) Total Score.</title>
        <description>The ADHD-RS-IV was developed to measure the behaviors of children with ADHD (DuPaul et al., 1998). The scale consists of 18 items designed to reflect current symptomatology of ADHD. Each item is scored in a range from 0 (reflecting no symptoms or a frequency of never or rarely) to 3 (reflecting severe symptoms or a frequency of almost always), with a range of total scores ranging from 0 to 54. In this study, a site clinican (required to be an MD, PhD, DO, licensed social worker, or any trained mental health professional approved by the sponsor) completed ADHD-RS-IV assessments at each visit using a structured interview format.</description>

        <title>Before School Functioning Questionnaire (BSFQ) Total Score</title>
        <description>The BSFQ was developed as a hybrid measure completed by a clinician or parent/legal guardian to assess commonly reported areas of morning dysfunction - both behaviors and functions associated with the post-waking, early morning period (from approximately 6:00 am to 9:00 am) - in children and adolescents with ADHD (Wilens et al., 2010; Wilens et al., 2013). Symptom severity and functional impairment were rated from 0 (none) to 3 (severe - different from peers all days, all settings) with total scores ranging from 0 to 60. Ratings were completed by a site clinician (MD, PhD, DO, licensed social worker, or trained mental health professional approved by the sponsor) at Visits 2 through 5 using a structured interview format.</description>
