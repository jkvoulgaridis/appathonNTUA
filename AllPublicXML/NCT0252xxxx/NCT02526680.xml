  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the impact of OrCam over 1 month on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in
      subjects with advanced glaucoma using the National Eye Institute Visual Function
      Questionnaire 25 (NEI-VFQ-25).

      To identify tasks for which subjects are using the OrCam device and patient satisfaction.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will document their daily impression about the use of OrCam, a small camera
      attached to their glasses over a 1-month period. They will attend 2 appointments at Wills Eye
      Hospital Glaucoma Research Center (baseline and final visit). Participant's will be trained
      to use the OrCam device at baseline visit and complete a best-corrected visual acuity
      assessment ETDRS (early treatment diabetic retinopathy study) and the NEI-VFQ-25
      questionnaire. They will also read a short newspaper article.

      The NEI-VFQ-25 includes a series of 25 questions pertaining to vision or feelings about a
      vision condition. Answers are selected among a numbered list of possible responses, the
      values of which are ultimately recoded and converted to a 0 to 100 scale. Items within each
      subscale are averaged together to create 12 subscale scores. An overall composite score will
      be calculated by averaging vision-targeted subscale scores, excluding the general health
      rating question.

      Participants will read a short article. They will be asked to grade their reading difficulty
      between 1 (unable to read) to 10 (able to read without difficulty). Time to read article will
      be recorded. Reading task will be performed with best correction - with and without the
      assistance of the OrCam device.

      Subjects will utilize OrCam daily for one month. Each week, subjects will record thoughts
      about the device in a log book or by using audio tape recorder, according to patient's
      personal preference.

      Final assessment at 1 month will include best-corrected visual acuity (ETDRS), NEI-VFQ-25,
      and the newspaper-reading task with and without OrCam assistance. A satisfaction
      questionnaire will be completed in order to assess subjects' overall feelings regarding
      OrCam. Audio log books will be analyzed for specific factors and recorded by a research
      assistant.

    <description>National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire-25 (NEI-VFQ-25) is a series of questions pertaining to vision or feelings about a vision condition in relation to functional status to assess their quality of life. Multiple choice responses from 12 subscales (general vision, near vision, distance vision, ocular pain, social functioning, mental health, roll difficulties, dependency, driving, color vision and peripheral vision) were recorded into a 0-100 score where 0 represents the lowest perceived vision difficulties and 100 the highest perceived difficulties. NEI-VFQ-25 was used to measure the number of participants who showed improvement in vision-related quality of life after using the OrCam device over a one month period.</description>
