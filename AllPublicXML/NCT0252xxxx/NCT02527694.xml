      This study aims to compare the quality of emergency medical services cardiopulmonary
      resuscitation between flexible stretcher and standard stretcher during ambulance transport to
      hospital among out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) during ambulance transport in Asia has been
      known to be ineffective for quality and unsafe for emergency medical services(EMS)providers.
      Small elevators in high rise buildings are the most serious barriers to provide high quality
      CPR due to too long stretcher cart to enter in the elevators. We developed flexible stretcher
      cart to be safely used in small elevator through reducing the length of the stretcher. This
      study aims to compare the quality of EMS CPR between flexible stretcher and standard
      stretcher during transport to hospital.

      Method:

      This is a before and after-trial in a metropolis EMS. Study targets are adult out-of-hospital
      cardiac arrest (OHCA), excluding evident death cases, pregnancy, DNR cases, and too big or
      too small body size for stretcher cart or mechanical CPR devices. In the before period, the
      standard stretcher will be used for manual CPR using standard CPR protocol. In the after
      period, the flexible stretcher will be used with mechanical CPR devices after 3 cycles of
      standard manual CPR. Individual and Utstein risk factors will be collected. Main outcomes are
      no-flow fraction (NFF) measured by defibrillators (X-series) and safety will be measured on
      mechanical error, transportation error, patient injury and EMS provider injury. Sample size
      were 24 cases for before (12 cases) and after (12 cases) trial from 80% power and 0.05 of
      alpha error for expecting 20% quality difference (30% NFF inflexible stretcher and 50% NFF in
      standard stretcher)

      Expected impact:

      The study will be expected to find the benefit of flexible stretcher cart during CPR in small
      elevators. This findings will contribute to revise the Asian EMS protocol for improving
      quality of CPR.

      <population>During the before-phase, 29 OHCAs were treated and transported by EMS crews. After serial exclusion, 21 patients were eligible for the final analysis. During the afterphase, 20 OHCAs were eligible for enrollment. After serial exclusion, 10 cardiac arrests received mechanical chest compressions on reducible stretchers during hospital transport</population>

          <description>We manufactured a stretcher that hinged at multiple points to be reduced to fit into small elevators with a patient on board.

In cases of cardiac arrest, the upper mattress of the stretcher could be removed to install the mechanical compression device.

            <title>Reducible Stretcher Group</title>
            <description>We manufactured a stretcher that hinged at multiple points to be reduced to fit into small elevators with a patient on board. The stretcher can be used to transport patients without cardiac arrest in the same manner as a standard stretcher. In cases of cardiac arrest, the upper mattress of the stretcher could be removed to install the mechanical compression device. The stretcher has additional sidebars that can be used to attach and lock mechanical CPR devices that are commercially available in Korea. The patient’ legs were elevated with V shape body position through knee flection and hip flection on accessory steel bar when the patients are being transporting to avoid decrease of venous return by leg-down. A l0ad-distributing band-type mechanical compression device, the AutoPulse® (ZOLL Medical, Chelmsford, MA, USA), was used for this study.</description>
