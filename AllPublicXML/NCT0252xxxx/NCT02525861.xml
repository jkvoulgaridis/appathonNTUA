    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is 2-fold: (1) to evaluate the safety and potential immunogenicity
      of GLASSIA following intravenous (IV) administration via in-line filtration; and (2) to
      assess the effects of GLASSIA augmentation therapy on the levels of A1PI and various
      biomarkers in the epithelial lining fluid (ELF) following intravenous (IV) administration at
      a dosage of 60 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) Body weight (BW)/week active alpha1-proteinase
      inhibitor (A1PI) protein for 25 weeks in participants with emphysema due to congenital A1PI
      deficiency.

An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom (eg, rash, pain, discomfort, fever, dizziness, etc.), disease (eg, peritonitis, bacteremia, etc.), or outcome of death temporally associated with the use of the IP, whether or not considered causally related to the IP.
