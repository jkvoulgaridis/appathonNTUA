  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1b/2, open-label, multicenter trial designed to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, biologic activity, and preliminary efficacy of intratumoral SD-101 injections
      in combination with intravenous pembrolizumab in patients with metastatic melanoma or
      recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).

      This study will be conducted in 2 phases. Phase 1 evaluates SD-101 given in combination with
      pembrolizumab in melanoma populations (anti-PD-1/L1 naïve and anti-PD-1/L1 experienced with
      progressive disease) in up to 4 Dose Escalation cohorts to identify a recommended Phase 2
      dose (RP2D) to be evaluated in up to 4 Dose Expansion cohorts in Phase 2. Phase 2 also
      includes up to 4 Dose Expansion cohorts of patients with HNSCC (anti-PD-1/L1 naïve and
      anti-PD-1/L1 experienced with progressive disease).

             expression level by immunohistochemistry and can be an archival sample of the
             anticipated target lesion that has been collected within 3 months of screening. The
             other sample is for RNA expression profiling and must be a fresh biopsy.

          6. Life expectancy of at least 6 months

          7. Female patients of childbearing potential, as defined in Section 5.2.1, must have a
             negative urine or serum pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to taking the first dose
             of trial treatment. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative
             then a serum test is required which must be negative for the patient to enroll. Women
             of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must be willing to use 2 medically acceptable
             methods of contraceptive from Day 1 through 120 days after the last dose of trial
             treatment. The 2 medically acceptable birth control methods can be either 2 barrier
             methods or a barrier method plus a hormonal method to prevent pregnancy. The following
             are considered adequate barrier methods of contraception: diaphragm, condom (by the
             partner), copper intrauterine device, sponge, or spermicide as per local regulations
             or guidelines. Appropriate hormonal contraceptives will include any registered and

             melanoma

          9. For Phase 1 Escalation Cohorts 1-4, must have at least 1 lesion that qualifies as a
             target lesion per RECIST v1.1 except for the minimum measurement of 10 mm in diameter
             for superficial lesions, is easily accessible (palpable or can be visualized by
             ultrasound), and is amenable to multiple intratumoral injections. If superficial, the
             target lesion must be documented photographically.

             [Inclusion Criteria (Phase 2 only: Melanoma)]

         10. Histologically or cytologically confirmed recurrent or unresectable or metastatic
             (stage IV) melanoma

         11. Must have at least 2 lesions that qualify as a target lesion per RECIST v1.1, and 1 of
             the qualifying lesions must be easily accessible (palpable or can be visualized by
             ultrasound) and amenable to multiple intratumoral injections. The target lesion should
             be of sufficient size such that the required tumor biopsies do not significantly
             affect tumor assessment per RECIST v1.1. If superficial, the target lesion must
             measure at least 10 mm in diameter, be measured by calipers, and be documented
             photographically. Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area, or in an
             area subjected to other loco-regional therapy, are usually not considered measurable
             unless there has been demonstrated progression in the lesion. Approval from the
             Medical Monitor is required to inject a previously radiated lesion.

         12. Expansion Cohort 2: Must have documented PD per RECIST v1.1 on a prior treatment
             regimen containing an anti-PD-1/L1 drug (see Appendix 6 for definition of PD per

                  rapid clinical progression

             [Inclusion Criteria (Phase 2 only: HNSCC)]

         14. Histologically or cytologically confirmed recurrent or metastatic HNSCC that could not
             be treated with curative intent

         15. Must have at least 1 lesion that qualifies as a target lesion per RECIST v1.1, and
             which must be easily accessible (palpable or can be visualized by ultrasound) and
             amenable to multiple intratumoral injections. The target lesion should be of
             sufficient size such that the required tumor biopsies do not significantly affect
             tumor assessment per RECIST v1.1. Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated
             area, or in an area subjected to other loco-regional therapy, are usually not
             considered measurable unless there has been demonstrated progression in the lesion.

                  anti-PD-1/L1 therapy was within 6 months of study enrollment (Day 1)

               2. Refractory response, ie, PD occurred within 3 months duration of the start of
                  treatment on anti-PD-1/L1 therapy; OR resistant response, ie, PD occurred beyond
                  3 months duration of treatment on anti-PD-1/L1 therapy and within 6 months after
                  the last dose of treatment on anti-PD-1/L1 therapy

               3. Documented PD per RECIST v.1.1, which has been confirmed by a second assessment
                  at least 4 weeks from the date of the first documented PD, in the absence of

             prior to study enrollment

             NOTE: Patients with ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy or ≤ Grade 2 alopecia or Grade 2 AEs that
             qualify as Grade 2 due to replacement hormonal or steroid therapy are exceptions to
             this criterion and may qualify for the study with approval by a Dynavax Medical
             Monitor.

             If a patient received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the
             toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to enrollment.

          5. Received a transfusion of blood products (including platelets or red blood cells) or
             colony-stimulating factors (including G-CSF, GM-CSF or recombinant erythropoietin)
             within 4 weeks prior to study enrollment

          6. Is expected to require any other form of anti-cancer therapy while in the trial

          7. Diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any other
             form of immunosuppressive therapy (including immune modulators or systemic
             corticosteroids) within 7 days prior to study enrollment

          8. Positive for active hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
             infection as determined by laboratory tests for HBsAg, anti-HBc, and anti-HBs;
             anti-HCV; and anti-HIV -1/2, respectively

          9. History of or current uveal or ocular or mucosal melanoma

         10. Active infection including cytomegalovirus

         11. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial through 120 days after the last dose of trial
             treatment

         12. Active autoimmune disease requiring systemic treatment in the past 2 years or a
             disease that requires immunosuppressive medication including systemic lupus
             erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, Sjogren's syndrome, or
             autoimmune thrombocytopenia. Replacement therapy (eg, thyroxine, insulin, or
             physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency)
             is not considered a form of systemic treatment.

         13. Current pneumonitis or history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids

         14. An immune-related AE from a previous immunotherapeutic agent that has not resolved to
             Grade 1 or less prior to study enrollment. The exception is a Grade 2 AE which
             qualifies as Grade 2 due to replacement steroid therapy which may be allowed with
             approval by a Dynavax Medical Monitor.

         15. Known active central nervous system metastases or carcinomatous meningitis

             NOTE: Patients with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they
             are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging [using the identical imaging
             modality for each assessment, either MRI or CT scan] for at least 4 weeks prior to the
             first dose of trial treatment and with any neurologic symptoms returned to baseline),
             have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using steroids for
             at least 7 days prior to trial treatment. This exception does not include
             carcinomatous meningitis which is excluded regardless of clinical stability.

         16. Use of any investigational agent within the last 28 days prior to study enrollment

         17. Has received a live-virus vaccination within 30 days of planned treatment start.
             Seasonal flu vaccines that do not contain live virus are permitted.

         18. Any other significant medical or psychiatric condition, laboratory abnormality, or
             difficulty complying with protocol requirements that may increase the risk associated
             with trial participation or trial drug administration that may interfere with the
             interpretation of trial results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make
             the patient inappropriate for this trial

         19. History of sensitivity to any component of SD-101 or hypersensitivity reaction to
             treatment with a monoclonal antibody and/or any of its excipients

         20. Any known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment.
             Exceptions are cutaneous melanoma or HNSCC under study per protocol, or basal cell
             carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or in situ cervical cancer
             that has undergone potentially curative therapy.

             [Exclusion Criteria (Phase 2, Melanoma Expansion Cohorts 1 and 5 only)]

         21. Melanoma considered resectable with curative intent

         22. Prior therapy with an anti-PD-1/L1 agent

             therapy (eg, T-VEC [talimogene laherparepvec]), toll-like receptors (TLR) agonists,
             STING or RIG-1 and an anti-PD-1/L1 inhibitor

             [Exclusion Criteria (Phase 2, HNSCC Expansion Cohorts 3 and 6 only)]

         26. HNSCC considered resectable with curative intent

         28. Require anticoagulation therapy

             [Exclusion Criteria (Phase 2, HNSCC Expansion Cohorts 4 and 7 only)]

         29. HNSCC considered resectable with curative intent

         30. Any prior combination therapy involving agents given by intratumoral injection that
             target the innate immune pathway or system such as oncolytic viral or microbial
             therapy (eg, T-VEC), TLR agonists, STING or RIG-1 and an anti-PD-1/L1 inhibitor
