      This is a pilot study evaluating pre-surgical patients with histologically confirmed
      localized prostate cancer who receive infusion with hyperpolarized pyruvate (13C) injection
      and undergo metabolic MR imaging with endorectal coil within 12 weeks of subsequent radical
      prostatectomy.

      and undergo metabolic MR imaging with endorectal coil within 12 weeks of subsequent radical

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Biopsy-proven adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Biopsy may be performed outside of UCSF,
             if detailed results of sextant biopsy are available. A minimum of 20 patients out of a
             planned enrollment of 50 patients must have high-risk disease as defined by primary
             Gleason score of 4 or 5 on prior prostate biopsy.

          -  Planned radical prostatectomy at University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) within
             12 weeks following protocol MRI/magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI).

          -  The subject is able and willing to comply with study procedures and provide signed and
             dated informed consent.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 or 1.

          -  Adequate organ function, including absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1500 cells/μL,
             hemoglobin ≥9.0 gm/dL, platelets ≥75,000 cells/μL, estimated creatinine clearance ≥50
             mL/min (by the Cockcroft Gault equation), bilirubin &lt;1.5x upper limit of normal (ULN)
             (unless Gilbert's is suspected), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine
             aminotransferase (ALT) &lt;1.5x ULN.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who because of age less than 18 years old, general medical or psychiatric
             condition, or physiologic status cannot give valid informed consent.

          -  Patients unwilling or unable to undergo MR imaging, including patients with
             contra-indications to MRI, such as cardiac pacemakers or non-compatible intracranial
             vascular clips.

          -  Patients who cannot tolerate or have contra-indications to endorectal coil insertion;
             for example, patients with a prior abdominoperineal resection of the rectum or latex
             allergy.

          -  Patients with contra-indications to injection of gadolinium contrast; for example
             patients with prior documented allergy or those with inadequate renal function.

          -  Metallic hip implant or any other metallic implant or device that distorts local
             magnetic field and compromises the quality of MR imaging.

          -  Cryosurgery, surgery for prostate cancer, prostatic or pelvic radiotherapy prior to
             study enrollment. No limit on number of prior prostate biopsies. Prior transurethral
             resection of the prostate (TURP) is not allowed.

          -  Current or prior androgen deprivation therapy. A history of use of a 5-α reductase
             inhibitor is allowed, provided it was discontinued at least one month prior to study
             entry.

          -  Poorly controlled hypertension, with blood pressure at study entry &gt;160/100. The
             addition of anti-hypertensives to control blood pressure is allowed for eligibility
             determination.

          -  Congestive heart failure or New York Heart Association (NYHA) status ≥ 2.

          -  A history of clinically significant EKG abnormalities, including QT prolongation, a
             family history of prolonged QT interval syndrome, or myocardial infarction (MI) within
             6 months of study entry. Patients with rate-controlled atrial fibrillation/flutter
             will be allowed on study.
