  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Konan RAPDx (Konan Medical USA, Irvine, CA) is a newly patented pupillography device.The
      aims of this study are to assess the ability of the RAPDx to distinguish between healthy
      subjects and patients with confirmed glaucoma using standard testing sequences developed for
      use at the Wills Eye Hospital Glaucoma Research Center and to determine the combination of
      demographic, clinical, and RAPDx testing parameters which allow for maximum sensitivity and
      specificity.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The RAPDx utilizes noninvasive digital, high-definition, infrared machine-vision with
      eye-tracking and automated blink detection technology to analyze and quantify the pupillary
      response to light.

      During the scheduled appointment, all patients will receive an undilated fundus examination
      by the attending ophthalmologist. The following data will be collected; Demographic
      information, Visual acuity, Intraocular pressure (IOP) measured by Goldmann applanation
      tonometry, Disc damage likelihood scale (DDLS), Vertical cup/disc ratio, Gonioscopy (if not
      documented in the chart within the past 2 years) and Humphrey visual field examination.

      Each participant will undergo RAPDx testing with two different testing sequences. They are
      separated by a 10-second resting period during which the patient is instructed to close his
      or her eyes. The exam may be paused at any time and re-alignment may be performed during any
      pause. The two testing sequences are:

        1. Standard Factory Setting: 0.1-second stimuli with 2-second inter-stimuli pauses;

        2. Custom Setting: 3-second stimuli with 1-second inter-stimuli pauses

    <description>Pupil size changes when light shines into the eyes making the diameter of the pupil smaller (constriction). The size of the pupil's reaction to light, measured in millimeters, is the amplitude or change in diameter. Amplitude of maximum pupil constriction (pupil size) when light is shone is compared between the right and left eyes. Asymmetry is the difference between maximum pupil size of the two eyes.</description>

    <description>Pupil size changes at different speeds when light shines into the eyes making the diameter of the pupil smaller (constriction). The speed of the pupil's reaction to light is the latency or amount of time. Latency of maximum pupil constriction when light is shone is compared between the right and left eyes. Asymmetry is the difference in time it takes for maximum pupil constriction between the two eyes.</description>

    <time_frame>1 examination, one hour</time_frame>
    <description>Log difference between duration of maximum pupil constriction when light is shone into the right versus the left eye. The duration of maximum constriction is calculated as time in milliseconds between point of maximum constriction and time when pupil amplitude has reached 50% of peak amplitude of dilation.</description>

The size of the pupil's reaction to light, measured in millimeters, is the amplitude or change in diameter. Amplitude of maximum pupil constriction (pupil size) when light is shone is compared between the right and left eyes. Asymmetry is the difference between maximum pupil size of the two eyes.</description>
