  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well ramucirumab works in treating patients with previously
      treated biliary cancers that have spread to other places in the body and usually cannot be
      cured or controlled with treatment (advanced) or have spread to other places in the body
      (metastatic) and cannot be removed by surgery. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such
      as ramucirumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with
      the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the progression-free survival (PFS) of ramucirumab in advanced biliary cancers
      (intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and gallbladder cancer)
      who have received prior chemotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the response rate (RR) and disease control rate (partial response + complete
      response + stable disease) of ramucirumab in advanced biliary cancers.

      II. Determine overall survival (OS) of ramucirumab in advanced biliary cancers. III. Evaluate
      the toxicity of ramucirumab in advanced biliary cancers.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Correlate the carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9 response (defined as &gt; 50% decrease from
      baseline) with tumor response, PFS and OS.

      II. Correlate baseline tumor gene expression profile with PFS. III. Correlate pre- and
      post-therapy computed tomography (CT) imaging to quantify iodine content, atomic numbers, and
      Z-values and correlate with response.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive ramucirumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat
      every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3
      months thereafter.
