    <description>Any participant with incidence of an adjudicated outcome of primary osteonecrosis, rapidly progressive osteoarthritis (OA) type 1 or type 2, subchondral insufficiency fracture, or pathological fracture. Rapidly progressive OA type 1 events were those that the Adjudication Committee considered to have significant loss of joint space width (JSW) (greater than or equal to [&gt;=] 2 millimeters [mm]) within approximately 1 year without gross structural failure. Rapidly progressive OA type 2 events were those considered to have abnormal loss/destruction of bone including limited or total collapse of at least one subchondral surface (e.g., medial femoral condyle) that is not normally present in conventional end-stage OA.</description>

    <description>The LEAS is a self-administered scale to assess activity level in participants having total knee arthroplasty. The LEAS scale reflected four levels of lower-extremity activity (1)housebound(unable to walk or a minimal ability to walk) (2)more ordinary walking about the house (3)walking about the community (4)walking about the community as well as substantial work or exercise. It consisted of 12 questions resulting in 18-level scale that allowed participants to select a single description that most represented his or her self-perceived activity level. The final score was simply the number of the descriptor selected by the participant as being most representative of his or her activity level. The minimum possible score was 1(entirely bedbound) and the maximum possible score was 18(currently competitive athlete). Higher score indicated increased activity. Categorical changes from baseline were reported in terms of improvement (Change &gt;0), No change and worsening (Change less than [&lt;] 0).</description>

        <description>Any participant with incidence of an adjudicated outcome of primary osteonecrosis, rapidly progressive osteoarthritis (OA) type 1 or type 2, subchondral insufficiency fracture, or pathological fracture. Rapidly progressive OA type 1 events were those that the Adjudication Committee considered to have significant loss of joint space width (JSW) (greater than or equal to [&gt;=] 2 millimeters [mm]) within approximately 1 year without gross structural failure. Rapidly progressive OA type 2 events were those considered to have abnormal loss/destruction of bone including limited or total collapse of at least one subchondral surface (e.g., medial femoral condyle) that is not normally present in conventional end-stage OA.</description>

        <description>WOMAC: Self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with OA. The WOMAC pain subscale is a 5-item questionnaire used to assess the amount of pain experienced due to OA of index joint (knee or hip) during past 48 hours. It was calculated as the mean of scores from 5 individual questions, which may not be a whole (integer) number, scored on a numerical rating scale (NRS). Scores for each question and WOMAC Pain subscale score on NRS ranged from 0 (no pain) to 10 (extreme pain), where higher scores indicated higher pain.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Physical Function Subscale at Week 16</title>
        <description>WOMAC: Self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with OA. Physical function refers to participant's ability to move around and perform usual activities of daily living. The WOMAC physical function subscale is a 17-item questionnaire used to assess the degree of difficulty experienced due to OA in index joint (knee or hip) during past 48 hours. It was calculated as mean of the scores from 17 individual questions, which may not be a whole (integer) number, scored on a NRS. Scores for each question and WOMAC physical function subscale score on NRS ranged from 0 (no difficulty) to 10 (extreme difficulty), where higher scores indicated extreme difficulty/worse physical function.</description>

        <description>Observation time was defined as the start day of first SC study medication until either the (i) date of completion of or withdrawal from study, if a participant did not have the event, or (ii) date of the event (earliest event within each participant in the case of multiple events). Individual joint safety outcome included rapidly progressive OA (type-1 only), rapidly progressive OA (type-2 only), rapidly progressive OA (type-1 or type-2 combined), subchondral insufficiency fracture, primary osteonecrosis, and pathological fracture. Event rate was calculated as the number of events per 1000 participant-years at risk.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Medial or Lateral Joint Space Width of the Index Knee (Kellgren-Lawrence Grade 2 or 3) at Weeks 56 and 80</title>
        <description>Change from baseline in JSW was defined as change in JSW compared to baseline in participants with Kellgren-Lawrence grade 2 or 3 over the course of the study. It was measured radiographically in the medial and lateral tibiofemoral of knee in participants with OA. Kellgren-Lawrence grade system was a method of classifying the severity of knee OA using five grades i.e. 0 [no radiographic features of OA], 1 [doubtful joint space narrowing (JSN) and possible osteophytic lipping], 2 [definite osteophytes and possible JSN on anteroposterior weight-bearing radiograph], 3 [multiple osteophytes, definite JSN, sclerosis, possible bony deformity], 4 [large osteophytes, marked JSN, severe sclerosis and definite bony deformity]. Higher grade indicating worse knee function.

          <title>Change From Baseline in Medial or Lateral Joint Space Width of the Index Knee (Kellgren-Lawrence Grade 2 or 3) at Weeks 56 and 80</title>
          <description>Change from baseline in JSW was defined as change in JSW compared to baseline in participants with Kellgren-Lawrence grade 2 or 3 over the course of the study. It was measured radiographically in the medial and lateral tibiofemoral of knee in participants with OA. Kellgren-Lawrence grade system was a method of classifying the severity of knee OA using five grades i.e. 0 [no radiographic features of OA], 1 [doubtful joint space narrowing (JSN) and possible osteophytic lipping], 2 [definite osteophytes and possible JSN on anteroposterior weight-bearing radiograph], 3 [multiple osteophytes, definite JSN, sclerosis, possible bony deformity], 4 [large osteophytes, marked JSN, severe sclerosis and definite bony deformity]. Higher grade indicating worse knee function. The number of participants with progression of OA in the index knee are summarized separately by the compartment of OA at baseline (medial or lateral).</description>

        <description>Change from baseline in JSW was defined as narrowing in JSW compared to baseline in participants with Kellgren-Lawrence grade 2 or 3 over the course of the study. It was measured radiographically in the index hip in participants with OA. Kellgren-Lawrence grade system was a method of classifying the severity of hip OA using five grades i.e. 0 (no radiographic features of OA), 1 (doubtful JSN and possible osteophytic lipping), 2 (definite osteophytes and possible JSN on anteroposterior weight-bearing radiograph), 3 (multiple osteophytes, definite JSN, sclerosis, possible bony deformity), 4 (large osteophytes, marked JSN, severe sclerosis and definite bony deformity). Higher grade indicating worse hip function.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Joint Space Width of the Index Hip (Kellgren-Lawrence Grade 2 or 3) at Weeks 56 and 80</title>
          <description>Change from baseline in JSW was defined as narrowing in JSW compared to baseline in participants with Kellgren-Lawrence grade 2 or 3 over the course of the study. It was measured radiographically in the index hip in participants with OA. Kellgren-Lawrence grade system was a method of classifying the severity of hip OA using five grades i.e. 0 (no radiographic features of OA), 1 (doubtful JSN and possible osteophytic lipping), 2 (definite osteophytes and possible JSN on anteroposterior weight-bearing radiograph), 3 (multiple osteophytes, definite JSN, sclerosis, possible bony deformity), 4 (large osteophytes, marked JSN, severe sclerosis and definite bony deformity). Higher grade indicating worse hip function.</description>
          <population>Safety population included all participants treated with tanezumab or placebo SC. Here “Overall number of participants analyzed” signifies participants who were evaluable for this outcome measure, and “Number analyzed” signifies those participants who were evaluable at specified time point for each arm, respectively.</population>

        <title>Number of Participants With Progression of Osteoarthritis in the Index Hip (Kellgren-Lawrence Grade 2 or 3) According to Bland and Altman Method at Weeks 56 and 80</title>
        <description>Progression of OA according to Bland-Altman methodology as defined by a decrease in JSW &gt;=1.96 times within-participant standard deviation of the change in JSW in the index hip. The number of participants with progression of OA in the index hip per Bland-Altman methodology are reported. Kellgren-Lawrence grade system was a method of classifying the severity of hip OA using five grades i.e. 0 (no radiographic features of OA), 1 (doubtful JSN and possible osteophytic lipping), 2 (definite osteophytes and possible JSN on anteroposterior weight-bearing radiograph), 3 (multiple osteophytes, definite JSN, sclerosis, possible bony deformity), 4 (large osteophytes, marked JSN, severe sclerosis and definite bony deformity). Higher grade indicating worse hip function.</description>

The WOMAC pain subscale is a 5-item questionnaire used to assess the amount of pain experienced due to OA of index joint (knee or hip) during past 48 hours. It was calculated as the mean of scores from 5 individual questions scored on a NRS, which may not be a whole (integer) number. Scores for each question and WOMAC Pain subscale score on NRS ranged from 0 (no pain) to 10 (extreme pain), where higher scores indicated higher pain.</description>

        <description>WOMAC: Self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with OA. The WOMAC pain subscale is a 5-item questionnaire used to assess the amount of pain experienced due to OA of index joint (knee or hip) during past 48 hours. It was calculated as the mean of scores from 5 individual questions scored on a NRS, which may not be a whole (integer) number. Scores for each question and WOMAC Pain subscale score on NRS ranged from 0 (no pain) to 10 (extreme pain), where higher scores indicated higher pain.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in WOMAC Physical Function Subscale at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 24, 32, 40, 48 and 56</title>
        <description>WOMAC: Self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with OA. Physical function refers to participant's ability to move around and perform usual activities of daily living. The WOMAC physical function subscale is a 17-item questionnaire used to assess the degree of difficulty experienced due to OA in index joint (knee or hip) during past 48 hours. It was calculated as mean of the scores from 17 individual questions, which may not be a whole (integer) number, scored on a NRS. Scores for each question and WOMAC physical function subscale score on NRS ranged from 0 (no difficulty) to 10 (extreme difficulty), where higher scores indicated extreme difficulty/worse physical function.</description>

The WOMAC physical function subscale is a 17-item questionnaire used to assess the degree of difficulty experienced due to OA in index joint (knee or hip) during past 48 hours. It was calculated as mean of the scores from 17 individual questions, which may not be a whole (integer) number, scored on a NRS. Scores for each question and WOMAC physical function subscale score on NRS ranged from 0 (no difficulty) to 10 (extreme difficulty), where higher scores indicated extreme difficulty/worse physical function.</description>
          <population>ITT population included all randomized participants who received at least one dose of SC study medication (either Tanezumab or matching placebo).</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in WOMAC Physical Function Subscale at Week 64</title>
        <description>WOMAC: Self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with OA. Physical function refers to participant's ability to move around and perform usual activities of daily living. The WOMAC physical function subscale is a 17-item questionnaire used to assess the degree of difficulty experienced due to OA in index joint (knee or hip) during past 48 hours. It was calculated as mean of the scores from 17 individual questions, which may not be a whole (integer) number, scored on a NRS. Scores for each question and WOMAC physical function subscale score on NRS ranged from 0 (no difficulty) to 10 (extreme difficulty), where higher scores indicated extreme difficulty/worse physical function.</description>

        <description>Percentage of participants with reduction in WOMAC pain intensity of &gt;= 30%, 50%, 70% and 90% at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56 and 64 compared to baseline were classified as responders to WOMAC pain subscale and are reported here. WOMAC: Self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with OA. The WOMAC pain subscale is a 5-item questionnaire used to assess the amount of pain experienced due to OA of index joint (knee or hip) during past 48 hours. It was calculated as the mean of scores from 5 individual questions scored on a NRS. Scores for each question and WOMAC Pain subscale score on NRS ranged from 0 (no pain) to 10 (extreme pain), where higher scores indicated higher pain. Missing data was imputed using mixed BOCF/LOCF.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Cumulative Percent Change From Baseline in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Pain Subscale at Weeks 16, 24 and 56</title>
        <description>WOMAC: Self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with OA. The WOMAC pain subscale is a 5-item questionnaire used to assess the amount of pain experienced due to OA of index joint during past 48 hours. It was calculated as the mean of scores from 5 individual questions scored on a NRS. Scores for each question and WOMAC Pain subscale score on NRS ranged from 0 (no pain) to 10 (extreme pain), where higher scores indicated higher pain. Percentage of participants with cumulative reduction (as percent) (greater than [&gt;] 0% ; &gt;= 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90%; = 100 %) in WOMAC pain subscale from Baseline to Weeks 16, 24 and 56 were reported, participants (%) are reported more than once in categories specified. Missing data was imputed using mixed BOCF/LOCF.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Physical Function Subscale Reduction of &gt;=30%, &gt;=50%, &gt;=70% and &gt;=90% Response at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56 and 64</title>
        <description>Percentage of participants with reduction in WOMAC physical function of &gt;=(30%,50%,70%,90%) at Weeks 2,4,8,16,24,32,40,48,56 and 64 compared to baseline were classified as responders to WOMAC physical function subscale. WOMAC: Self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with OA. Physical function:Participant's ability to move around and perform usual activities of daily living. WOMAC physical function subscale17-item questionnaire used to assess the degree of difficulty experienced due to OA in index joint (knee/hip) during past 48 hours, calculated as mean of the scores from 17 individual questions scored on a NRS. Scores for each question and WOMAC physical subscale on NRS ranged from 0 (no difficulty) to 10 (extreme difficulty), where higher scores indicated extreme difficulty/worse physical function. Missing data was imputed using mixed BOCF/LOCF.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Cumulative Percent Change From Baseline in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Physical Function Subscale at Weeks 16, 24 and 56</title>
        <description>Percentage of participants with cumulative reduction (as percent) (&gt; 0 %; &gt;= 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80% and 90%; =100%) in WOMAC physical function subscale from baseline to Weeks 16, 24 and 56 were reported. WOMAC:Self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with OA. Physical function: participant's ability to move around and perform usual activities of daily living. WOMAC physical function subscale:17-item questionnaire to assess the degree of difficulty experienced due to OA in index joint (knee or hip) during past 48 hours, calculated as mean of the scores from 17 individual questions scored on a NRS. Scores for each question and WOMAC Pain subscale on NRS ranged from 0 (no difficulty) to 10 (extreme difficulty), higher scores indicate extreme difficulty/worse physical function. Missing data was imputed using mixed BOCF/LOCF.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants With Cumulative Percent Change From Baseline in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Physical Function Subscale at Weeks 16, 24 and 56</title>
          <description>Percentage of participants with cumulative reduction (as percent) (&gt; 0 %; &gt;= 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80% and 90%; =100%) in WOMAC physical function subscale from baseline to Weeks 16, 24 and 56 were reported. WOMAC:Self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with OA. Physical function: participant's ability to move around and perform usual activities of daily living. WOMAC physical function subscale:17-item questionnaire to assess the degree of difficulty experienced due to OA in index joint (knee or hip) during past 48 hours, calculated as mean of the scores from 17 individual questions scored on a NRS. Scores for each question and WOMAC Pain subscale on NRS ranged from 0 (no difficulty) to 10 (extreme difficulty), higher scores indicate extreme difficulty/worse physical function. Missing data was imputed using mixed BOCF/LOCF.</description>
          <population>ITT population included all randomized participants who received at least one dose of SC study medication (either Tanezumab or matching placebo). Here ‘Overall number of participants analyzed’ = participants who were evaluable for this outcome measure.</population>

        <description>PGA of OA was assessed by asking a question from participants: &quot;Considering all the ways your OA in your knee or hip affects you, how are you doing today?&quot; Participants responded on a scale ranging from 1-5, where, 1=very good (no symptom and no limitation of normal activities), 2= good (mild symptoms and no limitation of normal activities), 3= fair (moderate symptoms and limitation of some normal activities), 4= poor (severe symptoms and inability to carry out most normal activities), and 5 = very poor (very severe symptoms and inability to carry out all normal activities). Higher scores indicated worse condition. Percentage of participants with improvement of at least 2 points from baseline in PGA of OA were reported. Missing data was imputed using mixed BOCF/LOCF.</description>

        <description>Participants assessed their average pain in the index hip/knee in the past 24 hours using NRS, with a scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). Higher scores indicated higher pain. Data for Weeks 20 through 56 represents averages of the values reported during the 4-week interval up to and including the given week. Change from baseline was calculated using the difference between each post-baseline weekly mean and the baseline mean score.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Average Pain Score in the Index Joint at Week 64</title>
        <description>Participants assessed their average pain in the index hip/knee in the past 24 hours using NRS, with a scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). Higher scores indicated higher pain. Data represents averages of the values reported during the 4-week interval up to and including Week 64. Change from baseline was calculated using the difference between each post-baseline weekly mean and the baseline mean score.</description>

        <description>WOMAC: self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with OA. Stiffness was defined as a sensation of decreased ease of movement in the index joint (knee or hip). The WOMAC stiffness subscale is a 2-item questionnaire used to assess the amount of stiffness experienced due to OA in the index joint (knee or hip) during the past 48 hours. It was calculated as the mean of scores from 2 individual questions scored on NRS. Scores for each question and WOMAC stiffness subscale score on NRS ranged from 0 (no stiffness) to 10 (extreme stiffness), where higher scores indicated higher stiffness.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Stiffness Subscale at Week 64</title>
        <description>WOMAC: self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with OA. Stiffness was defined as a sensation of decreased ease of movement in the index joint (knee or hip). The WOMAC stiffness subscale is a 2-item questionnaire used to assess the amount of stiffness experienced due to OA in the index joint (knee or hip) during the past 48 hours. It was calculated as the mean of scores from 2 individual questions scored on NRS. Scores for each question and WOMAC stiffness subscale score on NRS ranged from 0 (no stiffness) to 10 (extreme stiffness), where higher scores indicated higher stiffness.</description>

        <description>WOMAC: self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with OA of index joint (knee or hip). WOMAC pain subscale assess amount of pain experienced (score: 0 [no pain] to 10 [extreme pain], higher score = more pain), WOMAC physical function subscale assess degree of difficulty experienced (score: 0 [no difficulty] to 10 [extreme difficulty], higher score = worse physical function) and WOMAC stiffness subscale assess the amount of stiffness experienced (score: 0 [no stiffness] to 10 [extreme stiffness], higher score = higher stiffness). WOMAC average score was the mean of WOMAC pain, physical function and stiffness subscale scores and ranges from 0 to 10, where higher scores indicated worse response.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Pain Subscale Item: Pain When Walking on a Flat Surface at Week 64</title>
        <description>WOMAC: self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with OA in index joint (knee or hip). Participants answered a question: &quot;How much pain have you had when walking on a flat surface?&quot;. Participants responded about the amount of pain they experienced when walking on a flat surface by using a NRS of 0 (no pain) to 10 (extreme pain), where higher scores indicated higher pain.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire for Osteoarthritis (WPAI:OA) Scores at Weeks 16, 24 and 56</title>
        <description>WPAI is 6-question participant rated questionnaire to determine the impact of OA on absenteeism, presenteeism, work productivity, and daily activity impairment for a period of 7 days prior to a visit. It yields 4 sub-scores: work time missed (absenteeism), impairment while working (presenteeism), overall work impairment (work productivity) and activity impairment (daily activity impairment). These sub-scores are expressed as an impairment percentage (range from 0 to 100), with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity.</description>

        <description>WPAI is 6-question participant rated questionnaire to determine the impact of OA on absenteeism, presenteeism, work productivity, and daily activity impairment for a period of 7 days prior to a visit. It yields 4 sub-scores: work time missed (absenteeism), impairment while working (presenteeism), overall work impairment (work productivity) and activity impairment (daily activity impairment). These sub-scores are expressed as an impairment percentage (range from 0 to 100), with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Responses to European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions-5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L): Mobility Domain</title>
        <description>Number of participants with mobility domain responses of EQ-5D-5L were provided. EQ-5D-5L is a standardized participant completed questionnaire that measures health-related quality of life and translates that score into an index value or utility score. EQ-5D-5L consists of two components: a health state profile and an optional visual analogue scale (VAS). EQ-5D health state profile is comprised of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression.

          <title>Number of Participants With Responses to European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions-5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L): Mobility Domain</title>
          <description>Number of participants with mobility domain responses of EQ-5D-5L were provided. EQ-5D-5L is a standardized participant completed questionnaire that measures health-related quality of life and translates that score into an index value or utility score. EQ-5D-5L consists of two components: a health state profile and an optional visual analogue scale (VAS). EQ-5D health state profile is comprised of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: 1=no problems, 2=slight problems, 3=moderate problems, 4=severe problems, and 5=extreme problems. Higher scores indicated greater levels of problems across the five dimensions.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Responses to European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions-5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L): Self-Care Domain</title>
        <description>Number of participants with self-care domain responses of EQ-5D-5L were provided. EQ-5D-5L is a standardized participant completed questionnaire that measures health-related quality of life and translates that score into an index value or utility score. EQ-5D-5L consists of two components: a health state profile and an optional visual analogue scale (VAS). EQ-5D health state profile is comprised of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: 1=no problems, 2=slight problems, 3=moderate problems, 4=severe problems, and 5=extreme problems. Higher scores indicated greater levels of problems across the five dimensions.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 8, 16, 24, 40, 56 and 64</time_frame>
        <population>ITT population included all randomized participants who received at least one dose of SC study medication (either tanezumab or matching placebo). Here, “Number analyzed” signifies those participants who were evaluable at specified time point for each arm, respectively.</population>

        <title>Number of Participants With Responses to European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions-5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L): Usual Activities Domain</title>
        <description>Number of participants with usual activities domain responses of EQ-5D-5L were provided. EQ-5D-5L is a standardized participant completed questionnaire that measures health-related quality of life and translates that score into an index value or utility score. EQ-5D-5L consists of two components: a health state profile and an optional visual analogue scale (VAS). EQ-5D health state profile is comprised of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: 1=no problems, 2=slight problems, 3=moderate problems, 4=severe problems, and 5=extreme problems. Higher scores indicated greater levels of problems across the five dimensions.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 8, 16, 24, 40, 56 and 64</time_frame>
        <population>ITT population included all randomized participants who received at least one dose of SC study medication (either tanezumab or matching placebo). Here, “Number analyzed” signifies those participants who were evaluable at specified time point for each arm, respectively.</population>

          <title>Number of Participants With Responses to European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions-5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L): Usual Activities Domain</title>
          <description>Number of participants with usual activities domain responses of EQ-5D-5L were provided. EQ-5D-5L is a standardized participant completed questionnaire that measures health-related quality of life and translates that score into an index value or utility score. EQ-5D-5L consists of two components: a health state profile and an optional visual analogue scale (VAS). EQ-5D health state profile is comprised of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: 1=no problems, 2=slight problems, 3=moderate problems, 4=severe problems, and 5=extreme problems. Higher scores indicated greater levels of problems across the five dimensions.</description>
          <population>ITT population included all randomized participants who received at least one dose of SC study medication (either tanezumab or matching placebo). Here, “Number analyzed” signifies those participants who were evaluable at specified time point for each arm, respectively.</population>

        <title>Number of Participants With Responses to European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions-5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L): Pain/Discomfort Domain</title>
        <description>Number of participants with pain/discomfort domain responses of EQ-5D-5L were provided. EQ-5D-5L is a standardized participant completed questionnaire that measures health-related quality of life and translates that score into an index value or utility score. EQ-5D-5L consists of two components: a health state profile and an optional visual analogue scale (VAS). EQ-5D health state profile is comprised of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: 1=no problems, 2=slight problems, 3=moderate problems, 4=severe problems, and 5=extreme problems. Higher scores indicated greater levels of problems across the five dimensions.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 8, 16, 24, 40, 56 and 64</time_frame>
        <population>ITT population included all randomized participants who received at least one dose of SC study medication (either tanezumab or matching placebo). Here, “Number analyzed” signifies those participants who were evaluable at specified time point for each arm, respectively.</population>

        <title>Number of Participants With Responses to European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions-5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L): Anxiety/ Depression Domain</title>
        <description>Number of participants with anxiety/ depression domain responses of EQ-5D-5L were provided. EQ-5D-5L is a standardized participant completed questionnaire that measures health-related quality of life and translates that score into an index value or utility score. EQ-5D-5L consists of two components: a health state profile and an optional visual analogue scale (VAS). EQ-5D health state profile is comprised of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: 1=no problems, 2=slight problems, 3=moderate problems, 4=severe problems, and 5=extreme problems. Higher scores indicated greater levels of problems across the five dimensions.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 8, 16, 24, 40, 56 and 64</time_frame>
        <population>ITT population included all randomized participants who received at least one dose of SC study medication (either Tanezumab or matching placebo). Here, “Number analyzed” signifies those participants who were evaluable at specified time point for each arm, respectively.</population>

          <title>Number of Participants With Responses to European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions-5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L): Anxiety/ Depression Domain</title>
          <description>Number of participants with anxiety/ depression domain responses of EQ-5D-5L were provided. EQ-5D-5L is a standardized participant completed questionnaire that measures health-related quality of life and translates that score into an index value or utility score. EQ-5D-5L consists of two components: a health state profile and an optional visual analogue scale (VAS). EQ-5D health state profile is comprised of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: 1=no problems, 2=slight problems, 3=moderate problems, 4=severe problems, and 5=extreme problems. Higher scores indicated greater levels of problems across the five dimensions.</description>
          <population>ITT population included all randomized participants who received at least one dose of SC study medication (either Tanezumab or matching placebo). Here, “Number analyzed” signifies those participants who were evaluable at specified time point for each arm, respectively.</population>

        <title>European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions-5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L) Overall Health Utility Score/Index Value</title>
        <description>EQ-5D-5L: standardized participant completed questionnaire that measures health-related quality of life and translates that score into an index value or utility score. EQ-5D-5L consists of two components: a health state profile and an optional VAS. EQ-5D health state profile comprises of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: 1=no problems, 2=slight problems, 3=moderate problems, 4=severe problems, and 5=extreme problems. Responses from the five domains were used to calculate a single utility index (the Overall health utility score) where values are less than or equal to (&lt;=) 1. The Overall health utility score for a participant with no problems in all 5 items is 1 for all countries (except for Zimbabwe where it is 0.9), and is reduced where a participant reports greater levels of problems across the five dimensions.</description>

        <title>Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire Medicine Version II (TSQM v.II) Score With Effectiveness, Side Effects, Convenience, and Overall Satisfaction Responses</title>
        <description>TSQM v.II is a self-administered 11-item validated scale that quantified participant's level of satisfaction with study medication (scored on a 7-point Likert scale [1= extremely dissatisfied, 2=very dissatisfied, 3=dissatisfied, 4=somewhat satisfied, 5=satisfied, 6=very satisfied, 7=extremely satisfied]) and dissatisfaction with side effects (3 questions scored on 5 point Likert scale [1= extremely dissatisfied, 2=very dissatisfied, 3=somewhat dissatisfied, 4=slightly dissatisfied, 5=not at all dissatisfied] and 1 question on 2 point scale [0 =No, 1=Yes]). Participants were asked to assess their level of satisfaction taking all things into account. The 11 questions of the TSQM were used to calculate the 4 endpoints of effectiveness, side Effects, convenience and global satisfaction, each scored on a 0-100 scale with 100 being the best level of satisfaction.</description>

        <title>Patient-Reported Treatment Impact Assessment- Modified (mPRTI) Score at Weeks 16 and 56: Participant Global Preference Assessment- What is The Current or Most Recent Treatment You Were Receiving for Osteoarthritis Pain Before Enrolling?</title>
        <description>The mPRTI is a self-administered questionnaire containing participant's global preference assessment (to assess previous treatment and preference to continue using the investigational product) and participant's willingness to use drug again assessment. To assess current or most recent treatment, participants responded for, 1=injectable prescription medicines, 2=prescription medicines taken by mouth, 3=surgery, 4=prescription medicines and surgery and 5=no treatment. Number of participants who responded for the specified question were reported.</description>
        <time_frame>Weeks 16 and 56</time_frame>
        <population>ITT population included all randomized participants who received at least one dose of SC study medication (either tanezumab or matching placebo). Here, “Number analyzed” signifies those participants who were evaluable at specified time point for each arm, respectively.</population>

          <title>Patient-Reported Treatment Impact Assessment- Modified (mPRTI) Score at Weeks 16 and 56: Participant Global Preference Assessment- What is The Current or Most Recent Treatment You Were Receiving for Osteoarthritis Pain Before Enrolling?</title>
          <description>The mPRTI is a self-administered questionnaire containing participant's global preference assessment (to assess previous treatment and preference to continue using the investigational product) and participant's willingness to use drug again assessment. To assess current or most recent treatment, participants responded for, 1=injectable prescription medicines, 2=prescription medicines taken by mouth, 3=surgery, 4=prescription medicines and surgery and 5=no treatment. Number of participants who responded for the specified question were reported.</description>
          <population>ITT population included all randomized participants who received at least one dose of SC study medication (either tanezumab or matching placebo). Here, “Number analyzed” signifies those participants who were evaluable at specified time point for each arm, respectively.</population>

        <title>Patient Reported Treatment Impact Assessment-Modified (mPRTI) Score at Weeks 16 and 56: Participant Global Preference Assessment- Overall, do You Prefer the Drug That You Received in This Study to Previous Treatment?</title>
        <description>The mPRTI is a self-administered questionnaire containing participant global preference assessment (to assess previous treatment and preference to continue using the investigational product) and participant willingness to use drug again assessment. To assess preference to continue using the investigational product, participants responded using IRT on a 5 point Likert scale from 1-5, where, 1= yes, I definitely prefer the drug that I am receiving now, 2= I have a slight preference for the drug that I am receiving now, 3= I have no preference either way, 4= I have a slight preference for my previous treatment, 5= No, I definitely prefer my previous treatment. Higher scores indicate lesser preference to use the investigational product. Number of participants who responded for the specified question were reported.</description>

        <title>Patient Reported Treatment Impact Assessment-Modified (mPRTI) Score at Weeks 16 and 56: Participant Willingness to Use Drug Again Assessment- Willing to Use the Same Drug That You Have Received in This Study for Your Osteoarthritis Pain?</title>
        <description>The mPRTI is a self-administered questionnaire containing participant global preference assessment (to assess previous treatment and preference to continue using the investigational product) and participant willingness to use drug again assessment. To assess participant willingness to use drug again, participants responded using IRT on a 5 point likert scale from 1-5, where, 1= yes, I would definitely want to use the same drug again, 2= I might want to use the same drug again, 3= I am not sure, 4= I might not want to use the same drug again, 5= no, I definitely would not want to use the same drug again. Higher scores indicate lesser willingness to use the investigational product. Number of participants who responded for the specified question were reported.</description>
        <time_frame>Weeks 16 and 56</time_frame>
        <population>ITT population included all randomized participants who received at least one dose of SC study medication (either tanezumab or matching placebo). Here, “Number analyzed” = participants who were evaluable at specified time point for each arm, respectively.</population>

        <title>Health Care Resource Utilization (HCRU): Number of Participants Who Used Any Aids/Devices for Doing Things Due to Osteoarthritis</title>
        <description>OA HCRU assessed healthcare usage during the last 3 months (for Baseline and Week 80) and past 8 weeks (for Week 64). Domain evaluated was number of participants who used any aids/devices for doing things. Aids such as walking aid, wheelchair, device or utensil for dress/bathe/eat and any other aids/devices.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Categorical Change From Baseline in Lower Extremity Activity Scale (LEAS) at Weeks 4, 8, 16, 24, 56 and 80</title>
        <description>The LEAS is a self-administered scale to assess activity level in participants having total knee arthroplasty. The LEAS scale reflected four levels of lower-extremity activity (1)housebound(unable to walk or a minimal ability to walk) (2)more ordinary walking about the house (3)walking about the community (4)walking about the community as well as substantial work or exercise. It consisted of 12 questions resulting in 18-level scale that allowed participants to select a single description that most represented his or her self-perceived activity level. The final score was simply the number of the descriptor selected by the participant as being most representative of his or her activity level. The minimum possible score was 1(entirely bedbound) and the maximum possible score was 18(currently competitive athlete). Higher score indicated increased activity. Categorical changes from baseline were reported in terms of improvement (Change &gt;0), No change and worsening (Change less than [&lt;] 0).</description>

        <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent were events between first dose of study drug and up to Week 80 that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pre-treatment state. AEs included both serious and non-serious AEs. Clinically significant physical examination abnormalities were reported as AEs.</description>

        <description>A 12-lead ECG was recorded after participants had rested for at least 5 minutes in the supine position in a quiet environment. All standard intervals (PR, QRS, QT, QTcF, QTcB, RR intervals) were collected. ECG abnormalities included: 1) QT interval, QT interval corrected using Bazett's formula (QTcB) and QT interval corrected using Fridericia's formula (QTcF): increase from baseline greater than (&gt;) 30 millisecond (ms) or 60 ms; absolute value &gt; 450 ms, &gt;480 ms and &gt; 500 ms; 2) heart rate (HR) : absolute value &lt;=50 bpm and decrease from baseline &gt;=20 bpm; absolute value &gt;=120 beats per minute (bpm) and increase from baseline &gt;=20 bpm; 3) PR interval: absolute value &gt;=220 ms and increase from baseline &gt;=20 ms; 4) QRS interval: absolute value &gt;= 120 ms.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Confirmed Orthostatic Hypotension</title>
        <description>Orthostatic hypotension was defined as postural change (supine to standing) that met the following criteria: For systolic BP &lt;=150 mmHg (mean supine): Reduction in systolic BP&gt;=20 mmHg or reduction in diastolic BP&gt;=10 mmHg at the 1 and/or 3 minute standing BP measurements. For systolic BP &gt;150 mmHg (mean supine): Reduction in systolic BP&gt;=30 mmHg or reduction in diastolic BP&gt;=15 mmHg at the 1 and/or 3 minute standing BP measurements. If the 1 minute or 3 minute standing BP in a sequence met the orthostatic hypotension criteria, then that sequence was considered positive. If 2 of 2 or 2 of 3 sequences were positive, then orthostatic hypotension was considered confirmed.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Survey of Autonomic Symptom (SAS) Scores at Weeks 24, 56 and 80</title>
        <description>The SAS is a 12 item (11 for females) questionnaire, from which the total number of symptoms (0-12 for males and 0-11 for females) is calculated. Each positive symptom is rated from 1 (not at all) to 5 (a lot). The total impact score was the sum of all symptom rating scores, with 0 assigned where the participant did not have the particular symptom. The range for the total impact score is 0-60 for males and 0-55 for females, higher scores indicating higher impact.</description>

        <description>NIS is a standardized instrument used to evaluate participant for signs of peripheral neuropathy. NIS is the sum of scores of 37 items, from both the left and right side, where 24 items scored from 0 (normal) to 4 (paralysis), higher score indicated higher abnormality/impairment and 13 items scored from 0 (normal), 1 (decreased) and 2 (absent), higher score indicated higher impairment. NIS possible overall score ranged from 0 (no impairment) to 244 (maximum impairment), higher scores indicated increased impairment.</description>
