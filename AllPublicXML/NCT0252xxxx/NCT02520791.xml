      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of anti-inducible T-cell
      co-stimulator (ICOS) monoclonal antibody MEDI-570 in treating patients with peripheral T-cell
      lymphoma follicular variant or angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma that has returned after a
      period of improvement (relapsed) or has not responded to previous treatment (refractory).
      Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as anti-ICOS monoclonal antibody MEDI-570, may
      induce changes in the body's immune system and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells
      to grow and spread.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the safety, maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of
      MEDI-570 (anti-ICOS monoclonal antibody MEDI-570) in patients with refractory/relapsed
      peripheral T-cell lymphoma-not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS), angioimmunoblastic T-cell
      lymphoma (AITL), follicular lymphoma, mycosis fungoides (MF) and cutaneous T-cell lymphomas
      (CTCL).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of MEDI-570. II. To evaluate the overall response
      rate (ORR) and progression free survival (PFS) of MEDI-570 at all dose levels and in a
      10-patient expansion cohort at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).

      III. To determine short and long term effects of MEDI-570 at all dose levels on the immune
      system and on T-cell lymphocyte subsets.

      IV. To determine the relationship between ICOS expression on tumor cells and response to
      MEDI-570.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate biomarkers of response and resistance to MEDI-570 in the study population.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive anti-ICOS monoclonal antibody MEDI-570 intravenously (IV) over 1-4 hours on
      day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 12 cycles in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 6
      weeks for 12 weeks.

               -  PLT &gt;= 50 000/mcL

          -  Availability of tissue for correlative studies; patients must have at least 6-8
             unstained slides of archived formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissue available;
             if not enough archived tissue is available, a fresh tumor biopsy prior to study
             initiation is mandatory; for patients who have undergone a fresh baseline biopsy at
             baseline, the archived tissue is not mandatory

          -  The effects of MEDI-570 on the developing human fetus are unknown; for this reason,
             women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, during
             the study participation, and for 3 months after the last dose of the drug; should a
             woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately; men
             treated or enrolled on this protocol must have either had a prior vasectomy or agree
             to use effective contraception prior to the study, during the study, and for 3 months
             after the last dose of the drug; males should avoid fathering children during and for
             at least three months after therapy is completed

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents

          -  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to MEDI-570 or history of anaphylaxis to any biological component

          -  Any history or evidence of opportunistic infection within 6 months of screening
             including tuberculosis, severe cytomegalovirus (CMV) or herpetic infections (such as
             disseminated herpes, herpes encephalitis, ophthalmic herpes)

          -  Evidence of active infection by hepatitis B and/or C; active viral infection by
             hepatitis B and hepatitis C could be associated with cytopenias (due to hypersplenism
             or due to the active virus itself), which could add further risk when a potential
             immunosuppressive medication is used; for patients with hepatitis B treated with
             anti-virals to undetectable viral load, and for patients with hepatitis C with
             undetectable ribonucleic acid (RNA) levels and no evidence of liver damage, enrollment
             may be considered and should discuss first with study's principal investigator

          -  History of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection; the human immunodeficiency
             virus (HIV) depletes CD4 T-cells and could also have a role in T-cell anergy; since
             MEDI-570 preferentially affects CD4 T-cell numbers and function, and the resultant
             immunosuppression by this agent can be prolonged, exposing HIV patients to MEDI-570
             will place them in an unnecessary risk of developing infections due to an underlying
             acquired cellular immunity defect

          -  History of primary immunodeficiency

          -  Receipt of live or live attenuated vaccine within 12 weeks prior to enrollment

          -  All potential patients must undergo a tuberculosis (TB) test prior to study entry to
             rule out active or latent tuberculosis (either purified protein derivative [PPD] or
             QuantiFERON-TB Gold, whichever is preferred and available at the institution);
             patients with a history of TB (even if treated), or evidence of active or latent TB,
             are excluded; the diagnosis of active TB is defined per current guidelines; patients
             with a positive TB test (e.g. PPD or QuantiFERON-TB Gold) will be excluded; patients
             with history of Bacille-Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination will be tested with
             QuantiFERON-TB Gold test in order to rule out exposure to TB

          -  Patients who have undergone allogeneic stem cell transplantation

          -  Patients who have undergone autologous stem cell transplantation within 3 months from
             study entry

          -  Major surgery within 30 days prior or during the study period

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study due to the potential toxicity in
             pre-clinical reproductive studies; in addition, there is an unknown but potential risk
             for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with
             MEDI-570; breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with MEDI-570

          -  Patients with active, known, or suspected autoimmune disease, except in these
             conditions:

               -  Participants with well-controlled asthma and/or mild allergic rhinitis (seasonal
                  allergies) are eligible

               -  Participants with the following disease conditions are also eligible:

                    -  Vitiligo,

                    -  Type 1 diabetes mellitus

                    -  Residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune condition only requiring hormone
                       replacement

                    -  Euthyroid participants with a history of Grave's disease (participants
                       suspected autoimmune thyroid disorders must be negative for thyroglobulin
                       and thyroid peroxidase antibodies and thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin
                       prior to first dose of study drug)

                    -  For patients with ITP (idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura) or AIHA
                       (autoimmune hemolytic anemia), a case by case discussion with study
                       principal investigator (PI) may be considered

                    -  Patients not receiving systemic therapy (i.e., systemic steroids or biologic
                       therapy with disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs [DMARDs]) within 2 years
                       can be also eligible
