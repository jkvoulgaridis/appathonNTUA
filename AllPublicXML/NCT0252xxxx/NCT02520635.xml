      The primary purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of supra-early
      post-surgery chemotherapy versus standard TEMODAL® regimen in treatment of patients with
      newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme. The secondary purpose is to assess the efficacy of
      supra-early post-surgery chemotherapy in release brain edema.

      Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary malignant brain tumor. Despite great efforts
      have been devoted to promoting the treatment effect, GBM remains one of the most lethal
      tumors concurrent with poor prognosis and inevitable recurrence. The standard treatment
      protocol for GBM includes surgical resection, radiotherapy and temozolomide (TMZ) based
      chemotherapy. TMZ, an alkylating agent, has been proved to be efficient to control tumor
      growth after surgery and gradually has been recognized in routine clinical course for GBM. In
      a pivotal clinical trial published in 2005, GBM patients received concomitant TMZ and
      radiotherapy followed by 6 periods of adjuvant TMZ chemotherapy had a median survival of 14.6
      months and 5-year survival rate of 9.8%, which has been regarded as a landscape in treatment
      history of GBM. To date, this regimen remains the standard protocol for newly diagnosed GBM
      patients. However, the optimal timing of initiation of TMZ or radiotherapy remains unclear.
      Our previous study showed 75mg per square meter of body surface per day (mg/m2/d) of TMZ
      chemotherapy alone was effective to control post-operative edema caused by tumor cell
      infiltration in primary GBM patients. The result suggested anti-cancer agents such as TMZ may
      be a useful regimen to control tumor cell regrowth after operation. Therefore, we conducted
      this prospective clinical trial to testify the hypothesis that supra-early initiation of TMZ
      chemotherapy in newly diagnosed GBM patients is effective to control tumor growth after tumor
      resection and therefore improve patients'clinical outcome.

    <description>4 weeks after surgery, patients are administered with radiotherapy that consisted of fractionated focal irradiation at a dose of 2 Gy per fraction given once daily 5 dyas a week over a period of 6 weeks. Concomitant TEMODAL® are administered orally at a daily dose of 75mg/m2 from the first day of radiotherapy until the last day of radiotherapy, but for no longer than 49 days. After a 4-week break, patients were then to receive up to 6 cycles of adjuvant TEMODAL® chemotherapy according to the standard 5-day schedule every 28 days.The dose is 150mg/m2 once daily for cycle 1 and is increase to 200mg/m2 at the beginning of cycle 2, so long as there were no hematologic toxic effects.</description>
