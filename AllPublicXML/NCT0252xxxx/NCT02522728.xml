    <measure>Assessment of Fixation and Stability of the Triathlon Total Knee Prosthesis by Roentgen Stereophotogrammetric Analysis (RSA)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Roentgen Stereophotogrammetric Analysis (RSA) is a technique to measure migration of prosthesis components relative to the bone which allows conclusions regarding the fixation of an implant. This study assesses the fixation and stability of the Triathlon total knee prosthesis at 2 years by RSA as a predictor of late mechanical loosening.</description>

    <measure>Investigation of Clinical Performance and Patient Outcome With the Knee Society Score (KSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-operative, 3 months, 1, 2, 5, 7 and 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Knee Society Clinical Rating System is comprised of two distinct sub-scores: 1. assessment score for pain, range of motion (ROM) and joint stability, 2. score for functional parameters. Sub-scores range from a potential minimum score of 0 to a maximum score of 100 points. Although the specific scores are not distinguished as &quot;excellent,&quot; &quot;good,&quot; &quot;fair,&quot; or &quot;poor,&quot; a higher value represents a better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Investigation of Clinical Performance and Patient Outcome With the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) Patient Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-operative, 3 months, 1, 2, 5, 7 and 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>KOOS consists of 5 subscales: Pain, other symptoms, function in daily living , function in sport and recreation and knee related quality of life (QOL). The previous week is the time period considered when answering the questions. Standardized answer options are given (5 Likert boxes) and each question is assigned a score from 0 to 4. A normalized score (100 indicating no problems or a better outcome and 0 indicating extreme problems or a worse outcome).</description>

    <measure>Investigation of Clinical Performance and Patient Outcome With EuroQuol-5 Dimension (EQ-5D) Patient Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>1, 2, 5, 7 and 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D is a subject-completed questionnaire designed to assess subject health state values. The EQ-5D consists of 2 areas; EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). The EQ-5D descriptive system comprises the following five dimensions: mobility self care, usual activities, pain/comfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 3 levels indicating no problems, some problems or extreme problems. The index values on a scale between -1 (low) and 1 (high) are showing the average health status according to the 5 dimensions: A low score shows worse health and a high score shows better health.
With the EQ VAS the respondents can report their perceived health status with a grade ranging from 0 (the worst possible health status) to 100 (the best possible health status).</description>

             system

          3. Patients who understand the conditions of the study and are willing and able to comply
             with the post-operative scheduled clinical and radiographical evaluations and the
             prescribed rehabilitation.

        <description>The Knee Society Clinical Rating System is comprised of two distinct sub-scores: 1. assessment score for pain, range of motion (ROM) and joint stability, 2. score for functional parameters. Sub-scores range from a potential minimum score of 0 to a maximum score of 100 points. Although the specific scores are not distinguished as &quot;excellent,&quot; &quot;good,&quot; &quot;fair,&quot; or &quot;poor,&quot; a higher value represents a better outcome.</description>

        <description>KOOS consists of 5 subscales: Pain, other symptoms, function in daily living , function in sport and recreation and knee related quality of life (QOL). The previous week is the time period considered when answering the questions. Standardized answer options are given (5 Likert boxes) and each question is assigned a score from 0 to 4. A normalized score (100 indicating no problems or a better outcome and 0 indicating extreme problems or a worse outcome).</description>

        <title>Investigation of Clinical Performance and Patient Outcome With EuroQuol-5 Dimension (EQ-5D) Patient Questionnaire</title>
        <description>The EQ-5D is a subject-completed questionnaire designed to assess subject health state values. The EQ-5D consists of 2 areas; EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). The EQ-5D descriptive system comprises the following five dimensions: mobility self care, usual activities, pain/comfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 3 levels indicating no problems, some problems or extreme problems. The index values on a scale between -1 (low) and 1 (high) are showing the average health status according to the 5 dimensions: A low score shows worse health and a high score shows better health.
With the EQ VAS the respondents can report their perceived health status with a grade ranging from 0 (the worst possible health status) to 100 (the best possible health status).</description>
