  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Th mechanism of action of dapagliflozin is via sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2)
      inhibition. Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibition is associated with moderate weight
      (fat) loss, in addition to other health benefits, including decreased blood pressure,
      decreased inflammation, and decreased oxidative stress. It is unclear as to whether these
      health benefits are due to SGLT2 inhibition per se, or as a secondary effect of weight loss.

      This is a randomized, prospective, placebo-controlled, double-blind, repeated measures study.
      92 overweight/obese adults (body mas index &gt; 27.5 kg/m^2) will be recruited for participation
      and randomly assigned to one of four 12 week treatments: 1) daily oral administration of
      dapagliflozin with ad-libitum dietary intake; 2) daily oral administration of dapagliflozin
      with supplemented dietary intake to achieve weight maintenance; 3) daily oral administration
      of a placebo plus dietary restriction such that weight loss is matched to participants in
      treatment 1; or, 4) daily oral administration of a placebo with ad-libitum dietary intake.

    <description>Perceptions of satiety will be determined using a visual analog scale called a Hunger Rating Scales. The minimum value is 1 (not at all full) and the maximum value is 100 (extremely full). One value between 1 and 100 is reported by the participant dependent on their perception. No sub scores are used. The perceived values are reported as the group average at baseline and 12 weeks. There is not a better or worse outcome, but rather a measure of perceived satiety. If Dapagliflozin were effective at increasing fullness, respondents would exhibit 12-week scores for the question in comparison to their baseline scores.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Perception of Satiety at Week 12</title>
        <description>Perceptions of satiety will be determined using a visual analog scale called a Hunger Rating Scales. The minimum value is 1 (not at all full) and the maximum value is 100 (extremely full). One value between 1 and 100 is reported by the participant dependent on their perception. No sub scores are used. The perceived values are reported as the group average at baseline and 12 weeks. There is not a better or worse outcome, but rather a measure of perceived satiety. If Dapagliflozin were effective at increasing fullness, respondents would exhibit 12-week scores for the question in comparison to their baseline scores.</description>

          <description>Perceptions of satiety will be determined using a visual analog scale called a Hunger Rating Scales. The minimum value is 1 (not at all full) and the maximum value is 100 (extremely full). One value between 1 and 100 is reported by the participant dependent on their perception. No sub scores are used. The perceived values are reported as the group average at baseline and 12 weeks. There is not a better or worse outcome, but rather a measure of perceived satiety. If Dapagliflozin were effective at increasing fullness, respondents would exhibit 12-week scores for the question in comparison to their baseline scores.</description>
