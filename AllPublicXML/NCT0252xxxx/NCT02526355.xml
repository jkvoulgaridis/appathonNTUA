  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence rate of maternal depression in Pakistani women and its effect on the growth
      and development of young children and child mortality is very high.

      The main objective of this study is to increase access to evidence based psychological
      interventions for mothers who have children of age 0 to 30 months, consistent with her
      values. The study will be a 2 (conditions) into 3 (Time) single blind randomized controlled
      trail. Depressed mothers will be randomized either to intervention arm or control arm.
      Intervention will include text messages based on Learning Through Play Plus (LTP plus CBT).

      Disturbances in mother-infant relationship in depressed mothers negatively influence the
      child's development. There are a number of efficient treatments for postnatal depression
      including antidepressant medication, psychotherapy and psychosocial interventions.
      Tele-health and mobile health is a novel and emerging field in psychiatric and psychological
      care and treatment of mental health difficulties, it involves the use of telecommunications
      to provide health care, support and intervention from a distance.

      The proposed study will test the efficacy of an innovative, affordable mobile based
      intervention program that can help mothers with postnatal depression in low resource
      countries such as Pakistan.

      Participants will be recruited from maternal and child care centres in Karachi, Pakistan and
      those participants (n = 204) meeting inclusion criteria of the study will be randomized into
      one of the 2 treatment arms, i.e., intervention or control, after completion of baseline
      assessment. Intervention will be comprised of LTP Plus and will be delivered through text
      messages. Momentary Sampling assessment and Momentary Psychological intervention will be part
      of this study. Participants will be assessed again after completion of intervention (i.e.,
      after 12 weeks) and then 3 months post intervention.
