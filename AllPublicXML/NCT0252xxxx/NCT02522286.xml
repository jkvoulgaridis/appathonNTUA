    <textblock>
      This study implements a simple evidence-based patient activation intervention - &quot;Ask 3
      Questions&quot;- augmented by a novel theory-based intervention - &quot;Open Communication&quot; - aimed at
      activating patients and healthcare providers. The goal of this project is to increase patient
      and physician's preparedness for more having more questions, expressing differing opinions,
      and working collaboratively in making medical decisions that are both informed and responsive
      to patients' needs and preferences.

      Conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) to compare two interventions, &quot;Ask 3
      Questions,&quot; &quot;Open Communication,&quot; a combination of both &quot;Ask 3 Questions&quot; and &quot;Open
      Communication,&quot; to a usual care control condition. These data will inform a potential future
      large scale evaluation of the interventions in clinical practice. Consistent with a
      patient-centered approach, outcome measures are selected in collaboration with a group of
      patient stakeholders and will include measures of patient satisfaction. The study aims to
      collect 75 post-visit surveys and 10 appointment audio-recordings from patients at each of 4
      participating sites (a total of 300 post-visit surveys and 40 audio-recordings).

    <description>Responses from CollaboRATE, a 3-question validated patient reported measure of shared decision making. Patients answered questions on a scale of 0 (&quot;definitely disagree&quot;) to 9 (&quot;definitely agree&quot;). The CollaboRATE questions are as follows: 1) How much effort was made to help you understand your health issues? 2) How much effort was made to listen to the things that matter most to you about your health issues?, 3) How much effort was made to include what matters most to you in choosing what to do next? The outcome measure was the percent of patients who gave the top score of 9 on all three questions.</description>

    <description>&quot;Responses from this patient reported measure regarding their attitudes of doctor facilitation of patient involvement for their illness management. Patients rated 5 statements on a scale of 0 (&quot;&quot;definitely disagree&quot;&quot;) to 9 (&quot;&quot;definitely agree&quot;&quot;). The statements are as follows: 1) My doctor encouraged me to talk about personal concerns related to my medical symptoms, 2) My doctor asked me what I believe is causing my medical symptoms, 3) My doctor gave me a complete explanation for my medical symptoms or treatment, 4) My doctor encouraged me to give my opinion about my medical treatment, 5) My doctor asked me whether I agree with his/her decisions. The outcome measure was the percent of patients who gave the top score of 9 on all five statements.</description>

    <description>Patient responses to statements that were generated by the study's patient and physicians stakeholders regarding how they felt during their appointment. Patients rated 5 statements, described below, on a scale of 0 (definitely disagree) to 9 (definitely agree). The outcome measure is the percent of patients that responded with a top score of &quot;9.&quot; Statement 1: My doctor and I accomplished my most important goals today. Statement 2: I feel cared for. Statement 3: I feel comfortable being open with my doctor. Statement 4: I felt my doctor was open with me. Statement 5: I know what my next steps are.</description>

    <measure>Option 5 Shared Decision Making Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (outcomes measures were assessed once for each participant based on analysis of the audio recording of their visits)</time_frame>
    <description>Researchers measured the shared decision making process that occurs between patients and physicians during the appointment using a method called OPTION5. Researchers listened to audio-recorded patient appointments, identified any topic, defined as &quot;a health issue where alternate treatment or management option exist/where the need for a decision exists,&quot; and then measured each topic for each of the OPTION5 items on a scale of 0 (&quot;no effort: nothing observed or heard&quot;) to 20 (exemplary effort: excellent, careful attention to communication around the ideas and issues, with checks on understanding,&quot; for each of the 5 items described below. The total score is a sum of the scores from each of the 5 items at the clinic.
Item 1: presenting options Item 2: establishing a partnership with the patient Item 3: describing pros and cons of options Item 4: eliciting patient preferences Item 5: integrating patient preferences into the decision</description>

    <description>Open Communication includes a combination of interventions. 1) Participants used a Visit Companion Booklet to write out issues they would like to discuss with their physician during their appointment before showing up. They were also asked to write out any next steps decided on during their appointment and to repeat back to their doctor what they wrote before leaving.
2) Patients watched a short, informational cartoon video to better understand the Visit Companion Booklet.
3) Participating physicians received a training through the use of a Standardized Patient Instructor as a means of providing convenient, individualized training on communication techniques. Dyads (physicians and their medical assistants) were trained on how to incorporate the Visit Companion Booklet into workflow.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>From May 2014 to April 2015, 75 patients were screened and enrolled for each of the 4 participating family or internal medicine clinics. Researchers met with interested patients who had a regularly scheduled appointment in order to consent and advise on how to use the study materials. After their visit, they completed a post-visit survey.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>New patients and patients with physical exams or osteopathic evaluations were initially excluded though later allowed for recruitment for some physicians at one of the participating clinics. There were 6 patients who consented to participate but did not complete the final survey when exiting their appointment.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Patient Rating of Shared Decision Making</title>
        <description>Responses from CollaboRATE, a 3-question validated patient reported measure of shared decision making. Patients answered questions on a scale of 0 (&quot;definitely disagree&quot;) to 9 (&quot;definitely agree&quot;). The CollaboRATE questions are as follows: 1) How much effort was made to help you understand your health issues? 2) How much effort was made to listen to the things that matter most to you about your health issues?, 3) How much effort was made to include what matters most to you in choosing what to do next? The outcome measure was the percent of patients who gave the top score of 9 on all three questions.</description>

They were also asked to write out any next steps decided on during their appointment and to repeat back to their doctor what they wrote before leaving.
2) Patients watched a short, informational cartoon video to better understand the Visit Companion Booklet.
3) Participating physicians received a training through the use of a Standardized Patient Instructor as a means of providing convenient, individualized training on communication techniques. Dyads (physicians and their medical assistants) were trained on how to incorporate the Visit Companion Booklet into workflow.</description>

        <title>Patients' Feeling of Respect by Their Doctor</title>
        <description>Patient responses to one statement modified from Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) regarding the respect they felt from their doctor. Patients rated the statement &quot;My doctor showed respect for what I had to say,&quot; on a scale of 1 (&quot;definitely disagree&quot;) to 4 (&quot;definitely agree&quot;). The outcome measure was the percentage of patients that gave the top score of 4 on this statement.</description>

They were also asked to write out any next steps decided on during their appointment and to repeat back to their doctor what they wrote before leaving.
2) Patients watched a short, informational cartoon video to better understand the Visit Companion Booklet.
3) Participating physicians received a training through the use of a Standardized Patient Instructor as a means of providing convenient, individualized training on communication techniques. Dyads (physicians and their medical assistants) were trained on how to incorporate the Visit Companion Booklet into workflow.</description>

        <title>Option 5 Shared Decision Making Score</title>
        <description>Researchers measured the shared decision making process that occurs between patients and physicians during the appointment using a method called OPTION5. Researchers listened to audio-recorded patient appointments, identified any topic, defined as &quot;a health issue where alternate treatment or management option exist/where the need for a decision exists,&quot; and then measured each topic for each of the OPTION5 items on a scale of 0 (&quot;no effort: nothing observed or heard&quot;) to 20 (exemplary effort: excellent, careful attention to communication around the ideas and issues, with checks on understanding,&quot; for each of the 5 items described below. The total score is a sum of the scores from each of the 5 items at the clinic.
Item 1: presenting options Item 2: establishing a partnership with the patient Item 3: describing pros and cons of options Item 4: eliciting patient preferences Item 5: integrating patient preferences into the decision</description>

        <population>From the 75 patients at each of the 4 clinics, 10 appointments were randomly selected to be audio-recordinged. The Number of Participants Analyzed reflects the number of topics identified from the 10 recordings at each clinic.</population>
