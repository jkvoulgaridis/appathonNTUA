      This is a prospective open cohort study with annual assessment and reporting of descriptive
      findings and a final report at the end of the study to address all study objectives. The
      study period will include 10 years of data accumulated in each data system. The primary data
      sources will be the following:• US Medicare, including Parts A, B, and D• United HealthCare•
      Scandinavian national health registry databases, including data from Denmark, Sweden, and
      Norway. Data will be collected for postmenopausal women overall, women with Postmenopausal
      Osteoporosis, men with osteoporosis, and patients who receive Prolia for unapproved
      indications.

        Three study populations will be identified based on the following inclusion and exclusion
        criteria. Patients in Medicare and United HealthCare will need to have appropriate plan
        coverage to be included in any of the following populations. Appropriate plan coverage for
        the United HealthCare database refers to both pharmacy and medical plan coverage.
        Appropriate plan coverage for the US Medicare database refers to enrollment in traditional
        fee-for-service Medicare (Medicare Parts A and B coverage and not in a Medicare Advantage
        plan), plus Part D. The requirement of 12-months of continuous enrollment is not relevant
        for Scandinavian national registries because all citizens are enrolled in the universal
        health coverage from birth to death unless they move out of the country.

        Inclusion Criteria for women with postmenopausal osteoporosis:

          -  Postmenopausal women: Postmenopausal status will be determined based on age and
             defined as women ≥ 55 years old. For the Medicare database, only women ≥ 65 years old
             will be included in the analysis, given that generally all individuals in the US ≥ 65
             years old are eligible for Medicare coverage and data on postmenopausal women less
             than 65 years old will be available for only a small number of women meeting other
             specialized eligibility criteria.

          -  Women with Post Menopausal Osteoporosis: The presence of Post Menopausal Osteoporosis
             will be determined utilizing an algorithm based upon definition of postmenopausal
             women (≥ 65 years old in Medicare or ≥ 55 years old in other data systems), diagnostic
             codes indicating osteoporosis, diagnostic codes indicating osteoporotic fracture,
             and/or relevant postmenopausal osteoporosis treatment codes.

        Exclusion Criteria for women with postmenopausal osteoporosis:

        • Women with postmenopausal osteoporosis: Women with Paget's disease during the 12-month
        period prior to meeting criteria for inclusion in postmenopausal osteoporosis population
        will be excluded. Additionally, in US Medicare and United Healthcare, women with a
        diagnosis of malignancy (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) or treatment with
        chemotherapy, hormonal therapy or radiation therapy for cancer up to 12-months before index
        date will be excluded. In the Scandinavian national registries, women with a diagnosis of
        cancer according to the patient registry and/or cancer registry up to 12-months prior to
        meeting criteria for inclusion in postmenopausal osteoporosis population will be excluded.

        Inclusion criteria for men with osteoporosis:

          -  Men ≥ 65 years old in the Medicare database or ≥ 30 years old in United Healthcare who
             receive at least one denosumab 60 mg injection will be included. All men need to be
             continuously enrolled for at least 12 months prior to start of follow-up. A diagnosis
             code of osteoporosis or osteoporotic fracture would not be required because it is
             known that male osteoporosis is under-diagnosed. The exclusion of patients with cancer
             or Paget disease (as described in the Exclusion Criteria Section) will ensure that
             patients treated with Prolia is for osteoporosis but not for other indications. The
             index date is defined as the date when a patient first satisfies all inclusion
             criteria.

        Exclusion Criteria for men with osteporosis:

          -  Men with a diagnosis of malignancy (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) or treatment
             with chemotherapy, hormonal therapy or radiation therapy for cancer up to 12 months
             before the index date will be excluded.

          -  Men with Paget's disease during the 12-month period prior to the index date will also
             be excluded.
