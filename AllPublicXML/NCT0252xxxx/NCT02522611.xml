    <textblock>
      Background:

      Cancer-induced bone pain (CIBP) is common in people with cancer. Bone cancer can also lead to
      anxiety, depression, and reduced mobility and quality of life. Researchers believe a research
      drug called resiniferatoxin (RTX) may be able to help.

      Objective:

      To learn whether RTX is safe and can reduce cancer induced bone pain.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 18 and older with CIBP that is not relieved by standard treatments

      Design:

      Participants will have up to 6 outpatient visits over about 7 months. These will include:

      Medical history

      Physical exam

      Blood and urine tests.

      Thermal testing: a disk placed on the skin to test ability to sense temperature in and around
      the area of pain

      Chest x-ray

      EKG: stickers are placed on the chest to measure heart signals

      ECG: measures electrical activity of the heart

      Participants will have 1 inpatient visit lasting 2-4 days. This will include:

      Catheter inserted into a vein in the arm. They are given anesthesia, sedation, and x-ray
      contrast.

      A needle is passed through the skin of the back to inject the RTX.

      Participants will keep a log of the pain medications they take after surgery.

      Participants will be called 1 week and 2, 3, and 4 months after the injection.

      Participants will be mailed surveys and questionnaires to complete 2, 3, and 4 months after
      the injection.

    <textblock>
      Cancer-induced bone pain (CIBP) is a common clinical problem. While primary osteosarcoma is
      relatively uncommon, bone metastases frequently cause cancer-related pain with metastatic
      spread to bone in 60-84% of cases. Resiniferatoxin (RTX) is an ultrapotent agonist analog of
      capsaicin that targets a receptor expressed on specific dorsal root sensory ganglia (DRG)
      neurons and is expected to reduce pain within the targeted zone. The overall program goal is
      to develop a new treatment for intractable chronic pain below the mid-thoracic level
      resulting from CIBP that has not been controlled with conservative treatments.

      Objectives:

      The primary objective it to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of RTX when injected
      near one or more DRGs, to characterize its safety/toxicity profile, and to identify any
      dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). The secondary objectives are to determine the relative change
      in pain reduction, the change in opioid analgesic consumption and quality of life prior to
      RTX injection and at the various post RTX timepoints.

      Study Population

      Up to 30 adult subjects are estimated to be necessary for enrollment to have up to 16
      subjects who will receive RTX and provide study-related assessment results through the 30-day
      time point.

      Design

      The study is a single center, open-label Phase 1b dose escalation safety and efficacy trial
      for adult subjects with intractable pain due to CIBP below the mid-thoracic level. Those
      subjects who meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria will undergo various study procedures
      and then be scheduled for the unilateral periganglionic (PG) DRG injection(s) (a maximum of 3
      contiguous levels) under fluoroscopic guidance to treat the targeted DRGs demonstrated to be
      responsible for the chronic CIBP. The RTX will be injected at 1 of 4 dose levels, 0.8mcg/DRG,
      1.6 mcg/DRG, 3.2 mcg/DRG or 6.4 mcg/DRG. The adaptivedesign algorithm for this study utilizes
      outcome dependent randomization, a process that selects the dose to be administered to the
      next subject based on all previous outcomes. In this schema, DLT is the measure that will be
      used to determine if it is safe to escalate to the next highest dose level.

      Subjects who are screen failures and those who prematurely terminate participation will be
      replaced until 16 subjects have received the injection(s) and completed study-related
      assessments through the day 30 (D30) timepoint. There is no placebo group because of the
      invasive nature of the injection and the dose escalation performed in the study.

      Outcome Measures

      The primary outcome is to achieve a dose-response relationship for safety. All subjects will
      receive RTX. The secondary outcome measures are: 1) change in NRS and VAS scores at the
      post-RTX assessments compared to pre RTX assessment, 2) change of opioid usage (in MME) at
      post RTX assessments compared to pre RTX assessment; 3) comparison SF-36 and BDI at pre RTX
      injection and Days 14, 37, and 187.

      The efficacy outcome variable will be evaluated by establishing dose-response curves, with
      dose plotted on the x-axis and changes in efficacy endpoints (before RTX treatment and at the
      post RTX assessment visits) plotted on the y-axis. If, at the end of the study, all dose
      levels of RTX have equal pain-relieving efficacy, the Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC)
      may determine if it is appropriate to include a dose lower than 0.8 mcg and/or a control
      group. On the other hand, if the dose-response curves show that higher doses could result in
      greater pain-relieving efficacy, the protocol may be amended to include higher doses of RTX.

          1. Male or female subjects must be at least 18 years of age or older.

          2. Must be diagnosed with histologically-confirmed cancer-induced bone pain producing
             intractable chronic pain in the target area (mid thoracic or chest level down to lower
             extremities) which was poorly responsive to conservative therapies based on patient
             report, such as analgesic medication management with potent opioids with or without
             prior radiotherapy, bisphosphonates, or radioisotope therapy. Additionally, pain that
             is non-responsive to non-opioid drugs in situations where opioids were not tolerated.
             Conservative therapies do not include invasive treatments, such as neurolytic
             procedure, including surgical neurolysis, percutaneous regional or neuraxial
             continuous infusions (whether opioid or local anesthetic), and peripheral
             neuromodulation or spinal cord stimulation, but may include temporary diagnostic or
             therapeutic procedures.

          3. Not currently seeking or receiving potentially curative therapies for cancer (e.g.,
             chemotherapy or immunotherapy). Curative cancer therapy may be sought after the
             Outpatient Follow Up visit 14 (D14). Palliative anti-tumor therapy is allowed as long
             as the subject was established on that therapy prior to enrollment.

          4. Must have moderate to severe pain that is not relieved by standard treatments. Mean
             daily worst pain NRS score of greater than or equal to 6 for pain at or below the T6

             score must be derived from recordings on at least 4 of 7 consecutive days within 3
             weeks preceding treatment.

          5. The subject must agree to undergo a diagnostic periganglionic injection(s) with a
             long-acting local anesthetic (e.g., bupivacaine) under fluoroscopic guidance which
             resulted in at least a 30% temporary pain reduction in the targeted pain region
             lasting for the expected duration of the local anesthetic used.

          6. Must be healthy enough to tolerate study procedures in the judgment of the
             investigator.

          7. Subjects taking aspirin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications, or vitamin
             supplements that include vitamin E or any prophylactic anticoagulant (including but

             these at least 7 days before surgery or be given instructions on dosing changes if
             applicable. In addition, if patients are currently taking a Factor Xa inhibitor (such
             as Xarelto) a hematology consult will be obtained. Subjects must be willing to comply
             with this requirement, which is standard clinical practice when undergoing elective
             surgical procedures to avoid surgical and post-surgical bleeding complications.

          8. Formal review of the subject s medical records and written approval for his/her
             inclusion in the study by 3 separate persons:

             radiographic contrast agents.

          7. Subject must not have an anatomic abnormality or pathology of the spinal cord and/or
             PG space on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that could increase the risk of adverse
             effects of placement of the needle.

          8. Subject must not have a contraindication to MRI or MRI contrast..

          9. Subjects must not have evidence of a coagulopathy or hemostasis problem as

             evidenced by the following blood laboratory values within the week prior to the
             planned injection:

               -  PT/INR (prothrombin time/International normalized ratio) &gt; 1.5 times upper limit
                  of normal range (ULN).

             adversely impact the subject s participation or safety, conduct of the study, or
             interfere with the pain assessment, such as poorly controlled diabetes or
             hypertension. Patients can be re-assessed for eligibility if these conditions can be
             controlled medically.

         17. Subjects may not have a history of heart failure or unexplained fainting (syncope).

         18. Subjects who participated in a clinical trial of an investigational drug or device
             within 30 days of screening visit or are scheduled to receive an investigational
