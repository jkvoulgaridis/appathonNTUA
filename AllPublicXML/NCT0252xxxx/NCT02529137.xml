      The primary objective of this study is to show safety and effectiveness of the PDx for In
      Vitro Diagnostic (IVD) use as an aid to the pathologist to view, review and diagnose digital
      images of surgical pathology slides.

    <measure>Major Discordance Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint was the difference in major discordance rates between Manual Optical (MO) and Manual Digital (MD). MO is defined as reading by using optical microscope whereas MD is defined as reading by using PIPS. MO major discordance rate is defined as the proportion of major discordances between the MO diagnosis and the main diagnosis from the total number of readings.
MD major discordance rate is defined as the proportion of major discordances between the MD diagnosis and the main diagnosis from the total number of readings.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Case enrollment started in October 2015 and enrollment was completed in December 2015. A total of 2000 cases was enrolled. Eight cases were discontinued before reading, resulting in a total of 1992 cases for reading.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>In total 2000 cases were planned to be enrolled, divided over the clinical study sites.
A total of 2000 cases were enrolled, between 390 and 600 cases per site over four sites.</pre_assignment_details>
