  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to define the safety and tolerability of this drug combination.
      The study will also define the response rate of patients with advanced and unresectable
      NSCLC.

      This study has a dose escalation (Ib) and dose expansion phase (II). The ALT-803 treatment in
      the Phase Ib portion of the study will escalate until a recommended dose level is decided.
      This dose level will be used in the phase II portion of the study. The Phase II potion of the
      study will include two groups: Nivolumab naive and Nivolumab progressing. Patients will be
      enrolled to one of the arms based on their previous treatment with Nivolumab.

    <description>The phase II portion of the study looks to define the response rate (using immune-related RECIST) of ALT-803 added to nivolumab in patients with advanced and unresectable non-small cell lung cancer.
Response rate will be defined by the test overall response, which is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease, the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). The subject's best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.</description>

          8. Female participants of childbearing potential must adhere to using a medically
             accepted method of birth control up to 28 days prior to screening and agree to
             continue its use during the study or be surgically sterilized (e.g., hysterectomy or

          5. Patients with CNS metastases with the following exceptions: Patient untreated CNS
             metastases with 5 or fewer sites of disease, with no single site larger than 20mm, are
             eligible if they are asymptomatic and not requiring steroids at any dose. Patients
             with asymptomatic CNS metastases may be treated with radiosurgery before or during
             therapy on trial without treatment delays. Patients with treated, symptomatic CNS
             metastases are eligible if they are neurologically returned to baseline (except for
             residual signs or symptoms related to the CNS treatment) for at least 2 weeks prior to

             mg daily prednisone (or equivalent).

          6. Known autoimmune disease requiring active treatment. Subjects with a condition
             requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (&gt;10 mg daily prednisone
             equivalent) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of registration are
             excluded. Inhaled or topical steroids, and adrenal replacement steroid doses &lt; 10 mg

         13. Any ongoing toxicity from prior anti-cancer treatment that, in the judgment of the
             investigator, may interfere with study treatment. All toxicities attributed to prior
             anti-cancer therapy other than alopecia and fatigue must resolve to grade 1 (NCI CTCAE
             version 4) or baseline prior to registration.

         14. Anti-cancer treatment including surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, other
             immunotherapy, or investigational therapy within 14 days of registration.
