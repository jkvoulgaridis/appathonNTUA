    <description>KCCQ is a self-administered questionnaire that quantifies physical limitations, symptoms, self-efficacy, social interference and quality of life. This questionnaire is a reliable and responsive health status measure used in various cardiovascular research studies. A minimum mean group difference in KCCQ score of ≥5 is considered to be clinically significant. Each question responses are coded sequentially (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6) from worst to best status. Scores are generated by adding points for all questions and scaled from 0 to 100, with 0 denoting the worst and 100 the best possible status.</description>

    <description>The Short Form(SF) (36) Health Survey is a 36-item, patient-reported survey of patient health. The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.
The physical &amp; mental functions were assessed by the Physical Component Summary (PCS) score &amp; Mental Component Summary (MCS) score. Normal PCS and MCS scores vary depending on the demographics of the population studied. The PCS&amp;MCS norms for 65-75 year old are 44 &amp; 52, respectively while the norms for congestive heart failure (CHF) population are 31 &amp; 46, respectively.</description>

    <description>The 6MWT is a practical simple test that requires a 100-ft hallway but no exercise equipment or advanced training for technicians. This test measures the distance that a patient can quickly walk on a flat, hard surface in a period of 6 minutes (the 6MWD). It evaluates the global and integrated responses of all the systems involved during exercise, including the pulmonary and cardiovascular systems, systemic circulation, peripheral circulation, blood, neuromuscular units, and muscle metabolism. It does not provide specific information on the function of each of the different organs and systems involved in exercise or the mechanism of exercise limitation, as is possible with maximal cardiopulmonary exercise testing. The self-paced 6MWT assesses the submaximal level of functional capacity.</description>

             registration, assessed by the site using any one of the following methods:
             echocardiography, contrast left ventriculography, gated blood pool scan or cardiac
             magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Note: The method must provide a quantitative readout
             (not a visual assessment).

          4. New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification is class II, class III, or ambulatory
             class IV.

          5. Subject is deemed difficult for mitral valve surgery due to either Society of Thoracic
             Surgery (STS) surgical mortality risk for mitral valve replacement of ≥ 8% OR due to
             the presence of one of the following risk factors:

             not completed the primary endpoint or that clinically interferes with the current
             study endpoints. (Note: Trials requiring extended follow-up for products that were
             investigational, but have since become commercially available, are not considered
             investigational trials).

         26. In the opinion of the investigator or designee, subject is unable to comply with the
             requirements of the study protocol or is unsuitable for the study for any reason.

        <description>Mitral regurgitation severity is determined based on the American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) Recommendations for Evaluation of The Severity of Native Valvular Regurgitation with Two-Dimensional and Doppler Echocardiography. MR severity grade was assessed by the core lab using the transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) at baseline, discharge and subsequent follow-up visits. The severity of MR is determined by the amount of blood being pushed back into the left atrium when it should be circulating through the left ventricle with each heart beat. MR severity is typically classified as mild (grade 1+), moderate (grade 2+), moderate to severe (grade 3+) or severe (grade 4+).</description>

        <description>Mitral regurgitation severity is determined based on the American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) Recommendations for Evaluation of The Severity of Native Valvular Regurgitation with Two-Dimensional and Doppler Echocardiography. MR severity grade was assessed by the core lab using the transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) at baseline, discharge and subsequent follow-up visits. The severity of MR is determined by the amount of blood being pushed back into the left atrium when it should be circulating through the left ventricle with each heart beat. MR severity is typically classified as mild (grade 1+), moderate (grade 2+), moderate to severe (grade 3+) or severe (grade 4+).</description>

        <title>MR Severity Grade</title>
        <description>Mitral regurgitation severity is determined based on the American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) Recommendations for Evaluation of The Severity of Native Valvular Regurgitation with Two-Dimensional and Doppler Echocardiography. MR severity grade was assessed by the core lab using the transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) at baseline, discharge and subsequent follow-up visits. The severity of MR is determined by the amount of blood being pushed back into the left atrium when it should be circulating through the left ventricle with each heart beat. MR severity is typically classified as mild (grade 1+), moderate (grade 2+), moderate to severe (grade 3+) or severe (grade 4+).</description>

        <description>KCCQ is a self-administered questionnaire that quantifies physical limitations, symptoms, self-efficacy, social interference and quality of life. This questionnaire is a reliable and responsive health status measure used in various cardiovascular research studies. A minimum mean group difference in KCCQ score of ≥5 is considered to be clinically significant. Each question responses are coded sequentially (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6) from worst to best status. Scores are generated by adding points for all questions and scaled from 0 to 100, with 0 denoting the worst and 100 the best possible status.</description>

        <title>KCCQ QoL Scores</title>
        <description>KCCQ is a self-administered questionnaire that quantifies physical limitations, symptoms, self-efficacy, social interference and quality of life. This questionnaire is a reliable and responsive health status measure used in various cardiovascular research studies. A minimum mean group difference in KCCQ score of ≥5 is considered to be clinically significant. Each question responses are coded sequentially (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6) from worst to best status. Scores are generated by adding points for all questions and scaled from 0 to 100, with 0 denoting the worst and 100 the best possible status.</description>

        <description>The Short Form(SF) (36) Health Survey is a 36-item, patient-reported survey of patient health. The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.
The physical &amp; mental functions were assessed by the Physical Component Summary (PCS) score &amp; Mental Component Summary (MCS) score. Normal PCS and MCS scores vary depending on the demographics of the population studied. The PCS&amp;MCS norms for 65-75 year old are 44 &amp; 52, respectively while the norms for congestive heart failure (CHF) population are 31 &amp; 46, respectively.</description>

        <title>SF-36 QoL Scores</title>
        <description>The Short Form (36) Health Survey is a 36-item, patient-reported survey of patient health. The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.</description>

        <title>Six Minute Walk Test (6MWT) Distance</title>
        <description>The 6MWT is a practical simple test that requires a 100-ft hallway but no exercise equipment or advanced training for technicians. This test measures the distance that a patient can quickly walk on a flat, hard surface in a period of 6 minutes (the 6MWD). It evaluates the global and integrated responses of all the systems involved during exercise, including the pulmonary and cardiovascular systems, systemic circulation, peripheral circulation, blood, neuromuscular units, and muscle metabolism. It does not provide specific information on the function of each of the different organs and systems involved in exercise or the mechanism of exercise limitation, as is possible with maximal cardiopulmonary exercise testing. The self-paced 6MWT assesses the submaximal level of functional capacity.</description>

        <title>Six Minute Walk Test (6MWT) Distance</title>
        <description>The 6MWT is a practical simple test that requires a 100-ft hallway but no exercise equipment or advanced training for technicians. This test measures the distance that a patient can quickly walk on a flat, hard surface in a period of 6 minutes (the 6MWD). It evaluates the global and integrated responses of all the systems involved during exercise, including the pulmonary and cardiovascular systems, systemic circulation, peripheral circulation, blood, neuromuscular units, and muscle metabolism. It does not provide specific information on the function of each of the different organs and systems involved in exercise or the mechanism of exercise limitation, as is possible with maximal cardiopulmonary exercise testing. The self-paced 6MWT assesses the submaximal level of functional capacity.</description>
