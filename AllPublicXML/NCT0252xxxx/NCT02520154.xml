      This phase II trial studies how well pembrolizumab works when given in combination with
      carboplatin and paclitaxel in treating patients with stage III-IV ovarian, primary
      peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as
      pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with
      the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      carboplatin and paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either
      by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.
      Giving pembrolizumab in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel may be a better treatment
      for ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate progression-free survival of paclitaxel/carboplatin and pembrolizumab in
      patients with advanced stage, metastatic ovarian cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy
      (NACT).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the feasibility of combination therapy and maintenance pembrolizumab in this
      population.

      II. To evaluate the safety of combination and maintenance pembrolizumab. III. To report
      overall survival.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the sequential effects of chemotherapy on immune response and PD-1 expression
      and receptor occupancy.

      II. To evaluate circulating lymphoid populations (subsets). III. To determine tissue PD-L1
      expression and T-cell infiltration.

      OUTLINE:

      NACT: Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15, and
      carboplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 3 cycles in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo surgery.

      ADJUVANT THERAPY: Beginning 3-6 weeks after surgery, paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8,
      and 15, patients receive carboplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1, and pembrolizumab IV over 30
      minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 3 cycles in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Patients receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment
      repeats every 21 days for up to 20 cycles in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks.
