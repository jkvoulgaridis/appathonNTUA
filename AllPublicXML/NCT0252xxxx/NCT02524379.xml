  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of using oral Glyburide in patients with
      acute traumatic cervical spinal cord injuries (SCI).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will include patients between 18 and 80 years who have experienced acute traumatic
      cervical spinal cord injury (specifically ASIA A, B or C). Patients will then begin an oral
      drug regimen of Glyburide, which must be started within 8 hours of injury and continued for
      72 hours at a daily dose of 3.125 mg on Day 1, 2.5 mg on Day 2 and 2.5 mg on Day 3. If
      indicated, the patient will also have surgical intervention for spinal cord decompression and
      spinal stabilization. Each patient who takes part in this study will have labs drawn
      regularly and adverse events assessed daily through Day 14 or discharge (whichever is
      earlier). Study participation will last for 365 days (+/- 30 days), with post-hospitalization
      follow-up occurring on Days 28, 42, 84, 182 and 365.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Serum pharmacokinetic and biomarker analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>Enrollment through post-treatment day 7</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma concentrations will be serially quantified through day 3 following tSCI to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of Glyburide in the acute tSCI population. Comparisons will be made to reported levels achieved in healthy patient cohorts. Standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) techniques will be used to measure blood levels of neurofilament light chain, neuron- specific enolase, tau, S100b, and glial fibrillary acidic protein levels on admission, at 24 hours and on days 3 and 7 following tSCI to evaluate serum biomarker levels. Comparisons will be made to previously published values observed in non-treated control patients</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Spinal cord lesion imaging analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>Enrollment through post-treatment day 2</time_frame>
    <description>Finally, spinal cord lesion volume will be analyzed using standard sequences (including T1 and T2-weighted images) to assess the extent of the hemorrhagic lesion and surrounding edema. Patients will be imaged on the day of admission and on day 2 following injury demarcating a defined time window for assessment of post-tSCI lesion expansion 18. Volumetric assessments of lesion size (based on manual outlines) will be performed and compared at the two time-points by the study neuroradiologist to assess for the progression of intrinsic cord signal changes.</description>
