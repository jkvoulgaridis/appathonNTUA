  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The motor impairment produced by Parkinson's disease (PD) is a significant and debilitating
      part of the condition. Current methods to evaluate this impairment rely on subjective
      examinations. The investigators seek to develop an objective assessment of motor deficits by
      monitoring the participants natural interactions with a keyboard (on a computer or smart
      device). This approach provides a window to how the brain behaves during typical daily use of
      these devices, i.e. writing a report, sending an email or any other task performed on a
      digital device and thus has the potential to be used easily and regularly. (Importantly, the
      data gathered are non-sensitive and based only on timing information).

      PD participants will be recruited during outpatient visits to PD clinics throughout the
      Madrid metropolitan region. General entry criteria will be those patients who are scheduled
      to begin dopaminergic therapy, and own a home computer or laptop. The study will not impact
      on participants' standard clinical management other than by asking the participants to type
      for 15 minutes at each of the clinic visits, and installing the investigators proprietary
      software on their home computer. This software will collect keystroke data alone. (None of
      the actual information about what is being typed will be collected.) The keystroke data
      collected will be analyzed and compared with standard clinical metrics of therapeutic
      response, as well as the in-clinic typing data.

    <description>A diagnostic table will be computed with all the study subjects. Those subjects with a clinical relevant response to medication (&gt; 4 points in UPDRS - III) will be considered as true positives. Then, the accuracy of the typing test to detect them will be evaluated. For this purpose, the sensitivity, specificity, predictive values and ROC curve of a classification algorithm based on our nQ index will be computed. This will allow us assessing the validity of the test to identify a motor change. detected by the developed algorithm (sensitivity to a motor change).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Participants between 18 years and 70 years (older subjects will be deemed eligible on
             an individual basis after review by the study team).

          2. Parkinson's disease (PD) diagnosis according to the United Kingdom Brain Bank
             Criteria.
