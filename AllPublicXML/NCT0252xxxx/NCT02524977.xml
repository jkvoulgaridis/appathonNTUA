  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study objective was to improve decision-making and thromboprophylaxis for patients with
      Atrial Fibrillation (AF) by developing and implementing a computerized decision support tool
      for individual patient-level decision-making about oral anticoagulant therapy. To accomplish
      these goals, the investigators studied the incremental impact of adding a quality-improvement
      (QI) intervention to an educational package (for practice staff and clinicians) using a
      computerized aid, the Atrial Fibrillation Decision Support Tool (AFDST) for individual
      patient-level decision-making about oral anticoagulant therapy in patients with non-valvular
      AF. The decision support tool incorporates individual patients' risk factor profiles for
      ischemic stroke and bleeding and provides a recommendation for treatment based upon the
      projected quality-adjusted life expectancy gained or lost with the addition of either oral
      anticoagulant therapy or aspirin compared with no thromboprophylaxis.

      Setting - Cluster randomized trial. Setting - Primary care practices of an integrated
      healthcare system. Participants - 1,493 adults with non-valvular AF seen between April 2014
      and March 2015.

      Intervention - Treatment recommendations were made by an Atrial Fibrillation Decision Support
      Tool (AFDST) based on projections for quality-adjusted life expectancy calculated by a
      decision analytic model that integrates patient-specific risk factors for stroke and
      hemorrhage.

    <description>Educational Intervention Only - Educational package was delivered as 2 didactic noon-conferences on atrial fibrillation with a review of up-to-date anticoagulation guidelines for stroke prevention, and distribution of educational materials. Physicians delivering the noon conference series at all of the general internal medicine and primary care practice sites included 3 stroke neurologists, 2 cardiologists, and a general internist (PI) who were co-investigators in this study. Internists who were faculty at the University of Cincinnati and Internal Medicine residents also had an opportunity to participate in the first of the noon conferences in a special Department of Medicine Grand Rounds delivered by the PI.
All practices (intervention and control groups) received the educational package focused on physicians, and clinical and non-clinical staff who would be involved in this QI process.</description>

Providers were also reminded of upcoming visits for patients being seen within the next week so they could review their reports and use them in discussions with their patients.</description>

            <description>Educational Intervention Only - Educational package was delivered as 2 didactic noon-conferences on atrial fibrillation with a review of up-to-date anticoagulation guidelines for stroke prevention, and distribution of educational materials. Physicians delivering the noon conference series at all of the general internal medicine and primary care practice sites included 3 stroke neurologists, 2 cardiologists, and a general internist (PI) who were co-investigators in this study. Internists who were faculty at the University of Cincinnati and Internal Medicine residents also had an opportunity to participate in the first of the noon conferences in a special Department of Medicine Grand Rounds delivered by the PI.
All practices (intervention and control groups) received the educational package focused on physicians, and clinical and non-clinical staff who would be involved in this QI process.

            <description>Educational Intervention plus Decision Support - Physicians in the intervention arm received a practice-level and physician-level summary report via a secure web site designed for patients with treatment recommendations that were discordant with current therapy, along with an explanation for the recommendation, the gain or loss in QALYs predicted by the decision model and the current 2014 ACC/AHA/HRS guidelines. Providers were also reminded of upcoming visits for patients being seen within the next week so they could review their reports and use them in discussions with their patients.
