  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date two different instruments are commercially available to measure retinal oxygen
      saturation and retinal vessel diameters: Dynamic Vessel Analyzer (DVA) and Oxymap. Retinal
      oxygen saturation analysis is based on spectroscopic evaluation of retinal fundus images. Up
      to now no data comparing both instruments for the measurement of retinal oxygen saturation
      and vessel diameter are available in the literature.

      Study objectives: To compare retinal oxygenation and retinal vessel diameters in healthy
      subjects and patients with diabetic retinopathy or retinal vein occlusion between 2
      commercially available systems (DVA, Oxymap T1)

      Study design: Open pilot study

      Study population:

      30 healthy volunteers, age 18-80 years 30 type 2 diabetic patients with mild or moderate
      non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy, age 18-80 years 30 patients with retinal vein
      occlusion, age 18-80 years

      Topically administered medication:

      Tropicamide (Mydriaticum &quot;Agepha&quot;®, Agepha, Vienna, Austria), dose: 1-2 drops per study day
      for dilation of the pupil Oxybuprocainhydrochloride combined with sodium fluorescein
      (Thilorbin®, Alcon Pharma GmbH, Freiburg, Germany), dose: 1 drop in one eye for measurements
      of intraocular pressure Nonylacidvanillylamide combined with
      Nicotinic-acid--ß-butoxyethylester (Finalgon®, Boehringer Ingelheim RCV GmbH &amp; Co KG, Vienna,
      Austria): topical on the earlobe

      Methods:

      Dynamic vessel analyzer Oxymap T1 Blood pressure and pulse rate measurement Applanation
      tonometry Oxygen and carbon dioxide partial pressure measurement in arterialized blood from
      earlobe

      Main outcome variables:

      Difference of oxygen saturation of retinal vessels between DVA and Oxymap T1

      The motive for this investigation is to compare data between 2 commercially available
      instruments for the measurement of retinal oxygen saturation and retinal vessel diameter in
      healthy subjects as well as in patients with ocular disease associated with altered retinal
      oxygenation. Comparative data from both systems are currently not available. Data from this
      study will allow the comparison of studies performed with different systems. All oxygen
      measurement procedures are non-invasive and painless. Hence, the risk/benefit ratio appears
      to be acceptable.
