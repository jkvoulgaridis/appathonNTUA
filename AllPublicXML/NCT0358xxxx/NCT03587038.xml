  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study exploring the potential benefit of adding OKN-007 with Temozolomide for
      treatment in patients with malignant Glioblastoma undergoing adjuvant concomitant
      radiotherapy. This drug combination is expected to have an anti-cancer effect in patients who
      have experienced disease progression after first line treatment.

             contraindicated).

          -  Patients must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and must sign
             and give written informed consent for this protocol in accordance with institutional
             and federal guidelines.

          -  Serious concomitant systemic disorders (for example, active infection or abnormal
             electrocardiogram (ECG) indicative of cardiac disease) that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, would compromise the safety of the patient and his/her ability to
             complete the study

          -  Patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (calculated creatinine clearance of
