  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will explore whether if the use of Orlistat results in weight loss that is
      accompanied by a reduction in the body burdens of polybrominated biphenyls (PBB) and other
      Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Orlistat is an over-the-counter weight-loss aid that preferentially reduces body fat compared
      to diet and exercise alone. PBB is a Persistent Organic Pollutant (POP), characterized by a
      very long half-life and storage in adipose (fat) tissue.The study will explore whether if the
      use of Orlistat results in weight loss that is accompanied by a reduction in the body burdens
      of polybrominated biphenyls (PBB) and other Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs).

    <measure>Change in weight</measure>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Body Mass Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening, 3 and 6 months follow up visits</time_frame>
    <description>Body Mass Index is a weight-to-height ratio, calculated by dividing one's weight in kilograms by the square of one's height in meters and used as an indicator of obesity and underweight. Participants will have their weight measured in light clothing without shoes on a regularly calibrated digital scale. Height will be measured using a well-mounted stadiometer.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in dietary intake using Automated Self-administered 24-hour Recall score</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening, 3 and 6 months follow up visits</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked to recall their food and beverage intake during the previous 24-hour period using the most recent version of the Automated Self-Administered 24-hour (ASA24) Recall - an interactive web-based system sponsored by NCI - that prompts participants for food description details and automatically codes and calculates nutrient intakes. Details are described here: https://epi.grants.cancer.gov/hei/developing.html Using data collected from ASA24 recalls, two outcomes will be assessed: diet quality and percent of calories from fat. Diet quality will be assessed with the Healthy Eating Index (HEI-2015). This Index contains 13 components that sum to a maximum of 100 points (minimum 0 points; higher scores are better). Percent of calories from fat will be calculated by dividing the total calories from fat by the total calories consumed.These are continuous variables. We will determine if the percent calories from fat is reduced during the course of the trial.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in physical activity</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening, 3 and 6 months follow up visits</time_frame>
    <description>Change in physical activity will be assessed using the Women's Health Initiative Physical Activity Questionnaire (WHI-PAQ) which assesses physical activity across several domains (leisure, domestic and yard, work and transportation-related activities) and when scored can provide metrics of total minutes/week spent in various categories of activity and can be transformed to MET (metabolic equivalent) values for overall activity.
METs will be calculated as outlined in Appendix 2 of this reference: Meyer AM, Evenson KR, Morimoto L, Siscovick D, White E: Test-retest reliability of the Women's Health Initiative physical activity questionnaire. Med Sci Sports Exerc 2009;41:530-538.
A physical activity summary variable will be created by combining frequency, duration and MET-estimated intensity:
(Frequency of activity per week × Minutes per session × MET for that activity) / (60 min/hour)</description>
