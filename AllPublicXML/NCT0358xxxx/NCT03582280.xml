  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An exploratory open label study to improve the function and welfare of late-stage solid
      cancer subjects (with or without lung involvement) who failed or refused anti-cancer
      treatment by ACC treatment, administered orally and concomitantly by inhalation.

      The following measures will be evaluated: improvement of pain, performance status, dyspnea
      measurement (Modified Borg Scale)/ oxygen saturation (if applicable) and overall survival.

      The subjects' medical charts will be reviewed for their eligibility including the following:
      medical history, prior cancer treatments, pathologic diagnosis of cancer, and CT/Chest X-ray
      results. Assessment of prior and concurrent medication use, physician evaluation of patient
      status, and measurement of Albumin Corrected Serum Calcium level (to be done at baseline and
      prior to dose escalation, so that results are available prior to the visit) will be performed
      prior to each dose escalation; in addition, vital signs, ECOG/Karnofsky performance status
      and VAS pain assessments will be recorded at each visit as well. CT test will be executed
      during the study period: at baseline, week 12 and week 24 visits in order to assess
      progression free survival by CT.

      The tests during the visits will be performed by a physician/nurse. Each subject will receive
      individual doses of AMOR-powder by escalating doses up to 1,800 mg of ACC powder per day
      (Amor powder administration will be continuous along the day - each eppendorf every two
      hours). Patients who will not be able to swallow the powder, will receive similar doses of
      ACC in tablets.

      In addition, subject will inhale 1% ACC in 8 ml suspension, for inhalation three times a day.

      Subject's functionality will be assessed by serially determining ECOG/Karnofsky performance
      status. Subject's progression free survival will be assessed by CT to evaluate tumor response
      to treatment.
