  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates within-person and between-person effects of a personalized normative
      feedback intervention and injunctive norms as they are altered by self-determination in heavy
      drinkers. Half of participants will receive personalized normative feedback and the other
      half will receive control feedback about media use habits.

    <masking_description>Participants will be assigned to and receive feedback via the computer. Once they have received feedback a research assistant will print this feedback for them to take home. At this time, research assistants will become unblinded to condition, but will not administer any new procedures other than answering participant questions.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Between-Person Self-Determination by PNF Interaction Predicting Consumption</measure>
    <time_frame>2-4 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A structural equation model will be fit with baseline consumption, self-determination, intervention condition, and the interaction between self-determination and condition predicting follow-up alcohol consumption. Consumption will be measured with the Alcohol Consumption Index, Quantity-Frequency-Peak Alcohol Use Index, and the Daily Drinking Questionnaire. These scales will be used as indicators of a single latent consumption variable. That latent consumption measure will be the outcome of interest.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Within-Person Self-Determination by PNF Interaction Predicting Consumption</measure>
    <time_frame>17 Days</time_frame>
    <description>A multilevel model will be fit with baseline consumption, daily self determination, intervention condition, and the interaction between condition and daily self-determination predicting daily alcohol consumption. Consumption will be measured as the number of drinks consumed the previous evening.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Between-Person Self-Determination by PNF Interaction Predicting Alcohol-Related Problems</measure>
    <time_frame>2-4 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A structural equation model will be fit with baseline consumption, alcohol-related problems, self-determination, intervention condition, and the interaction between self-determination and condition predicting follow-up alcohol-related problems. Alcohol-related problems will be measured with the Rutgers Alcohol Problems Index and the Young Adult Alcohol Consequences Questionnaire. Each of these problems measures will be split to form two indicators (for a total of four problems indicators) for an overall problems latent variable. This problems latent variable will then be used as the outcome of interest.</description>

    <measure>Within-Person Self-Determination by PNF Interaction Predicting Alcohol-Related Problems</measure>
    <time_frame>17 Days</time_frame>
    <description>A multilevel model will be fit with baseline consumption, daily self determination, intervention condition, and the interaction between condition and daily self-determination predicting daily alcohol alcohol-related problems. Alcohol-related problems will be measured with a checklist of non-overlapping items from the Rutgers Alcohol Problems Index and the Young Adult Alcohol Consequences Questionnaire. This combined checklist will be used to create the overall problems outcome of interest.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants will receive feedback about their average number of days on which alcohol was consumed, average drinks per occasion, and average number of drinks per week. This feedback will include the participant's averages reported at baseline, the participant's descriptive norm of others' averages (what they think others drank), and actual others' drinking. Feedback will be about other students at their university of the same sex.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive feedback about their number of hours texting, on social media websites, and playing video games. This feedback will include the participant's averages reported at baseline, the participant's descriptive norm of others' averages (what they think others did), and actual others' behavior. Feedback will be about other students at their university of the same sex.</description>
