  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lifelong premature ejaculation (LPE) is a common male sexual dysfunction with a high
      prevalence in global. Up to now, the etiology of LPE remains unclear. In recent years,
      dapoxetine, a highly potent serotonin-transporter inhibitor, has been used for treating
      premature ejaculation. However, the underlying mechanism of dapoxetine was unknown. Recently,
      with widespread use of neuroimaging techniques, like positron emission tomography and
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in basic science, researchers can acquire human data on
      cerebral base of human sexual behavior, not only in normal subjects but also in patients with
      sexual dysfunction. Therefore, in order to further understand the biological mechanism of LPE
      and the brain targets of dapoxetine, the present study would investigate the brain changes of
      LPE and the effect of dapoxetine on brain activation by using MRI technology.
