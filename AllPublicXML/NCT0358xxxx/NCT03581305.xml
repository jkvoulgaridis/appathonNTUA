  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is a serious disease with no cure. Some people
      with HIV have depression and other mood problems. They can have problems with thinking and
      memory. Researchers think 2 chemicals in the brain may cause those problems. The chemicals
      are serotonin and dopamine. The researchers want to take images to learn more about those
      chemicals in HIV patients.

      Objective:

      To learn how HIV affects serotonin and dopamine in the brain.

      Eligibility:

      Adults ages 18-70 with HIV who have been on antiretroviral treatment for at least 1 year

      Healthy adults ages 18-70

      All participants must be already enrolled in protocol 13-N-0149.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a urine drug test. The results could be shared with
           insurance companies.

        -  Participants who could be pregnant will have a pregnancy test.

        -  Participants may have a physical exam and blood tests.

        -  Participants will have 1 or 2 positron emission tomography (PET) scans. A needle will
           guide a thin plastic tube (catheter) into an arm vein. A radioactive drug will be
           injected into the plastic tube. This is a tracer that helps researchers understand the
           PET images.

        -  Participants who have the dopamine scan will have to fast for 4-6 hours before the scan.
           They will take a pill to help direct the tracer to the brain one hour before the scan.

        -  Each scan will last about 1.5 hours.

        -  Participants will be asked to drink a lot of fluids and empty their bladder frequently
           for the rest of the day after each scan.

      Background: An extensive body of literature points towards neuronal brain injury in human
      immunodeficiency virus positive (HIV-positive) subjects despite virological suppression of
      the virus in the periphery under the effect of antiretroviral therapies (ART). Existing
      evidence suggests that the central nervous system (CNS) could be an important reservoir for
      human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) regardless of cumulative time on treatment. This results
      in progressive neurocognitive dysfunction despite optimal treatment and peripheral control of
      the infection. Even though structural imaging studies have described abnormalities in
      optimally-treated HIV-positive subject population, there has been only a few attempts at
      deciphering the cellular levels of brain damage in those subjects using in vivo molecular
      imaging biomarkers. As part of CNS involvement, specific neurotransmitter systems including
      the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems are thought to be affected by the infection with
      distinct neurological, cognitive and psychological manifestations, even in optimally-treated
      subjects.

      Objective: This protocol aims at identifying aspects of dopaminergic and serotonergic
      dysfunction in optimally-treated HIV-positive subjects using high resolution positron
      emission tomography (PET) of the brain and radioligands targeted against the dopaminergic
      (18F-FDOPA) and serotonergic (11C-DASB) systems.

      Study population: We will identify 25 eligible HIV-infected individuals and 50 eligible
      HIV-negative (HIV-) individuals for the dopaminergic arm, and 20 HIV-infected individuals and
      20 HIV-negative individuals for the serotonergic arm. Subjects will be selected from protocol
      #13-N-0149 (&quot;Screening and Recruitment for HIV-associated Neurocognitive Disorders (HAND)
      Studies&quot; and &quot;An Evaluation of HIV-associated Neurocognitive Disorders in Virologically
      Controlled Patients&quot;, PI Dr. Avindra Nath; ALL HANDS protocol) and those who meet eligibility
      criteria will be offered enrollment in our study.

      Design: Subjects will undergo either a one-time 18F-FDOPA PET scan or a one-time 11C-DASB PET
      scan or both, if eligible. HIV-positive subjects and HIV-negative individuals will be
      included in the study.

      Outcome Measures: Influx constant (Ki) for 18F-FDOPA PET and Binding potential relative to

      non-displaceable binding (BPND) values for 11C-DASB PET

        HIV-negative Subjects with or without co- morbidities (Group E, n=20)

        1. HIV-antibody negative

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        All Subjects (Groups A-E):

          1. Illness or other condition that, in the opinion of the PI, may interfere with study
             participation at the time of enrollment, including known history of significant
             intracranial structural damage such as previous stroke(s) or history of intracranial
             benign or malignant tumors.

          2. Conditions other than HAND associated with cognitive impairment or dementia such as
             Alzheimer s, Parkinson s disease, head injury with loss of consciousness &gt;30 minutes,
             or seizure disorders.

          3. A positive screening result for psychiatric diseases that are known to affect the
             dopaminergic or serotonergic systems.

          4. Current substance abuse that would interfere with PET scan results at the
             investigators discretion.

          5. Medications: use of any drug with known dopaminergic or serotonergic activity within 6
             months prior to planned imaging date(s).

          6. Pregnant or Lactating women: Women of childbearing potential must have a negative
             serum or urine pregnancy test within 1 week prior to study entry. Pregnancy testing
             will also be performed in enrolled female participants prior to any radiation
             exposure.

          7. Prior or planned/anticipated exposure to radiation due to clinical care or
             participation in other research protocols, which would exceed the recommended
             acceptable annual limit of radiation exposure once accounting for the requirements of
             the current study.

        Additional Exclusion Criteria for the Dopaminergic Arm (Groups A, B and C):

          1. Use of any of the following drugs within 6 months from planned imaging date(s):

               1. Haloperidol (increased intracerebral dopamine turnover caused by haloperidol may
                  result in increased accumulation of 18F-DOPA)

               2. Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (may result in increased accumulation of
                  18F-DOPA in the brain)

               3. Reserpine (reserpine-induced depletion of the contents of intraneuronal vesicles
                  may prevent retention of 18F-DOPA in the brain)

               4. Carbidopa/LDOPA (LDOPA competes with 18F-DOPA for DOPA decarboxylase activity)

          2. Allergy to carbidopa

        Note that HBV is not an exclusion criterion for groups A, B, D or E since it s not known to
        have direct CNS pathology in the absence of advanced liver disease and cirrhosis.
