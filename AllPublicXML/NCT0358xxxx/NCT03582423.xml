  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, a 24-week, single blinded, randomized controlled clinical trial will be
      conducted to examine the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for Chemotherapy Induced
      Peripheral Neuropathy (CIPN) in colorectal cancer patients in Hong Kong.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot single-blind, randomized, sham-controlled trial. 84 colorectal cancer
      patients will be randomly assigned to acupuncture group or control group. The duration of the
      treatment will be 12 weeks with 1 session per week and the follow-up period will be 12 weeks.

    <masking_description>Subjects of both groups will be randomly assigned to receive either electro-acupuncture or control (sham) treatment. For randomization, simple, complete non-sequential random numbers will be generated in advance by a computer program in a block of four, and kept by the principal investigator. After a patient's eligibility is confirmed, a randomization number which corresponds to the group allocation will be provided to the acupuncturist by the PI. This arrangement will ensure that the clinical assessor and participants are blinded to the allocation.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in scores of Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy/Gynecology Oncology Group/Neurotoxicity (FACT/GOC-Ntx) questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,15,18,21,24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>FACT/GOC-Ntx includes 11 questions covering sensory neuropathy, motor neuropathy, hearing neuropathy, and dysfunction associated with neuropathy. It results in a cumulative score ranging from 0 to 44, with the higher scores reflecting worse neuropathy symptoms. It will be assessed every week during 12-week treatment and the post-trial access will be performed at 15th, 18th, 21st and 24th week.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in scores of numerical rating scale (NRS) of numbness/pain score in hands and feet</measure>
    <time_frame>0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,15,18,21,24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>patients will be asked to rate their average neuropathy symptoms within one week, on an 0 to 10 scale (0 = no symptoms; 10 = worst possible symptoms), those &lt;4 of 10 NRS will be considered as mild CIPN while ≥4 of 10 NRS will be considered as moderate to severe CIPN. It will be assessed every week during 12-week treatment and the post-trial access will be performed at 15th, 18th, 21st and 24th week.</description>

    <description>It is a 30-items questionnaire assessing five functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional and social), three symptoms scales (fatigue, pain, nausea and vomiting), and other symptoms and problem in cancer patients (dyspnea, appetite loss, insomnia, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties).It will be assessed every 3 weeks during 12-week treatment and the post-trial access will be performed at 15th, 18th, 21st and 24th week.</description>

It will be assessed at the end of treatment (12th week) and at the end of follow-up (24th week).</description>

The use of ba xie (EX-UE9) and ba feng (EX-LE10) will be optional if skin lesions of hands and feet occurs due to Capecitabine (Xeloda).Disposable acupuncture needles will be inserted at a depth of 10-25mm into the points. We will deliver electrical stimulation with continuous waves at 2 Hz, at an intensity of each patient's minimum sensation of stimulation through the electrical acupuncture stimulation instrument to the points. The needles will be retained in position for 25 minutes.</description>
