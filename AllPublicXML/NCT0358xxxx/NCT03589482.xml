  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mechanical ventilation can cause damage by overstretching the lungs, especially when the
      lungs are collapsed or edematous. Raising ventilator pressures can reduce lung collapse and
      this can prevent overstretching from mechanical ventilation. It remains uncertain how much
      pressure (PEEP - positive end-expiratory pressure) should be used on the ventilator and how
      to identify patients who will benefit from higher ventilator pressures vs. lower ventilator
      pressures. The investigators are using a unique new imaging technology, electrical impedance
      tomography (EIT), to study this problem and to determine the safest and most effective
      ventilator pressure level. The results of this study will inform future trials of higher vs.
      lower PEEP strategies in mechanically ventilated patients.

      Patients participating in this physiological cross-over randomized trial will undergo a
      series of PEEP maneuvers designed to assess lung recruitability, PEEP responsiveness, and
      optimal PEEP. EIT imaging and esophageal manometry will be employed throughout the protocol
      to quantify the effect of PEEP on lung function. Patients will be randomized to be ventilated
      at PEEP levels supplied by the ExPRESS strategy or by the EIT hyperdistention/collapse
      algorithm. The biological response will be assessed by measuring serum cytokines.

    <description>Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a new technique that enables real-time visualization of the distribution of ventilation at the bedside. This technique allows clinicians and investigators to immediately determine how applying higher or lower PEEP levels affect stress and strain in the lung. The investigators propose to apply this new technique to test a strategy for finding the optimal level of PEEP that prevents lung injury and improves outcomes in critically ill patients.</description>
