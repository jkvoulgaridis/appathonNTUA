  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate whether strengthen community diabetes patients self-monitoring of blood
      glucose can improve the patient's blood glucose control under Chinese guidelines for the
      prevention and treatment of diabetes (CDS 2017) and whether this intervention produces health
      and economic benefits.

      This project is a cohort intervention study for randomized controlled trials. Community
      health service centers are the main body of implementing treatment and community diabetes
      patients are the objects of intervention. 498 T2DM patients with poor blood glucose control
      (7%＜HbA1c≤9.5%) from 4 different community health service centers will be randomized into two
      groups (strengthen group and control group). Strengthen self-monitoring of blood glucose by
      APP is the intervention and its duration is 12 months. Follow-up time of this study is 24
      months (12 months after the intervention stopped). The diabetes treatment of patients from
      both groups follows Chinese guidelines (CDS 2017).
