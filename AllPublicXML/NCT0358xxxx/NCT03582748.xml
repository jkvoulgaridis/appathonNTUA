  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bariatric surgery is an important treatment option for morbidly obese patients who fail to
      lose weight through diet and exercise. Despite intervention, 20-50% of patients either fail
      to lose targeted amounts of weight or regain weight that was lost initially. Attempts at
      predicting degree of weight loss have had only modest success and none have long term (&gt;2
      year) reliability. Moreover, research predicting weight loss beyond the 1st or 2nd year
      post-surgery and for outcomes other than weight loss including comorbidities common in the
      bariatric population is lacking. The investigators' pilot data in 45 patients suggest that
      individual differences on pre-surgical neural activity measured with functional MRI (fMRI)
      reliably explains 33% of the variance in weight loss up to 1 year post surgery, and over 50%
      of a multifaceted outcome measure, far outperforming many other indicators. These predictors
      implicate regions that closely conform to a theoretical model emphasizing both consummatory
      urges (a &quot;Now&quot; neural circuit) vs. regulation of craving and self-control (a &quot;Later&quot;
      circuit). The central hypothesis in this study is that individual differences in these neural
      pathways exert a powerful effect on the ability to sustain weight loss and achieve other key
      health outcomes.

      The study will replicate and refine this model over a longer timeframe and assess its
      predictive utility for key weight-related health outcomes. The investigators propose to
      replicate the model derived from their fMRI pilot data and secondarily to explore its
      predictive utility for changes in calorie intake, activity levels, liver fat, hemoglobin A1c,
      plasma lipids, blood pressure, and fasting glucose in a new, independent cohort of N=150
      successively consenting, presurgical sleeve gastrectomy (SG) patients in study years 1-3. The
      study will follow the pilot cohort for up to 7 years and the new cohort for 3 or more years
      to determine if predictors replicated in Aim 1 retain their long-term predictive power,
      particularly when supplemented with non-brain imaging variables and using a larger
      longitudinal dataset. The study will use imaging and non-imaging data to develop multivariate
      statistical models incorporating energy balance, fMRI, and laboratory values with the
      variables described in Aim 1 to help to separate predictors vs. consequences of post-surgical
      outcomes. To help separate scan-to-scan variability from true post-surgical,
      trajectory-related brain changes, the study will enroll N=20 obese subjects who will not
      undergo bariatric surgery, and are individually matched with the above SG subjects. Finally,
      the study will evaluate whether several related, non-fMRI cognitive tests might potentially
      act as surrogates in clinical practice.

    <measure>Regulation of Craving (ROC) functional MRI (fMRI) Task</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 7 years</time_frame>
    <description>This task tests food cue- induced craving and the ability to regulate craving. Participants are given an instruction, see pictures of high-calorie foods (previously shown to increase craving) and then rate their craving on a scale from 1 (not at all) to 5 (a lot).</description>

    <time_frame>up to 7 years</time_frame>
    <description>Participants see cues that they may win or lose money ($0, $1, $5), then wait for a variable anticipatory delay period, and respond to a rapidly presented target with a single button press to try to either win or avoid losing money.</description>

    <measure>Affective Pictures Paradigm (APP) fMRI Task</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 7 years</time_frame>
    <description>This task examines neural activity elicited by incidental emotional processing that engages emotional systems. Forty-two single-face pictures (14 happy, 14 angry and 14 neutral expressions) are presented in pseudorandom order for 3 sec with a 9-sec inter-stimulus interval during which a fixation cross serves as a baseline measure. Participants are instructed to identify via button press whether the face was male or female.</description>
