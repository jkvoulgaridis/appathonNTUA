      The aim of this study is to adapt the Sedentary Behavior Questionnaire (SBQ) into the culture
      of Turkish and to work on the reliability and validity of it in healthy individuals between
      the ages of 18-64. The permission was obtained via mail from Dori Rosenberg, who is the
      developer of the questionnaire, for its Turkish adaptation. SPSS package programme will be
      used in the analysis,

      The aim of this study is to adapt the Sedentary Behavior Questionnaire (SBQ) into the culture
      of Turkish and to work on the reliability and validity of it in healthy individuals between
      the ages of 18-64. Original form has nine questions but Spanish version of it had eleven
      questions so the investigators will translate Spanish version of SBQ. At first step by using
      a forward-backward translation method, a translation and adaptation process will be
      performed. At second step the validation process will be performed in a total of 200 healthy
      subjects aged between 18-64 years. Subjects will fill sociodemographic information form,
      International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form, and SBQ Turkish version ( at
      baseline and after seven days). Cronbach's alpha values, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA)
      will be evaluated for the reliability, construct and convergent validity.

    <description>Sedentary Behavior Questionnaire scales the amount of time spent doing 11 sedentary behaviors.Response options are none, 15 minutes or less, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours,3 hours, 4 hours, 5 hours, 6 hours or more. In the scoring the time spent on each behavior is converted into hours (eg, a response of 15 minutes is recoded as .25 hours). For the total scores of sedentary behavior, responsed hours per day for each behavior are summed separately for weekday and weekend days. For the summary scores of total hours/day spent in sedentary behaviors (weekday and weekend) and total sedentary hours/week, responses higher than 24 hours/day are truncated to 24 hours/day. There are not any normative variables of Sedentary Behavior Questionnaire.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form(IPAQ-SF) scales the types of intensity of physical activity and sitting time that people do as part of their daily lives. The short form records the physical activity of 3 different intensity levels: 1) vigorous-intensity activity such as aerobics (8.0 MET), 2) moderate-intensity activity such as leisure cycling (4.0 MET), 3) walking (3.3 MET). The IPAQ-SF questions activities for last 7 days with 7 items. In the scoring total estimate physical activity in MET-min/week and time spent while sitting are calculated ( Ex. 4.0 METx activity dayx activity duration (in minutes) equals moderate-intensity activity total MET score).According to scores subjects are categorized as inactive (achieving &lt;600 MET-min/week), minimally active (achieving a minimum of at least 600 MET-min/week and &lt;3000 MET-min/week), active (&gt;3000 MET-min/week).</description>
