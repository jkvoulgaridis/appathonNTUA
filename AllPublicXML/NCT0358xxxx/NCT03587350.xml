  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study involves the use of a novel, non-invasive, monitoring device to measure the
      response to treatment with botulinum toxin injections in 24 (16 Intervention and 8 control)
      patients with cervical dystonia. A baseline assessment, prior to botulinum treatment,will be
      structured around validated clinical rating scales for cervical dystonia and questionnaires
      and the performance of simple neck movements, and will be undertaken while the patient wears
      a movement sensor attached to the head with an elastic strap. The same assessments will be
      undertaken at 0, 3, 6, 9 and 12 weeks following treatment to assess response. The patients'
      treatment will not be affected by their participation in the research. The device readings
      will then be compared with the clinical ratings to establish whether it might be used as a
      more sensitive measure of treatment response than clinical assessment alone. This will help
      clinicians to plan and execute botulinum injections more effectively in future
