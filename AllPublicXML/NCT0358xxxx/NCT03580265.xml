  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The laser acupuncture is a new and potential intervention for the disease of peripheral
      nerve. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of laser acupucnture therapy on
      carpal tunnel syndrome.

    <textblock>
      Laser acupuncture is combined low level laser with acupuncture points. Investigators perform
      a prospective randomized, single-blinded study to investigate the efficacy of laser
      acupuncture in patients with carpal tunnel syndrome. Patients were randomized into
      intervention and control group. Participants in intervention group received six-sessions of
      laser acupuncture and six-sessions of sham laser acupuncture was given in control group. All
      participants used wrist splint at night. The evaluation was performed pretreatment as well as
      on the 2th, 4th, 8th and 12th week after the treatment.

    <time_frame>baseline, 2th, 4th, 8th and 12th weeks after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire (BCTQ) is a disease-specific measure of self-reported symptom severity and functional status. One is the minimum score and five is the maximum score in each symptom severity scale (11 items). The total score range of symptom severity scale is 11 to 55. One is the minimum score and five is the maximum score in each functional status scale (8 items). The total score range of functional status scale is 8 to 40.

    <description>The visual analog scale (VAS) is a measurement instrument that tries to measure the amount of pain that a patient feels ranges across a continuum from none to an extreme amount of pain. Zero is the minimum score of pain and ten is the maximum score of pain.
