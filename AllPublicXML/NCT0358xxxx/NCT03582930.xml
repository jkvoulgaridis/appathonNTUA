  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surfactant replacement therapy can be life-saving for newborn infants born with symptomatic
      lung surfactant deficiency causing Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS). Currently, such
      therapy requires instillation of a liquid suspension into the trachea through an endotracheal
      tube. Endotracheal intubations have undesirable adverse effects on fragile premature infants.
      Instilling surfactant as a liquid suspension into the lung is associated with adverse events
      due to interruption of breathing in patients who already have respiratory insufficiency. This
      treatment protocol is expanded access that offers the opportunity for patients to receive
      aerosolized Infasurf prior to FDA acting on ONY Biotech's application for approval for
      commercial marketing of aerosolized Infasurf.

      This Treatment Protocol will offer patients access to aerosolized Infasurf therapy at the
      time RDS is diagnosed if a patient is &lt;12 hours of age and has not previously received liquid
      surfactant, or is &lt;24 hours of age, and received liquid surfactant in the first hour after
      birth, was extubated and RDS is worsening. Parents must give informed consent. Up to 2 repeat
      doses of aerosolized Infasurf can be administered. Aerosolized Infasurf must be administered
      as described in the protocol. Adverse events at administration (if any) and all serious
      adverse events related or possibly related the aerosolized Infasurf therapy will be extracted
      from the medical record and reported to the sponsor, ONY Biotech. A copy of the discharge
      summary of patients will be collected by the sponsor using HIPAA compliant methodology for
      generation of a data set that will characterize adverse events and other efficacy and safety
      data.

    <description>Aerosolization of Infasurf administered to premature babies suffering from RDS. Successful administration of Infasurf by aerosolization will provide two important benefits for patients. (1) endotracheal intubation may be able to be avoided in some patients, and (2) the adverse events at instillation due to filling the airway with liquid and interrupting breathing may be diminished or abolished.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Two cohorts with different entry criteria are included. In cohort 1 are patients with a
        diagnosis of early RDS who are not intubated and have not received a liquid surfactant
        instillation. In cohort 2 are patients who received liquid surfactant in the first hour of
        life, have been extubated and whose RDS is worsening.

        Cohort 1 Inclusion Criteria

          1. NICU patient, &lt;12 hours of age.

          2. Clinical diagnosis of RDS, with or without chest X-ray data.

          3. Inspired oxygen ≤40% to maintain adequate oxygen saturation.

          4. Not intubated

          5. Requiring: (a) nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP), or (b) high flow
             nasal cannula (≥2L/kg/min) (HFNC), or (c) non-invasive ventilation.

        Cohort 2 Inclusion Criteria

          1. NICU patient, &lt;24 hours of age who received liquid surfactant at ≤ 1 hour of age and
             was extubated.

          2. Clinical diagnosis of RDS, with or without chest X-ray data.

          3. Inspired oxygen ≤40% to maintain adequate oxygen saturation.

          4. Not intubated

          5. Requiring: (a) nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP), or (b) high flow
             nasal cannula (≥2L/kg/min) (HFNC), or (c) non-invasive ventilation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1) Requires &gt;40% inspired oxygen to maintain acceptable oxygenation 2) Requires
             endotracheal intubation. 3) A co-existing medical condition that makes aerosol
             administration contraindicated in the judgment of the attending physician.
