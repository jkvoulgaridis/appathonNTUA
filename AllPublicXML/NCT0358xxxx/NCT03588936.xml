      This is a phase 1, interventional single arm, open label, treatment study designed to
      evaluate the safety combination programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and interleukin 6
      (IL-6) inhibition in participants with relapsed disease post-allogeneic transplant.

      Study disease: Hematologic malignancies including, but not exclusive to,acute/chronic
      leukemia, lymphoma, and myelodysplastic syndrome that has relapsed after allogeneic
      transplant.

      Study Rationale: Phase 1 Safety/Dose Finding Study: To determine the safety and maximum
      tolerated dose of Nivolumab in combination with Tocilizumab.

      Study Agent Description:

      Tocilizumab is a monoclonal antibody and immunosuppressant; specifically, tocilizumab is an
      IL-6 receptor antagonist.

      Nivolumab is a human immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody that binds to the PD-1
      receptor of T cells blocking its interaction with PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby enhancing T-cell
      proliferation and allowing the immune system to attack the tumor.

      Number of Subjects: A maximum of 12 participants will be enrolled on this Phase 1 study.

      Duration of Follow-up: Participants will be followed for up to one year post-treatment for
      survival and response.

      Study Design: This is a 3 + 3 design. In a &quot;3 + 3 design,&quot; three participants are initially
      enrolled into a given dose cohort. If there is no dose limiting toxicity (DLT) observed in
      any of these subjects, the trial proceeds to enroll additional subjects into the next higher
      dose cohort. If one subject develops a DLT at a specific dose, an additional three subjects
      are enrolled into that same dose cohort. Development of DLTs in more than one of six subjects
      in a specific dose cohort suggests that the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has been exceeded,
      and further dose escalation is not pursued.
