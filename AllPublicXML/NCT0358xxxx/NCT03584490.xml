  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low health literacy as a barrier to healthcare. Health literacy is defined as &quot;the degree to
      which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health
      information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.&quot; A vast body of
      research shows that lower health literacy is associated with poorer outcomes, including
      higher hospitalization rates, worse health, and greater mortality. Approximately 75 million
      U.S. adults have low health literacy. Worse yet, racial and ethnic minorities and older
      individuals (age 65+) are more likely to have low health literacy, creating another mechanism
      for health disparities. These data indicate that many people will have difficulties adhering
      to treatment regimens that require health literacy, as well as completing questionnaires for
      public health and health research and care.

      Improving self-report assessment. Health surveys are ubiquitous, but almost no questionnaires
      used across the country have been validated for use with people who have low health literacy.
      This is a glaring shortcoming in current survey validation methodology; inaccurate surveys
      lead to false conclusions and threaten the empirical foundation of everyone's efforts to
      understand and improve public health, healthcare, and health outcomes. Our goal is to rectify
      this shortcoming. This study will 1) determine the effect of health literacy on widely-used
      questionnaires, 2) determine the stability of psychometric properties of questionnaires over
      time, and 3) test various testing formats to determine which ones work best for people with
      low health literacy.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The degree of differential item functioning (DIF) in NIH Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS Profile 57 v 2.0)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>A primary outcome of this study will be the degree of DIF in NIH PROMIS questionnaires observed across adequate versus low health literacy.
The outcome will be measured by a McFadden pseudo-R-square, which captures the degree to which health-literacy group determines probability of response type for each item.
PROMIS has the following subscales: Physical function, Anxiety, Depression, Fatigue, Sleep disturbance, Ability to participate in social roles and activities, Pain interference, Pain intensity.
For DIF analysis, each scale is normalized to a theta metric (mean = 0, standard dev. = 1 by definition). PROMIS is scaled by T-scores, referenced against the mean of the US population. Items are aggregated using item response theory, but aggregation is not relevant to this study because the McFadden pseudo-R-square is evaluated for each item.
Pain intensity will not be included because it is only 1 item and is not amenable to DIF.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The degree of differential item functioning (DIF) in the Berlin Questionnaire (sleep)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>A primary outcome of this study will be the degree of DIF observed in the Berlin Questionnaire across adequate versus low health.
The outcome will be measured by a McFadden pseudo-R-square, which captures the degree to which health-literacy group determines probability of response type for each item.
For DIF analysis, each scale is normalized to a theta metric (mean = 0, standard dev. = 1 by definition). Thus, the unit of measure is one standard deviation.
Normally items are aggregated by a sum score, but the aggregation is not relevant to this study because the McFadden pseudo-R-square is evaluated for each item, not for aggregate scores.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>NIH Toolbox - Meaning and Purpose</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>A primary outcome of this study will be the degree of DIF observed in the NIH Toolbox - Meaning and Purpose questionnaire across adequate versus low health literacy, determined by Health LiTT.
The outcome will be measured by a McFadden pseudo-R-square, which captures the degree to which health-literacy group determines probability of response type for each item.
For DIF analysis, each scale is normalized to a theta metric (mean = 0, standard dev. = 1 by definition). Thus, the unit of measure is one standard deviation.
Normally items are aggregated by a score determined by an item response theory scoring algorithm using a two-parameter model. It should be noted that the aggregation is not relevant to this study because the McFadden pseudo-R-square is evaluated for each item, not for aggregate scores.
By convention NIH Toolbox scores are rescaled to T scores (mean = 50, Standard Deviation (SD) = 10 by definition), referenced against the mean of the US population.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PTSD Checklist/PCL-5)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>A primary outcome of this study will be the degree of DIF observed in the PCL-5 (PTSD checklist) across adequate versus low health literacy, determined by the Health Literacy Assessment Using Talking Touchscreen Technology (Health LiTT). The PCL-5 is a questionnaire used to determine the presence of PTSD and severity of PTSD.
The outcome will be measured by a McFadden pseudo-R-square, which captures the degree to which health-literacy group determines probability of response type for each item.
For DIF analysis, each scale is normalized to a theta metric (mean = 0, standard dev. = 1 by definition). Thus, the unit of measure is one standard deviation.
Normally items are aggregated by a sum score, but the aggregation is not relevant to this study because the McFadden pseudo-R-square is evaluated for each item, not for aggregate scores.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Ruminative Responses Scale (RRS; 10-item version)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>A primary outcome of this study will be the degree of DIF observed in the RRS across adequate versus low health literacy, determined by Health LiTT. The RRS is a questionnaire used to quantify the degree to which the participant ruminates.
The outcome will be measured by a McFadden pseudo-R-square, which captures the degree to which health-literacy group determines probability of response type for each item.
For DIF analysis, each scale is normalized to a theta metric (mean = 0, standard dev. = 1 by definition). Thus, the unit of measure is one standard deviation.
Normally items are aggregated by a sum score, but the aggregation is not relevant to this study because the McFadden pseudo-R-square is evaluated for each item, not for aggregate scores.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>A primary outcome of this study will be the degree of DIF observed in the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), a questionnaire used to measure depression, across adequate versus low health literacy.
The outcome will be measured by a McFadden pseudo-R-square, which captures the degree to which health-literacy group determines probability of response type for each item.
For DIF analysis, each scale is normalized to a theta metric (mean = 0, standard dev. = 1 by definition). Thus, the unit of measure is one standard deviation.
Normally items are aggregated by a sum score, but the aggregation is not relevant to this study because the McFadden pseudo-R-square is evaluated for each item, not for aggregate scores.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Exit interview: Participant comfort during assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>At the end of the 6-month study, each participant will provide information about their experience during testing. There are about 1) Comfort, 2) Difficulty, and 3) Nervousness.
Each items is rated on a 5-point scale. Investigators will treat these data as ordinal and thus no unit of measure is assumed. Investigators will evaluate this outcome using non-parametric statistics, that is, a Spearman correlation between rating and whether the participant received the talking touchscreen (coded 0 or 1).
These items will be administered verbally by a research coordinator.
Investigators predict that participant's receiving the talking touchscreen will report high levels of comfort, less difficulty, and less nervousness. Investigators will evaluate statistical significance using a 99% confidence interval, rejecting the null hypothesis if this interval does not contain zero.
The items will not be aggregated; each item will be analyzed separately.</description>
