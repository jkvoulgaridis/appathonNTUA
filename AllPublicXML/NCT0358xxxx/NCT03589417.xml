  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a clinical condition characterized by the repetitive
      obstruction of the upper airway during sleep, resulting in nocturnal hypoxaemia and
      fragmented sleep. Fragmented sleep leads to daytime sleepiness that causes alterations in
      reaction times and reflexes . Postural stability is an important function of the human body.
      It is shown that the sleep deprivation disturbs daytime postural stability and balance. Aim
      of this study is to examine the influence of OSA severity and daytime sleepiness on postural
      stability, balance and fall risk.

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>'Postural Stability Test' will be applied with Biodex Balance System®. Subjects will stand still on the platform and the displacement of the centre of gravity will be quantified for anterior-posterior (AP) and medial-lateral (ML) axes. Test provides three types of scores: overall stability index, anterior-posterior stability index and medial-lateral stability index. Higher scores indicate worse postural stability.</description>

    <measure>Limits of Stability Test score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>'Limits of Stability Test' will be applied with Biodex Balance System®. Subjects will stand on the platform and lean in eight directions to control the cursor displayed on the screen and try to move the cursor inside the target circles. Test provides scores for all eight directions as well as an overall score. Higher scores indicate better performance (0= worst performance; 100= perfect performance)</description>

    <measure>Fall risk Test score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>'Fall Risk Test' will be applied with Biodex Balance System®. Subjects will stand still on the platform which will gradually become more unstable for 20 seconds. Total displacement of the centre of gravity will be quantified. Test provides one score: Overall stability index. Higher score indicates higher risk of fall.</description>
