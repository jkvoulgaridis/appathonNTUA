  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to inspect the effect of nurses wearing the surgical mask on their
      patients' satisfaction with the relationship. All participants will initially be treated
      without the mask. Then, half will be treated with the mask and the other half will be treated
      without the mask.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of the surgical mask has well-known benefits for both the patient and the
      professional regarding the control of infection contamination. However, its use is left to
      individual criteria, and is passed on from generation to generation of nurses through
      experiential, intuitive knowledge. Studies are necessary to support the use of the surgical
      mask.

      Research indicates that wearing the mask affects perception of words, thus influencing
      patient-nurse communication. However, it might also affect the very nurse--patient relation.
      For example, it can convey the idea of personal distancing, which can either be appreciated
      by patients as dutiful professional care by the nurse, or viewed as a limit imposed on
      interpersonal communication and on the relationship.

      This study inspects patient satisfaction about (1) interpersonal aspects and (2)
      professionalism in the patient-nurse relationship when the mask is used.
