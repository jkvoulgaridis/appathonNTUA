  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the use of osteopathic manipulation (manual medicine) for migraine
      headache following traumatic head injury. Headache is an important and very common somatic
      complaint among people with traumatic brain injury and an important cause of disability in
      the United States. Over 15-percent of soldiers deployed to Iraq sustained concussion. A
      majority of these patients suffer from headaches. Many of these are classified as migraine
      headache that do not respond to medications. Osteopathic manipulation is practiced by
      physicians in the United States and has been shown to be beneficial in some migraine
      patients. However, its use in the management of persistent post-traumatic headaches has not
      been explored. The investigators will use a randomized cross-over design to evaluate
      post-traumatic migraine patients' response to osteopathic manipulation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 30-week prospective, randomized delayed treatment control group design in which 20
      participants from the community will be randomized 1:1 into (a) an immediate treatment group
      that will receive 12 weeks of osteopathic manipulation (OMT) treatment plus standard of care
      right away or (b) delayed treatment group that will receive 12 weeks of OMT plus standard of
      care after a 6-week waiting period. The delayed treatment group initially serves as a control
      condition but then receives the experimental treatment. The investigators selected this
      control condition to improve our statistical power in this small pilot study. As noted, all
      participants will continue to receive standard of care throughout the study as a washout is
      not feasible with osteopathic manipulation and removing standard of care could exacerbate the
      participant's symptoms. Participants in both arms will be followed for another 12 weeks after
      the 12 weeks of OMT, resulting in 24 weeks of study participation for the immediate treatment
      group and 30 weeks of study participation for the delayed treatment group, with participants
      in both arms answering a series of questionnaires to evaluate migraine frequency and impact,
      treatment efficacy, side effects, adherence t standard of care and depressive symptoms every
      6 weeks throughout their study participation. Participant encounters will consist of
      screening, psychometric and functional scale administration at every 6 weeks for a total of
      24-30 weeks, as well as 12 weeks of OMT treatments for participants in both study arms. Study
      participants will likely come from UCSD internal referrals.

    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>20-item measure that asks respondents to rate how often over the past week they experienced symptoms associated with depression, such as restless sleep, poor appetite, and feeling lonely. Response options range from 0 to 3 for each item (0 = Rarely or None of the Time, 1 = Some or Little of the Time, 2 = Moderately or Much of the time, 3 = Most or Almost All the Time). Scores range from 0 to 60, with high scores indicating greater depressive symptoms.</description>

    <description>Osteopathic manipulation involves a number of different manual techniques. These include muscle inhibition; myofascial release; muscle energy stretch; counterstrain; facilitated positional release ; osteopathy in the cranial field ; balanced ligamentous tension/ligamentous articular strain; one or all of these techniques may be used. Participants will be positioned on an exam table supine, seated, lateral decubitus, prone, or in their position of greatest comfort for the procedure.</description>
