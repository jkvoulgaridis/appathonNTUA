    <textblock>
      Sixty patients with a diagnosis of knee osteoarthritis, aged between 40 and 80 years, of both
      genders were included. The patients were divided into: experimental group that carried out an
      educational program - 5 consecutive sessions held once a week, with a duration of 60 minutes
      each class and at the end of the last class, a booklet was delivered for each patient with
      all the contents of the classes and the Transcutaneous Nerve Electro-Stimulation device -
      being performed twice weekly, for 5 weeks for 40 minutes each session; and control group who
      only underwent treatment with the Transcutaneous Nerve Electro-Stimulation in the same
      parameters as experimental group. The evaluations were performed at the beginning of the
      treatment, 4 and 12 weeks after the beginning of the treatment using a numerical pain scale;
      WOMAC; IDATE and SF-36 questionnaires; and 6-minute walk test.
