  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this research is to develop and validate standard operating procedures
      (SOP) to assess the human pancreas in individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and other forms
      of diabetes using advanced, quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) approaches.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research applies magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques to study the pancreas of
      individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and other forms of diabetes. Recent studies have
      demonstrated reduced pancreatic volume is present within months of T1D diagnosis in children,
      adolescents, and adults, and in non-diabetic individuals expressing islet autoantibodies that
      portend the development of T1D. As the pancreatic beta cells constitute only 1-2% of the
      pancreas, the degree of reduction in pancreas volume at disease onset suggests exocrine
      involvement, challenging the established paradigm of T1D being solely a disease of the
      endocrine pancreas. These unexpected findings raise fundamental questions that challenge our
      understanding of T1D pathogenesis. These changes in pancreatic volume and size before and
      soon after onset of T1D, as detected by MRI, appear to be a marker of the T1D pathogenic
      disease process. There is an urgent need to determine whether similar observations can be
      obtained at different centers using different MRI platforms. Discovery of unknown changes may
      lead to new ways to treat disease. The MRI techniques may also be useful for following how
      T1D is progressing in different people, determining whether new drugs are effective, and
      ultimately detecting T1D in people earlier than currently possible.

        Individuals with diabetes for this study may be referred by any pediatric or adult
        endocrinologists. Healthy controls are recruited via a passive recruitment process. A small
        subset of controls will travel to multiple study centers to have an MRI. In this study, the
        MRI scan will be used for research purposes only. However, if we see something that is not
        normal, the participant will be told and asked to consult his or her doctor.
