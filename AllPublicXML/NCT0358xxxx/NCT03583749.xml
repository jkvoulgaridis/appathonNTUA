  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elderly people are more prone to develop infection with a poorer prognosis compared to young
      people. Physicians may encounter difficulties regarding antimicrobial agents administration
      route. In fact, poor venous access and behavioral disturbance are frequent issues. The
      subcutaneous (SC) route may be a safe alternative, but sparse data are available in the
      literature. The present study aims to describe Pharmacokinetics (PK) / Pharmacodynamics (PD)
      characteristics of antibiotics (amoxicillin/clavulanate, ceftriaxone and
      piperacillin/tazobactam) subcutaneous administration in patients aged over 65.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Antibiotic administration through subcutaneous (SC) injection is common practice in France,
      especially in Geriatrics as an alternative to intravenous (IV) route in case of poor venous
      access or delirium (Forestier et al. CMI 2015). Whereas tolerance of such a practice seems to
      be reasonable (Roubaud-Baudron et al. Age and Ageing 2017), sparse PK/PD data are available.
      Most PK/PD studies include young and healthy subjects, yet elderly patients often have
      multimorbidity , poly medication, renal insufficiency and cachexia which may disturb
      antibiotics PK/PD. Compared to intravenous (IV) route, SC route is less painful and less
      frequently associated with infectious or thrombotic complication. A recent study carried out
      in Bordeaux University Hospital comparing PK/PD data on ertapenem SC or IV administrations in
      patients aged over 75 showed that area under the curve (AUC) and probability to maintain free
      ertapenem concentration above the Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) during at least 40%
      of time (fT&gt;MIC&gt;40%) were not significantly different (manuscript in progress).

      The investigator's hypothesis is that SC administration of amoxicillin-clavulanate,
      ceftriaxone and piperacillin-tazobactam has favorable pharmacokinetics and acceptable
      tolerance compared with IV infusion in elderly patients.

      Patients receiving one of the three antibiotics by IV or SC route will be included at steady
      state (depending on antibiotic treatment) for several blood tests (3 or 4 depending of routes
      choice) and followed until 15 days after completion of antibiotic treatment in order to
      evaluate tolerance and efficacy of antibiotic treatment. Physicians in charge of patients
      will decide antibiotic prescription including administration route. The study will not
      influence these choices because patients will be included after antibiotic initiation.

      The sampling times chosen are the following:

        -  C0: concentration measured at the end of the therapeutic interval, just before the
           following infusion, which corresponds to the minimum or residual concentration

        -  Cperf: concentration measured at the end of infusion: immediately after stopping the
           infusion, which corresponds to the maximum concentration IV

        -  C5h: concentration measured in the elimination phase, 5h after the end of the infusion.
           For the subcutaneous route only, an additional sample will be taken:

        -  C2h: concentration measured 2h after the end of the SC infusion.

      The tubes will then be processed in the local pharmacokinetic laboratory as follows:

      For each antibiotic, the blood samples obtained from each recruitment center will be
      transported, centrifuged, aliquoted and frozen at the local pharmacology laboratory. The
      tubes will then be batched to the centralized transport dosing laboratory every 6 months.
