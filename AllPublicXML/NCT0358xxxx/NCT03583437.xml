  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) covers a spectrum from reversible hepatic steatosis
      to inflammation and fibrosis termed steatohepatitis (NASH) and cirrhosis. New evidence
      indicates that NAFLD is associated with development of heart failure, abnormal ventricular
      glucose and fatty acid (FA) utilisation and cardiosteatosis. The mechanisms behind cardiac
      involvement and the progression from NAFLD to NASH are poorly understood but must include
      altered cardiac and intrahepatic lipid handling. In collaboration with renowned research
      groups from Oxford, Mayo Clinic and Copenhagen investigators plan comprehensive kinetic
      studies of heart and liver FA uptake and oxidation, ventricular function and substrate
      utilisation, and hepatic triglyceride (TG) secretion in order to assess mechanisms governing
      cardiac and hepatic lipid and glucose trafficking in subjects with NAFLD and NASH and the
      relationship with heart function. In addition, the investigators will assess skeletal muscle
      and adipose tissue enzyme activities, gene expression and protein concentrations in these
      subjects to define mechanisms involved in the cross-talk between heart, liver, muscle and
      adipose tissues. Investigators will address these questions using innovative tracer
      techniques (11Cpalmitate, 11C acetate, 18FDG glucose PET tracers and TG tracers) in
      combination with hepatic vein catherisation to study cardiac and liver substrate trafficking,
      as well as NMR spectroscopy, echocardiography, muscle and fat biopsies in combination with
      state-of-the art muscle and adipose tissue enzyme kinetics, gene- and protein expression.
      Effects of acute exercise will be assessed. The overarching goals are to define abnormalities
      and differences between NAFLD and NASH in hepatic lipid (FA and TG) metabolism and to assess
      the effect of exercise on both hepatic, cardiac and adipose and skeletal muscle lipid and
      substrate utilisation.
