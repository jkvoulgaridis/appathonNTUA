  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Cabozantinib in Japanese
      patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who have received prior systemic
      anticancer therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called Cabozantinib. Cabozantinib is being tested to
      treat advanced hepatocellular carcinoma in Japanese patients. This study will look at the
      efficacy and safety of Cabozantinib.

      The study will enroll approximately 32 patients. Participants will be assigned to Cohort A
      (at least 17 participants) or Cohort B (approximately 15 participants) and will receive the
      following treatment. Participants who have received prior sorafenib will enroll to Cohort A
      and participants who have not received prior sorafenib will enroll to Cohort B.

      - Cabozantinib 60 mg

      All participants will be asked to take one tablet of cabozantinib once daily in the fasted
      state (dose at least 2 hours after meal and no more food intake for 1 hour postdose)
      throughout the study.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Japan. The overall time to participate in this
      study is approximately at most 3 years. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic
      during the treatment and posttreatment period, including a follow-up assessment after last
      dose of study drug.

    <description>24-week PFSR is defined as Progression-Free Survival (PFS) proportion at Study Day of Week 25 Day 1 plus 7 days. PFS is defined as time from the first day of study drug administration to the earlier of progressive disease (PD) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) or death due to any cause. PFS will be assessed by independent radiology committee (IRC) per RECIST 1.1 where PD: At least a 20% increase in the baseline sum of the diameters (SoD) of target lesions, taking as a reference the smallest (nadir) SoD since (and including) baseline. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the SoD must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.</description>

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received, an opportunity for the primary publication of the research has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com/approach for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>
