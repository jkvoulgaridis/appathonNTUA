  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an experimental study of participants who had positive blood culture to compare time
      to appropriate antibiotic between using Microarray Assay and Mass Spectrometry to bacterial
      Identification.

      Between June to Dec 2018, 200 participants those met the eligibility criteria were enrolled
      in this study that is a quasi experimental study. All participants were empirical antibiotic
      therapy by infectious physician. 100 patients in Pre-intervention group had bacterial
      identification by Mass spectrometry technique from bacterial colony and 100 patients in
      Post-intervention group had bacterial identification by Microarray assay from blood culture.
      Antibiotic adjustment were considered after bacterial identification and result of antibiotic
      susceptibility testing. Then all participants were re-evaluated outcome after treatment.
      Finally, the results were ready to analysis in January 2019.
