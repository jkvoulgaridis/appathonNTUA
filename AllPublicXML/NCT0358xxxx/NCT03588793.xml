  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phantom limb pain (PLP) is experienced by 60-80% of all people who have had an amputation.
      This persistent pain condition can impact on independence, activities of daily living and
      overall quality of life.

      While there is some research into PLP there is no consensus on appropriate outcome measures
      and there is (to our knowledge) neither guideline nor literature evidence on the reliability
      and validity of outcomes measures for this patient group. Such measures are vital to the
      robust evaluation of any interventions and/or monitoring progression.

      The aim of the proposed study is to assess the reliability and validity of four self-report
      questionnaires (Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain, Short Form McGill Pain Questionnaire 2
      (SFMPQ-2), Trinity Amputation and Prosthetic Evaluation Scale (TAPES), a health-related
      quality of life measure (EQ-5D-L), a pain diary, a left/right limb judgement task (Implicit
      Motor Imagery Testing - IMIT) and the two-point discrimination (TPD)test.

      The data will be collated and statistically analysed to assess how stable each of the
      measures are over time (intra session reliability) and how each measure co-relates with the
      others (validity).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age: ≥ 18 years At least six months post amputation (date of surgery) The amputation
             must be above wrist/ankle. Are currently experiencing PLP which has persisted for at
             least 3 months or more They rate their PLP as ≥3 on a 0-10 scale on at least 2 days in
             the preceding week Concomitant medications;

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participating in any research trial of any intervention hypothesised to affect PLP.

        Currently under-going active prosthetic rehabilitation e.g. walking training sessions or
        upper limb rehabilitation sessions.

        Any current non-prescribed substance dependency An inability to understand and follow basic
        instructions - both the two-point discrimination test and left/right limb judgement task
        requires the participant to follow basic/simple instructions.

        Any person, otherwise eligible, who commences any treatment for PLP (physical or
        pharmacological, prescribed or non-prescribed) will be withdrawn from the study.
