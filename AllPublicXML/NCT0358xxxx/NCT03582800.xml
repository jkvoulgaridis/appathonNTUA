  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ectopic soft tissue calcifications or ossifications can complicate the course of numerous
      diseases; most of them are rare or very rare. Even if the clinical, radiological and
      pathological presentation of ectopic calcifications and ossifications are different, the same
      hypotheses are discussed considering their hypothetical pathophysiology. Indeed, high calcium
      phosphate product, local cellular lesions and abnormal transdifferentiation of mesenchymal
      cells are regularly evoked when pathophysiology of such calcifications or ossifications are
      discussed. Apart from several case reports that have not been confirmed so far, no medical
      treatments are available, leading to significant pain and impairment of quality of life for
      patients. Therefore, only surgical treatment can be proposed when the volume or the
      consequences of these calcifications/ossifications become too important.

      Sodium thiosulfate (STS) is currently used as a cyanide poisoning antagonist and a
      chemoprotectant against adverse effects of several chemotherapies such as Cisplatin. Numerous
      case reports and several studies have revealed the potential interest of STS in the treatment
      of uremic induced vascular or soft tissues calcifications. Recently, our group has developed
      an expertise in the use of STS for the treatment of ectopic soft tissue calcifications or
      ossifications. Considering these promising preliminary data, and their limits, we developed a
      strategy to treat soft tissue calcifications or ossifications based on a local administration
      of STS. The first results of this therapeutic strategy are highly promising and the local or
      systemic safety is satisfactory so far. These preliminary data also reported by others
      deserve to be confirmed in a prospective study.

      We propose in this project to conduct a prospective open controlled phase II trial in order
      to assess the efficacy and the safety of intralesional administration of STS for the
      treatment of calcifications secondary to dermatomyositis or systemic sclerosis and ectopic
      ossifications secondary to pseudo-hypoparathyroidism 1a type (PHP1A/iPPSD2) (inactivating
      parathyroid hormone / parathyroid-hormone-related peptid (PTH/PTHrP) signalling disorder).
