  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this project is to de-implement the reliance on opioid analgesics and
      to implement reliance on non-opioid analgesics to manage postoperative pain following dental
      extractions. Using a prospective, provider-level, 3-arm cluster randomized trial design, the
      investigators will compare different strategies to reduce the reliance on opioids and
      increase the use of alternative pain management approaches utilizing information support
      tools aimed at both providers and their patients.

      The primary objective of this project is to de-implement the use of opioid analgesics for the
      management of postoperative pain following dental extractions and to implement effective
      alternative pain management. The investigators propose a cluster-randomized trial design in
      which dental practitioners will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 conditions involving different
      implementation strategies. The first condition, Standard Practice, will serve as a control
      condition. The second condition will implement a clinical decision support (CDS) tool that
      will extract patient history and interface with the state prescription drug monitoring
      program to provide personalized recommendations for analgesic prescribing and offer language
      for discussing optimal, evidence-based non-opioid pain management with dental extraction
      patients. The third condition will involve an enhanced version of the CDS (CDS-E) that will
      also include information regarding optimal, evidence-based, non-opioid pain management
      delivered directly to the patient both before and following the dental extraction visit. The
      investigators will examine opioid and non-opioid prescribing data from the electronic health
      record across study arms as well as other provider- and patient-focused outcomes using mixed
      methods.
