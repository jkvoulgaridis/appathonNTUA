  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Hyperglycaemia is an important cause of long-term macro-and microvascular
      complications in all patients with diabetes mellitus. However, only a small fraction of the
      patients with diabetes reaches the set target of glycemic control. Problems with adequate
      self-management usually underlie problems to maintain glycaemic control. Thus, patients need
      more support in order to reduce the burden and increase the effectiveness of their diabetes
      self-management. One way to do this is by using integrated technologies and personalized
      plans for diabetes care. For this purpose, the POWER2DM support system was developed to give
      patients insight into their condition and support diabetes patients and their health care
      professionals in setting and achieving self-management goals using predictive computer model
      simulations and behavioural action plans.

      Objective: To provide proof of concept that POWER2DM is safe and effective in improving
      glycaemic control, improving behavioural/psychosocial and lifestyle markers, and to assess
      the cost-effectiveness of the approach and to highlight any potential issues that may impede
      implementation.

      Study design: This is a pragmatic randomised controlled trial with 9 months follow-up in
      which patients will be randomised 1:1 to either Power2DM support (Power2DM group) or usual
      care (usual care group). There will be evaluation moments at baseline, after 11 weeks, 22
      weeks and 37 weeks.

      Study population: 230 patients with diabetes (N=115 type 1 diabetes (T1D), N=115 type 2
      diabetes (T2D)) recruited from out-patient clinics in the Netherlands (Leiden University
      Medical Centre and affiliating teaching hospitals N=115) and Córdoba, Spain (Reina Sofia
      University Hospital N=115).

      Intervention: The POWER2DM support group will receive access to the prototype 2 of the
      POWER2DM system. This system consists of two components: 1) the web-based Shared Decision
      Making Dashboard, used to set self-management goals together with a health care professional
      with the use of both short- and long-term predictive computer simulation models, and 2) the
      POWER2DM Self-Management Support System as a mobile application and webpage, used to support
      behavioural change in DM self-management. The system is fed with data from an activity
      tracker, a glucose monitor and manual data entry.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: Change in glucose regulation as measured by %HbA1c before
      and after the intervention compared between the intervention and control group.
