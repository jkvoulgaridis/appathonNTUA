    <description>The popliteal angle test was performed to assess hamstring flexibility. The popliteal angle was measured in a supine position and the hip flexed 90°, and fixed by first physical therapist. Opposite knee and hip were placed in extension position. Then, the child was asked to rise lower leg straight. The incomplete angle for full extension of the knee was the popliteal angle.</description>

        Thirty children whose functional levels were in 1 or 2 according to the Brooke Lower
        Extremity Functional Classification Scale were included in the study. Flexibilities of
        hamstrings was evaluated by Popliteal Angle Test. Muscle strenght was assessed with manuel
        muscle strength test and myometer. correlation between the flexibility of hamstrings and
        muscle strength tests were examined.
