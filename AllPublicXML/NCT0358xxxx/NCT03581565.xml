  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cement retention has been widely used for implant-supported fixed partial dentures in daily
      dental practice. The cementation approach indeed offers straightforward clinical application
      protocol which is basically conceptualized for tooth/teeth supported fixed restorations.
      However, removal of excess cement around implant restorations presents specific difficulties.
      More importantly, there are certain biological consequences due to residual cement leftover
      in peri-implant sulcus. There is no evidence based guidance with regards to cementation
      techniques applied for implant supported fixed restorations due to limited clinical studies.
      Therefore the aim of this clinical trial is to compare three different cementation technique
      with regards to removal of excess cement and other clinical subsidiaries (abutment margin,
      crown surface and contour) involving indirectly as well.

      Single-tooth implant crowns to replace missing molar tooth were addressed to qualify and
      quantify residual cement on implant-abutment complex and peri-implant soft tissue following
      cementation. Thirty bone-level dental implants of one kind enrolled in the study. Prior to
      delivery of screw-retained crowns completed for usual treatment, implants were allocated
      randomly to a trial comparison group. Three different cement loading approach, ten in each
      group, was applied using cement-retained trial crowns on prefabricated metal abutments.
      Following completion of the assigned cementation technique, the trial crown was removed with
      its abutment accessing from the occlusal hole prepared after removal of excess cement. Then,
      the presence of residual cement on implant-abutment complex and implant soft tissue in
      accordance with axial and proximal surfaces was qualified. To quantify the amount of residual
      cement in accordance with location and distribution, the crown-abutment complex was digitized
      three-dimensionally using an intra-oral scanner. The output of surface data was evaluated in
      virtual 3-D image for cement excess, when detected location in the abutment-crown complex is
      recorded, area and distribution was calculated using a software. The frequency of occurrence
      and quantity of residual cement of 3-different cementation techniques was statistically
      evaluated using logistic and linear regression model separately considering abutment margin,
      crown surface and contour.
