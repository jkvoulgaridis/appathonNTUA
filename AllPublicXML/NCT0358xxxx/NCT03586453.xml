      This research study is studying a targeted therapy as a possible treatment for Non-Small Cell
      Lung Cancer (NSCLC) with an EGFR mutation.

      The names of the study drug involved in this study is:

      - Osimertinib (Tagrisso)

      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a
      specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.

      This research study is studying a targeted therapy as a possible treatment for Non-Small Cell
      Lung Cancer (NSCLC) with an EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) genetic mutation. The
      EGFR gene produces a protein that helps cells divide. Specific changes or a mutation in the
      genetic information causes abnormal cell division and can lead to lung cancer. Patients who
      have NSCLC with an EGFR gene mutation can be treated by drugs called EGFR tyrosine kinase
      inhibitors (EGFR TKIs). They may stop (or &quot;inhibit&quot;) the effect of the mutation in the EGFR
      gene.

      - Osimertinib has been approved by the FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) for this
      disease.

          -  Participants must have measurable disease at baseline, defined as at least one lesion
             that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be

             conventional techniques or as ≥10 mm with spiral CT scan, MRI, or calipers by clinical
             exam.

          -  Participants must be aged ≥ 18 years

          -  Participants must have an ECOG performance status of 0-1 (Appendix A)

          -  Participants must have biopsy tissue at time of diagnosis available and sufficient for
             targeted next-generation sequencing. The sequencing can be performed at a commercial
             vendor such as Foundation Medicine. The testing does not have to be completed prior to
             study enrollment. If the specimen is insufficient a repeat biopsy will need to be
             performed.

             --Note: Cytology specimen may be acceptable for baseline NGS if tumor cellular content
             is sufficient and following PI approval. If there is no cytology specimen or tissue
             sample available for NGS, plasma-based NGS may be acceptable for enrollment following
             discussion with PI.

             pregnant women, during the trial and for a washout period of 4 months. Male patients
             should avoid procreation for 4 months after completion of trial treatment. Patients
             should refrain from donating sperm from the start of dosing until 4 months after
             discontinuing study treatment.

          -  Female patients (women of child-bearing potential): Willing to use adequate
             contraception (barrier or abstinence) at least 2 weeks before receiving any study

                  institution.

               -  c) Documentation of irreversible surgical sterilization by hysterectomy,
                  bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral salpingectomy but not tubal ligation.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

          -  Subjects may enter the study even if they have started their treatment using

             of receiving commercial osimertinib therapy (up to 84 days of commercial osimertinib
             before entering the study). In order to enter the study after starting commercial
             osimertinib, subjects must meet all eligibility criteria listed above, have baseline
             and follow up imaging available for review for response assessment, and must not have

             therapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects should not enter the study if any of the following exclusion criteria are
             fulfilled:

          -  Prior or ongoing treatment with any of the following:

               -  EGFR targeted therapy (TKI or antibody) or any other targeted therapies targeting
                  the ERBB family except for subjects receiving first line osimertinib during the
                  first three months of therapy.

               -  Any cytotoxic chemotherapy, investigational agents, immunotherapy or anticancer
                  drugs for the treatment of metastatic NSCLC

               -  Note: Patients who have completed adjuvant or neo-adjuvant chemotherapy &gt; 6
                  months ago are considered treatment naïve

             disease will be allowed to enroll provided they have asymptomatic clinically confirmed
             stable disease with ≥2 weeks since definitive CNS therapy (radiation or surgery) and
             ≥2 weeks without systemic steroids. Patients may undergo either whole brain radiation

                  evaluation QT corrected Fridericia (QTcF) of ≤ 450 ms in males or ≤ 470 ms in
                  females

               -  any factors that increase the risk of QTc prolongation or risk of arrhythmic
                  events such as heart failure, hypokalemia, congenital long QT syndrome, family
                  history of long QT syndrome or unexplained sudden death under 40 years of age in
                  first degree relatives, or any concomitant medication known to the prolong the QT

               -  past medical history of interstitial lung disease, drug-induced interstitial lung
                  disease, radiation pneumonitis which required steroid treatment, or any evidence
                  of clinically active interstitial lung disease

               -  active bleeding diatheses, which in the investigator's opinion makes it
                  undesirable for the patient to participate in the trial or which would jeopardize
                  compliance with the protocol

               -  known active infection or ongoing antiviral medication for viral infections
                  including hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
                  Screening for chronic conditions is not required. HIV-positive participants on
                  combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for
                  pharmacokinetic interactions with osimertinib.

               -  cardiac ejection fraction of &lt; 45%

               -  Any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic diseases, including active
                  bleeding diatheses, which in the investigator's opinion makes it undesirable for
                  the patient to participate in the trial or which would jeopardize compliance with
                  the protocol

          -  Known to be T790M+ (on pre-treatment tumor or plasma) or known germline T790M. Note:
             testing is not required for study entry.

          -  Males and females of reproductive potential who are not using an effective method of
             birth control and females who are pregnant or breastfeeding or have a positive (urine
             or serum) pregnancy test prior to study entry. Women of child-bearing potential must
             have a negative pregnancy test prior to start of dosing.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the effects of osimertinib on the
             development of the fetus are unknown, and there is potential for teratogenic or
             abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with osimertinib,
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with osimertinib.
