    <textblock>
      The concept of Patient Blood Management requires preoperative diagnostic of anemia. To avoid
      the harmful procedure of venous puncture for drawing a blood sample, noninvasive measurement
      of hemoglobin has been developed. However noninvasive measurement of hemoglobin has yet been
      not accurate enough to replace invasive hemoglobin measurement. This study investigates if a
      noninvasive measurement tool can serve as a screening tool to find out for which patients
      invasive measurement of hemoglobin is necessary.

      The noninvasive hemoglobin measurement tool Pronto® can measure hemoglobin noninvasively by a
      sensor clip. The investigators analyzed previous studies with the Pronto device and
      calculated two cut-off values of the noninvasive hemoglobin device. If noninvasive hemoglobin
      values are higher than cut off value 1 the investigators postulate that with a sensitivity of
      99% the participant has no anemia. To confirm this, participants who are supposed to undergo
      elective surgery and come to the preoperative anesthetic ambulance are measured by the
      Pronto-device. The noninvasive measurements are compared with the laboratory values of the
      patients and cut-off value 1 can be confirmed.

    <description>Previous studies show that noninvasively measured haemoglobin is not accurate enough to determine exactly the haemoglobin value for preoperative diagnosis of anaemia. We postulate that noninvasive haemoglobin measurement can be used as a screening tool to decide wether invasive measurement of haemoglobin is necessary. We calculated a cut-off value 1 by analysing previous studies. Noninvasive haemoglobin measurements that are above the cut-off-value are postulated to show that the patient is not anaemic with a sensitivity of 99%.</description>
