  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the practicality of a short-term (8-weeks),
      home-based digital versatile disc (DVD) chair exercise program among 40 sedentary older
      Black/African American and White/Caucasian veterans with three or more chronic health
      conditions, such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and osteoarthritis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine the feasibility of a home-based DVD chair exercise program, &quot;Sit
      and Be Fit.&quot; Participants will be asked to complete a chair-exercise program Monday through
      Friday. Each chair exercise session lasts approximately 30 minutes. Participants will receive
      a new DVD player, the exercise DVD, and the necessary exercise equipment to complete each
      session. The equipment includes a set of 1 pound hand weights, a 10&quot; exercise ball, a small
      handball, a resistance band, an exercise log, and a satisfaction survey. Upon initial
      enrollment, both groups will receive a baseline health assessment that will include
      health-related quality of life, subjective well-being, body mass index (BMI), comorbidity,
      blood pressure, lower body extremity fitness, physical activity, and hand grip strength.
      Excluding health status, all other measures will be completed at post-assessment (the end of
      week 8 for Group A and Group B). The intervention group (Group A) will receive the equipment
      after completing eligibility screening, an informed consent, and health assessments. The
      waitlist control group (Group B) will receive the equipment at week 9 after the
      post-assessment. Group B will complete the program through week 16. The waitlist control
      group(Group B) will not receive an additional post assessment at the end of week 16.

    <time_frame>Baseline and post-assessment at week 8.</time_frame>
    <description>How an individual rates general feelings of happiness (well-being). SWB will be measured using a modified SWB scale. The scale consists of 4 items that assess overall happiness. Respondents were asked two questions about their happiness as well as two questions comparing their happiness to the happiness of others on a scale from 1 to 7, with 7 reflecting a high degree of perceived happiness. Composite scores on the scale range from 4 to 28.</description>

    <measure>Physical Activity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and post-assessment at week 8.</time_frame>
    <description>The Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) will be used to assess level of physical activity. Score ranges from 0 to 360. A high score indicates a high level of physical activity.</description>

    <measure>Hand Grip Strength</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and post-assessment at week 8.</time_frame>
    <description>Hand grip strength will be assessed using a Baseline Hydraulic Hand Dynamometer.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and post-assessment at week 8.</time_frame>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Comorbidity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
