      This phase I/II trial studies the best dose and timing of panitumumab-IRDye800 in detecting
      cancer in participants with lung cancer during the surgery. Panitumumab-IRDye800 is a
      combination of the antibody drug panitumumab and IRDye800CW, an investigational dye that can
      be seen using a special camera. Panitumumab-IRDye800 may attach to tumor cells and make them
      more visible during surgery in patients with lung cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the optimal dose and timing of panitumumab IRDye800 infusion for identifying
      lung cancer compared to surrounding normal tissue in the ex vivo setting as measured by tumor
      to background ratio.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the safety and tolerability of the panitumumab IRDye800 as an imaging agent in
      subjects undergoing resection of lung cancer.

      II. Determine whether the primary lung tumor or positive lymph nodes can be detected by
      near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging with panitumumab IRDye800 but not by white light
      imaging.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of panitumumab-IRDye800 followed by a phase
      II study.

      Participants receive panitumumab- IRDye800 intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day 0, and
      then undergo NIR and surgery within 1-5 days.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up for up to 30 days.

    <description>The TBR is defined as the near-infrared fluorescence signal of tumor or lymph node tissue compared to normal adjacent tissue measured in ex vivo tissues. Outcomes will be reported as the TBR (mean) and standard deviation for each dose group and timing group (1-2 days or 3-5 days prior to surgery).</description>

    <description>Intraoperative near-infrared fluorescence imaging with panitumumab-IRDye800 will be compared to conventional white light visualization and ex vivo histopathology methods to identify metastatic lesions. Outcomes will be reported as the number of metastatic lesions detected by both near-infrared fluorescence imaging and histopathology, and each method alone.</description>

    <description>Intraoperative near-infrared fluorescence imaging with panitumumab-IRDye800 will be compared to conventional white light visualization and ex vivo histopathology methods to identify residual disease at resection margins. Outcomes will be reported as the number of positive-margins detected by both near-infrared fluorescence imaging and histopathology, and each method alone.</description>
