    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I study evaluating the safety and feasibility of intraperitoneally
      administered lentiviral transduced MOv19-BBz CAR T cells in 4 cohorts with or without
      cyclophosphamide + fludarabine in a 3+3 dose escalation design.

      The DLT observation period is 28 days post CAR T cell infusion. The Maximum Tolerated Dose
      (MTD) is defined as the dose at which 0 or 1 DLT occurs in 6 evaluable subjects tested within
      the dose range of this study.

      Cohort 1: (n= 3 to 6 subjects): Single infusion of 1-3x107 /m2 lentivirally transduced
      MOv19-BBz CAR T cells on day 0 without lymphodepleting chemotherapy.

      Cohort 2: (n= 3 to 6 subjects): Single infusion of 1-3x107 /m2 lentivirally transduced
      MOv19-BBz CAR T cells on day 0 beginning 3 days (+/- 1 day) after lymphodepleting
      chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide + fludarabine.

      Cohort 3: (n=3 to 6 subjects): Single infusion of 1-3x108 lentivirally transduced MOv19-BBz
      CAR T cells on day 0 beginning 3 days (+/- 1 day) after lymphodepleting chemotherapy with
      cyclophosphamide + fludarabine.

      Cohort -1: (n= 3 to 6 subjects): Single Infusion of 1-3x106 /m2 lentivirally transduced
      MOv19-BBz CAR T cells on day 0 without lymphodepleting chemotherapy. Up to 6 subjects will be
      infused in Cohort -1 with ≤ 1 DLT/6 subjects to establish the MTD.

         11. Prior therapy with lentiviral gene modified cells.

         15. Presence of any other condition that may increase the risk associated with study
             participation or may interfere with the interpretation of study results, and, in the

             into the study.
