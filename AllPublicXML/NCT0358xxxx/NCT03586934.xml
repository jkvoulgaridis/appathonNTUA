  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Opioid medications are associated with many side effects and the risk of abuse or overdose.
      Orthopaedic surgeons are currently investigating ways to control pain after surgery while
      limiting the amount of opioid medications prescribed. One way to reduce the amount of opioid
      medications prescribed, and potentially avoid opioid-associated adverse events, is to use
      multiple non-opioid medications and anesthetic drugs before surgery, during surgery, and
      after surgery. This study aims to evaluate a protocol with non-opioid pain medications to
      reduce the need for opioid medication after shoulder surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The United States constitutes &lt;5% of the world's population but over 80% of the opioid supply
      and 99% of the hydrocodone supply. In 2014, there were 18,893 deaths from prescription drug
      overdose, and orthopaedic surgeons are the third highest prescribing physicians for opioids.
      Surgeons often prescribe opioids to minimize postoperative pain and to reduce the likelihood
      of readmission for pain. Available data suggests that orthopaedic surgeons are the most
      likely physicians to prescribe opioids to Medicare patients. Among Medicare patients, opioid
      prescriptions are over 7 times more likely to come from an orthopaedic surgeon than another
      type of physician. Yet, despite the significant amount of opioids prescribed by orthopaedic
      surgeons, orthopaedic surgeons often have one of the highest readmission rates for
      post-operative pain. Many studies have investigated the utilization of opioids after surgery
      to assess surgeon's tendencies to overprescribe, demographics of those likely to overuse, and
      adverse events of opioid abusers.

      A recent paper by Kim et al. prospectively investigated opioid utilization after upper
      extremity surgery. This study (n=1,416) showed an opioid utilization rate of just 34%, taking
      an average 8.1 pills out of 24 prescribed. Patients aged 30-39, those having joint
      procedures, upper extremity/shoulder surgery, or self-pay/Medicaid insurance were all far
      more likely to overuse opioids. The study concluded that their surgeons prescribed 3 times
      the required opioid following surgery and gave recommendations for opioid distribution based
      on location, procedure type, and patient risk factors. This study's identification of over
      prescription is congruent with a study completed by Bates et al that showed 67% of patients
      had a surplus of medications, with 92% not receiving proper medication disposal instructions.

      Other recent literature has attempted to risk stratify patients who are more likely to abuse
      prescription opioids. Morris et al. identified various risk factors including: family history
      of substance abuse, nicotine dependency, age &lt;45, psychiatric disorders, and lower level of
      education.These risk factors are associated with aberrant behaviors (non-compliance, early
      refill request, &quot;lost or stolen&quot; medication), which should raise concerns for any provider
      prescribing opioids.

      Studies have shown that patients who are on chronic opioid therapy before surgery have worse
      outcomes. A recent study compared chronic opioids users (n= 35,068) versus those who were
      opioid-na√Øve at the time of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and found the opioid group had more
      opioid scripts filled per patient at discharge as well as at 3, 6, and 9 months (0.63
      scripts/patient vs. 1.2 scripts/patient, p&lt;0.05). These patients also had a higher Charlson
      Comorbidity Index (p&lt;0.05) and higher rates of respiratory failure, acute kidney failure,
      pneumonia, all post-operative infections, and infections requiring return to the OR. The
      study concluded patients should have their opioid consumption controlled during the
      pre-operative and peri-operative period.

      In addition to the complications of opioid medications experienced by orthopaedic patients, a
      recent nationwide retrospective analysis presents an unintended yet severe problem associated
      with opioid prescriptions. The incidence of pediatric hospitalizations for opioid toxicity
      nearly tripled from 1997 to 2012. The over-prescription of opioids creates a readily
      available source for accidental ingestion by younger children and for intentional opioid
      overdose by older pediatric/adolescent patients. In fact, a family member's leftover pills
      have been described as the number one source for pediatric opioid overdose. Moreover, the
      Center for Disease Control reported that in 2015 the U.S. saw its highest incidence of
      opioid-related death. Given the frequency and severity of opioid diversion and misuse,
      orthopaedic surgeons should consider the best methods for controlling patients postoperative
      pain and also avoid facilitating opiate misuse, whether by orthopaedic patients or other
      community members. With this goal in mind, this study will investigate regimens for effective
      postoperative pain control that also minimize the total amount of opioids prescribed.
