  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Environmental Enteropathy (EE) is an acquired sub-clinical inflammatory gut condition in
      which alterations in intestinal structure, function, and local and systemic immune activation
      lead to impaired vaccine responses, decreased cognitive potential and undernutrition in
      low-middle income countries. Approximately half of all global deaths in children aged less
      than five years are attributable to undernutrition making the study of EE an area of critical
      priority. However, given the operational limitations and ethical considerations for safely
      obtaining intestinal biopsies from young children in low resource settings, there have been
      few detailed investigations of human intestinal tissue in this vulnerable patient group for
      whom reversal of EE would provide the greatest benefit. EE biomarkers have been studied in
      different settings but these have not been correlated with the gold standard histopathology
      confirmation. The Study of Environment Enteropathy and Malnutrition in Pakistan (SEEM
      Pakistan) is designed to better understand the pathophysiology, predictors, biomarkers, and
      potential management strategies of EE to inform strategies to eradicate this debilitating
      pathology.

Environmental Enteropathy and celiac disease have some shared features therefore we plan to enroll children under the age of 6 years with newly diagnosed celiac disease per endoscopy at CCHMC to assess the extent to which gene signatures and associated biologic pathways for children with celiac disease or environmental enteropathy overlap or differ.</description>

As some differentially expressed ileal gene signatures for Crohn's disease bear remarkable similarities to individual gene expression patterns previously reported for EE, children under the age of 10 years with newly diagnosed Crohn's disease per endoscopy at CCHMC will be enrolled to study these similarities and any differences</description>
