  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Through close collaboration with the Ugandan Ministry of Health, the investigators plan to
      provide PrEP for HIV-negative members of HIV serodiscordant couples by launching PrEP
      delivery within 12 public ART clinics in Kampala, Uganda. Intervention delivery will be
      launched in a staggered fashion among clinics through a stepped wedge cluster randomized
      trial providing a rigorous research opportunity to measure the effect of the intervention on
      PrEP and ART initiation and adherence. To measure these outcomes using clinic records and
      biomarkers, the program will enroll approximately 1440 HIV serodiscordant couples.
      Additionally, the program will collect qualitative and quantitative data to determine if
      PrEP-taking is a modeled behavior that facilitates ART use and characterize the way that PrEP
      and ART use interact within couples and estimate the programmatic costs of the integrated
      PrEP and ART strategy.
