    <textblock>
      Objectives

        1. Evaluate the ability of aesthetic physicians to accurately inject a specific amount
           (i.e., 0.2cc) of HA soft tissue filler; and

        2. Investigate the effect of different HA gel properties (e.g., G', cohesivity,
           viscoelasticity) on an injector's performance accuracy.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Volumetric accuracy of HA filler injections using observational methods</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>physicians will attempt to inject 0.2CC of four HA products into a porcine membrane. Volumes will be measured in CC's and their accuracy assessed based on the amount of product left in the syringe.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Volumetric accuracy of HA filler expulsions over a scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Physicians will attempt to dispense 0.2CC of four different HA products. They will do this into free air, over a scale. The weights will be calculated in grams and converted to CC's. The scale is the &quot;Smart Weight&quot; digital milligram scale, JDS20 edition. It's specifications are as follows: capacity: 20g/100ct/308.8gn/12.86dwt; readability: 0.001g/0.005ct/0.02gn/0.001dwt; scale dimensions: 3x5x0.8&quot;; accuracy of 0.001grams and capacity of 20grams.</description>

    <description>Subjects will be blind folded and asked to deposit 0.2cc's of each of the four investigational products, in a randomized order. First, over a weight and then into a porcine membrane.</description>
