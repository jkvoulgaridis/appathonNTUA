  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rural areas and refugee camps are characterized by poor access of patients to needed
      noncommunicable disease (NCD)-related health services, including diabetes and hypertension.
      This community trial study aims to assess the effect of employing low-cost mHealth tools on
      the accessibility to health services and improvement of health indicators of individuals with
      NCDs in rural areas and refugee camps in Lebanon.

      Rural areas and refugee camps are characterized by poor access of patients to needed
      noncommunicable disease (NCD)-related health services, including diabetes and hypertension.
      Employing low-cost innovative eHealth interventions, such as mobile health (mHealth), may
      help improve NCDs prevention and control among disadvantaged populations.

      The aim of this study was to assess the effect of employing low-cost mHealth tools on the
      accessibility to health services and improvement of health indicators of individuals with
      NCDs in rural areas and refugee camps in Lebanon.

      This is a community trial study in which centers were allocated randomly into control and
      intervention sites. The effect of an employed mHealth intervention is assessed through
      selected quality indicators examined in both control and intervention groups. Sixteen primary
      health care centers (eight controls, eight interventions) located in rural areas and
      Palestinian refugee camps across Lebanon were included in this study. Data on diabetic and
      hypertensive patients—1433 in the intervention group and 926 in the control group—was
      extracted from patient files in the pre and postintervention periods. The intervention
      entailed weekly short message service messages, including medical information, importance of
      compliance, and reminders of appointments or regular physician follow-up. Internationally
      established care indicators were utilized in this study.

    <intervention_model_description>This study reports on a community trial in which PHC centers, along their respective catchment areas, were randomly allocated into control and intervention sites with the aim of assessing the change in selected NCD care quality indicators (QIs) among community individuals and patients. Patients in the intervention sites received a 1-year mHealth intervention, and their pre- and postintervention outcomes were assessed through measurement of QIs. Patients in the control sites received no intervention.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Individual in the intervention group receive a weekly educational health SMS for the intervention period of 1 year. SMS content covered different health themes providing health information on lifestyle, dietary habits, body weight, smoking, medications, importance of compliance, as well as symptoms and self-management of HTN and diabetes. Community individuals who were diagnosed and were receiving necessary care previous to the investigator's intervention were sent weekly informative health SMS, as well as customized SMSs reminders to follow up on their scheduled medical appointments (eg, to check their HbA1c levels and have their annual foot or eye exams).</description>
