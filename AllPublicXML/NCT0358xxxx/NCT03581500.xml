  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well hyperpolarized carbon C 13 pyruvate magnetic resonance
      spectroscopic imaging works in predicting treatment response in patients with prostate
      cancer. Hyperpolarized carbon C 13 pyruvate magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging may help
      to accurately predict how prostate cancer patients will respond to standard therapy
      (abiraterone and apalutamide).

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess reproducibility of quantitative spectroscopic and imaging parameters in
      hyperpolarized 13-C pyruvate magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI), including key
      performance indicator (kpl), which assesses the rate of conversion of 13-C pyruvate to 13-C
      lactate in the tissue of interest, using a test-retest study design.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To provide initial assessment of the sensitivity and specificity of hyperpolarized
      13-C-pyruvate MRSI performed pre-therapy for detecting high risk localized prostate cancer.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive hyperpolarized carbon C 13 pyruvate intravenously (IV) over 10-20 seconds
      and undergo MRSI over 2-3 minutes at 6 and 8 weeks.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 1 day and then for up to 3 years.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Biopsy proven high risk prostate adenocarcinoma, or de novo metastatic previously
             untreated naive prostate cancer (patients who have initiated gonadotrophin releasing
             hormone [Lhrh] analog or antagonist within the past 4 weeks are eligible)

          -  Gleason &gt;= 8 OR Gleason 7 + &gt;= cT2b + prostate specific antigen (PSA) &gt; 10 ng/ml

          -  Prior prostate biopsy must have been performed at least 4 weeks prior

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Contraindication to MRI

          -  Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt; 30

          -  Allergy to gadavist intravenous contrast

          -  History of cardiac arrhythmia

          -  Since they do not get prostate cancer, women are excluded; thus, pregnancy is not an
             issue
