  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is estimated that over 25% of the world's population had hypertension in the year 2000 and
      that this proportion will reach 30% in the year 2025. With the introduction of the 2017
      Guideline for High Blood Pressure in Adults from the American College of Cardiology and the
      American Heart Association Task Force on Clinical Practice Guidelines, the definition of
      hypertension became broader and as a result the prevalence is expected to further increase.
      On the other hand, it is estimated that around 10% of the world's population is affected by
      chronic kidney disease (CKD) with hypertension being both cause and complication of CKD.

      It is obvious that hypertension and CKD are interconnected and are both major risk factors
      for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Hypertension results in increased CVD risk both directly,
      as an independent factor, and indirectly via its negative impact on renal function. In fact,
      the deterioration of the renal function is proportional to the degree of hypertension. On the
      other hand, the more advanced the CKD is, the more challenging the management of hypertension
      becomes, as patients with CKD present altered patterns of blood pressure (BP) during the day
      and, additionally, the prevalence of white coat and masked hypertension is significantly
      higher in this group of patients.

      To date, hypertensive patients are treated according to the BP recordings that are obtained
      in the office (OBP) during routine patient visits, which leads to inaccurate estimates of the
      true burden of hypertension and also affects the efficacy of the therapeutic intervention. It
      has been suggested that self measured BP (HBP) is a more accurate estimate of the patients'
      daytime BP compared to the conventional office BP measurements. This has been already
      confirmed in studies regarding the general population and it has been suggested that the same
      applies to the patients with CKD. This study aims to check the validity of this hypothesis by
      comparing the effect of the HBP - guided management versus the conventional OBP - guided
      management on the 24 hour ambulatory BP monitoring of patients with uncontrolled hypertension
      and CKD stage 3 and 4.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension among people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is very common, difficult to
      diagnose and often poorly controlled. The identification and management of hypertension among
      patients with CKD is challenging, owing to the markedly altered patterns and rhythms of blood
      pressure (BP) during the 24-hour period (i.e., non-dipping status and nocturnal hypertension)
      and the high prevalence of white coat and masked hypertension in these individuals.
      Conventional BP recordings obtained in the office are reported to provide inaccurate
      estimates of the true BP burden assessed using out-of-office BP monitoring techniques.
      Self-measured BP by the patients themselves at home provides a more accurate estimate of the
      patient's daytime BP. Similarly to the general hypertensive population, clinical studies
      support the notion that among people with CKD, home BP monitoring offers several advantages
      over the conventional office BP recordings in diagnosing hypertension and estimating the
      associated cardiovascular and renal risk. Compared with office BP, home BP recordings exhibit
      closer association with indices of target-organ damage, such as left ventricular mass index
      and aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV). Moreover, compared with office BP, home BP recordings
      are stronger predictors of the rate of renal function decline over time and incident
      end-stage-renal-disease (ESRD) requiring dialysis. Importantly, home BP recordings were shown
      to carry stronger value relative to office BP in predicting the risk of all-cause and
      cardiovascular mortality.

      The feasibility of performing repeated home BP monitoring over several days, weeks or months
      offers the ability to accurately assess alterations in BP levels and responses to
      antihypertensive therapy in the long-term. Consequently, several randomized controlled
      studies conducted in the general hypertensive population have provided evidence that home BP
      monitoring is a simple approach to guide the management of hypertension on a monthly basis.
      In a meta-analysis of 37 randomized controlled trials (incorporating data from 9,446
      hypertensive patients), it was shown that compared with clinic BP-based hypertension
      management, home BP monitoring was associated with a significantly higher reduction in
      systolic BP [weighted mean difference (WMD): -2.63 mmHg; 95% Confidence Interval (CI): -4.24,
      -1.02] and in diastolic BP (WMD: -1.68 mmHg; 95% CI: -2.58, -0.79). Implementation of home BP
      monitoring as a tool to guide the management of hypertension was associated with more
      frequent reductions in the number of prescribed antihypertensive medications [relative risk
      (RR): 2.02; 95% CI: 1.32-3.11] and reduced the risk of therapeutic inertia, defined as
      unchanged antihypertensive regimen despite the presence of uncontrolled hypertension (RR:
      0.82; 95% CI: 0.68-0.99).

      In contrast to the accumulated evidence supporting the use of home BP (HBP)-guided management
      of hypertension in non-CKD populations, the only study to investigate the role of home BP
      monitoring as a tool to achieve BP targets in patients with CKD was a previous, small,
      randomized study enrolling 65 ESRD patients on maintenance hemodialysis. In this study the
      use of home BP monitoring for 6 months produced a significantly higher reduction in
      interdialytic ambulatory BP compared to conventional managements of hypertension based on
      routine pre-dialysis BP recordings (mean 24-hour BP at study-end: 135/76 versus 147/79 mmHg,
      p&lt;0.05). Despite the fact that the use of home BP monitoring among people with hypertension
      and CKD is anticipated to overcome the barriers of white coat and masked hypertension effects
      and improve therapeutic inertia, there is still no solid evidence on the value of using this
      technique as a simple approach to improve BP control and maximize the associated benefits on
      regression of target-organ damage.
