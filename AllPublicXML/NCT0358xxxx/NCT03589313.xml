        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male subject ≥18 years of age on the day of signing the ICF.

          -  A confirmed clinical diagnosis of CF.

          -  Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (documented in the subject's medical record).

          -  Stable concomitant medication regimen for pulmonary health for at least 2 weeks prior
             to study drug administration

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of clinically meaningful unstable or uncontrolled chronic disease that makes
             the subject unsuitable for inclusion in the study in the opinion of the investigator.

          -  Unstable pulmonary status or respiratory tract infection (including rhinosinusitis)
             requiring a change in therapy within 2 weeks prior to study drug administration.

          -  Need for supplemental oxygen during the day, and &gt;2 L/minute while sleeping.

          -  History of solid organ or hematopoietic cell transplantation.

          -  History of hepatic cirrhosis with portal hypertension (e.g., signs/symptoms of
             splenomegaly, esophageal varices).

          -  Use of CFTR modulator therapy (e.g., lumacaftor or ivacaftor) within 2 weeks prior to
             study drug administration.

          -  Abnormal liver function test at screening, defined as aspartate aminotransferase (AST)
             and/or ALT and/or alkaline phosphatase and/or gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) ≥3x the
             upper limit of normal, and/or total bilirubin ≥1.5x the upper limit of normal.
