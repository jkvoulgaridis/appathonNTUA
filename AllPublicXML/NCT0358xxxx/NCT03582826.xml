      The purpose of this study is to identify microbial signatures associated with remission and
      recurrence of idiopathic malodor and PATM conditions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Human odorprints, mostly owing to the microbiome, have proven their value as biomarkers of
      health and environmental exposures. In recent years, microbial networks responsible for
      localized malodors such as halitosis or axillary odor have been mapped by using next
      generation sequencing approaches. Intestinal microbes responsible for psychologically
      debilitating systemic malodor (whole-body and extraoral halitosis), however, remain to be
      identified. Even a relatively straightforward disorder of choline metabolism
      trimethylaminuria (TMAU) is thought to exhibit complex host-gene microbiome interactions and
      has not been sufficiently studied.

      Proposed controlled pilot study aims to explore the dynamics of microbial communities in
      remission and flare-up periods. Better knowledge of the important aspects of disease
      fluctuation should enhance patient care and, combined with our prior data, will help to
      develop new therapies and treatments.

    <description>Quality of life (QOL) will be measured with MEBO quality of life assessment questionnaire, a new tool designed on the basis of the Halitosis Associated Life-quality Test (HALT) and WHOQOL-100 questionnaires. Most questions were devised with a Likert scale of 0-5 where a higher score indicated a higher quality of life. Scores for five negatively framed questions are transformed to positively framed questions. MEBO test provides a total QOL score (minimum score of 20 and maximum score of 150) and is focusing on four aspects of QOL: physical health, psychological health, social support and environment.</description>
