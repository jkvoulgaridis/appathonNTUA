  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in Switzerland and still more
      than a quarter of the Swiss population smokes cigarettes. Recently, electronic nicotine
      delivery systems (ENDS; also called vaporizer or electronic cigarette) have become popular
      with smokers who want to stop smoking or reduce their exposure to inhaled chemicals since
      ENDS use appears to be safer than tobacco smoking. Only two rigorous randomized controlled
      trials (RCTs) on the efficacy of ENDS to help smokers quit have been published so far. They
      have promising, yet inconclusive results, as the number of included participants were small.
      The safety and potential adverse effects of ENDS are also largely unknown. While the aerosol
      the users inhale appears safe in laboratory conditions, the difference in exposure to
      chemicals (such as reduction in exposure to volatile organic compounds) and effects of
      chemicals on the body (adverse events, improved health-related outcomes and measures of
      oxidative stress) between smokers who quit (with or without ENDS) and those who use ENDS for
      a long time have not yet been assessed in an RCT.

      This study will therefore test the efficacy of ENDS for cigarette smoking cessation, the
      safety of ENDS on adverse events and the effect of ENDS on health-related outcomes and
      exposure to inhaled chemicals.

      The primary hypothesis of this trial is that providing cigarette smokers willing to quit
      smoking tobacco cigarettes with ENDS leads to a higher rate of smokers who quit cigarette
      smoking than only smoking cessation counseling with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), which
      represents nowadays the standard of care.

      For this trial, cigarette smokers motivated to quit smoking cigarettes will be included.
      Participants in the intervention group will receive an ENDS and nicotine-containing
      e-liquids, which they will be allowed to use ad libitum. Additionally, they will receive
      smoking cessation counseling. Participants in the control group will receive smoking
      cessation counseling only. Participants in both groups will be allowed to additionally use
      nicotine replacement therapy. All participants will be followed over a 6-month period.
      Smoking cessation counseling will be provided in person at the first clinical visit and then
      over the phone at the target quit date and again at week 1, 2, 4 and 8 after the target quit
      date. After 6 months, participants will be asked to come to a final clinical visit.

    <description>Nicotine dependence measured using the Fagerström Test. The Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND, Heatherton TF et al., 1991) is a standard instrument for assessing the intensity of physical addiction to nicotine. It contains six items that evaluate the quantity of cigarette consumption, the compulsion to use, and dependence. Two items have four possible responses (0-3) and four items have two possible responses (0-1). The nicotine dependence score ranges from 0 to 10. A score between 0 and 2 is considered as a low nicotine dependence, a score between 3 to 5 is considered as a medium nicotine dependence, a score between 6 and 7 is considered as a high nicotine dependence and a score between 8 and 10 is considered as a very high nicotine dependence.</description>
