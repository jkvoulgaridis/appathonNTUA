  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Achalasia is a primary rare esophageal motor disorder of the esophagus (annual
      incidence of 1:100,000 persons). Recently, a new endoscopic technique, Per-Oral Endoscopic
      Myotomy (POEM), has been introduced with excellent success rates. Several studies have
      evaluated complications of POEM but there is a lack of knowledge on the potential risk of
      bacteremia or microbial translocation during the endoscopic intervention and, also, there
      aren't evidences regarding the use of antibiotics before/after POEM. Microbial translocation
      (MT) is the passage of both viable and nonviable microbes across the anatomically intact GI
      barrier to the mesenteric lymph nodes, and possibly other tissues. Gram-negative bacteria
      contain lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) coating their thin peptidoglycan cell wall. The presence
      of LPS, an endotoxin, in the plasma has been correlated to sepsis and septic shock through
      the activation of the inflammatory host defence via binding to soluble CD14 (sCD14) which
      initiates downstream cytokines (like IL-6, IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α)) and, also,
      through the production of sCD14 and LPS-binding protein (LBP) by the innate immune system.

      Objectives: Considering POEM a clean-contaminated procedure, it should be assessed whether
      the post-POEM fever or systemic inflammation is a cytokinin-mediated or an infection-related
      fever. Thus, aim of the study is to evaluate the presence of inflammation mediators,
      bacteremia and microbial translocation post POEM, to guide future antibiotic
      prophylaxis/therapy in patients undergoing this procedure.

      Methods: All patients who will undergo POEM at _Investigator's Department from June 2017 to
      June 2019 will be enrolled in a prospective, interventional randomized clinical trial (RCT).
      Patients will be randomized in two groups. The Group A, prophylaxis group, will receive
      antibiotics (Cefazolin 2 gr i.v.) only before procedure whereas Group B, short therapy group,
      will receive antibiotics before POEM (Cefazolin 2 gr i.v.), continued for the first 24 hours
      and then per os (Amoxicilline/Clavulanic Acid 3 gr/die) for 3 days. For each patient we will
      be evaluated: dosage of IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, sCD4, LPB, LPS and blood cultures.

      Expected results: we expect that the prophylaxis group vs short therapy group, has a
      prevalence of fever and/or systemic inflammation not higher than 10% difference of the fever
      related to the procedure.
