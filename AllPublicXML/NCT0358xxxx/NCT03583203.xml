  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized, open label, prospective study with a 12-month follow-up period. The primary
      objective evaluates the effectiveness of an intensive anti-smoking programme that informs
      patients of their individual risk of lung damages and the possibilities of prevention. The
      main measurement will be having given up smoking in month 12, measurement of self-reported
      abstinence on the 7 previous days and confirmed by a CO-oximeter test&lt; 10 ppm, between the
      intervention and control group. A total of 9 urban and rural mental health centres will
      participate in the study. The intervention group will undergo spirometry and presence and the
      degree of respiratory obstruction will be assessed. Participants will be given individual
      information to generate a motivational message about the possibilities of prevention and the
      information will be maintained for three months by sending text messages (SMS) to their
      mobile phones. The efficacy of the method and the pulmonary damage variables will be
      evaluated: smoking cessation at the end of follow-up will be confirmed by cooximetry, and the
      COPD diagnosis and the severity of the staging for disease will be assessed

    <description>This group will include personalized information about lung damage. After evaluating their COPD, the patients will be informed about its existence it so and staging. Depending on the damage found, the generation of motivation will focus on the different prevention methods. Likewise, after the motivation level is set, the patients will be offered the option of treatment and regular follow-up. The intervention will be strengthened by motivational messages, half of which are linked to the possibilities of preventing respiratory damage, sent to the patient's mobile phone via SMS during the 3 months after the face-to-face intervention. Patients without mobile phones will receive a call on their phone to convey the same messages.</description>
