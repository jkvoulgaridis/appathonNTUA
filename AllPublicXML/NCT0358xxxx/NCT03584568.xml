  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is hypothesized that reappraising intergeneration relationships through perspective-taking
      will enhance the well-being of adult-child caregivers. Incorporating both psychological and
      social perspectives, the study makes a unique contribution to address research gaps by
      evaluating an integrated model of intervention for dementia caregivers. The conceptual model
      involves the following components: 1) relational insights; 2) self-reflection to integrate
      the challenges and benefits in caregiving; 3) interpersonal empathy

      To test the incremental value of perspective-taking reappraisals, the study involves a
      two-arm randomized controlled trial of 12 weeks of intervention with two conditions: 1)
      Reappraisal through Perspective Taking and 2) Basic Skill Building. Telephone-administered
      sessions are integrated with group sessions and home visits to maximize sustainability and
      accessibility of the intervention. One hundred fifty-four participants will be recruited and
      randomized. Primary outcomes are reduced depressive symptoms and enhanced psychological
      well-being for the caregivers. Secondary outcomes include enhanced social support for
      caregivers and reduced behavioral problems in the care-recipients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study aims to address a major research gap in caregiving interventions in the
      context of intergeneration perspective-taking reappraisals. Adult child caregivers are part
      of a sandwich generation, involved in actualizing their own goals and coping with social
      expectations to care for their elderly parents. Dementia caregiving presents a particular
      challenge in life transition wherein the adult child is parenting his or her parents. With
      global aging, people living with dementia are rising exponentially. This presents a challenge
      for sustainable care in Hong Kong and also in countries where public services are developing
      and the demand for family and intergeneration caregiving is high due to collectivistic
      concerns. It is hypothesized that reappraising intergeneration relationships through
      perspective-taking will enhance the well-being of adult-child caregivers. Incorporating both
      psychological and social perspectives, the study makes a unique contribution to address
      research gaps by evaluating an integrated model of intervention for dementia caregivers. The
      conceptual model involves the following components: 1) relational insights; 2)
      self-reflection to integrate the challenges and benefits in caregiving; 3) interpersonal
      empathy.

      Most caregiving psycho-education programs involve skill training including scheduling
      pleasant events, communicating with the care recipient and other family members. To test the
      incremental value of perspective-taking reappraisals, the study involves a two-arm randomized
      controlled trial of 12 weeks of intervention with two conditions: 1) Perspective Taking
      Reappraisal and 2) Basic Skill Building. Telephone-administered sessions are integrated with
      home visits to maximize sustainability and accessibility of the intervention. One hundred
      fifty-four participants will be recruited and randomized. Primary outcomes are reduced
      depressive symptoms and enhanced psychological well-being for the caregivers. Secondary
      outcomes include enhanced social support for caregivers and reduced behavioral problems in
      the care-recipients. Measures are obtained at baseline Weeks 1 (baseline), 6 and 12 with a
      follow-up at Week 24. Findings have implications for enhancing sustainable care for older
      adults in the wider society.

    <description>20-item measure that asks caregivers to rate how often over the past week they The scale rates experienced symptoms associated with depression.. Response options range from 0 to 3 for each item (0 = Rarely or None of the Time, 1 = Some or Little of the Time, 2 = Moderately or Much of the time, 3 = Most or Almost All the Time). Scores range from 0 to 60, with high scores indicating greater level of having depressive symptoms.</description>

    <time_frame>Weeks 1,6, 12, 24</time_frame>
    <description>The 18-version of the scale taps the six areas of psychological well-being: autonomy, environmental mastery, personal growth, positive relations with others, purpose in life, and self-acceptance. Respondents rate statements on a scale of 1 to 6, with 1 indicating strong disagreement and 6 indicating strong agreement. The range of scores is from 0 to 108. Higher scores suggest higher levels of well-being. The subscale score of each of the six areas can be calculating by summation of the three items associated with each of the area.</description>

    <time_frame>Weeks 1, 6, 12 ,24</time_frame>
    <description>The checklist is a 24-item caregiver-report measure provides a total score plus scores for three subscale memory-related problems, affective distress and disruptive behaviors. Scores are computed for the presence or absence of each problem first, and then for caregiver &quot;reaction&quot; or the extent to which caregivers were &quot;bothered&quot; or &quot;distressed&quot; by each behavior. The caregivers' reaction to each behavior, or the extent of distress experienced, were scored as follows: Reactions are assessed by asking how &quot;upsetting&quot; the behavior was on a Likert scale of 0 to 4 (0 = Not at all, 1= a little, 2 = moderately, 3 = very much, and 4 =extremely). Frequency of behaviors are assessed based on a Likert-scale of 0 to 4 (0 = never occurs, 1 = occurs infrequently and not in the last week, 2 = occurred 1-2 times in the last week, 3 = occurred 3-6 times in the last week, and 4 = occurs daily or more often). The range of score is from 0 to 96, higher scores suggesting greater disruption.</description>

    <description>The measure the levels of emotional and instrumental social support experienced by the caregivers. The scale consists of 12 items assesses the frequency of receipt of 3 categories of social support: emotional support, instrumental support and negative interaction involving conflict or excessive demands. The participants scored each item on a 5-point Likert Scale ranging from 0 (never) to 4 (frequently). The range of scores is from 0 to 48, with higher score indicating better social support.</description>
