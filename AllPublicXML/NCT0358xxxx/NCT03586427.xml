    <time_frame>Baseline to Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>The MADRS is a clinician-rated scale to assess depressive symptomatology during the preceding week. Participants are rated on 10 items (feelings of sadness, lassitude, pessimism, inner tension, suicidality, reduced sleep or appetite, difficulty concentrating, and lack of interest) each on a 7-point scale from 0 (no symptoms) to 6 (symptoms of maximum severity). The total score ranges from 0 to 60 with a higher score indicating more depression. A negative change score indicates improvement.</description>
