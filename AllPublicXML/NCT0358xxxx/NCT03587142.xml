  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates whether the study medication, buspirone, an antianxiety drug, improves
      the symptoms of gastroparesis in patients with gastroparesis symptoms and at least moderately
      severe symptoms of fullness and/or inability to eat a full meal. Half the patients will
      receive buspirone and half the patients will receive a placebo.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, parallel treatment
      groups phase 2 trial to determine the effect of buspirone, a 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) 1a
      receptor agonist, on early satiety and postprandial fullness in participants with symptoms of
      gastroparesis and with at least moderately severe symptoms of early satiety and/or
      postprandial fullness. After enrollment, participants aged 18-75 years will be treated with
      buspirone (10 mg three times per day) or a matching placebo for 4 weeks, followed by a 2-week
      post-treatment washout period. The primary outcome for the study is 4-week change (week 4
      minus baseline) in the 4-item postprandial fullness/early satiety subscore (higher scores
      indicate worse symptoms) from the Patient Assessment of Gastrointestinal Disorders Symptom
      Severity Index (PAGI-SYM) Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index (GCSI). We hypothesize that
      buspirone treatment will improve symptoms of postprandial fullness/early satiety compared to
      treatment with placebo, as indicated by a lower (smaller, more negative) 4-week change in the
      postprandial fullness/early satiety subscore in the buspirone arm compared to the placebo
      arm; change for a participant will be calculated as subscore at 4-weeks minus subscore at
      baseline.

    <masking>Triple (Participant, Care Provider, Investigator)</masking>
    <masking_description>Participants, all clinic staff and the investigators will be masked as to whether the participant is receiving buspirone or the placebo.
The study drug will be over encapsulated in a size 0 gelatin capsule with partial filler to be identical to the placebo capsule, which contains only filler.
The random treatment assignment will consist of a numbered study drug bottle; each bottle number will be unique and each participant will be assigned a specific bottle number, which is labelled: &quot;Buspirone or placebo 10 mg.&quot; with directions.
The randomization scheme will assign participants in randomly permuted blocks of assignments stratified by clinical center. The randomization plan will be prepared and administered centrally via a secure web application by the Scientific Data Research Center.</masking_description>

    <ipd_description>The study will comply with the NIH Data Sharing Policy. The data will be first de-identified so that no individual participant identifiers will be included in the dataset (no names, addresses, dates, comments, etc). If a characteristic is an extreme value for this population, then those values will be categorized into one frequency group. If a CSR has multiple versions, then all data will be recoded into the format of the most current form version. A random unique identification number will be substituted for the unique BESST identification number. If a clinical item was obtained from surveys with restrictions due to licensing, then that data will be excluded. The data will be shared in 2 stages: the first will be the analytic datasets to produce the primary outcome paper. For this dataset, the documentation will include analytic code. The full dataset by CSR will be provided in the second stage.</ipd_description>

    <ipd_time_frame>The analytic datasets to produce the primary result manuscript will be submitted within one year of publication of the primary result manuscript.

    <ipd_access_criteria>An investigator interested in acquiring BESST study data should contact the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) Central Repository at https://www.niddkrepository.org/search/study/ and apply to obtain the data required for their study.</ipd_access_criteria>
