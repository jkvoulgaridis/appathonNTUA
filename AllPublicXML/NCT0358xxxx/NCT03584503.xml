  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Suction Above Cuff Endotracheal Tube (SACETT) has a dorsal port above the cuff designed to
      allow continuous or intermittent suctioning of secretions from the subglottic space. Thus, it
      facilitates suctioning of excessive secretions around the mouth and the cuff. In this study,
      we aimed to investigate the effect of the use of SACETT on laryngospasm and postoperative
      complications in rhinoplasty operations. This randomized controlled clinical trial was
      conducted in 132 patients undergoing rhinoplasty.

      The investigators believe that the use of SACETT in rhinoplasty operations reduces the
      incidences of laryngospasm, emergence agitation, sore throat, swallowing difficulty, and PONV
      when compared with classic endotracheal tube.

      Suction Above Cuff Endotracheal Tube (SACETT) has a dorsal port above the cuff designed to
      allow continuous or intermittent suctioning of secretions from the subglottic space. Thus, it
      facilitates suctioning of excessive secretions around the mouth and the cuff. In this study,
      the investigators aimed to investigate the effect of the use of SACETT on laryngospasm and
      postoperative complications in rhinoplasty operations.

      This randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted in 132 patients undergoing
      rhinoplasty. The patients were randomly divided into 2 groups: Suction Above Cuff
      Endotracheal Tube (n:66) (Group SA) and classic endotracheal tube (n:66) (Group C).
      Complications following general anesthesia were statistically analyzed among the two groups.

      55 male patients and 77 female patients were included in the study. The incidences of
      postoperative laryngospasm and respiratory complications were found to be lower in Group SA
      compared to Group C. In addition, the incidences of agitation, postoperative nausea and
      vomiting (PONV), swallowing difficulty, and sore throat were found to be lower in Group SA
      compared to Group C. However, the incidences of cough, hypotension, and tachycardia were
      similar in both groups. No PONV, swallowing difficulty, and hypotension were observed in
      Group SA. The blood volume accumulated in the suction chamber was found to be greater in
      Group SA compared to Group C.

      The investigators believe that the use of SACETT in rhinoplasty operations reduces the
      incidences of laryngospasm, emergence agitation, sore throat, swallowing difficulty, and PONV
      when compared with classic endotracheal tube.
