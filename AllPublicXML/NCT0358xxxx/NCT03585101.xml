    <textblock>
      This study will assess the effect of treatment for hepatitis C virus (HCV) on cardiovascular
      disease risk. The study will enroll men and women who are infected with HCV and have
      underlying metabolic disease. All participants will receive a 12-week course of an HCV
      treatment (elbasvir/grazoprevir). Cardiovascular disease risk will be evaluated at baseline,
      week 4 on treatment, 12 weeks post-treatment, and 52 weeks post-treatment through noninvasive
      measurements of endothelial function, insulin resistance, liver fibrosis and steatosis, and
      circulating blood biomarkers.
