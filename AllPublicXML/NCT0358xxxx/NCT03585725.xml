      This is a A Pilot Investigator-Initiated Study of Ribavirin in Indolent Follicular Lymphoma
      and Mantle Cell Lymphoma
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is for men and women ages 18 and older with follicular lymphoma with
      detectable BCL2-t or mantle cell lymphoma with presence of cyclin D1 overexpression (can be
      newly diagnosed or relapsed). The objective of this study is to assess the possibility of
      treating follicular lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma patients with ribavirin and using cell
      free DNA (cfDNA) for BCL2-t and cyclin D1 extracted from peripheral blood to measure
      treatment effect.

      Clinical trials of ribavirin have been conducted in relapsed and refractory acute myeloid
      leukemia (AML). Ribavirin, an antiviral agent with established doses, has resulted in the
      regression of the tumor.

        -  Ribavirin 1000 mg will be administered orally twice daily continuously for 28-day
           cycles.

        -  Patients will be followed for up to 7 months.

        -  Will continue on treatment as long as they are responding to therapy and not
           experiencing unacceptable side effects.

    <description>Feasibility will be measured by the number of subjects who receive ribavirin for at least 3 months, have peripheral blood samples collected at baseline and monthly while on treatment, and have levels of BCL-t and cyclin D1, respectively, obtained from their peripheral blood samples. The intervention will be deemed feasible if all three criteria are met in 10 out of 15 subjects.</description>

    <description>Response rate will be assessed by the number of participants who achieve a response to ribavirin treatment based on PET/CT or CT at baseline and within 4 weeks after completion of treatment. International working group criteria will be used for response assessment based on imaging done at baseline and 2-4 weeks after completion of therapy. The total number of participants who achieve a response will be assessed after the last patient has their response assessed after completion of therapy.</description>
