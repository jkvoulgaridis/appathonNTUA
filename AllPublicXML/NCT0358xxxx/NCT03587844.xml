          1. Concurrent use of other systemic anti-cancer agents or treatments for mycosis
             fungoides/sezary syndrome, or lymphomatoid papulosis.

               -  Patients with more than one type of lymphoma may be enrolled after discussion
                  with the MSK Principal Investigator.

               -  Adjuvant or maintenance therapy to reduce the risk of recurrence of other
                  malignancy (other than T-cell lymphoma) is permissible after discussion with the
