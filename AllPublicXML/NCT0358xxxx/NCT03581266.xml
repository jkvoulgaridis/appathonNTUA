  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Certain functional properties of cereal products, e.g. their postprandial glucose and insulin
      responses, have been characterized as steps towards obtaining a greater understanding of
      their beneficial health effects. A low-glycemic index diet results in decreased postprandial
      insulin and glucose responses, which is thought to be beneficial for insulin and glucose
      metabolism.

      In healthy subjects, it has been shown that rye breads (RBs) produce a lower postprandial
      insulin response compared with refined wheat breads (RWB) despite similar glucose responses.
      Juntunen et al. (2003) suggested that the difference in the structural characteristics
      between rye and wheat breads is a possible explanatory mechanism. However, the underlying
      mechanism of this discrepancy between insulin and glucose responses to rye bread, the
      so-called &quot;rye factor&quot; (RF), is still largely unknown. Faster starch digestibility and higher
      postprandial insulin responses for RWB compared with RBs may indicate faster intestinal
      glucose absorption and faster glucose disappearance respectively.

      Therefore our hypothesis is that despite having similar glucose responses, RWB has faster
      turn over (kinetics) compared with RBs. The present study is aiming to apply an experimental
      set up which can comprehend the hypothetical differences in RWB and RBs kinetics.

      The human subjects after an overnight fasting 10-12 hours are coming to the clinic. On
      arrival, catheters are inserted into a forearm vein of each arm for blood sampling and
      isotope infusion, respectively. A primed followed by a constant-rate infusion of [6,6-2H2]
      glucose are administered. The enrichment of [6,6-2H2] glucose in the blood is then measured
      at different time points after the breakfast. The glucose kinetics can be calculated from
      this.
