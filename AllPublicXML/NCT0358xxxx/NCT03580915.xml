  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess a functional literacy program for formerly homeless
      adults now residing in supported housing who have difficulty performing daily life skills
      requiring functional literacy (e.g., bill paying, medication management, community
      transportation) needed to maintain housing placements. The hypothesis is that intervention
      group participants will improve in functional literacy compared to the control group that
      does not receive the intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sixty-five percent of homeless adults are reported to be illiterate or marginally literate.
      The lack of literacy in a high technological society negatively impacts this population's
      ability to participate in daily life activities including finding and maintaining employment,
      renting and maintaining an apartment, seeking health care, using public transportation, and
      managing finances. Poor literacy marginalizes this population from societal participation and
      maintains this group in a state of lack and deficiency.

      A literacy program will be delivered to participants who are formerly homeless and now
      residing in supported shelter. Participants will be randomly assigned to an intervention
      (n=20) or control (n=20) group. The intervention group will receive the functional literacy
      intervention over 8 weeks, twice weekly. Intervention sessions will allow participants to
      learn literacy skills within the context of real-life daily activities like grocery shopping,
      preparing a meal, and purchasing subway cards. Control group participants will not receive
      intervention.

    <measure>Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) score</measure>
    <time_frame>1-week post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) is a 5-item, 10-point rating scale (1=most important, 10=least important) designed to be completed conjointly by a therapist and participant, and requires approximately 30 minutes to administer. The scale allows participants to identify and prioritize the most important problems impacting daily function and can be used with clients of all ages and diagnoses. Participants are asked to identify the five most critical problems impeding functional performance in the areas of self-care, productivity, and leisure. After the identification of five problems, participants are asked to rate both performance and satisfaction levels of the identified activities on a 10-point scale (1=not satisfied; 10=extremely satisfied). An open-ended narrative section is provided to allow therapists to record participant comments. The COPM is intended to be used pre- and post-intervention.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Inventory of Reading Occupations (IRO) score</measure>
    <time_frame>1-week post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The IRO-Adult identifies reading materials from a list of 14 categories (e.g., financial records, federal/state aid documents, food and nutrition labels) that participants access as part of daily occupations. Two sections include Reading Categories (having 14 items) and Dimensions of Reading Participation (consisting of 5 dimensions with two open-ended questions and three 5-point Likert scale items; scores of 10+ = higher reading proficiency). For each client-identified reading category, participants are asked a series of questions about the 5 dimensions of reading participation: (1) reading material type; (2) frequency of access; (3) effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction; (4) importance of reading material in daily life; and (5) strategies and supports needed to access). The IRO-Adult descriptively assesses participants' relative mastery (effectiveness, efficiency, satisfaction) in functional literacy in relation to occupational participation.</description>

    <description>The intervention will be provided twice weekly in 2-hour sessions, over 8 weeks. The 16 intervention sessions will provide the opportunity for participants to learn functional literacy skills to (1) manage an apartment, (2) access community resources, (3) manage finances, (4) access free recreational activities. All sessions will address literacy skills needed to complete basic daily life activities in the home and community environments. Literacy skills will first be learned and practiced within the supported shelter, and then extended to the community.</description>
