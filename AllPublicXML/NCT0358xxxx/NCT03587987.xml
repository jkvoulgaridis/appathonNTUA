  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a complex physiological process involved in establishing regular breaths at birth.
      After initiation of the first breath, fluid is removed from the alveoli and enough pressure
      must be generated to inflate the lungs . Most newborns will establish spontaneous regular
      breathing sufficient to maintain the heart rate above 100 beats/min and to improve perfusion
      within 3 minutes of birth. According to the neonatal resuscitation programme (NRP), if heart
      rate is below 100 or there is persistence of apnoea or gasping after the initial steps of
      drying/stimulation and oropharyngeal suction, intervention is required .

      The main focus of neonatal resuscitation is effective ventilation to improve gas exchange and
      prevent respiratory failure. After birth, approximately 4% to 10% of term and late preterm
      newborns will receive help breathing with positive-pressure ventilation (PPV). Adequate mask
      ventilation is essential when providing breaths during neonatal resuscitation. However, this
      can be difficult, especially for less experienced staff and may be affected by inadequate
      seal of the mask, gas leaks and airway obstruction. In addition, trauma may be caused by the
      volumes being given during pressure controlled ventilation.

      Comparison of two different neonatal resuscitation devices (Neopuff and rPAP) in the Neonatal
      Unit in Cork University Maternity Hospital. Participants will use the devices on a mannequin.
      Performance of the two devices is judged by comparing the tidal volumes produced.

      Participants will be recruited from the medical staff (Non-consultant Hospital Doctors and
      Consultants) of the neonatal unit.
