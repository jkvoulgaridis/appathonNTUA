      Patients will be treated for a total of 6 cycles.For patients responding or who have stable
      disease following cycle 6, treatment may continue until one of the following criteria
      applies:

        -  Inter-current illness that prevent further administration of treatment

        -  Unacceptable adverse event(s)

        -  Participant decides to withdraw from the study,

        -  general or specific changes in the participant's condition render the participant
           unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.

        -  Evidence of disease progression by international working Group (IWG) 2006 criteria.

        -  participants who wish not to continue treatment at time of disease assessment at end of
           cycle 6 will complete their end of treatment visit upon completion of cycle 6

             squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or adequately resected carcinoma in situ (e.g.
             cervix) may enroll irrespective of the time of diagnosis.

          4. Prior exposure to azacitidine, decitabine or investigational hypomethylating agent

          5. Use of cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents, or experimental agents (agents that are not
             commercially available) for the treatment of MDS, MDS/MPN, CMML or AML within 14 days
             of the first day of study drug treatment.

          6. No concurrent use of erythroid stimulating agents, Granulocyte-colony stimulating
             Factor (G-CSF), Granulocyte Macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is allowed
             during study except in cases of febrile neutropenia where G-CSF can be used for short
             term. Growth factors must be stopped 14 days prior to study.

          7. Patients with history of allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

          8. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because APR-246 has not been studied in
             pregnant subjects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events

             should be discontinued if the mother is treated with APR-246.
