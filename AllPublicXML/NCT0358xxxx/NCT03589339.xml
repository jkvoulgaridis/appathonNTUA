  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The 1100 study is an open-label, Phase I, prospective clinical study to assess the safety of
      intratumoral injection of NBTXR3 activated by radiotherapy in combination with anti-PD-1
      therapy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The 1100 study aims to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of NBTXR3 activated by
      radiotherapy in combination with an anti-PD-1 therapy in three cohorts of patients. The first
      cohort includes patients with LRR or R/M HNSCC with the target lesion in a previously
      irradiated field. In cohorts two and three, patients present with lung or liver metastases
      from any primary cancer eligible for anti-PD-1 therapy. These patients have a high unmet need
      and the Sponsor hypothesizes that NBTXR3 activated by radiotherapy will act synergistically
      with anti-PD-1 to enhance the therapeutic index of radiotherapy maximizing local effect, to
      overcome radio-resistance, to increase the local efficacy of immunotherapy, and to improve
      distant tumor control via an abscopal effect. Eligible patients will receive a single
      intratumoral injection of NBTXR3 subsequently activated by radiotherapy and then an approved
      anti-PD-1. The end of treatment visit will take place 4 weeks after the last radiotherapy
      fraction. Patients will be followed for long-term safety and efficacy until the end of the
      study.
