  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical investigation is intended to evaluate the ability of a magnetic cardiac
      positioning system to decrease medical radiation exposure on a peripheral angioplasty
      procedure in patients with a peripheral artery stenosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study aims at addressing the fluoroscopy exposure time concern among physicians
      by proposing a new methodology that capitalizes on the cardiac positioning system (CPS) to
      reach near-zero fluoroscopy time for interventional cardiologists.

      Intracoronary navigation of balloon catheter toward an anatomical landmark will be done with
      two navigation method:

        1. Fluoroscopy alone

        2. Fluoroscopy + CPS combination.

      The order of the navigation method (method 1 then method 2 or vice versa) will be determine
      arbitrarily determined for each subject.
