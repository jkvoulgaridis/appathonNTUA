      This is a study to evaluate the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of a recombinant
      circumsporozoite protein (rCSP) malaria vaccine administered with and without AP 10-602
      [Glucopyranosyl Lipid A (GLA) in liposome Quillaja saponaria 21 formulation (LSQ)] adjuvant.
      Fifty healthy adult, malaria naive volunteers aged 18 to 45 will receive vaccination with or
      without adjuvant (10 of those volunteers will receive rCSP alone) in five dose escalating
      groups. Each group will receive 3 vaccination doses total, with intramuscular (IM) injections
      on days 1, 29, and 85. A sixth group of 6 volunteers will receive no vaccinations and will
      participate as a control in a Controlled Human Malaria Infection (CHMI) challenge with two of
      the vaccinated groups. The study will be conducted at the Center for Vaccine Development
      (CVD) in Baltimore, Maryland. The patient participation duration is expected to be up to 510
      days (up to 117 days for nonvaccination group). This study will test two hypotheses: (1) the
      rCSP/AP 10-602 [GLA-LSQ] candidate malaria vaccine will induce an immune response in a
      dose-dependent manner as measured by anti-CSP antibody titer via ELISA and (2) the rCSP/AP
      10-602 [GLA-LSQ] candidate malaria vaccine will provide a minimum of 50% efficacy in vaccines
      compared to unvaccinated infectivity controls. The primary objective is to assess the safety
      and reactogenicity of candidate rCSP/AP 10-602 [GLA-LSQ] malaria vaccine when administered
      intramuscularly on a 1, 29, and 85 day schedule to healthy malaria-naive adults aged 18-45
      years.

      This is a phase I, single-site, dose escalation study to evaluate the safety, immunogenicity,
      and efficacy of the recombinant circumsporozoite protein (rCSP) antigen malaria vaccine
      administered with and without AP 10-602 [Glucopyranosyl Lipid A (GLA) in liposome Quillaja
      saponaria 21 formulation (LSQ)]. The study population will consist of 56 healthy male and
      female adults aged 18 to 45 years old and be conducted at the Center for Vaccine Development
      (CVD) in Baltimore, Maryland. Forty healthy, malaria-na√Øve volunteers will receive rCSP
      vaccination with AP 10-602 [GLA-LSQ] adjuvant. Ten volunteers will receive rCSP alone. Each
      dose-escalating group will receive 3 intramuscular (IM) total doses of vaccine on days 1, 29,
      and 85. Group 1 will receive a dose of 10 mcg rCSP + AP 10-602 [GLA-LSQ] (5 mcg GLA - 2 mcg
      LSQ) at each injection; Group 2 will receive 30 mcg rCSP + AP 10-602 [GLA-LSQ] (5 mcg GLA - 2
      mcg LSQ); Group 3 will receive 30 mcg rCSP without adjuvant; and Group 4 will receive 60 mcg
      rCSP + AP 10-602 [GLA-LSQ] (5 mcg GLA - 2 mcg LSQ). The dose for Group 5 will depend on
      immunogenicity analysis from groups 1, 2 and 3. If immunogenicity analysis conducted 28 days
      post-2nd dose in Groups 1, 2 and 3 show promise (at least fourfold increase in geometric mean
      anti-CSP antibody or geometric mean anti-CSP titer of 20), the 10 volunteers in Group 5 will
      receive the lowest rCSP dose that gives this predefined immunogenic response ((either 10 or
      30 mcg rCSP) + AP 10-602 [GLA-LSQ],]), otherwise, Group 5 will receive 60 mcg rCSP + AP
      10-602 [GLA-LSQ]. Groups will be vaccinated in a stepwise manner following a &quot;telescoped&quot;
      design. A sixth group of 6 volunteers (Group 6) will receive no vaccinations and will be used
      as an infectivity control for a Controlled Human Malaria Infection (CHMI) challenge. Groups 4
      and 5 will also undergo the CHMI challenge together, 28 days after the last vaccination. The
      patient participation duration is expected to be up to 510 days for Groups 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5;
      and up to 117 days for Group 6. This study will test two hypotheses: (1) the rCSP/AP 10-602
      [GLA-LSQ] candidate malaria vaccine will induce an immune response in a dose-dependent manner
      as measured by anti-CSP antibody titer via ELISA and (2) the rCSP/AP 10-602 [GLA-LSQ]
      candidate malaria vaccine will provide a minimum of 50% efficacy in vaccines compared to
      unvaccinated infectivity controls. The primary objective is to assess the safety and
      reactogenicity of candidate rCSP/AP 10-602 [GLA-LSQ] malaria vaccine when administered
      intramuscularly on a 1, 29, and 85 day schedule to healthy malaria-naive adults aged 18-45
      years. The secondary objectives are to (1) assess immunogenicity of rCSP/AP 10-602 [GLA-LSQ]
      malaria vaccine when administered intramuscularly on a 1, 29, and 85 day schedule and (2) to
      assess the preliminary efficacy of candidate rCSP/AP 10-602 [GLA-LSQ] malaria vaccine against
      infection with Plasmodium falciparum malaria (defined as P. falciparum asexual parasitemia or
      a delay in patency of infection &gt; 2 days versus unimmunized infectivity controls) under
      Controlled Human Malaria Infection (CHMI).

                  surgical sterilization via tubal ligation the essure procedure or hysterectomy,
                  abstinence or a vasectomized partner). The contraceptive method should remain
                  unchanged throughout the study participation.

          6. Is in good health, as determined by vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, oral
             temperature); medical history; normal laboratory ranges; and a physical examination.

               -  Laboratory ranges include: hemoglobin, white blood cell count, platelet count,
                  glucose (random), serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), serum creatinine, urine
                  protein and urine blood.

          7. Agree not to travel to a malaria endemic region during the entire course of the trial.

          8. Willing to avoid non-study related blood donation for the duration of participation in

             whichever is longer.

          9. Able to understand and comply with planned study procedures including daily outpatient
             follow-up visits beginning 5 days after malaria challenge (groups 4, 5, and 6 only).

         10. Willing to avoid non-study related blood donation for 3 years following P. falciparum
             challenge (groups 4, 5, and 6 only).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any history of malaria infection, or travel to a malaria endemic region within 6
             months before first vaccination.

          2. History of long-term residence (&gt; / = 5 years) in an area known to have significant
             transmission of P. falciparum.

          3. Positive serology for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), or
             hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg).

          4. Positive sickle cell screening test or known hemoglobinopathy (groups 4, 5 and 6 only)

          5. Current or recent (within the last four weeks) treatment with parenteral or oral
             corticosteroids (intranasal or inhaled steroids are acceptable), or other
             immunosuppressive agents, or chemotherapy.

          6. History of splenectomy.

          7. Screening laboratory values outside protocol-specified acceptable normal ranges,
             except hematuria &gt; 1 + detected during menses for females (for females who are
             menstruating, urinalysis frequently tests positive for blood and is not an indicator
             of poor health status or increased risk).

          8. Vaccination with a live vaccine within the past 30 days or with a nonreplicating,
             inactivated, or subunit vaccine within the last 14 days.

          9. Known hypersensitivity to components of the vaccine for groups 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5; or to
             the adjuvant for groups 1, 2, 4 and 5.

         10. History of acute or chronic medical conditions including, but not limited to,
             disorders of the liver, kidney, lung, heart, nervous system, or other metabolic or
             autoimmune/inflammatory conditions.

         11. History of anaphylaxis or severe hypersensitivity reaction.

         12. History of Guillain-Barre syndrome or severe adverse reaction to any vaccination.

         13. Severe asthma, as defined by an emergency room visit or hospitalization within the
             last 12 months.

         14. Pregnant or breastfeeding women or women who plan to become pregnant before day 115 in
             groups 1, 2 and 3; or before 30 days post-malaria challenge in groups 4, 5 and 6.

         15. Concurrent participation in other investigational protocols or receipt of an
             investigational product within the previous 30 days.

         16. Planned receipt of an investigational product within 28 days following the last
             vaccination dose or malaria challenge.

         17. Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would affect a participant's
             ability to understand or comply with the study protocol or would jeopardize a
             participant's safety or rights.

         18. History of previous receipt of a candidate malaria vaccine or a vaccine containing the
             GLA-LSQ adjuvant.

         19. Use or planned use of any drug with anti-malarial activity 30 days before, or after
