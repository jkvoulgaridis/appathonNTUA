    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-arm, phase 1, dose escalation study to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary pharmacodynamic effect of EOC317 in patients
      with advanced solid tumors.

      The study comprises a dose-escalation phase and a dose-expansion phase.

        1. Dose-escalation: using 3+3 design to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and
           pharmacokinetic profile of EOC317 at 5, 10, 20, 30, 45, 60 mg in patients with advanced
           solid tumors, and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended dose
           (RDE) for the dose expansion phase.

        2. Dose-expansion: based on PK profile in the dose escalation phase, the dose-expansion
           study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary pharmacodynamic effect of
           the RDE for EOC317 in patients with advanced solid tumors.
