      This initial, proof of concept study will focus on identifying significant differences in
      response to the Ebolavirus Zaire vaccine (ChAd3-EBO-Z) when administered with placebo,
      MVA-BN(R)-Filo, or ChAd3-EBO-Z boosters after 8 days. All 60 participants will receive the
      ChAd3-EBO-Z vaccine and then randomized into each booster group (20 receiving each type of
      booster). Subjects will be followed-up for 6 months to monitor for safety outcomes and
      efficacy measures. There is no formal hypothesis for this study. The primary objective of
      this study is to assess the safety and reactogenicity of study products by study group when
      administered IM to healthy adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind trial of 60 evaluable males and non-pregnant
      females, 18-45 years old, inclusive, who are in good health, meet all eligibility criteria,
      and do not meet any exclusion criteria. This trial is designed to assess the safety,
      reactogenicity and immunogenicity of an Ebolavirus Zaire (ChAd3-EBO-Z) vaccine for the
      prevention of Ebola. ChAd3-EBO-Z will be administered intramuscularly into the deltoid of all
      participants on Day 1. On Day 8, subjects will receive either placebo, ChAd3-EBO-Z , or MVA-
      BN(R)-Filo boosters, administered intramuscularly into the deltoid of the arm opposite their
      first vaccination, based on study group. There will be 20 subjects in each group. Subjects
      will be monitored for 6 months after vaccination to assess safety and efficacy for
      ChA3d-EBO-Z with homologous and heterologous boosting. Differences between the homologous and
      heterologous arm represent potential points for further, more in depth assessment to
      determine if there is a correlation with efficacy. Long term goals include comparing results
      from this study with results from naturally infected individuals as well as non-human primate
      (NHP) vaccination/challenge studies. There is no formal hypothesis for this study. The
      primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and reactogenicity of study products
      by study group when administered IM to healthy adults. The secondary study objective is to
      assess the antibody response to Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV) glycoprotein (GP) by study group.

               -  As determined by medical history and physical examination to evaluate acute or
                  currently ongoing chronic medical diagnoses or conditions, defined as those that
                  have been present for at least 90 days which would affect the assessment of the
                  safety of subjects or the immunogenicity of study vaccinations. Chronic medical
                  diagnoses or conditions should be stable for the last 60 days (no
                  hospitalizations, ER or urgent care for condition and no adverse symptoms that
                  need medical intervention such as medication change/supplemental oxygen). This
                  includes no change in chronic prescription medication, dose, or frequency as a
                  result of deterioration of the chronic medical diagnosis or condition in the 60
                  days prior to enrollment. Any prescription change that is due to change of health
                  care provider, insurance company, etc., or that is done for financial reasons, as
                  long as in the same class of medication, will not be considered a deviation of
                  this inclusion criterion. Any change in prescription medication due to
                  improvement of a disease outcome, as determined by the site principal
                  investigator or appropriate sub-investigator, will not be considered a deviation
                  of this inclusion criterion. Subjects may be on chronic or as needed (prn)
                  medications if, in the opinion of the site principal investigator or appropriate
                  sub-investigator, they pose no additional risk to subject safety or assessment of
                  reactogenicity and immunogenicity and do not indicate a worsening of medical
                  diagnosis or condition. Similarly, medication changes subsequent to enrollment
                  and study vaccination are acceptable provided there was no deterioration in the
                  subject's chronic medical condition that necessitated a medication change, and
                  there is no additional risk to the subject or interference with the evaluation of
                  responses to study vaccination. Note: Topical, nasal, and inhaled medications
                  (apart from steroids as outlined in the Subject Exclusion Criteria), herbals,

                  normal range.

                    -  Screening laboratory values that are outside the range of eligibility but
                       are thought to be due to an acute condition or due to laboratory error may
                       be repeated once.
