    <textblock>
      The prevention and control of post-treatment pain is of great importance for the comfort of
      the patient as well as for the clinician's prestige. In this study, the effect of 940 nm
      diode laser disinfection on the postoperative pain of retreatment cases was evaluated.

    <textblock>
      From the fact that microorganisms are the most common factors causing pain, this study aimed
      to evaluate effect of 940 nm diode laser disinfection performed in addition to conventional
      irrigation on postoperative pain of retreatment cases. Eighty-four patients with chronic
      apical periodontitis were treated. Root canal fillings were removed using rotary files. Root
      canals were irrigated using sodium hypochlorite between instrument changes. Final irrigation
      was performed using sodium hypochlorite and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). The cases
      were randomly allocated into 2 groups: Group 1: Diode laser disinfection group, Group 2:
      control group. Root canal fillings were applied and crowns were restored. All treatments were
      completed in a single appointment. Patients were given a pain scale and they were requested
      to mark the code that reflects their pain intensity during 3 days.

    <measure>Post-endodontic pain after diode laser disinfection in retreatment cases</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>Pain intensity was evaluated at 24 hours after retreatment procedures. An 11-item numerical rating scale (NRS) was used to assess the pain. This NRS is a segmented numeric version of the visual analog scale (VAS) in which a respondent selects a whole number (0 -10 integers) that best reflects the intensity of their pain. Number 0 represents 'no pain' whereas number 10 represents 'pain as bad as someone can imagine'.All patients were requested to mark a number corresponding to their average pain.</description>

    <description>Pain intensity was evaluated at 72 hours after retreatment procedures. An 11-item numerical rating scale (NRS) was used to assess the pain.
