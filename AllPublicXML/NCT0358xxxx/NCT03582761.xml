  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter, case-control phase IV clinical trial to evaluate the
      effectiveness of the EV71 vaccine. About 40000 children in the town aged 6-35 months will be
      recruited and vaccinated with EV71 vaccines, which account for 20-40% of the children aged
      6-35 months in the areas. The subjects will be vaccinated with EV71 vaccine at day 0 and day
      28. Other children of appropriate age in the town will choose voluntarily whether or not to
      be vaccinated with EV71 vaccine. All children's vaccination of EV71 vaccines will be recorded
      in the study areas and the coverage rate of EV71 vaccine in the town will be calculated. The
      vaccination is expected to complete before the epidemic peak of HFMD.

      Surveillance of HFMD cases caused by EV71 will be conducted in hospitals of the study areas
      for 10-12 months, which cover a whole HFMD epidemic period. Throat and anal swabs will be
      collected from children with a clinically diagnosed HFMD for typing of human enteroviruses
      tested by PCR. The HFMD cases with EV71 positive will be recruited as cases, while those with
      EV71 negative will be recruited as test-negative controls. Besides, for each EV71-associated
      HFMD cases, the investigators will select 4 community controls mateced with each case for
      age, sex and residence.

    <description>Cases are defined as eligible patients who tested positive for enteroviruse 71. For each case, we will select two groups of control children, including hospital test-negative control and community control. Logistic regression is performed to calculate the odds ratio (OR) of vaccination in cases vs each of the control groups.</description>
