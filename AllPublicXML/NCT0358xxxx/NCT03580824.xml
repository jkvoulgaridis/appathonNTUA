    <textblock>
      This is a clinical trial to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of R21/MM in healthy
      Kenyan participants from the different age groups.Participants will receive 3 vaccinations 4
      weeks apart.

      The study includes three age groups:

      Group 1: healthy adults (18-45 years) Group 2: young children (aged 1-5 years) Group 3:
      infants (aged 5- &lt;12 months of age) Each group will receive 3 vaccine doses which will be
      4-weeks apart.

      The trial is funded by The European &amp; Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership
      (EDCTP), European Union

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate the safety and tolerability of R21 with adjuvant Matrix-M in healthy adults then children and finally infants.</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 years following vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>Solicited and unsolicited adverse event data will be collected at each clinic visit from diary cards, clinical review, clinical examination (including observations) and laboratory results. This AE data will be tabulated and frequency, duration and severity of AEs compared between groups.
The following parameters will be assessed for all study groups:
Occurrence of solicited local reactogenicity signs and symptoms for 7 days following the vaccination
Occurrence of solicited systemic reactogenicity signs and symptoms for 7 days following the vaccination
Occurrence of unsolicited adverse events for 28 days following the vaccination
Change from baseline for safety laboratory measures
Occurrence of serious adverse events during the whole study duration</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To assess the cellular and humoral immunogenicity of R21 in humans with adjuvant Matrix- M in healthy adults, children and infants.</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 years following vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>Comparison of immunogenicity (antibody responses) of the R21-Matrix-M1 - adjuvanted vaccination doses and the longevity of responses.
ELISA to quantify antibodies to the vaccine components CS, NANP and HBsAb.
Flow cytometry assays with intracellular cytokine staining to enumerate and functionally characterise immune cell populations such as effector and memory T cells (e.g. CD4+ and CD8+), T follicular helper cells, regulatory T cells, B cells, plasma cells and dendritic cells
ELISPOT for enumeration of antibody-secreting cells (e.g. B and plasma cells)</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy adults aged 18 to 45 years (Group 1), Healthy child aged 1-5 years (Group 2),
             healthy infant aged 5- &lt;12 months (Group 3)

          -  Able and willing (in the Investigator's opinion) to comply with all study requirements

          -  Non-pregnant, non-lactating adult female or adult male

        rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly, in accordance with the
        product label. Examples of these include: combined oral contraceptives; injectable
        progestogen; implants of etenogestrel or levonorgestrel; intrauterine device or
        intrauterine system; male partner sterilisation at least 6 months prior to the female
        subject's entry into the study, and the relationship is monogamous; male condom combined
        with a vaginal spermicide (foam, gel, film, cream or suppository); and male condom combined

          -  Blood transfusion within one month of enrolment.

          -  Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months
             preceding the planned administration of the vaccine candidate.

             product in the 30 days preceding enrolment, or planned use during the study period.

             trial, or may influence the result of the trial, or the participant's ability to
             participate in the trial.
