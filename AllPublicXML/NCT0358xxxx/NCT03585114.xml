      Primary Objective:

        -  To determine whether changes in uptake of [18F]DCFPyL PET/CT scans at baseline and after
           6 weeks of treatment for metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer, correlates with
           radiographic progression free survival (rPFS) as defined by Prostate Cancer Working
           Group 3 (PCWG3) criteria.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To determine whether changes in uptake of [18F]DCFPyL PET/CT scans correlate with
           overall survival (OS)

        -  To determine whether baseline SUVmax correlate with rPFS

        -  To compare number of lesions detected with standard imaging at baseline and at the time
           of progression

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is the most common cancer and the third most common cause of cancer deaths in
      American men. The lethal form of the disease is metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer
      (mCRPC). Serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing has been relied upon heavily as a
      marker of disease and is commonly used in the community to guide therapy.

      PyL, also known as [18F]DCFPyL, is a second-generation fluorinated prostate-specific membrane
      antigen (PSMA) targeted positron emission tomography (PET) imaging agent. In preliminary
      studies it demonstrates a higher detection of metastatic prostate lesions compared to
      standard imaging. However, the role of [18F] PyL in tumor response to therapy has not been
      evaluated, specifically the potential to serve as a predictive biomarker of response. Given
      the high cost of current therapeutic agents in mCRPC, there is a need for an early response
      biomarker to stratify which patients will benefit from therapy and which will not. This will
      also allow for earlier change in management of patients who will not response to these
      therapies, potentially improving patient outcomes.
