  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dry needling is a therapeutic modality used to treat a number of neuromusculoskeletal
      conditions. Practice trends suggest it is becoming widely used by Physical Therapists to help
      patients manage symptoms associated with CGH, however, there is limited scientific evidence
      demonstrating meaningful impact for dry needling for CGH. Manual therapy (thrust and
      non-thrust mobilizations) to the cervical spine are well researched and have an established
      treatment effect for managing symptoms related to CGH. The purpose of this study is to
      compare outcomes (1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 12 months) for patients with CGH treated with
      cervical-cranial dry needling or pragmatically applied orthopedic manual therapy to the
      cervical spine. In addition to either the cervical-cranial dry needling or manual therapy to
      the cervical spine, patients will also receive patient education, thoracic manipulation, and
      exercise.

    <textblock>
      The use of dry needling is becoming widely used by Physical Therapists in the United States
      for a number of neuromusculoskeletal conditions including cervicogenic headache (CGH). Dry
      needling is performed by taking a mono-filament needle and inserting it into symptomatic soft
      tissue. In this trial, the dry needling will be performed segmentally in the neck and along
      the patient's headache distribution pattern. Orthopedic manual therapy (OMT) may include both
      thrust and non-thrust techniques applied to a targeted spinal level and has a
      well-established treatment effect for patients with CGH. In this trial, the OMT will be
      applied pragmatically to the cervical spine at the most symptomatic level of the headache.
      Other interventions used in this trial will include patient education, thoracic manipulation
      and exercise.

      Patients will be randomized to receive either dry needling or OMT 2x/week for 2 weeks and
      then 1-2x/week for 2 weeks totaling 6-8 visits over the course of 1 month. The 1 week and 1
      month outcomes collected will be reported on separately from the 3 and 12 months.
