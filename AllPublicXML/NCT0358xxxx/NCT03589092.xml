  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to identify the number of MODY patients to be found among Emirati women with
      GDM as the incidence and prevalence of monogenic diabetes among this group of patients is
      unknown. This will enable improvements in diagnostics, treatment and the counselling of these
      women.

  <detailed_description>

      The present study aims to perform systematic genetic screening of genes known as the cause of
      MODY in women diagnosed with gestational diabetes to estimate the prevalence of MODY. This is
      important to understand the extent to which monogenic diabetes is encountered for the first
      time during pregnancy. Once women with MODY developing GDM have been identified, biomarkers
      to identify these women can be found which will assist the clinical process of performing
      genetic screening in the right subset of patients. Also for the women participating in the
      present study, this is of great importance as correct genetic diagnosis will provide them
      with the needed information to receive optimal treatment, correct plan for follow-up and a
      more accurate prognosis in relation to risk of future complication and therefore prevention
      of such.
