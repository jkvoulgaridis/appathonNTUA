  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this study is to evaluate refractive and visual outcomes in glaucoma
      patients who will be having either traditional glaucoma surgery or minimally invasive
      glaucoma surgery, also known as MIGS.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is an increasing number of surgical options to lower intraocular pressure (IOP) in
      patients with glaucoma and ocular hypertension performed with or without concurrent cataract
      surgery. Today, patients undergoing glaucoma surgery have increasingly higher expectations
      for their postoperative visual outcomes. Therefore, it is important to understand the
      influence of various glaucoma surgical procedures on refractive outcomes. This information
      would aid in patient and surgical procedure selection, pre-operative counseling to set
      appropriate expectations and may help surgeons adjust their plans and techniques to improve
      visual outcomes.

      The advent of minimally invasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS) procedures further highlights the
      importance of studying refractive outcomes as many of these surgeries are being performed
      earlier in the glaucoma severity spectrum where central visual potential is still preserved.
      Furthermore, this class of surgeries is often performed in combination with cataract surgery.

      There remains a lack of data regarding refractive outcomes in patients who have had
      phaco-iStent, phaco-Cypass, as well as goniotomy (Kahook dual blade (KDB) gonioscopy assisted
      transluminal trabeculotomy), and Xen gel stent implantation with or without cataract surgery.
      This information would help during pre-operative patient discussions and lens selection in
      the context of a combined procedure.
