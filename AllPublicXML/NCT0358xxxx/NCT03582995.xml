      The study will consist of a randomized controlled clinical study trial comparing the results
      of coronally positioned flap with AlloDerm GBR plus bovine derived xenograft versus coronally
      positioned tunnel with AlloDerm GBR plus bovine derived xenograft in approximately 30
      patients (15 per group). All materials used in the study are FDA approved.

      Patients will be assigned to one of two treatment groups. In the positive control group, BX
      will be placed over the root and bone surface of the defect, covered with ADM GBR® and
      sutured using a continuous sling suture technique (line angle to line angle) with a Maxon
      5-0, 3/8 circle 13 mm needle (Dodge et. al, 1998). The coronally positioned flap will be
      sutured separately and coronally positioned using a continuous sling suture technique
      (papilla to papilla sutures) with a Maxon 5-0, 3/8 circle 13 mm needle. In the test group, BX
      will be placed over the root and bone surface of the defect, covered with ADM GBR® and
      sutured together using a continuous sling suture technique (line angle to line angle) with a
      Maxon 5-0, 3/8 circle 13 mm needle. The coronally positioned tunnel will be sutured together
      and coronally positioned using a continuous sling suture technique (line angle to line angle)
      with a Maxon 5-0, 3/8 circle 13 mm needle.

      Post-operative instructions will be given to the patients along with prescriptions, in
      appropriate cases, for systemic doxycycline 100 mg once a day for 14 days; an
      anti-inflammatory agent (naproxen 375 mg q12h for 7 days); an analgesic
      (hydrocodone/acetaminophen 5/325mg q6-8h prn pain); a steroid, Medrol dose pack, 21 tablets
      of 4 mg methylprednisolone; 6 tablets on day 1, 5 on day 2, decrease by 1/day until last
      tablet dose on day 6, or dexamethazone 1mg, 18 tablets, 3 tablets/day for 1st3 days, 2/day
      for the next 3 days, 1/day for the last 3 days (always taken in the morning).

      All patients will be seen at week 1 or 2, 4, 8, 16 and 24, at which time the final exam will
      be completed. Sutures will be removed between weeks 4-8, as indicated. Post-operative visits
      will consist of supragingival plaque removal and oral hygiene reinforcement. Any patient who
      develops any adverse reaction to the materials used or shows attachment loss ≥2.0 mm will be
      exited from the study and will receive the appropriate treatment.
