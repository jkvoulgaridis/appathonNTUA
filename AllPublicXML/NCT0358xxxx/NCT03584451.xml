    <textblock>
      160 patients who received a total hip arthroplasty (THA) were included and randomized to
      receive specific rehabilitation sport (RS) or not (control) in addition to a conventional
      rehabilitation program. Upon completion of the rehabilitation phase 6 weeks, 6 months and 12
      months after surgery sports medical measurements have been performed. Strength abilities of
      the hip muscles were tested with isokinetic dynamometry, postural control with a force
      measuring platform and endurance via lactate measurements.

      In Germany, rehabilitation sport (RS) is a reimbursed postoperative measure in order to
      support socio-professional reintegration and self-help.

      160 patients who received a primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) were included and randomized
      to receive specific RS or not (control) in addition to a conventional rehabilitation program.
      Upon completion of the rehabilitation phase 6 weeks, 6 months and 12 months after surgery
      sports medical measurements have been performed. Strength abilities of the hip muscles were
      tested with isokinetic dynamometry, postural control with a force measuring platform and
      endurance via lactate measurements. The goal of the study was to prospectively randomized
      evaluate the effect of RS on hip-related muscular strength, endurance and postural stability
      on patients who underwent THA.
