  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PROTECT-ICD trial is a physician-led, multi-centre randomised controlled trial targeting
      prevention of sudden cardiac death in patients who have poor cardiac function following a
      myocardial infarct (MI). The trial aims to assess the role of electrophysiology study (EPS)
      in guiding implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation, in patients early
      following MI (first 40 days). The secondary aim is to assess the utility of cardiac MRI (CMR)
      in analysing cardiac function and viability as well as predicting inducible and spontaneous
      ventricular tachyarrhythmia when performed early post MI.

      Following a MI patients are at high risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD). The risk is highest
      in the first 40 days; however, current guidelines exclude patients from receiving an ICD
      during this time. This limitation is based largely on a single study, The Defibrillator in
      Acute Myocardial Infarction Trial (DINAMIT), which failed to demonstrate a benefit of early
      ICD implantation. However, this study was underpowered and used non-invasive tests to
      identify patients at high risk. EPS identifies patients with the substrate for re-entrant
      tachyarrhythmia, and has been found in multiple studies to predict patients at risk of SCD.
      Contrast-enhanced CMR is a non-invasive test without radiation exposure which can be used to
      assess left ventricular function. In addition, it provides information on myocardial
      viability, scar size and tissue heterogeneity. It has an emerging role as a predictor of
      mortality and spontaneous ventricular arrhythmia in patients with a previous MI.

      A total of 1,058 patients who are at high risk of SCD based on poor cardiac function (left
      ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤40%) following a ST-elevation or non-STE myocardial
      infarct will be enrolled in the trial. Patients will be randomised 1:1 to either the
      intervention or control arm.

      In the intervention arm all patients undergo early EPS. Patients with a positive study
      (inducible ventricular tachycardia cycle length ≥200ms) receive an ICD, while patients with a
      negative study (inducible ventricular fibrillation or no inducible VT) are discharged without
      an ICD, regardless of the LVEF.

      In the control arm patients are treated according to standard local practice. This involves
      early discharge and repeat assessment of cardiac function after 40 days or after 90 days
      following revascularisation (PCI or CABG). ICD implantation after 40 days according to
      current guidelines (LVEF≤30%, or ≤35% with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II/III
      symptoms) could be considered, if part of local standard practice, however the ICD is not
      funded by the trial.

      A proportion of trial patients from both the intervention and control arms at &gt;48 hours
      following MI will undergo CMR to enable correlation with (1) inducible VT at EPS and (2) SCD
      and non-fatal arrhythmia on follow up. It will be used to simultaneously assess left
      ventricular function, ventricular strain, myocardial infarction size, and peri-infarction
      injury. The size of the infarct core, infarct gray zone (as a measure of tissue
      heterogeneity) and total infarct size will be quantified for each patient.

      All patients will be followed for 2 years with a combined primary endpoint of non-fatal
      arrhythmia and SCD. Non-fatal arrhythmia includes resuscitated cardiac arrest, sustained
      ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF) in participants without an
      ICD. Secondary endpoints will include all-cause mortality, non-sudden cardiovascular death,
      non-fatal repeat MI, heart failure and inappropriate ICD denial. Secondary endpoints for CMR
      correlation will include (1) the presence or absence of inducible VT at EP study, and (2)
      combined endpoint of appropriate ICD activation or SCD at follow up.

      It is anticipated that the intervention arm will reduce the primary endpoint as a result of
      prevention of a) early sudden cardiac deaths/cardiac arrest, and b) sudden cardiac
      death/cardiac arrest in patients with a LVEF of 31-40%. It is expected that the 2-year
      primary endpoint rate will be reduced from 6.7% in the control arm to 2.8% in the
      intervention arm with a relative risk reduction (RRR) of 68%. A two-group chi-squared test
      with a 0.05 two-sided significance level will have 80% power to detect the difference between
      a Group 1 proportion of 0.028 experiencing the primary endpoint and a Group 2 proportion of
      0.067 experiencing the primary endpoint when the sample size in each group is 470. Assuming
      1% crossover and 10% loss to follow up the required sample size is 1,058 (n=529 patients per
      arm). To test the hypothesis that tissue heterogeneity at CMR predicts both inducible and
      spontaneous ventricular tachyarrhythmias will require a sample size of 400 patients to
      undergo CMR.

      It is anticipated that the use of EPS will select a group of patients who will benefit from
      an ICD soon after a MI. This has the potential to change clinical guidelines and save a large
      number of lives.

    <description>Cause of death will be determined based on information obtained from witnesses, family members, death certificates, hospital records and autopsy or coroner reports. Sudden cardiac death will be explicitly defined as death that occurs &quot;suddenly and unexpectedly&quot; in a patient in otherwise stable condition and includes witnessed instantaneous deaths (with or without documentation of arrhythmia), unwitnessed deaths if the patient had been seen within 24 hours before death (in the absence of another clear cause of death), deaths caused by incessant ventricular tachyarrhythmia, deaths considered a sequel of cardiac arrest and deaths resulting from pro-arrhythmia of anti-arrhythmic drugs.31 The remainder of deaths will be classified as either non-sudden cardiovascular death, or non-cardiovascular death. Operative deaths associated with the implantation of an ICD will be counted as non-sudden cardiovascular death.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Non-fatal arrhythmia</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years after randomisation</time_frame>
    <description>Non-fatal arrhythmia includes resuscitated cardiac arrest, sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF) in participants without an ICD. Resuscitated cardiac arrest is defined as a sudden circulatory arrest requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) (with or without documented arrhythmia) from which the patient regains consciousness. VT and VF are defined as ECG or telemetry-documented ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. Only sustained ventricular tachycardia will be included (greater than 30 seconds of VT) or if the VT required emergency treatment with anti-arrhythmic medications or electrical cardioversion.</description>

    <description>EPS will be performed in all patients in the intervention arm with programmed ventricular stimulation with a drive train of 8 beats at 400 ms with up to 4 extrastimuli and stimulation from the right ventricular apex with current delivered at twice pacing threshold. The end point for stimulation will be sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) lasting &gt; 10 seconds. If sustained monomorphic VT with cycle length (CL) ≥200ms is induced by ≤4 extra stimuli the EPS result will be considered positive for inducible VT.30 Ventricular fibrillation or flutter with CL&lt;200ms will be considered a negative result. The Programmed Ventricular Stimulation (PVS) induction will be repeated a second time if the initial induction was negative for VT.</description>
