  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, single blind, controlled trial. Aim to compare the effectiveness
      (especially the absorption degree of the synovial effusion measured by B ultrasonic) of the
      treatment group with the control group. The treatment group was given Xiao zhong fang
      granules orally and short wave infrared radiation and the control group was given the placebo
      Xiao zhong fang granules orally and short wave infrared radiation. To evaluate the clinical
      efficacy of the Chinese medicine in the treatment of the synovial effusion of knee
      osteoarthritis.
