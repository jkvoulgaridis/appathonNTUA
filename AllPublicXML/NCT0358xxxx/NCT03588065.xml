      INTRODUCTION. Health education based on interventions with new information and communication
      technologies.

      OBJECTIVE. To compare the effectiveness of an educational physiotherapy intervention in
      footballers, in face-to-face mode (conference) versus an intervention mediated by ICT, on the
      risk of medical injury with the Functional Movement Screen [FMS].

      MATERIAL AND METHODS. A randomized clinical trial (RCT) was carried out. The population
      consisted of 100 participants divided into two groups (ICT n = 50) and (Conference n = 50),
      with an average age of 18.2 versus 18.3 years for a conference. and ICT respectively.

      Recruitment phase: In this phase the athletes were contacted to explain the objectives of the
      study and the interventions; those who agreed to participate filled out the questionnaire to
      verify the inclusion and exclusion criteria, later those who met the criteria gave written
      informed consent. This phase was held in a week in the sports team club Initial evaluation
      phase: In this phase, the contact form and the general characteristics of the population were
      filled out and the initial evaluation of knowledge about sports injuries was done in all the
      participants of the investigation. Likewise, the participants were assigned to each of the
      two interventions at random. For the random assignment, the Excel 2010® program was used,
      where random numbers were assigned to the sampling frame.

      Intervention phase: The educational intervention in health was developed from physiotherapy
      in each of the groups (conference or mediated by ICT) according to the allocation group as
      explained below.

      Final evaluation phase: The final evaluation of knowledge about the prevention of injuries in
      football was made to both groups of the investigation.

    <intervention_model_description>For the process of imparting health education strategies in face-to-face (conference) and ICT-mediated mode, a 4-week time was estimated where 4 educational sessions were held at a rate of one each week, lasting about 40 minutes, for part of two physiotherapists experts in the theme of injury prevention around the conceptual elements of human body movement, warm-up phases, postural hygiene, sports hygiene, nutrition and clothing. Interventions were carried out simultaneously in both groups of the study, so that one researcher taught the lecture modality in person (conference group), and the other supervised the participants while using the computers of the sports training institution.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>A total of 17 questions were established, divided into seven categories of knowledge on the prevention of injuries, which should be addressed in the health education plan from Physiotherapy. The score was calculated as follows: each question answered correctly with the option of YES and NO had a point, the sum of the correct questions was made and divided by the number of questions. Using a rule of three this score was converted to a scale of 0 to 100.</description>

If the athlete performs the movement with one or more compensations or with a difficulty to receive a score of 2. If the athlete is unable to reproduce the requested movement, receive a score of 1. If during the performance of the test the athlete presents pain, receive a score of zero and should be referred to a specialist. The maximum score for the sum of all movements is 21.</description>
