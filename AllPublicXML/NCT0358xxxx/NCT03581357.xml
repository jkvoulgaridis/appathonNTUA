      Evaluate the impact and satisfaction of Mobile Mindfulness Meditation on anxiety, pain,
      fatigue, trauma, and sleep in cancer survivors.

      Through previous research, mindfulness meditation has been linked to decreases in anxiety,
      increased pain tolerance, better mood, and improved quality of life, in both healthy and
      medical populations. Although mindfulness meditation is well promoted both clinically and in
      the media, finding ways to promote engagement in and fidelity to the intervention, in a
      format that is accessible for cancer survivors is crucial, as the availability of resources
      and appreciation of the benefits does not necessarily lead to behavior change.

      With many more people surviving cancer than in previous decades, there is an opportunity to
      act on the residual effects of cancer diagnosis and treatment, and with the prevalence of
      technology ever increasing, online and mobile interventions have become more frequently
      delivered and have a particular utility for this population. Physical and geographic
      limitations could prevention cancer survivors from accessing psychosocial interventions.
      Whether the repeated beneficial findings of face-to-face training in mindfulness meditation
      will be found in a mobile environment is an open and timely question.

    <measure>Evaluate the impact of Mobile Mindful Meditation on anxiety as measured with the GAD-7</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Anxiety will be measured with the GAD-7, which entails respondents indicating how much in the past week they experienced anxiety. Participants are asked to provide their responses on a 5-point Likert type scale, with options ranging from &quot;never&quot; to &quot;always.&quot;</description>

    <measure>Evaluate the impact of Mobile Mindful Meditation on pain as measured with the PEG-3</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Pain will be measured with the PEG-3, a three item measure assessing pain intensity, interference with general activity, and interference with enjoyment of life, with response options ranging from a 0-10 scale (0 being &quot;no pain&quot; or &quot;does not interfere&quot; and 10 being &quot;pains as bad as you can imagine&quot; or &quot;completely interferes&quot;).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluate the impact of Mobile Mindful Meditation on fatigue as measured with the Brief Fatigue Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Fatigue will be measured with the Brief Fatigue Inventory, a 9-item measure where respondents are asked to rate their fatigue on an 11-point scale, with options on three items ranging from either &quot;no fatigue&quot; to &quot;as bad as you can imagine&quot; and options on the remaining items ranging from &quot;does not interfere&quot; to &quot;completely interferes&quot;</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluate the impact of Mobile Mindful Meditation on trauma as measured with the PCL-5</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Trauma Symptoms will be measured with the PCL-5. This 20-item measure assess for the 20 DSM-5 symptoms of PTSD, which fit into the larger categories of intrusive and avoidant symptoms.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluate the impact of Mobile Mindful Meditation on sleep as measured by the PROMIS sleep scale</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep will be measured by the PROMIS sleep scale, an 8-item measure, with 5-point response choices.</description>

    <measure>Evaluate the satisfaction with Mobile Mindful Meditation as measured by questionnaires on the Online Mindful Meditation platforms</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patient self-reporting through the Mobile Mindful Meditation platform will measure satisfaction. Successfully completing the 8-week program will also be an indirect measure of patient satisfaction.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Subjects assigned to this arm will receive mindfulness meditation instructions for 8 consecutive weeks following randomization to this arm. The mobile app contains 14 sessions that subject can participate in at their own pace. Subjects are asked to try and practice mindfulness meditation daily, for a total time of 2 hours per week. Subjects assigned to this arm will complete a questionnaire at three times points: the beginning after the subject has signed the informed consent form, at the 8 week and 16 week time points.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Subjects assigned to this arm will not be offered access to the mobile app during the first 8 weeks of their participation. Subjects will be asked to begin using the app eight weeks after randomization. Subjects assigned to this arm will complete a questionnaire at three times points: the beginning after the subject has signed the informed consent form, at the 8 week time point (just before subject begins using the mobile app) and 16 week time point.</description>

    <description>It is hypothesized that participants who are randomized in the app condition will have significantly less anxiety, pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbance than their counterparts in the control condition.</description>
