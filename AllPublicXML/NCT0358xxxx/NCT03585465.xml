      The study is a two-stage trial:

        1. First stage : Phase I feasibility trial to evaluate the safety of the combination of
           Nivolumab + metronomic chemotherapy considering three possible metronomic chemotherapy
           regimens

        2. Second stage: Phase II randomized controlled balanced 1:1 open- label trial comparing
           the efficacy of the metronomic chemotherapy regimen selected at the end of the previous
           stage, with or without nivolumab.

      1. First stage :

             -  Arm A: Nivolumab + Cyclophosphamide-Vinblastine

             -  Arm B: Nivolumab + Capecitabin

             -  Arm C: Nivolumab + Cyclophosphamide-Vinblastine + Capecitabin Arm A and Arm B will
                be initially allocated sequentially (A/B/A/B/A/B). Arm C will be opened, if arm A
                and Arm B are deemed safe. In each arm, the second patient will not be recruited
                before the first patient has been observed for a 28-day duration.

        2. Second stage will start after a meeting of IDMC Randomization will be balanced 1:1,
           controlling for histological type (HGG-Midline diffuse glioma / Lymphoma / Other) and
           treating center, using a dynamic allocation of treatment (minimization program) with a
           random factor set at 0.8.

             deficiency can't be precisely defined, it is known that patients carrying some
             homozygous or heterozygous mutations of DPYD responsible for the complete or almost
             complete absence of enzymatic activity of DPD, are exposed to a maximum risk of
             life-threatening or fatal toxicity and should not be treated with capecitabine
