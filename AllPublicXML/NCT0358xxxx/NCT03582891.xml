  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory pilot study to identify neural correlates of specific motor signs in
      Parkinson's disease (PD) and dystonia, using a novel totally implanted neural interface that
      senses brain activity as well as delivering therapeutic stimulation. Parkinson's disease and
      isolated dystonia patients will be implanted unilaterally or bilaterally with a totally
      internalized bidirectional neural interface, Medtronic Summit RC+S.

      This study includes three populations: ten PD patients undergoing deep brain stimulation in
      the subthalamic nucleus (STN), ten PD patients with a globus pallidus (GPi) target and five
      dystonia patients. All groups will test a variety of strategies for feedback-controlled deep
      brain stimulation, and all patients will undergo a blinded, small pilot clinical trial of
      closed-loop stimulation for thirty days.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this project investigators will develop adaptive DBS algorithms based on cortical and
      subcortical signals using the RC+S. This bidirectional neural interface is rechargeable (for
      up to 9 years of use), and is capable of delivering therapeutic open-loop stimulation or
      closed-loop stimulation. Its sensing capability includes four simultaneous time series
      channels at up to 1000 Hz sampling rate. In addition the device can stream time series data,
      and calculate and stream spectral power within a preset bandwidth. Twenty patients with
      idiopathic PD and motor fluctuations, or medically intractable tremor, will be implanted with
      unilateral or bilateral RC+S devices, each connected to a standard quadripolar DBS lead
      implanted in STN or globus pallidus, and to a 4-contact paddle type electrode placed
      subdurally over sensorimotor cortex. The basal ganglia lead will be used for both stimulation
      and LFP recordings, while the cortical lead will be used only for recording ECoG potentials,
      not for stimulation.

      Patients with motor fluctuations cycle between a hypokinetic state (too little movement) and
      a hyperkinetic state (excessive movement). During open-loop DBS, brain state continues to
      fluctuate between these states and stimulation may induce dyskinesia or inadequately relieve
      akinesia.

      With the goal of maintaining motor function within a normal range away from these two
      extremes, investigators will develop and test stimulation algorithms that utilize putative
      markers of both kinetic states. The basic strategy is to automatically adjust stimulation
      parameters until the physiological signature of abnormal function is minimized. First,
      investigators will prototype adaptive stimulation paradigms and briefly (2 hours) test them
      in clinic, using a &quot;distributed&quot; configuration (streaming to a computer). Then, investigators
      will embed these algorithms in RC+S to test chronic and fully closed-loop DBS in a small
      double-blinded clinical trial. Investigators will pay careful attention to the possibility of
      progressive reduction in stimulation currents over the course of the study, which could
      support the hypothesis that &quot;adaptive stimulation&quot; might make the brain progressively less
      dependent on the device. In quantifying DBS amplitude and comparing open loop with adaptive
      stimulation, an important parameter is the total electrical energy delivered (TEED). TEED is
      calculated by the following equation as suggested by Koss and colleagues (TEED1sec =
      ((voltage2 x frequency x pulsewidth)/impedance) x 1sec). This can be used as measure of the
      energy saved when stimulation is delivered in closed-loop mode relative to empiric open-loop
      stimulation.

    <masking_description>Subjects with Parkinson's disease who are being implanted in the STN will be blinded to the type of stimulation received (open-loop or closed-loop phases) during the chronic adaptive DBS testing phase (period 4) at home. Each of these subjects will have blinded open-loop or closed-loop stimulation for a total of one month.
The use of objective measures of motor function such as wearable devices, in addition physician administered rating scales, is a strategy to reduce observer bias. For physician administered scales, all exams will be videotaped so that these can be reviewed by a blinded neurologist evaluator.</masking_description>

    <description>Duration of 'on' stimulation time without dyskinesia in adaptive compared to standard open loop stimulation determined from the patients' motor diaries. The self-report motor diary is a validated method to capture this information.

Patients will complete this diary for 3 consecutive days. The total time spent in the 'on' state without troubling dyskinesia will then be summed and averaged over 3 days for all three conditions (baseline, open-loop stimulation and closed-loop stimulation).</description>
