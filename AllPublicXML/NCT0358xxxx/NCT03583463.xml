  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast Cancer (BC) is one of the most frequent cancers in women and is the most frequent
      cause of death in the female population. It represents 18% of all female cancers in the
      world.1 The incidence varies in different populations with almost half of the cases having
      their origin in North America and Western Europe. In Egypt, according to the National
      Population-Based Cancer Registry published in 2014, BC was the most frequent cancer among
      females representing 32% of all female cancers2 Metastatic disease occurs in approximately
      20-50% of patients with early BC history and in 6-10% of newly diagnosed BC cases.3 Since
      patients with metastatic BC form a heterogeneous population, treatment recommendations ought
      to be made on an individual basis, considering hormone receptor (HR) and human epidermal
      growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status, metastasis-free interval (MFI), response to and
      cumulative doses of previous therapy, location and extent of metastases and symptoms 4,5.

      Two thirds of BC patients have HR-positive (HR+) tumors 6, for whom endocrine therapy (ET) is
      the preferred initial treatment for metastatic disease as recommended in the treatment
      guidelines, even in the presence of visceral metastases 4, 6, 7. The use of ET is supported
      by data showing a therapeutic benefit with less toxicity and better quality of life in
      comparison to chemotherapy (CT) 5,8,9. Nevertheless, it is generally thought that CT is
      associated with greater and earlier tumor response, especially in the case of high burden of
      disease. For patients with hormone receptor-positive and HER2+ disease CT plus HER2-targeted
      therapy was strongly recommended, except for highly selected cases for whom clinicians may
      offer ET 10. On the contrary, for women with hormone receptor-positive HER2-negative disease
      who are the scope of this study the question of whether to use CT or ET as first-line
      treatment for metastatic BC remains, to date, partially unresolved.

        Postmenopausal women with ER positive, HER-2 negative locally advanced/ metastatic breast
        cancer, who either progressed during or after adjuvant endocrine therapy for early breast
        cancer or those presenting with de novo metastatic disease who had not received prior
        endocrine therapy. Patients should have already been prescribed first line treatment for
        their locally advanced/ metastatic breast cancer as per routine clinical practice prior to
        their enrolment in the study. Their participation in the study should in no way impact the
        treatment and care that they receive.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Provision of written informed consent prior to any study specific procedures

          2. Post-menopausal women (Defined as a woman who have experienced at least 12 consecutive
             months without menstruation, who had undergone bilateral ovariectomy or who has
             menopausal levels of serum Estradiol and FSH.)

          3. Hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer.

          4. Patients with either de novo metastatic disease who had not received any prior
             treatment or those who progressed during or after previous adjuvant endocrine

             or a relapse after/within 12 months of completing adjuvant ET. Patients with ER+ de
             novo metastatic disease are also considered hormone sensitive patients)

          6. Patients have already been prescribed treatment with ET either as monotherapy or in
             combination or physician's choice of a standard of care chemotherapy within the
