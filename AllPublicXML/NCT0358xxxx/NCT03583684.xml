  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a very heterogeneous disorder with limited empirically
      validated behavioral and biological interventions. The goal of this pilot investigation is to
      apply a biologically-based approach to identify predictors of treatment response in children
      with ASD who are receiving Pivotal Response Treatment (PRT), an evidence-based behavioral
      intervention. Specifically, the investigators propose to identify neuroimaging biomarkers of
      treatment response to a PRT program (PRT-P) targeting language deficits in young children
      with ASD who will be randomized to either PRT-P or to a delayed treatment group (DTG).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Spectrum Disorder (ASD) based on clinical interview and
             Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 5th edition (DSM-5) and confirmed using the Autism
             Diagnostic Interview Revised (ADI-R) and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule
             (ADOS),

          -  Outpatients between 2.0 and 4.11 years of age of either gender,

          -  Children of all cognitive levels will be included as long as they are able to
             participate in the testing procedures to the extent that valid standard scores can be
             obtained

          -  Language delay as measured by the Preschool Language Scale, 5th Edition (PLS-5) [at
             least 1 standard deviation behind for children age 2 and 3 years; and 2 standard
             deviations behind for children age 4],

             speech therapy, and school placement for at least 1 month prior to baseline
             measurements with no expected changes during study participation,

          -  No more than 60 minutes of 1:1 speech therapy per week,

          -  The child's exposure to the English language must be sufficient that administration of
             standardized tests in English is appropriate for measuring progress,

          -  The availability of at least one parent who can consistently participate in the
