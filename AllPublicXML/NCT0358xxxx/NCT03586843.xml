  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the relative bioavailability of JNJ-64565111 between
      subcutaneous (SC) administrations in the upper arm versus the abdomen, and between SC
      administrations in the thigh versus the abdomen in otherwise healthy overweight/obese
      participants (Part A) and to assess the gastrointestinal tolerability of JNJ-64565111
      following a dose titration in otherwise healthy obese participants at 6 weeks (Part B).
