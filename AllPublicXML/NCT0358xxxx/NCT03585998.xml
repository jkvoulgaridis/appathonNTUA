  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm Phase II study, in which 4 cycles of chemotherapy (Etoposide and
      Cisplatin) and durvalumab with thoracic radiotherapy (52.2Gy, 2.1Gy/Fx) start at the 3rd
      cycle of chemotherapy and durvalumab for limited disease-small cell lung cancer. Four weeks
      after completion of concurrent chemoradiation therapy, patients will receive durvalumab
      consolidation monotherapy every 4 weeks until progression of disease or unacceptable toxicity
      up to the maximum duration of 2 years since enrollment.

             with a past or resolved HBV infection (defined as the presence of hepatitis B core
             antibody [anti-HBc] and absence of HBsAg) are eligible. Patients positive for
             hepatitis C (HCV) antibody are eligible only if polymerase chain reaction is negative

             reproductive potential who are not willing to employ effective birth control from
