  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, 2-arm, patient-randomized study evaluating the feasibility and
      potential efficacy of the PRIMER intervention in improving physical function and reducing
      frailty in adult Liver Transplant candidates. The intervention will consist of a
      patient-tailored prehabilitation program designed to reduce frailty, improve physical
      function and nutritional status, and optimize pre- and post-transplant outcomes.

      The investigator will pilot-test a two-arm, randomized trial of a prehabilitation
      intervention in 38 pre-liver transplant patients with End Stage Liver Disease (ESLD). The
      investigator estimates an attrition rate of 20%, resulting n=30 participants; 10 participants
      in Arm 1 (control arm) and 20 participants in Arm 2 (intervention arm). To be eligible,
      patients must be waitlisted or &quot;Penn-Ready&quot; with a MELD-Na less than or equal to 25,
      English-speaking, able to safely participant in an exercise program, have a smartphone, and
      be identified as frail. The purpose of this trial is to develop and implement a program of
      medical optimization, physical activity, and nutrition recommendations specifically tailored
      to ESLD and designed to reduce frailty, improve physical function, and optimize pre- and
      post-transplant outcomes.

    <measure>Performance on the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB)</measure>
    <time_frame>14 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The SPPB is a simple test to measure lower extremity function using tasks that mimic daily activities. The SPPB examines three areas of lower extremity function; static balance, gait speed, and getting in and out of a chair. Static balance is measured in units of time (seconds) and patients are timed holding 3 different stances. Gait speed is measured in time (seconds) to walk 4 meters. Chair sits are measured as the time (seconds) it takes to get up and out of a chair 5 times without using one's arms to assist the exercise. Collectively, the three tests are used to generate a total score (0-12) that reflects a patient's frailty (score of 0) or lack of frailty (score of 12).</description>

    <time_frame>14 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Body Mass Index (BMI) will be calculated using height in inches and weight in pounds and reported as 'kg/m^2'. Grip strength will be compared to BMI and a 'BMI-adjusted' grip strength level will be reported using established 'kilogram to BMI ratio' standards.</description>

    <description>Bioelectrical impedance analysis will be completed using the Bodystat Quadscan 4000, which is a multi-frequency body composition analyzer. Body fat percentage (%) will be compared to lean body mass percentage and total body water percentage to assess sarcopenia and nutritional status.</description>
