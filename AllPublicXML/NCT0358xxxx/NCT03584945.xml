  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess the function and structure of
      overlapping task control circuits in children with a range of Obsessive-Compulsive symptoms
      (OCS). The functioning of task control circuits will be assessed using the well-validated
      Multisource interference task (MSIT). This study will also assess functional and anatomical
      connectivity within task control circuits in the same children, and determine whether
      disturbances in these overlapping circuits are associated with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder
      (OCD) symptom severity. Behavioral measures will be administered to further assess
      regulatory, learning and memory functions. Children with OCD will then be offered a standard
      course of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) before rescanning (along with age-and
      gender-matched control participants) in order to assess how these circuits may change with
      treatment. Children with subclinical OC symptoms will be offered referral for treatment on an
      as-needed basis. In addition, de-identified data may be used in the future to conduct
      secondary data analyses. As more about OC symptoms and neurobiological mechanisms of interest
      in the current study are understood, data may be used to answer questions beyond those
      described in this protocol. All study procedures will be conducted on-site at Columbia
      University/the New York State Psychiatric Institute (New York, NY) and the University of
      Michigan's outpatient Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (Ann Arbor, Michigan).

    <description>The treatment team will offer a course of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) (45 minute sessions for 12 to 16 weeks), augmented by medication treatment when clinically indicated based on the clinical treatment standards. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is a treatment based on learning and cognitive theories. CBT for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) involves gradually exposing patients to anxiety provoking stimuli while having patients refrain from engaging in compulsive rituals and/or avoidance behaviors. There are three major components of CBT treatment for OCD, specifically: (1) exposure to anxiety provoking stimuli, (2) response prevention, and (3) cognitive techniques intended to decrease anxiety during the exposure and response prevention processes.</description>
