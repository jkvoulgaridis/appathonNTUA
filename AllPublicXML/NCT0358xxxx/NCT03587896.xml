      This study evaluates the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the SH+ in Arabic speaking
      people including Syrians under the temporary protection of Republic of Turkey and other
      Arabic speaking immigrants and asylum seekers with psychological distress in Turkey. Half of
      participants will receive Self Help Plus (SH+), while the other half will receive enhanced
      treatment as usual.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Since the start of the war in Syria in 2011, more than 5 million Syrians had to
      take refuge in a safer place and they had chosen neighbouring countries including Turkey,
      Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and countries in Africa including Egypt and North Africa. As a
      consequence of several adversities, refugees are at great risk of developing symptoms of
      common mental disorders, notably posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety
      and related somatic health symptoms along with other forms of disabling psychological
      distress. The World Health Organization (WHO) has developed a new low-intensity 5-session
      self-help intervention called Self-Help Plus (SH+) in order to manage stress and cope with
      adversity (Epping-Jordan et al., 2016). SH+ is a brief and trans-diagnostic intervention
      which may be delivered by trained non-specialists facilitators to people with and without
      mental disorders. SH+ has been evaluated in RCTs in low and middle income countries.

      Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the Self Help Plus in
      Arabic speaking people including Syrians under the temporary protection of Republic of Turkey
      and other Arabic speaking immigrants and asylum seekers with psychological distress resettled
      in Turkey, as compared with enhanced treatment as usual (ETAU). The primary outcome is the
      reduction in the incidence of any mental disorders. Secondary outcomes are mental health
      symptoms, psychological functioning, well-being, drop-out rates, and economic outcomes.

      Design: This is a parallel-group randomized controlled trial, in which participants will have
      an equal probability (1:1) of being randomly allocated to the SH+ intervention or the ETAU.

      Methodology: Refugees who screen positive at the General Health Questionnaire (â‰¥ 3) and
      without a formal diagnosis of any psychiatric disorders according to the M.I.N.I.
      International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.) will enter the study. After random
      allocation they will receive the 5- session SH+ or the ETAU. Assessments will be performed by
      masked members of the research team immediately after intervention, at 6 months (primary
      outcome), and a 12 months after randomization.

      Time frame: The recruitment phase will last 12 months. After the screening, eligible
      participants will be assessed at baseline before randomization, immediately
      post-intervention, and at 6- and 12-month follow-up. The SH+ intervention delivery will be
      conducted in around 5 weeks (1 session per week).

      Expected outcomes: The expected outcomes are a reduction in the incidence of psychiatric
      diagnoses at 6-month follow-up, and a general improvement in mental health symptoms,
      psychological functioning, well-being, and economic outcomes at each assessment, in refugees
      in the SH+ intervention arm, as compared to ETAU.

    <description>The primary outcome will be the number of participants with a current psychiatric diagnosis 6 at six-month follow-up, as measured by the M.I.N.I. The M.I.N.I. was designed as a brief structured interview for the major psychiatric disorders (i.e., major depressive disorder, suicide behavior disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, social anxiety disorder, etc.) in DSM-5 and ICD-10. The M.I.N.I. is divided into modules identified by letters, each corresponding to a diagnostic category. At the beginning of each module (except for psychotic disorders module), screening question(s) corresponding to the main criteria of the disorder are presented in a gray box. At the end of each module, diagnostic box(es) permit(s) the health care professional to indicate whether the diagnostic criteria are met.</description>

    <description>Psychological distress will be measured through the General Health Questionnaire-12. The questionnaire asks whether the respondent has experienced a particular symptom or behaviour recently. Each item is rated on a four-point Likert scale (less than usual, no more than usual, rather more than usual, or much more than usual); and gives a total score of 36 or 12 based on the GHQ version and on the selected scoring methods. Higher scores indicate higher levels of mental distress.</description>

    <description>The WHO Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 (WHODAS 2.0) is a generic assessment instrument assessing health and disability. It is used across all diseases, including mental, neurological and substance use disorders. It is simple to administer and applicable across cultures. WHODAS covers six domains (cognition, mobility, self-care, getting along, life activities, and participation). It assesses difficulties people have across these domains during the last 30 days. Difficulties are scored as none, mild, moderate, severe, or extreme. Higher scores indicate higher levels of disability. In the current study, 12-item interviewer-administered version will be used. Data on socio-demographic information (sex, age, education, marital status and work status) will be collected through questions A1-A5 of the WHODAS 2.0, which will be administered first.</description>

    <description>Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). The PHQ-9 is a 9-item instrument measuring the presence and severity of depression. Major depression is diagnosed if five or more of the nine depressive symptom criteria have been present at least &quot;more than half the days&quot; in the past two weeks, and one of the symptoms includes depressed mood or anhedonia. Other types of depression are diagnosed if two, three, or four depressive symptoms have been present at least &quot;more than half the days&quot; in the past two weeks, and one of the symptoms includes depressed mood or anhedonia. As a severity measure, the PHQ-9 score may range from 0 to 27, since each of the nine items can be scored from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). Higher scores indicate worse symptomatology. The PHQ has been validated for a wide range of cultural groups.</description>

    <description>WHO-5 Wellbeing index. The WHO-5 Wellbeing Index is a 5-item questionnaire measuring current psychological wellbeing and quality of life, rather than psychopathology. Each of the items is rated on a 6-point Likert scale from 0 (= not present) to 5 (= constantly present). Scores are summed up and raw scores range from 0 to 25. Then the raw scores are multiplied by 4 and transformed to 0-100. Higher scores indicate better well-being.The scale has demonstrated sensitivity to change in wellbeing and is available in numerous languages.</description>

    <description>The Psychological Outcome Profiles instrument (PSYCHLOPS) consists of four questions. It contains three domains: problems (2 questions), function (1 question) and wellbeing (1 question). Participants are asked to give free text responses to the problem and function domains. Responses are scored on an ordinal six-point scale ranging from zero to five, producing a maximum score of 20. Lower scores indicate a better outcome.</description>

    <description>PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5). The PCL-5 is a 20-item self-report measure that assesses the 20 DSM-5 symptoms of PTSD. It takes approximately 5-10 minutes to complete. The PCL-5 can be scored in different ways: (a) a total symptom severity score (range - 0-80) can be obtained by summing the scores for each of the 20 items; (b) DSM-5 symptom cluster severity scores can be obtained by summing the scores for the items within a given cluster; (c) a provisional PTSD diagnosis can be made by treating each item rated as 2 = &quot;moderately&quot; or higher as a symptom endorsed, then following the DSM-5 diagnostic rule which requires at least: 1 B item (questions 1-5), 1 C item (questions 6-7), 2 D items (questions 8-14), 2 E items (questions 15-20). Higher scores indicate worse symptomatology. An adapted version making reference to the past week instead of the past month will be used in the current study for sensitivity reasons.</description>

    <description>The EuroQol-5 Dimension-3 level version (EQ-5D-3L). The EQ-5D-3L is applicable to a wide range of health conditions and treatments, it provides a simple descriptive profile and a single index value for health status that can be used in the clinical and economic evaluation of health care as well as in population health surveys.The EQ-5D-3L descriptive system comprises the following five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 3 levels: no problems, some problems, and extreme problems. The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results into a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state.</description>
