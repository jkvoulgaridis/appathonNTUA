      Serum blood samples will be collected to measure markers of bone turnover and to perform a
      serum TGF-β assay. Samples will be collected at baseline and within 14 days of day 168 of
      aromatase inhibitor (AI) treatment

      Skeletal muscle tissue will be collected and used to compare relative calstabin1 to RyR1 and
      RyR1 oxidation before and after exposure to aromatase inhibitor (AI) treatment. One sample
      will be stored for future research relating to aromatase inhibitor-induced muscle weakness
      including proteomic research. Four core needle samples will be taken from the quadriceps
      muscle at baseline and within 14 days of day 168 of AI treatment.

             heart failure, uncontrolled angina, myocardial infarction in the prior 12 months,
             orthopedic surgery in the previous 6 months or plans for orthopedic surgery during the
             study period, chronic uncontrolled pulmonary conditions such as uncontrolled asthma
             (symptoms &gt; 2 days/week) or dyspnea requiring oxygen, symptomatic peripheral vascular
             disease, or any other comorbidity that would interfere with the ability to complete
