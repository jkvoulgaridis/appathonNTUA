    <textblock>
      This pilot phase II trial studies how well vitamin B6 works in reducing hot flashes in
      participants with prostate cancer undergoing antiandrogen therapy. A nutritional supplement
      such as vitamin B6 may help improve hot flashes caused by antiandrogen therapy in
      participants with prostate cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the effect of Vitamin B6 in improves the frequency or severity of hot flashes
      in prostate cancer patients receiving antiandrogen therapy (androgen deprivation therapy
      [ADT]).

    <time_frame>Baseline to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>For the primary analysis, the difference in the median response to the 10-point hot flash scale between 8-week post-treatment and pre-treatment responses will be computed with the corresponding 95% percent confidence interval. The primary null hypothesis will be tested using a two-sided Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test with alpha=0.05.</description>

    <description>The same approach will be used for the secondary analysis of 12-week post-treatment responses in comparison to the pre-treatment responses.</description>
