    <textblock>
      Guided by Social Cognitive and Asset theories as well as Behavioral Economics (BE)
      principles,the proposed RCT is carefully designed to test the additive contributions of
      savings-led microfinance beyond traditional HIV risk reduction (HIVRR) alone in decreasing
      biologically confirmed STIs, including HIV, improving high risk behavioral outcomes, while
      concurrently reducing income from sex work. Working within established health care- and
      outreach-based settings, we will randomly assign 990 FSWs to one of three study arms (11 town
      centers each): (1) a control arm comprising treatment as usual (TAU) for FSWs (quarterly 2-3
      hour health education sessions, HIV testing services, and STI screening), bolstered with 4
      evidence-based sessions of HIVRR provided by local providers (n=330 ); or (2) a treatment arm
      including TAU, 4 sessions of HIVRR, combined with receipt of a matched savings account
      (HIVRR+S) to be used on short-term and/or long term consumption and skills development per a
      participant's discretion/choice (n=330); or (3) a treatment arm including TAU, 4 sessions of
      HIVRR, combined with a matched savings account for short-term and/or long term consumption
      and skills development, plus 6 sessions of financial literacy with integrated BE principles
      (e.g., delay discounting, economic utility, information salience, and loss aversion), and 8
      mentoring sessions for supportive transition to options for alternative income (HIVRR+S+FLM)
      (n=330).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Female Sex Workers (FSWs) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) have been identified as a high-risk
      group for the spread of HIV/AIDS, with those in poor areas and &quot;HIV hotspots&quot; being
      especially vulnerable. Research has shown that the primary reason poor women engage in
      commercial sex work is financial instability. Given these challenges, poor women require
      support over and above HIV prevention education. We propose to test the impact of adding
      economic empowerment (EE) components to traditional HIV risk reduction (HIVRR) to reduce new
      incidence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and of HIV among FSWs in Rakai and Masaka
      districts in Uganda. Guided by social-cognitive and asset theories, the study provides an
      avenue for FSWs to explore alternative means of safe and sustainable income to replace sex
      work. The study is informed by a previously tested microfinance (MF) intervention for FSWs in
      Mongolia, a pilot study conducted with FSWs in Masaka and Rakai, surveillance studies by
      RHSP, and EE interventions among AIDS-affected families in Uganda. Using a cluster-design we
      will randomly assign 990 FSWs from 33 matched town centers to one of three study arms (11
      town centers in each condition): (1) A control arm comprising of treatment as usual (TAU) for
      FSWs in the study area bolstered with 4 evidence-based sessions of HIVRR provided by local
      providers (n=330); or (2) A treatment arm including TAU, 4 sessions of HIVRR, combined with
      receipt of a matched savings account (HIVRR+S) to be used on short- and/or long-term
      consumption and skills development as per participants' own discretion (n=330); or (3) A
      treatment arm including TAU, 4 sessions of HIVRR, combined with a matched savings account to
      be used on short-term and/or long term consumption and skills development as per a
      participant's own discretion plus 6 sessions of financial literacy and 8 mentoring sessions
      for supportive transition to alternative income options (HIVRR+S+FLM) (n=330). This RCT
      study's aims are to: Aim1: Examine the impact of a financial savings-led MF intervention
      using HIVRR+S and HIVRR+S+FLM on HIV biological and behavioral outcomes in FSWs (Primary
      outcomes: women's cumulative incidence of biologically confirmed STIs and reported number and
      proportion of unprotected sexual acts with regular and paying partners; Secondary outcomes:
      women's rate of new HIV cases, proportion of monthly income from sex and nonsex work,
      reported number and proportion on preventive behaviors, and for HIV+ women only, viral load
      as a marker of ART adherence).

      Aim 2: Examine intervention mediation and effect modification to assess whether primary
      outcomes are mediated/moderated by participant characteristics; whether key theory-driven
      variables and Behavioral Economics measures mediate/moderate intervention outcomes.

      Aim 3: Qualitatively and quantitatively examine implementation in each study condition; Aim
      4: Assess the cost and cost-effectiveness of the HIVRR+S and HIVRR+S+FLM intervention
      compared with traditional HIVRR in terms of cumulative number of STI and HIV cases averted
      over the 24-month period.

    <description>Women in the control condition (and in the treatment arms) will receive treatment as usual (TAU) for FSW in the study area. Provided by RHSP, TAU includes: health education, HIV testing services, STI screening and treatment in a session that lasts about 2 hours, provided on a quarterly basis. This will be bolstered with 4 sessions provided twice per week for 2 weeks of an evidence-based, HIV/STI risk reduction intervention</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Women in this arm will receive TAU for FSW and the 4 HIVRR sessions (described above) and a single session following HIVRR specifically describing bank account opening, the matching process, and how to interact with banks. In this session our partnering banks will open up matched savings accounts for women in the two treatment arms. Women in both arms will save money in their matched savings accounts over a 10-month period post HIVRR. The study team will monitor the accounts using the statements received directly from the banks holding the accounts. Participants will receive monthly bank statements indicating their own savings and the associated match (1:1 match rate).</description>

    <description>This evidence-based Financial Education Core Curriculum addresses the importance of savings, banking services, budgeting debt management. Undarga adaptation for FSWs included shortening and simplifying sessions while retaining core elements; adding weekly check-ins due to safety concerns FSWs share related to intervention participation, and safety planning as needed. We will further adapt sessions in months 1-6 to assure language and illustrative examples are culturally consonant, and to infuse BE principles consistent with HIVRR. During sessions 1 &amp; 2 we will include information on delay discounting, for example, learning to understand the tendency to prefer small immediate rewards over larger available at a later time; sessions 3 &amp; 4 will include details on economic utility; sessions 5 will contain information on salience (e.g. understanding occasions when women may minimize triggers to unsafe sex); and session 6 will address loss aversion.</description>

    <description>Mentorship. Mentorship to bridge the transition from FL and savings to a vocational change is a critical component of this intervention. These sessions are intended to support the transition -equipped with financial literacy and savings -- to vocational, educational, employment or small business development training using matched savings. The mentorship sessions are adapted from the pilot study and integrate components (such as referral and linkage, coaching, exchange visits to model farmers) from income generating activities provided by our collaborating partner, RTY. All sessions include check-in and individual attention. The first 4 sessions focus on identifying options for vocational, educational, employment or business development training. The second 4 sessions include invited experts in identified areas of interest by group members for more intensive time and attention to individualized needs to make the transition.</description>

    <intervention_name>Matched savings individual development account</intervention_name>
    <description>A matched savings individual development account (hereafter IDA) is a savings account held at a local bank whereby deposits made by the woman are matched by the intervention to encourage savings and investment in skills and asset development. The accounts introduce women to financial management skills, introduce them to formal financial institutions, and by matching their deposits, incentivize women to save small amounts. Each woman will receive an IDA held in her own name. Women will be allowed and indeed encouraged to contribute up to 50,000 shillings (~15 USD) per month towards their IDAs. The maximum amount of women's contribution to be matched will be an equivalent of US$15 per month for 10 months. During the intervention, monthly account statements will be generated for women to note their accumulated savings. During the intervention, women will have direct access to both their personal savings deposited in the accounts and the match provided by the study.</description>
