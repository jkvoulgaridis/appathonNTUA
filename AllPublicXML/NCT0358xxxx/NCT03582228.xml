    <textblock>
      The Bridging Recovery Allies in Virtual Environments (BRAVE) study aims to evaluate the
      acceptability and feasibility of implementing a virtual environment (VE) social support group
      for social communication training among adults with traumatic brain injury (TBI).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  subjects with a traumatic brain injury

          -  between the age of 18 and 80

          -  living in the community

          -  able to read and speak English,

          -  have access to a computer meeting minimum specifications for the Learning in Virtual
             Environments (LIVE) platform (requires Windows)

          -  have broadband Internet connection,

          -  achieve a Galveston Orientation Assessment Test (GOAT) score &gt;75 to ensure appropriate
             levels of cognition for the study

          -  and score &gt;93.8 on the Western Battery Aphasia-Revised (WAB-R) scale to indicate
             sufficient communicative abilities to participate in a social support group and exit
             interview group.

          -  able to understand and independently consent for the study and provide written consent
             prior to enrollment in the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

        - verbal communication impairments will be excluded as measured by the WAB-R, as this study
        intends to focus on persons with social communication deficits rather than verbal deficits.
