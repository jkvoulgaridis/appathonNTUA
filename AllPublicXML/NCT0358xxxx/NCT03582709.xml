  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prospective cohort study is set up to address research questions dealing with sedentary
      lifestyle-related events mainly including cognition and cardiovascular-related disease in
      children .Participants aged 7-12 years old from five primary schools in Guangzhou,Guangdong
      province will be recruited and followed up to evaluate the risk factors of cognition and
      cardiovascular-related disease. Objective measurements combined with questionnaire-data-based
      information on a wide range of lifestyle factors and cognition were applied in this study.

      There are three stages in this project.At first stage,information about socio-demographic,
      psychological status, physical activity,sleep and diet were collected by a multi-components
      questionnaire survey.The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire(SDQ) and Behavior Rating
      Inventory of Executive Function(BRIEF) were conducted at the same time. Anthropometric
      measurement including height, weight, waist and hip circumferences, blood pressure and fat
      mass were conducted.Besides,blood samples were collected to measure total cholesterol,
      triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C).

      At second stage,participants were classified for 4 subgroups as follows: Low active-high
      sedentary;low active-low sedentary; high active-high sedentary;high active-low sedentary by
      different sedentary status and physical activity levels according to the international
      standard. Later cardiorespiratory fitness was assessed by the 20-m shuttle run test.
      Accelerometer GT3X+ Actigraph with physical activity log,Combined Raven's test, a series of
      psychometric paradigms were measured for further studies.

      At third stage,we will explore the related neuropsychological mechanism using the technology
      of event-related potentials (ERPs).

      About 1000 participants (7-12 years old) will be prospectively followed up. The associations
      between sedentary lifestyle and risks for cognition and cardiovascular-related disease will
      be evaluated.

    <description>Using International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short-Chinese（IPAQ-S-C）to assess the frequency and duration of activity and sedentary lifestyle（SL） in the last 7 days .Subjects with moderate activity and vigorous activity(MVPA)≥60min/day were classified into high PA subgroup while those with MVPA&lt;150min/week were classified into low PA subgroup according to the international standard.Subjects with SL≥gender-, age-specific 75% percentile were assigned to the high SL subgroup and&lt; gender-, age-specific 25% percentile were assigned to the low SL subgroup.</description>

    <description>Height was measured to the nearest millimeter and weight was measured to the nearest 0.1kg.Waist circumference(WC) was measured to the nearest millimeter at the level of 1cm above umbilicus with a steel tape. Body mass index(BMI) was calculated as body weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared (kg/m2).Human body fat mass was measured by means of the bio-impedance assay ( BIA ) .Blood pressure was recorded as systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) . Blood pressure was measured for 2 times with one-minute interval.</description>

    <description>The Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Parents(BRIEF-P) examines parents' report for the frequency of &quot;problematic&quot; behaviors that their child displayed at home during the previous 6 months. It contains 86 items (every item chooses from three dimensions &quot;No&quot;, &quot;Sometimes&quot; and &quot;Often&quot; ) within eight theoretically and empirically derived clinical scales that measure different aspects of executive functioning: Inhibit, Shift, Emotional Control, Initiate, Working Memory, Plan/Organize, Organization of Materials and Monitor, and three overarching composites (i.e. Behavioral Index [BRI, obtained Inhibit, Shift, Emotional Control], Metacognition Index [MI, obtained Initiate, Working Memory, Plan/Organize, Organization of Materials and Monitor] and Global Executive Composite [GEC]).The higher the score, the worse the executive function.</description>

    <description>Physical activity was measured using accelerometer GT3X+ Actigraph for 7 days continuously. The main measurement result was duration of physical activity. A wear time of ≥480 minutes/day was used as the criterion for a valid day, and ≥4 days (at least 3 weekdays and 1 weekend) were used as the criteria for a valid 7-day period of accumulated data.The cut-points for classify physical activity intensity levels are different, thus this will be specifically described in subsequent articles.</description>
