  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study will be to assess the effect that the application of deep trigger
      point dry needling to latent trigger points has on strength measurements. Specifically, the
      effect of deep trigger point dry needling on the strength measurements of the gluteus medius
      musculature immediately following intervention will be investigated. The author hypothesizes
      that there will be a significant difference in strength measurements of the gluteus medius
      musculature between the intervention and controls sides as well as within the intervention
      and control sides prior to and immediately following the application of deep trigger point
      dry needling. It is the authors' intention that clinicians may be able to apply the results
      of this study to generate a safe and effective treatment plan that can reduce the risk for
      trunk and lower extremity injuries within their patient population by reducing the number of
      latent trigger points within muscle tissue.

    <time_frame>Strength measurements of the gluteus medius will be recorded prior to and immediately following the application of trigger point dry needling for both the control &amp; intervention sides to determine if a significant change in muscle strength has occurred.</time_frame>
    <description>Strength of the gluteus medius musculature will be assessed for both the control and intervention sides. Strength of the gluteus medius muscle will be assessed using a hand held dynamometer which will measure peak force in kilograms. A maximal volitional isometric contraction break test will be used with the hip in two separate positions. A total of three measurements will be taken for each position and these measurements will be averaged for the hand held dynamometer readings. Both within group and between group differences in strength measurements will be compared for significance.</description>

    <description>For the purposes of this study, the term trigger point dry needling will be used to describe deep dry needling of muscle tissue. The goal of trigger point dry needling is to eliminate myofascial trigger points within muscle tissue, thereby reducing pain as well as improving motor control and function (Caramagno et al., 2015; Dommerholt et al., 2006; Shah et al., 2015). Trigger point dry needling utilizes a solid filiform needle and focuses on the penetration of a palpable myofascial trigger point at various depths. The needle is then manipulated within the tissue in an attempt to elicit a localized twitch response. Once the localized twitch response has ended, the needle is removed and another myofascial trigger point is located.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Males and females will be included in the study if they are between the ages of 18 and 50
        years and are currently asymptomatic at the time of screening and data collection.
        Asymptomatic will be defined as individuals who are currently experiencing no pain in their
        lumbar spine, sacroiliac region, pelvis, or bilateral lower extremities while at rest or
        with activity.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Participants will be excluded from the study if they have one of the following:

          -  Currently pregnant as self-reported by the participant

          -  Pain intensity greater than 0 out of 10 on the visual analogue scale in the lumbar
             spine, sacroiliac region, pelvis, and bilateral lower extremities at rest or with
             activity

          -  Positive Flexion Adduction Internal Rotation (FADIR) test on either the left or right
             hip. If the individual experiences a reproduction of his or her pain response with the
             FADIR test, which is overpressure into hip flexion, adduction, and internal rotation,
             he or she will be excluded from participation in the study

          -  Present with signs and symptoms consistent with hip osteoarthritis during clinical
             screening using the criteria proposed Altman et al. (1991) on either the left or right
             hip. Criteria is as follows: If an individual presents with pain in the hip joint with
             hip internal rotation that is measured to be less than 15 degrees as well as hip
             flexion that is measured to be less than or equal to 115 degrees, they will be
             excluded from participation in the study.

          -  Diagnosed with a progressive neurological disorder that may affect the strength of
             their lower extremities, a chronic pain condition such as fibromyalgia or myofascial
             pain syndrome, a connective tissue disorder such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, or
             osteoarthritis of the hip joint

          -  History of hip dysplasia or Legg Calve Perthes disease

        In order to continue within the study once the inclusion criteria has been met.
        Participants will be required to have at least 2 palpable latent trigger points in the
        gluteus medius muscle on the intervention sides. Individuals that do not have greater than
        2 latent trigger points on the intervention side will not be allowed to continue with the
        study. Data already collected for these participants will be destroyed.
