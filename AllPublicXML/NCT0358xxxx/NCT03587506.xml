      Although periodic limb movements are prevalent among patients with epilepsy, the exact
      relationship between these movements and epilepsy remains elusive. Objective: The aim of this
      work was to study the periodic limb movements among patients with genetic generalized
      epilepsy in relation to different clinical characteristics and seizure recurrence. Methods:
      Sixty individuals participated in this study: thirty of them were newly diagnosed with
      genetic generalized epilepsy and thirty were healthy individuals. Sleep quality was assessed
      using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire, and a standard polysomnographic study
      was conducted to all subjects. All patients then received sodium valproate in therapeutic
      doses and were followed up for six months. Electroencephalogram (EEG) was done after the
      follow-up period and seizure recurrence was assessed. Accordingly, patients were classified
      into three groups according to clinical seizure recurrence and follow-up EEG findings.

      Periodic limb movement index and frequency were compared among the patients' groups and were
      correlated with different clinical characteristics.

        Thirty patients and thirty volunteer healthy controls were recruited. Patients were newly
        diagnosed with genetic generalized epilepsy according to the ILAE 2010 criteria who did not
        previously receive AEDs. The clinical seizures were either eye-witnessed by physicians or
        video-recorded to ensure they were true epileptic seizures. Age of participants ranged from
        9 to 29 years. All patients recruited in this study had at least two unprovoked seizures
        occurring &gt;24 hours apart. Patients with pre-existing psychiatric illnesses those with
        seizures due to toxic or metabolic causes ), infections, or structural causes, and those
        using hypnotic drugs were excluded. The control subjects were healthy volunteers who were
        not related to the patients and had no family history of epilepsy.
