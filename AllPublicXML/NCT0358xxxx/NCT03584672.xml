      The aim of the study is to investigate reliability, validity, and responsiveness of the
      Static Balance Test in patients with Multiple Sclerosis.

    <textblock>
      At baseline, the Static Balance Test, Berg Balance Scale, Timed Up and Go test, Functional
      Reach Test, Four Square Step Test, and One-legged Stance Test is applied to the Multiple
      Sclerosis group. The Static Balance Test is repeated after seven days from the first
      application in patients with Multiple Sclerosis. Healthy controls are going to perform only
      the Static Balance Test.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Static Balance Test</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Static Balance Test is used to assess balance control. The Static Balance Test, consists of five posture-holding tasks (sitting, stride standing, close standing, one-foot standing on the unparalyzed leg, and one-foot standing on the paralyzed leg). Four grades, 1-4, are used to judge the ability of patients to hold these postures. The grade at which a subject is rated on a task is taken as the score for that task.
Hence, the minimum Static Balance Test score is 5, and the maximum is 20. A higher score indicates better balance.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Berg Balance Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Functional balance is assessed by using the Berg Balance Scale. During the test, participants are asked to perform 14 tasks frequently used in daily life activities. Each item is scored between 0 (unable to perform the task) and 4 (task is performed independently) according to the ability of the person while performing the task. The highest possible score is 56 points. A higher score indicates better balance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Timed Up and Go Test</measure>
    <time_frame>1 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Functional mobility is assessed by using the timed up and go test. The timed up and go test measures the time that a patient needs to stand up from a chair, walk a 3-m distance, come back and sit back on the chair. A lower score indicates better functional mobility.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Four Square Step Test</measure>
    <time_frame>1 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Four Square Step Test measures dynamic balance and clinically assesses the person's ability to step over objects forward, sideways, and backward. A square was formed by 4 canes resting flat on the floor. The participants were instructed to try and complete the sequence as fast as possible without touching the canes with both feet, making contact with the floor in each square. A lower score indicates better dynamic balance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>One-leg Stance Test</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The clinical test of One-leg Stance Test assesses postural steadiness in a static position by a quantitative measurement i.e. the number of seconds a person can maintain the One-leg Stance Test position, thus implying that better postural steadiness would allow for longer standing on one leg.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional Reach Test</measure>
    <time_frame>30 seconds</time_frame>
    <description>The Functional Reach Test assesses balance by measuring the limits while the patient reaches forwards as far as possible, having the arms in 90° flexion and without lifting the heels off the floor. A higher score indicates better limits of stability.</description>
