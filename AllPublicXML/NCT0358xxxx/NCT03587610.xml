  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In France, vaccination coverage is insufficient (in 2002, 71.2% coverage for tetanus, 41.9%
      for poliomyelitis and 33.7% for diphteria). These numbers decrease significantly with age:
      coverage for people aged over 65 was 60.5%, 13.3% and 10.5% for tetanus, poliomyelitis and
      diphteria coverage respectively.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of a hospital based vaccination
      remedial strategy for Tdap-IPV (tetanus, diphteria, pertussis and polio vaccine) in patients
      65 years of age or older.

      Secondary objectives are to measure the vaccination coverage of patients aged 65 years or
      older hospitalised in a medical ward in our hospital, to evaluate their knowledge of their
      vaccination coverage, and to evaluate the socio-demographic factors associated with
      vaccination coverage.
