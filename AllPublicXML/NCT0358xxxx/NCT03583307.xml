      To evaluate the safety and efficacy of Sirolimus in complicated vascular anomalies in Chinese

      Vascular anomalies are composed of vascular tumors and vascular malformations. The prognosis
      of vascular anomalies is significantly variable. Most of them had a benign course. However,
      complicated vascular anomalies can lead to disfigurement, organ disfunction and
      life-threatening with significant morbidity and mortality. Traditional treatments, including
      steroids, vincristine, cyclophosphamide and surgery, had limited response to complicated
      vascular anomalies. In the past few years, the inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin
      (mTOR) signaling pathway—sirolimus has emerged as a treatment for severe vascular anomalies.
      Besides, preclinical studies also showed that the Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein
      kinase B (Akt)/mTOR pathway play an important role in the development of vascular tumors and
      vascular malformations. However, the exact efficacious rate and complications of sirolimus
      are still unknow in china because of the lack of large scale of prospective studies.
      Therefore, it's important to perform this prospective study to determine the safety and
      efficacy of sirolimus in the treatment of Chinese children with complicated vascular
      anomalies, and this study will also make contributions to the diagnoses and treatments of
      vascular anomalies.

    <measure>Volumetric changes in complicated vascular anomalies to sirolimus</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Response to sirolimus treatment was measured by volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analyses, which were performed at baseline and 6 and 12 months after treatment and were independently assessed by 2 radiologists. Changes in size of vascular anomalies were classified as further growth (increase of ≥10%), no change (&lt;10% increase and &lt;10% decrease), partial involution (decrease of ≥10% and &lt;75%), nearly complete involution (decrease of ≥75% and &lt;100%), or complete involution (100%).
Photographs of the complicated vascular anomalies were taken at months 0, 3, 6 and 12 by a medical photographer.
Complete/nearly complete resolution of the vascular anomalies at month 12 compared to baseline based on the intra-patient blinded centralized independent qualitative assessments of month 12 MRI.</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life in patients by the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory TM (PedsQLTM) 4.0 Generic Core Scales.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PedsQL 4.0 Generic Core Scales encompass: 1) Physical Functioning (8 items), 2) Emotional Functioning (5 items), 3) Social Functioning (5 items), and 4) School Functioning (5 items), and were developed through focus groups and cognitive interviews. The PedsQL 4.0 Generic Core Scales are comprised of parallel child self-report (ages 5-18) and parent proxy-report formats (ages 0-18). A 5-point response scale is utilized across child self-report for ages 8 to 18 and parent proxy-report (0=never a problem; 1=almost never a problem; 2=sometimes a problem; 3=often a problem; 4=almost always a problem). For patients between ages 5-7, the response scale is simplified to a 3-point scale (0=not at all a problem; 2=sometimes a problem; 4=a lot of a problem. Items are reverse-scored and linearly transformed to a 0 to 100 scale (0=100, 1=75, 2 =50, 3=25, 4=0). Scale Scores are computed as the sum of the items divided by the number of items answered.</description>
