  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase II study is a continuation of the Phase I feasibility study where the
      investigators fully met and exceeded project aims to design, build, and test the usability
      and acceptability of an avatar-based system, the Virtual-CAMS (V-CAMS, formerly called
      CAMS-RAS), for use by suicidal ED patients and medical personnel responsible for their care.
      Phase II includes a formative phase, during which the investigators will continue conducting
      usability and acceptability tests of new features, and a summative phase to conduct a
      clinical trial. SBIR Phase II project aims include: (1) Complete development of V-CAMS,
      including readiness for electronic health record integration; (2) Cultivate and utilize the
      advisory board so that V-CAMS is positioned to meet the needs of diverse healthcare systems
      and successful conduct of the proposed research; (3) Conduct usability/acceptability tests of
      new features with target end-users (suicidal patients, including those in the ED, medical
      providers) and key stakeholders (i.e., administrators); and (4) Conduct a randomized
      controlled trial (RCT; N=90) of suicidal ED patients comparing V-CAMS (n=45) to Care-As-Usual
      (CAU; n=45). Participants will be assessed at baseline while in the ED, and again at 7, 30,
      and 90 days. The investigators predict that V-CAMS participants will report a significantly
      greater decrease in suicidal behaviors and ED/hospital admissions, as well as significantly
      greater increases in use of behavioral coping skills, self-efficacy in coping with distress,
      and perceived helpfulness of patients' ED experience.

    <measure>Change in Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 7 days, 30 days, and 90 days.</time_frame>
    <description>The Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS) is an interviewer-administered FDA-recommended tool to assess suicidal ideation and behaviors in healthcare systems. The scale has two subscales: Severity of Ideation and Suicidal Behavior. For the first subscale, answers are summed for a total ranging from 2 to 25, with higher scores indicating more intense ideation and greater risk. The Suicidal Behavior subscale consists of Yes or No questions that inquire about level of actual or potential medical damage, with greater number of &quot;yes&quot; answers indicating increased risk. It is administered to patient participants at four time-points during Phase II (summative) to assess change across time.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Suicide Cognitions Scale (SCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 7 days, 30 days, and 90 days.</time_frame>
    <description>An 18-item psychometrically sound self-report measure, the Suicide Cognitions Scale (SCS) assesses suicidal schemas. The score is found by summing the items for a total ranging from 18 to 90 with higher scores indicating worse outcomes. The scale is administered to patient participants at four time-points during Phase II (summative) to assess change over time.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 7 days, 30 days, and 90 days.</time_frame>
    <description>A nine-item self-report measure that assesses recent depressive symptoms and has excellent sensitivity (.77 to .86) and specificity (.78 to .95) in detecting major depression. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) total score is found by summing the answers and ranges from 0 to 27. Higher scores indicate more severe symptoms. It is administered to patient participants at four time-points during Phase II (summative).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Coping Skills Use</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 7 days, 30 days, and 90 days.</time_frame>
    <description>A face-valid self-report measure developed by Dr. Dimeff and used in other clinical trials to assess frequency of skills use, perceived helpfulness of skill, and self-efficacy in using them. It is administered to patient participants at four time-points during Phase II (summative).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 7 days, 30 days, and 90 days.</time_frame>
    <description>An eight-item measure frequently used in clinical trials, modified for this study to focus on patient participants' emergency department experience. The Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ) is scored by summing the individual items to produce a range of 8 to 32, with higher scores indicating greater satisfaction. It is administered to patient participants at four time-points during Phase II (summative):</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Usability Satisfaction and Acceptability Questionnaire (USAQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to one day</time_frame>
    <description>A brief face-valid, self-report measure that the PI derived from the System Usability Scale and has been successfully used in previous studies. Items are rated on a 5-point Likert Scale (1=poor; 3=good; 5=excellent). Open-ended questions are included to better understand what was most and least helpful with respect to each category and also measures users' acceptance. This scale is only administered during Phase I, formative usability and acceptability testing. It is administered directly after participants complete their interaction with the technology during their one-time participation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Provider Ratings Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 7 days, 30 days, and 90 days.</time_frame>
    <description>A face-valid self-report measure that will be adapted by the Principal Investigators to assess patient preparedness for clinical interview, patient distress, provider confidence in suicide risk assessment and helpfulness of clinical support tool. Expected date of development: February, 2019. It is administered to provider participants at four time-points during Phase II (summative).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Semi-Structured Interview</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to one day</time_frame>
    <description>A semi-structured interview to ask about and understand the user's likes, dislikes, and preferences. The semi-structured interview will be conducted for purposes of evaluating the usability of the technology rather than collecting any quantitative data for data analyses. It is administered in Phase I, formative usability and acceptability testing. Participants are asked to complete the semi-structured interview conducted by the research assistant after interacting with the technology.</description>

    <description>In Phase I (formative), all enrolled participants are asked to provide feedback on the V-CAMS prototype as it is being refined. Feedback will be gathered via survey measure and interview.
In Phase II (summative), enrolled patient participants will be randomly assigned to this arm and will be given access to the V-CAMS tools as part of their treatment in the ED. Baseline assessment surveys will be administered in the ED, and three follow up assessments after discharge at 7 days, 30 days, and 90 days.</description>

    <description>In Phase II (summative), enrolled patient participants will be randomly assigned to this arm so there is an even number of participants in the experimental condition and this condition. Those assigned to this condition will be treated as usual in the ED. Same as the experimental condition, those in the Care As Usual condition will be asked to complete baseline assessment surveys while they are waiting in the ED, and then three subsequent assessments after discharge at 7 days, 30 days, and 90 days).</description>
