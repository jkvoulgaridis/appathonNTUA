      Self-directed care (SDC) programs give people with disabilities control over public funds to
      purchase traditional behavioral health and non-traditional services in order to remain
      outside of institutional settings. The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of
      this model on participant outcomes, service costs, and user satisfaction among people with
      serious mental illness.

      Self-directed care (SDC) programs give people with disabilities control over public funds to
      purchase traditional behavioral health and non-traditional services in order to remain
      outside of institutional settings. The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of
      this model on participant outcomes, service costs, and user satisfaction among people with
      serious mental illness. Adults with serious mental illness served in the Texas public health
      system will be randomly assigned to SDC versus services as usual and assessed at baseline,
      12-month, and 24-month follow-up. Mixed effects random-regression analysis will test for
      longitudinal changes in outcomes between the two study conditions. Differences in service
      costs will be analyzed using generalized linear models with negative binomial and
      zero-inflated negative binomial distribution. Non-traditional expenditures by the SDC
      participants will be examined descriptively. Service satisfaction in both study conditions
      will be assessed at one- and two-year follow-up.

    <time_frame>Study entry (pre-intervention), 12 months later (midpoint of intervention), &amp; 24 months later (end of intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome is measured by the Recovery Assessment Scale (RAS). Recovery is a psychosocial outcome assessed via patient self-ratings on a 41-item scale using a 5-point Likert-Response format ranging from &quot;strongly disagree&quot; to &quot;strongly agree&quot;. The minimum value for the RAS is 41 and the maximum is 205, with higher scores indicating a better outcome. Dimensions of recovery include personal confidence and hope, willingness to ask for help, goal and success orientation, reliance on others, and not being dominated by one's residual psychiatric symptoms.</description>

        <title>Recovery From Mental Illness</title>
        <description>This outcome is measured by the Recovery Assessment Scale (RAS). Recovery is a psychosocial outcome assessed via patient self-ratings on a 41-item scale using a 5-point Likert-Response format ranging from &quot;strongly disagree&quot; to &quot;strongly agree&quot;. The minimum value for the RAS is 41 and the maximum is 205, with higher scores indicating a better outcome. Dimensions of recovery include personal confidence and hope, willingness to ask for help, goal and success orientation, reliance on others, and not being dominated by one's residual psychiatric symptoms.</description>

A fiscal intermediary manages financial resources to pay providers and enable the purchase of approved goods..
