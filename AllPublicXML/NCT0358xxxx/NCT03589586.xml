      This study is a multicenter, randomized, controlled, open-label trial designed to evaluate
      the safety and efficacy of DermACELL in subjects with a single target chronic venous leg
      ulcer (VLU). After eligibility is determined at a screening visit, VLU subjects will be
      entered into a 2 week run-in period of conventional wound care with moist wound therapy and
      multilayer compression bandage.

      At baseline, those continuing to meet eligibility criteria will be randomized to either
      DermACELL or conventional care wound management at a ratio of 1:1. The appropriate size of
      DermACELL will be applied to the wound of subjects in the DermACELL arm. The ADM will be
      attached with sutures, sterile adhesive strips, or bioadhesive, and covered with a dressing.
      For subjects in the conventional care wound management arm, the debrided wound will undergo a
      moist-wound therapy consisting of alginates, foams, or hydrogels, and will be covered with a
      gauze that is appropriate for the type of wound (moist or dry).

      Subsequent study visits will occur every week until 100% re-epithelialization or up to 16
      weeks after treatment (whichever comes first).
