  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This aim of the current research is to characterize the complex interaction between stress
      and cognitive workload. Furthermore, we aim to create a functional magnetic resonance imaging
      (fMRI) inspired Electroencephalogram (EEG) brain-based bio-marker for cognitive load under
      stress.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Research in the past years on stress and its influence on cognitive workload suggest that
      their relationship is not simply linear. On one hand, stress disrupts the processes of
      attention, memory and complicated decision making. While on the other hand, stress response
      allows the individual to recognize threats quickly, react accordingly, return the body to
      homeostasis, and prepare the organism to future challenges. However, it is still unclear why
      different individuals deal with cognitive workload under stress differently, and which brain
      mechanisms are underlying these processes.

      In this current research the use of non invasive imaging techniques, such as EEG and fMRI, in
      addition to physiological measurements, such as heart rate, skin conductance, and eye
      movements, will allow an objective characterization of the individual's response to cognitive
      workload under stress.

    <description>Participants will engage in demanding cognitive load computerized tasks (such as N-back and Stroop tasks). They will engage in these tasks once in a non-stressful (neutral condition), and once in a stressful condition.
Psychological stress will be induced by the following methods:
Limiting time for task completion
Providing negative feedback on participants' performance in relation to others
Presentation of sudden, loud sounds during task</description>
