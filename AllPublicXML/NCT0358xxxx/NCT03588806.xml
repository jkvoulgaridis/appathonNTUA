  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine how the use of Xtampza ER, an opioid analgesic packaged in openable
      microsphere-containing capsules, affects swallowing satisfaction, pain, and physical and
      mental health outcomes in chronic pain patients.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An important step in the evolution of pain care is more personalized medicine. One aspect of
      personalized medicine emphasizes that patients often have additional requirements for
      prescription medicines beyond just pain relief, including ease in taking medications and
      overall satisfaction with their care. Surveys indicate that 20% of adult patients either with
      or without pain have difficulty swallowing their medications, and up to 10% refuse to take a
      specific therapy because they cannot swallow the pills [1-3]. It is likely that this issue
      compromises the quantity, quality, and satisfaction with pain relief from oral opioids.

      Xtampza ER is an opioid analgesic consisting of a microsphere-containing capsule that can be
      opened so the microspheres can be added to soft food. This drug is designed to overcome
      capsule-swallowing issues and therefore may be an important tool for personalized pain
      medicine care. This study will investigate the pharmaceutic delivery properties of Xtampza to
      determine whether it is an improved alternative to the pill-swallowing problems that are
      common with opioid drugs.

    <description>Percent change in pain intensity (in the last 24 hours) from baseline to the end of the study averaged over the last 7 days before clinic visit 4 (week 6). Pain Intensity is measured on a 0-10 scale, with 0 meaning &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 meaning &quot;the worst pain imaginable.&quot; As decreases in pain intensity are a sign of improvement, percent change in pain intensity is calculated as -(end of study - baseline)/baseline score.</description>

    <description>Following baseline assessments, subjects will have their current opioid medication changed to Xtampza ER (oxycodone) for the duration of the study. A standard conversion table will be used to calculate the dose of Xtampza ER that is equivalent to the subject's current opioid medication dosage. Subjects will be converted to 75% of the calculated dose for the first 7-10 days and then to 100% of the calculated dose for the remaining 3 weeks of the study. The Xtampza ER dosage may be modified at the discretion of the PI to ensure the safety of the subject. As per manufacturer recommendations, subjects will be instructed to open the capsules, sprinkle the microspheres onto soft food such as pudding or applesauce, and then consume the food.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adult subjects must have noncancer chronic pain for at least six months on a daily
             basis,

          2. Be prescribed opioids on a daily basis

          3. Have an upper dose limit of daily opioids of 200 mg of morphine equivalents. This is
             because at doses greater than 200 mg daily, in the investigator's experience it is
             much more difficult to convert completely to another opioid compound within a week.
             Fentanyl and methadone users will not be specifically excluded unless their dosages
             fall outside this range.

          4. Ages 21-70

          5. Reported difficulty swallowing their opioid medication on the screening form at a
             level determined significant by the PI.

          6. Having a mobile phone. A smart phone is not required to respond to the text messages.

          7. Having Internet access to be able to respond to the emailed weekly surveys.

          8. If sexually active and able to become pregnant, must agree to use an acceptable method
             of birth control (hormonal methods, barrier methods with spermicide, intrauterine
             device (IUD) or abstinence).

          9. Only Pain Medicine Clinic patients may participate in this study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Inability to understand the surveys and complete them.

          2. Pregnancy

          3. High risk for opioid addiction and/or abuse behaviors

          4. Any condition, physical or mental, that in the investigator's judgment precludes
             optimal participation in the study procedures. This includes any documented current
             history of liver disease, renal insufficiency, delirium, alcohol use disorder,
             breast-feeding mothers, acute or severe asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
             requiring home oxygen, GI obstruction, biliary tract disease, pancreatitis, cardiac
             arrhythmia, bladder or urethral obstruction, adrenal insufficiency, psychosis, or
             taking medications which are potent inhibitors of the CYP3A4 enzyme (such as protease
             inhibitors, macrolide antibiotics, or antifungals).

          5. Demonstration of abusive alcohol behavior. For women, this is more than 3 drinks on
             any single day or more than 7 drinks per week. For men, more than 4 drinks on any
             single day or more than 14 drinks per week.

          6. Currently taking fentanyl or methadone

          7. Exhibiting the following contraindicated conditions: (1) significant respiratory
             depression (2) acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the
             absence of resuscitative equipment (3) known or suspected gastrointestinal
             obstruction, including paralytic ileus (4) hypersensitivity (e.g. anaphylaxis) to
             oxycodone (5) patients with chronic pulmonary disease (6) elderly, cachet, or
             debilitated patients (7) patients with evidence of increased intracranial pressure,
             brain tumors, head injury, or impaired consciousness (8) patients with seizure
             disorders (9) pregnant and breastfeeding women, due to risks to the fetus/baby

A standard conversion table will be used to calculate the dose of Xtampza ER that is equivalent to the subject's current opioid medication dosage. Subjects will be converted to 75% of the calculated dose for the first 7-10 days and then to 100% of the calculated dose for the remaining 3 weeks of the study. The Xtampza ER dosage may be modified at the discretion of the PI to ensure the safety of the subject. As per manufacturer recommendations, subjects will be instructed to open the capsules, sprinkle the microspheres onto soft food such as pudding or applesauce, and then consume the food.

            <description>Following baseline assessments, subjects will have their current opioid medication changed to Xtampza ER (oxycodone) for the duration of the study. A standard conversion table will be used to calculate the dose of Xtampza ER that is equivalent to the subject's current opioid medication dosage. Subjects will be converted to 75% of the calculated dose for the first 7-10 days and then to 100% of the calculated dose for the remaining 3 weeks of the study. The Xtampza ER dosage may be modified at the discretion of the PI to ensure the safety of the subject. As per manufacturer recommendations, subjects will be instructed to open the capsules, sprinkle the microspheres onto soft food such as pudding or applesauce, and then consume the food.

        <title>Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC)</title>
        <description>The subject's impression of the impact of the treatment on their pain and function will be measured with a 7-item scale (-3 = very much worse, -2 = much worse, -1 = minimally worse, 0 = no change, 1 = minimally improved, 2 = much improved, 3 = very much improved). Responses will be summarized as individual mean scores at clinic visit 4 (week 6).</description>

            <title>Xtampza ER (Oxycodone) Treatment</title>
            <description>Following baseline assessments, subjects will have their current opioid medication changed to Xtampza ER (oxycodone) for the duration of the study. A standard conversion table will be used to calculate the dose of Xtampza ER that is equivalent to the subject's current opioid medication dosage. Subjects will be converted to 75% of the calculated dose for the first 7-10 days and then to 100% of the calculated dose for the remaining 3 weeks of the study. The Xtampza ER dosage may be modified at the discretion of the PI to ensure the safety of the subject. As per manufacturer recommendations, subjects will be instructed to open the capsules, sprinkle the microspheres onto soft food such as pudding or applesauce, and then consume the food.
