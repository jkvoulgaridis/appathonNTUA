  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Memory and cognitive declines are associated with normal brain aging but are also precursors
      to dementia, in particular the so called the pandemic of the century, Alzheimer's disease.
      While currently there is no cure or &quot;vaccine&quot; against dementia, there are hopes to delay the
      onset of the disease by living a brain-healthy life style. The proposed research offers a
      novel approach to prevent dementia and age-related cognitive disorders.

      We propose to use our developed brain fitness APP for the aging population with dementia. The
      proposed APP is based on the premise of brain plasticity, and targets the brain functions
      that are declining with normal aging and dementia. In a pilot study, we showed very positive
      effects of our custom designed brain exercises to strengthen left-right side brain
      connectivity in older adults when used regularly. Leveraging our previous design, we have
      developed an end-user product with additional features and enhanced user interface and user
      experience that will allow it to be used for neuro-cognitive rehabilitation by an individual
      without supervision The proposed APP will be tested on 30 individuals with cognitive
      impairment.

      Additionally, participants can receive an optional electrical stimulation called transcranial
      alternating current stimulation. This applies an alternating current to a person's brain by
      two electrodes placed on the scalp. The participants, who choose this option, will receive
      simultaneous stimulation during the brain exercise tutored sessions. Studies have shown that
      simultaneous application of the electrical stimulation and cognitive exercises further
      enhances the cognitive function by boosting the working memory improvement. Thus, this may
      lead to further improvements from any potential positive effects of the brain exercises.

      We anticipate the frequent use of the proposed APP will help to slow and even reverse the
      progression of the cognition decline in individuals with mild cognitive impairment or
      dementia.

      The research is on the frequent use of our designed APP (for iPADs) that contains a series of
      our recently developed brain exercises that contains a series of our recently developed brain
      exercises, including orientation, associative memory, word-image association, recall memory,
      etc. Participant can receive an optional electrical stimulation called transcranial
      alternating current stimulation simultaneously during the brain exercise tutor sessions.

      Each participant will have a dedicated tutor for Brain Exercises with two scheduling options:

      A) 5 days/week, 2 sessions/day each 30 min) for a period of 4 weeks, or B) 3 days/week, 2
      sessions/day each 30 minute for a period of 8 weeks.

    <description>This assessment has a total of 11 tests, out of which we will use its six primary tests that assess our target brain functions, comprised of 12 subtests (subsections): Logical Memory 1, Verbal Paired Associates 1, Faces 1, Family Pictures 1, Logical Memory 2, Verbal Paired Associates 2, Faces 2, Family Pictures 2, Verbal Paired Associates 2 Recognition, Logical Memory 2 Recognition, Letter-Number Sequencing and Spatial Span. They are classified into 3 major memory indexes: Immediate Memory, General Memory and Working Memory.</description>

    <measure>Change in Egocentric Spatial Orientation</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, post-intervention within a week after the end of 4-week trial and a month after the second assessment</time_frame>
    <description>This test is one of the PI's designs that has been in use since a few years ago. It is used for detecting the onset of Alzheimer's. In this test participants sit in a customized wheelchair and by waking the wheelchair they move within a virtual cubic building to reach a particular target room. They can do this test either using the laptop screen or in its immersive version wearing a goggle (Oculus Rift 2).</description>

    <measure>Change in MONTGOMERY ASBERG DEPRESSION RATING SCALE (MADRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, post-intervention within a week after the end of 4-week trial and a month after the second assessment</time_frame>
    <description>The MADRS is a ten item rating scale for rating levels of depression. Each item is rated on a 7-point scale from 0 to 6, where 0 indicates absence of the symptom and 6 indicates extreme presence of the symptom. The time frame for the scale is the previous four weeks.</description>
