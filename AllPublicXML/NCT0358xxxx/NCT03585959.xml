    <description>The Primary Endpoint is the measured ability of the superDimension™ Navigation System v7.2 with Fluoroscopic Navigation Technology to place the center of the virtual navigation target (green ball) on the intended target lesion as confirmed by cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT).
The primary endpoint was evaluated in technically successful cases (those with local registration complete) and calculated as the percentage of cases in which the virtual target was correctly placed to overlap the target lesion, as confirmed by CBCT. The percent overlap was calculated in three dimensions (X, Y, and Z coordinates). Any case with more than 0% overlap was considered a primary endpoint success.</description>

        <title>Confirm the Location Accuracy of the Local Registration Feature</title>
        <description>The Primary Endpoint is the measured ability of the superDimension™ Navigation System v7.2 with Fluoroscopic Navigation Technology to place the center of the virtual navigation target (green ball) on the intended target lesion as confirmed by cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT).
The primary endpoint was evaluated in technically successful cases (those with local registration complete) and calculated as the percentage of cases in which the virtual target was correctly placed to overlap the target lesion, as confirmed by CBCT. The percent overlap was calculated in three dimensions (X, Y, and Z coordinates). Any case with more than 0% overlap was considered a primary endpoint success.</description>

        <population>47 cases were technically successful. From 47 cases, 4 couldn't be analyzed due to inadequate video recording. From 43 cases, 2 cases only had data from FNAV/CBCT 1 (Before Correction of Catheter Location) and 2 cases only had data from FNAV/CBCT 2 (After Correction of Catheter Location) resulting in 41 evaluable subjects per FNAV/CBCT group.</population>
