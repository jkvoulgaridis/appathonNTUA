  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are many different treatments of congenital talipes equinovarus. At our institution, we
      use the Ponseti method with manipulation and immobilization of the foot. In our study we'd
      like to demonstrate the better outcome in clinical results and in gait analysis of patients
      treated with the Ponseti method, compared to the 'older' methods of taping and posteromedial
      release.

      release. Trial objectives With this study we would like to investigate whether clinical
      results and gait analysis in patients treated with Ponseti has better results compared to
      patients treated with the older methods.
