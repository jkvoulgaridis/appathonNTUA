  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate digitally supported skin self-examination
      compared to usual care in people treated for localised melanoma.

      Patients may be eligible to join this study if they are aged 18 years or above, have been
      treated for stage 0/I/II melanoma and are attending regular melanoma surveillance follow-ups
      at the Melanoma Institute Australia (MIA), Royal Prince Alfred Hospital (RPAH) or the
      Newcastle Skin Check Clinic.

      People who are found to be eligible and who consent to participate will be randomised
      (allocated by chance) to the intervention or usual care in a 1:1 ratio. Usual care group will
      receive an educational booklet on early melanoma and the usual number of routine clinic
      visits. In addition to usual care, participants allocated to the intervention group will be
      required to download a skin checker App to their smartphone and will use a mobile
      dermatoscope to perform total body skin self-examinations every 2 months for 6 months in
      total. Email and SMS reminders will also be sent every two months to participants in the
      intervention group. Participants will be documented on how well they are able to perform a
      self skin examination, their levels of melanoma-related anxiety, the number of skin lesions
      biopsied or removed, and the costs of follow-up to the participant and to the healthcare
      system.

      Frequent follow-up of localised melanoma is time and resource intensive, and has not shown
      improved outcomes. This pilot study will provide evidence on which model is best for
      follow-up care after treatment for localised melanoma.

    <measure>Level of fear of new or recurrent melanoma (FCR) severity.</measure>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>General anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome will be measured using the short version of the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS-21). The DASS-21 is a set of three 7-item self-report scales designed to measure the emotional states of depression, anxiety and stress. The depression scale measures dysphoria, hopelessness, devaluation of life, self-deprecation, lack of interest/involvement, anhedonia and inertia. The anxiety scale measures autonomic arousal, skeletal muscle effects, situational anxiety, and subjective experience of anxious affect. The stress scale assesses difficulty relaxing, nervous arousal, and feeling irritable and impatient.
Each scale ranges from &quot;Did not apply to me&quot; (0) to &quot;Applied to me very much or most of the time&quot; (3). A higher value is considered a worse outcome.</description>

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Index test: teledermatology. A dermatologist who is blinded to clinical diagnosis + histopathology will review the patient performed teledermoscopy + text descriptions and assign skin lesions to the following clinical categories: clinical review warranted vs clinical review not warranted.
Reference test: Clinician opinion on whether review was warranted. An outcome assessor who is blinded to the teledermatology will review clinical notes +/- histopathology (where available) and assign skin lesions to the following clinical categories: clinical review warranted vs clinical review not warranted.</description>
