  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a trial designed to assess the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of one or
      two doses of monovalent inactivated split influenza 2013 and 2017 A/H7N9 virus vaccines
      administered intramuscularly at different dosages, given with or without AS03 adjuvant, using
      different vaccination schedules. This trial will enroll up to 180 males and non-pregnant
      females, 19 to 50 years of age, who are in good health and who are influenza A/H7 naïve.
      Subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of 6 treatment arms (30 subjects per arm) to evaluate
      the interval between the first and second doses and the presence of the adjuvant in the first
      and second doses. The neuraminidase-specific antibody response and the neuraminidase content
      of the Inactivated Influenza Virus Vaccine will be determined using tests that are currently
      under development. Study duration is approximately 22 months with subject participation
      duration of approximately 18 months. The primary objectives of the study are: 1) to assess
      the safety and reactogenicity of 2013 and 2017 A/H7N9 IIVs given with or without AS03
      adjuvant following receipt of each study vaccine; 2) to assess the serum hemagglutination
      inhibition (HAI) and neutralizing (Neut) antibody responses following receipt of the second
      study vaccine.

      This is a Phase II trial designed to assess the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of
      one or two doses of monovalent inactivated split influenza 2013 and 2017 A/H7N9 virus
      vaccines (2013 and 2017 A/H7N9 IIVs) administered intramuscularly at different dosages (3.75
      or 15 mcg of hemagglutinin (HA) per dose), given with or without AS03 adjuvant, using
      different heterologous and homologous prime-boost vaccination schedules. Phosphate buffered
      saline (PBS) diluent may be used to achieve targeted dosages. This trial will enroll up to
      180 males and non-pregnant females, 19 to 50 years of age, inclusive, who are in good health
      and meet all eligibility criteria and who are influenza A/H7 vaccine/infection naïve by
      medical history. Subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of 6 treatment arms (30 subjects per
      arm) evaluating the interval between the priming (first) and boosting (second) doses and the
      presence of the adjuvant in the priming (first) and boosting (second) doses. The
      neuraminidase-specific antibody response and the neuraminidase content of the Inactivated
      Influenza Virus Vaccine will be determined using tests that are currently under development.
      Study duration is approximately 22 months with subject participation duration of
      approximately 18 months. The primary objectives of the study are: 1) to assess the safety and
      reactogenicity of 2013 and 2017 A/H7N9 IIVs given with or without AS03 adjuvant following
      receipt of each study vaccine; 2) to assess the serum hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) and
      neutralizing (Neut) antibody responses following receipt of the second study vaccine. The
      secondary objectives are: 1) to assess unsolicited non-serious adverse events (AEs) following
      receipt of each study vaccine; 2) to assess medically-attended adverse events (MAAEs),
      including new-onset chronic medical conditions (NOCMCs) and potentially immune-mediated
      medical conditions (PIMMCs), following receipt of each study vaccine; 3) to assess the
      kinetics and durability of serum HAI and Neut antibody responses following receipt of each
      study vaccine.

          2. Are able to understand and comply with planned study procedures and be available for
             all study visits.

          3. Must agree to the collection of venous blood per protocol.

          4. Must agree to have residual specimens and samples/specimens collected during this
             trial specifically for the purpose of future research stored for future research use.

               -  As determined by medical history and physical examination to evaluate acute or
                  currently ongoing chronic medical diagnoses or conditions, defined as those that
                  have been present for at least 90 days, which would affect the assessment of the
                  safety of subjects or the immunogenicity of study vaccinations. Chronic medical
                  diagnoses or conditions should be stable for the last 60 days (no
                  hospitalizations, Emergency Room (ER), or urgent care for condition and no
                  adverse symptoms that need medical intervention such as medication
                  change/supplemental oxygen). This includes no change in chronic prescription
                  medication, dose, or frequency as a result of deterioration of the chronic
                  medical diagnosis or condition in the 60 days prior to enrollment. Any
                  prescription change that is due to change of health care provider, insurance
                  company, etc., or that is done for financial reasons, as long as in the same
                  class of medication, will not be considered a deviation of this inclusion
                  criterion. Any change in prescription medication due to improvement of a disease
                  outcome, as determined by the site principal investigator or appropriate
                  sub-investigator, will not be considered a deviation of this inclusion criterion.
                  Subjects may be on chronic or as needed (prn) medications if, in the opinion of
                  the site principal investigator or appropriate sub-investigator, they pose no
                  additional risk to subject safety or assessment of reactogenicity and
                  immunogenicity and do not indicate a worsening of medical diagnosis or condition.
                  Similarly, medication changes subsequent to enrollment and study vaccination are
                  acceptable provided there was no deterioration in the subject's chronic medical
                  condition that necessitated a medication change, and there is no additional risk
                  to the subject or interference with the evaluation of responses to study
                  vaccination. Note: Topical, nasal, and inhaled medications (with the exception of
                  inhaled corticosteroids as outlined in the Subject Exclusion Criteria), herbals,
                  vitamins, and supplements are permitted.

          7. Oral temperature is less than 100.0 degrees Fahrenheit.

             hysterectomy, or successful Essure(R) placement (permanent, non-surgical, non-hormonal
             sterilization) with documented radiological confirmation test at least 90 days after
             the procedure, and still menstruating or &lt;1 year of the last menses if menopausal.

             -- Includes non-male sexual relationships, abstinence from sexual intercourse with a
             male partner, monogamous relationship with vasectomized partner who has been
             vasectomized for 180 days or more prior to the subject receiving the first study
             vaccination, barrier methods such as condoms or diaphragms with spermicide or foam,
             effective intrauterine devices, NuvaRing(R), and licensed hormonal methods such as

             sub-investigator, within 72 hours prior to study vaccination.

               -  An acute illness which is nearly resolved with only minor residual symptoms
                  remaining is allowable if, in the opinion of the site principal investigator or
                  appropriate sub-investigator, the residual symptoms will not interfere with the
                  ability to assess safety parameters as required by the protocol.

          2. Have any medical disease or condition that, in the opinion of the site principal
