  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Carpal tunnel syndrome is one of the major known disorders of the wrist and hand that causes
      pain, tingling sensations, weakness of the hand and functional limitations in daily tasks
      (for example: handling objects with the hands). In the early stages of the syndrome, some
      individuals may benefit from wearing wrist splint or cortisone infiltration. For those with
      ongoing symptoms, surgery is often indicated. However, some individuals may experience
      worsening of their condition while waiting for surgery. To aid those individuals,
      physiotherapists often recommend exercises that aim to &quot;glide&quot; the nerve inside the arm.
      Specifically, these exercises involve arm and neck movements in a specific order, with the
      aim of improving the motion of the median nerve in relation with its environment. These nerve
      gliding exercises may have a favorable effect on the median nerve and may improve pain and
      upper limb functional abilities. In this study, the investigators aim to evaluated the
      feasibility and effects of a preoperative nerve gliding exercises completed by individuals
      undergoing surgery

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) is a common disorder characterized by alterations of the median
      nerve integrity at the carpal tunnel. The syndrome is classically recognized by chief
      complains of nocturnal or intermittent pain and paresthesia involving the median nerve
      sensory territory of the hand. In more severe condition, worsening of pain and paresthesia as
      well as thenar muscle atrophy may be present and lead to disability.

      Many conservative treatments for CTS are available. Yet, the current literature only support
      the use of wrist splints and cortisone infiltration, which have been shown to provide only
      temporary relief for many individuals. Those with ongoing symptoms or severe conditions are
      often offered carpal tunnel decompression surgery. However, the costs related to the surgery
      and the increasing delays on waiting lists warrants the need for better conservative
      management. A preoperative rehabilitation exercise program based on nerve gliding exercise is
      advocated by physical therapists to manage physical impairments and functional limitations
      associated with CTS. These exercises can be implement at low cost in the setting of an
      home-based program.

      The investigators aim to examine the feasibility and the efficacy of a preoperative home
      rehabilitation program based on nerve gliding exercises completed by individuals with carpal
      tunnel Syndrome waiting for decompression surgery.

      In this trial, individuals awaiting carpal tunnel decompression surgery will be randomly
      allocated to either complete a preoperative nerve-gliding exercise program (experimental
      group) or no intervention (control group). Thirty participants confirmed with CTS by their
      attending hand surgeons and enlisted for carpal tunnel decompression will be recruited for
      this study conducted at the hospital of the Université de Montréal (CHUM), Montreal, Quebec,
      Canada. All individuals enrolled in the study will be prioritized on the surgical waiting
      list to receive their surgery five weeks after initiating the study in order to ensure
      consistency between different timeframes of the study.

      The effects of the nerve-gliding exercise program will be assessed at baseline (T0) using
      standardized questionnaires, quantitative ultrasound measurements (including static and
      dynamic evaluations) of the median nerve, pinch grip strength and will be repeated after four
      weeks (T1; preoperative period) and four weeks following surgery (T2; postoperative period).

      Feasibility metrics will be analyzed using descriptive statistics. A significant interaction
      between the group allocation (experimental vs. control) and time (T0 vs. T1 vs. T2) on the
      main outcomes will be evaluated using two-way mixed ANOVAs.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in different pain-related disabilities and cognitive-behavioral factors involved in the experience of pain measured by the West Haven-Yale Multidimensional Pain inventory (WHYMPI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (T0), one month (T1), and two months (T2) following randomization</time_frame>
    <description>The WHYMPI is comprised of 52 questions organized into subscales quantifying domains including two subscales specific to pain experience (i.e., pain interference (9 items), and pain severity (3 items)). Each question is rated on a Likert scale ranging from 0 to 6 and a mean score is computed for each subscale. A higher mean score represents higher disability (e.g., very intense pain or extreme interference). The French version of the WHYPMI has been adapted and validated and has demonstrated good repeatability (ICC &gt; 0.75) when tested in adults with chronic musculoskeletal pain (Laliberté et al. 2008, Kerns, Turk, and Rudy 1985). The normalized minimal detectable change (MDC) for the WHYMPI for each of the five WHYMPI subscales range from MDC90%=15.4% (pain interference) to MDC90%=22.8% (emotional distress) (Bergström et al. 1999).</description>

    <measure>Change upper limb functional abilities measured with the Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (T0), one month (T1), and two months (T2) following randomization</time_frame>
    <description>The DASH includes 30 questions covering participation and performance of daily activities with the upper limb as well as symptom severity in individuals with musculoskeletal upper limb disorder. Each question is rated on a Likert scale ranging from 1 to 5, where a higher weighted score (range 0-100) represents substantial functional limitations. The French version of the DASH has been adapted and validated and has demonstrated excellent repeatability (ICC = 0.91) when tested in adults with chronic musculoskeletal pain (Hudak, Amadio, and Bombardier 1996, Durand et al. 2005). The normalized MDC was established (MDC90% = 10.7%) (Greenslade et al. 2004).</description>

    <measure>Change in median nerve cross sectional area at the carpal tunnel inlet measured by quantitative ultrasound imaging</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (T0), one month (T1), and two months (T2) following randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Static images of the median nerve's are acquired in the transverse plane at the level of the carpal tunnel inlet. The cross-sectional area of the median nerve is defined by semi-automatically outlining the inner border of the epineurium and will be assess offline using custom software. Median nerve cross-sectional area measurement has good repeatability ( &gt; 0.88) when performed in asymptomatic adults. The normalized MDC was previously estimated for the cross-sectional area measurement (MDC90% = 6.2%)</description>

    <description>Cineloops of the median nerve are acquired during passive extension of the wrist using ultrasound imaging at the distal forearm. Three region of interest within the epineurium border are manually drawn and will be assess offline custom software. Median nerve longitudinal excursion has good repeatability ( &gt; 0.84) when performed in a mixed population including asymptomatic individuals and individuals with carpal tunnel syndrome. The normalized MDC was previously estimated for the longitudinal excursion measurement (MDC90% = 34.1%)</description>
