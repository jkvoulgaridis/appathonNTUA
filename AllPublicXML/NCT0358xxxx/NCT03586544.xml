  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In obese children, excess fat exerts an increased mechanical burden on the respiratory
      system, particularly during exercise. It is unclear whether this burden reduces respiratory
      function and exercise tolerance and increases severity of exercise-induced
      bronchoconstriction in obese asthmatic children. The investigators propose that most of the
      respiratory effects in obese asthmatic children are the result of low lung volume breathing
      (i.e., reduced functional residual capacity). The first objective of this study is to
      investigate respiratory function, exercise tolerance, and exercise-induced
      bronchoconstriction in obese vs. nonobese asthmatic children. Guidelines from the American
      Thoracic Society strongly recommend interval warm-up exercise before planned exercise to
      reduce exercise-induced bronchoconstriction severity. However, no empirical data on the
      effects of interval warm-up exercise on exercise-induced bronchoconstriction severity are
      available in obese asthmatic children, where excess fat exerts such an unfavorable burden on
      the respiratory system, particularly during exercise. Thus, the second objective of this
      study is to investigate the effects of interval warm-up exercise on exercise-induced
      bronchoconstriction severity in obese and nonobese asthmatic children. Our approach will be
      to investigate exercise tolerance, respiratory function, and exercise-induced
      bronchoconstriction severity and the effects of (1) 8x30sec interval warm-up &amp; (2)
      pretreatment with a bronchodilator compared with a no-treatment control on exercise-induced
      bronchoconstriction severity in 8-12 yr, prepubescent, obese and nonobese asthmatic children.

      [Aim 1]: To investigate respiratory function and exercise tolerance [Hypothesis]: Obesity in
      children with asthma will reduce respiratory function and exercise tolerance [Aim 2]: To
      investigate exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. [Hypothesis]: Obesity in children with
      asthma will increase exercise-induced bronchoconstriction severity as evidenced by a greater
      maximum % fall in forced expiratory volume in the first second after an exercise challenge
      test.

      [Aim 3]: To investigate the effects of interval warm-up exercise on exercise-induced
      bronchoconstriction severity. [Hypothesis]: Interval warm-up exercise will reduce
      exercise-induced bronchoconstriction severity after an exercise challenge test to a similar
      extent as bronchodilator and better than control, although to a greater extent in nonobese
      asthmatic children.

      The investigators will enroll prepubescent, 8 - 12 yr old, obese (body mass index &gt; 95th
      percentile; N=25) and nonobese (body mass between 16th and 84th percentile; N=25) children
      with mild asthma. The investigators will investigate the severity of exercise-induced
      bronchoconstriction during planned exercise performed 15 minutes after the following three
      conditions performed on separate days in a random order: (1) 8x30sec interval warm-up, (2)
      short-acting beta agonist or albuterol, &amp; (3) control, in prepubescent, 8 - 12 yr old, obese
      and nonobese children with mild asthma. The investigators will also investigate differences
      in pulmonary function, exercise tolerance, and severity of exercise-induced
      bronchoconstriction between obese and nonobese children.

      The investigators will measure the following in all participants:

        1. Pulmonary function: spirometry, lung volumes, diffusing capacity of lung for carbon
           monoxide, maximum voluntary ventilation, maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures,
           airway resistance, and expired nitric oxide

        2. Exercise tolerance during graded cycle ergometry: Gas exchange, ventilation, heart rate,
           blood pressure, pulse oximetry, electrocardiogram

        3. Ratings of perceived breathlessness and exercise induced bronchoconstriction in response
           to a 6 minute high-intensity exercise challenge after three conditions performed on
           three separate days:

      Three conditions that will precede the exercise challenge include:

        1. 8x30sec of interval warm-up 15min prior to exercise challenge: This includes eight 30sec
           bouts of high-intensity interval exercise at 85-95% of HRmax, with 45sec of recovery
           between.

        2. Two puffs of albuterol 15 min prior to exercise challenge

        3. Control: seated rest for 15min prior to exercise challenge

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  no history of smoking, no history or evidence of heart disease, no history of
             uncontrolled hypertension, no documented and/or diagnosed sleep disorders, no
             diagnosed diabetes, no metabolic disorders, no history of significant mental illness,
             no dietary restrictions, no serious health conditions, or no musculoskeletal
             abnormality that would preclude exercise.

          -  Normal weight children with a body mass index between the 16th and 84th percentile

          -  Obese children with a body mass index &gt; 95th percentile but less than 170% above the
             95th percentile and less than an absolute body mass index of 40 kgÂ·m2

          -  Pulmonary function criteria 1) forced vital capacity â¥ 80% predicted, 2) forced
             expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) â¥ 75% predicted, and total lung capacity
             â¥ 80% predicted

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Children with significant diseases other than obesity and mild asthma will be
             excluded. A significant disease is defined as either a disease that in the opinion of
             the PI or medical consultant Dr. Craig Nakamura may put the participant at risk
             because of participation in the study or a disease that may influence the results of
             the study or the patient's ability to participate in the study.

          -  Children who cannot follow directions (e.g., eating before testing), adequately
             perform procedures (e.g., pulmonary function tests), or keep appointments (e.g., no
             shows for testing), will be excluded from study participation.

          -  Because the risk of severe exercise induced bronchoconstriction increases in children
             with moderate or severe obstructive airway disease, children with FEV1 &lt; 75% predicted
             will be excluded from the study. Diagnosis of asthma (i.e., airway responsiveness with
             reversible obstruction) will be established by spirometry (i.e., improvement of FEV1
             of â¥8% after administration of bronchodilator).

          -  Children without reversible airway obstruction will also be excluded from the study.

          -  Children who have been hospitalized for an asthma exacerbation or who have taken oral
             glucocorticoids for asthma in the past year, and children who have been admitted to an
             intensive care unit or been intubated because of their asthma in the past five years,
             will be excluded to reduce the risk of exacerbation during the study.
