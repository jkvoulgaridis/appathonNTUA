      Herpes Zoster (HZ),is a condition caused by Varizella-Zooster virus (VZV), The disease is
      caused by reactivation of a latent VZV-infection in the sensory ganglia.

      Clinically the condition is characterized by a painful, unilateral, vesicular rash. Pain is
      the most prominent symptom in around 90% of patients. In 10% of patients this pain remains
      and becomes chronic.

      Post-herpetic neuralgia is a chronic pain syndrome that occurs after the dermal
      manifestations disappears.

      Treatment is complex and mainly topical or systemic. For many patients this is not sufficient
      and they live with constant pain.

      Fat grafting has shown promise in treating several different painful conditions such as post
      mastectomy pain syndrome, painful scars etc.

      This study investigates is PHN can be treated by fat grafting.

    <description>Neuropathic Pain Symptom inventory (NPSI), Questionnaire. NPSI consists of 12 items in total: 10 items investigates differential symptoms descriptors and 2 items evaluate spontaneous and paroxysmal spontaneous pain.
The tool evaluates mean pain intensity in the last 24h in a verbal numeric scale from zero (no pain) to 10 (worst imaginable pain). Total pain intensity score may be calculated by the sum of the 10 descriptors.
The descriptors are:
Burning, Squeezing, Pressure, Electric Shocks, Stabbing, Provoked by brushing. Provoked by pressure, Evoked by cold stimulation, Pins and needles, Tingling.</description>

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Short Form 36 (SF-36), Questionnaire. Scoring the RAND 36-Item Health Survey is a two-step process. First, precoded numeric values are recoded per a scoring key. All items are scored so that a high score defines a more favorable health state. Each item is scored on a 0 to 100 range so that the lowest and highest possible scores are 0 and 100, respectively. Scores represent the percentage of total possible score achieved. After this, items in the same scale are averaged together to create the 8 scale scores.
The eight health concepts are: physical functioning, bodily pain, role limitations due to physical health problems, role limitations due to personal or emotional problems, emotional well-being, social functioning, energy/fatigue, and general health perceptions. It also includes a single item that provides an indication of perceived change in health.</description>

    <intervention_name>Fat grafting</intervention_name>
    <description>The area of dermal pain is identified and marked prior to surgery. The surgery starts with liposuction, either on the abdomen or the thigh. The harvested fat is prepared for fat grafting by sedimenting it for 10 minutes. The fat is then injected into the painful area, marked pre-surgery.</description>
