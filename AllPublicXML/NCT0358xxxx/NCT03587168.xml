  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Difficulty in turning is common after Parkinson's Disease. Patients with Parkinson's Disease
      take a greater number of steps, longer duration, narrower base of support in turning. Thus,
      turning ability is systematically investigated in Parkinson's Disease. The aim of this study
      to invastigate reliability, validity, and responsiveness of the timed 360° turn test in
      Patients with Parkinson's Disease.

      At baseline, the timed 360° turn test, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, Hoehn and
      Yahr Scale, Berg Balance Scale, Functional Reach Test, Timed Up and Go Test, Four Square Step
      Test and Trunk Impairment Scale was applied to the patients with Parkinson's Disease when the
      patients were &quot;on&quot; period. The timed 360° turn test was repeated after seven days from the
      first application when patients with Parkinson's Disease were &quot;on&quot; period to evaluate its
      reliability.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The timed 360° turn test</measure>
    <time_frame>10 seconds</time_frame>
    <description>Turning ability is assessed by using the timed 360° turn test. In the timed 360° turn test, a piece of colored tape is placed on the floor to mark the starting position. Each subject was required to stand with arms by his/her side and feet comfortably apart and pointing to the tape. Timing was started from the word &quot;go&quot; and stopped when subject's shoulders were facing forward again. The time taken to complete the turn was recorded (in seconds) by a stopwatch.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Berg Balance Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Functional balance is assessed by using the Berg Balance Scale. During the test, participants are asked to perform 14 tasks frequently used in daily life activities. Each item is scored between 0 (unable to perform the task) and 4 (task is performed independently) according to the ability of the person while performing the task. The highest possible score is 56 points. A higher score indicates better balance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Trunk Impairment Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>20 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Trunk performance is assessed by using the trunk impairment scale. The Trunk Impairment Scale consists of three subscales: static sitting balance, dynamic sitting balance and co-ordination. A higher score indicating a better performance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional Reach Test</measure>
    <time_frame>15 seconds</time_frame>
    <description>The Functional Reach Test assesses balance by measuring the limits while the patient reaches forwards as far as possible, having the arms in 90° flexion and without lifting the heels off the floor.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Four Square Step Test</measure>
    <time_frame>15 seconds</time_frame>
    <description>The Four Square Step Test measures dynamic balance and clinically assesses the person's ability to step over objects forward, sideways, and backward. A square was formed by 4 canes resting flat on the floor. The participants were instructed to try and complete the sequence as fast as possible without touching the canes with both feet, making contact with the floor in each square.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Timed Up and Go Test</measure>
    <time_frame>10 seconds</time_frame>
    <description>Functional mobility is assessed by using the timed up and go test. The timed up and go test measures the time that a patient needs to stand up from a chair, walk a 3-m distance, come back and sit back on the chair.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hoehn and Yahr Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>1 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Disease stage is assessed by the Hoehn and Yahr Scale. The Hoehn and Yahr scale is a commonly used diagnostic tool for quantifying the progression of Parkinson's Disease symptoms. Stages range from 0 (no signs of disease) to 5 (requiring a wheelchair, or bedridden unless assisted).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale is increasingly used as a gold standard reference scale and includes four components (Part I, Mentation, Behavior and Mood; Part II, Activities of Daily Living; Part III, Motor;Part IV, Complications). A lower score indicates lower disease severity.</description>
