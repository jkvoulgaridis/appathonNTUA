  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, parallel-group study to evaluate rotigotine pharmacokinetics,
      safety and tolerability following a single intramuscular dose of one of two different
      formulations of LY03003 in patients with Parkinson's disease.

    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate and compare the rotigotine pharmacokinetic profile of a
      single 28 mg intramuscular dose of LY03003 Formulation A and LY03003 Formulation B. The
      secondary objective of the trial is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of LY03003
      Formulation A and LY03003 Formulation B following a single 28 mg IM dose administered to
      patients with Parkinson's Disease.

          -  Has idiopathic Parkinson's Disease (i.e., without any other known or suspected cause
             of Parkinsonism) defined by the cardinal signs, bradykinesia, plus the presence of ≥1
             of the following: resting tremor, rigidity, or impairment of postural reflexes.

          -  Male or female patient ≥18 years old with BMI of 18.5 to 32 kg/m2, inclusive, and body
             weight ≥50 kg at Screening.

          -  MMSE score ≥25 at Screening.

          -  UPDRS motor (Part III) score ≥ 10 but ≤ 42 at Screening.

          -  History of symptomatic orthostatic hypotension with a decrease of ≥20 mmHg in SBP or
             decrease of ≥10 mmHg in DBP when changing from supine to standing position after
             having been in the supine position for at least 5 minutes or SBP less than 105 mmHg in
             a supine position at the Screening Visit.

          -  Therapy with a dopamine (DA) agonist either concurrently or within 21 days prior to
             study drug dosing.

          -  Therapy with 1 or more of the following drugs either concurrently or within 21 days
             prior to study drug dosing: monoamine oxidase inhibitors, DA releasing agents, DA
             modulating agents, DA antagonists, DA depleting antihypertensives, tricyclic
             antidepressants, neuroleptics, or other medications that may interact with DA
             function.

          -  Current diagnosis of epilepsy, history of seizures as an adult, lifetime history of
             stroke, or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within 1 year prior to the Screening Visit.

          -  Female patient who is pregnant or breastfeeding or of childbearing potential without
             adequate contraception

          -  History of prescription drug abuse or illicit drug use, alcohol abuse, or tobacco use
             within 6 months prior to the Screening Visit or positive finding in drugs of abuse
             test, nicotine test, or alcohol test.

          -  Any other clinically relevant hepatic, renal, hematologic, and/or cardiac dysfunction,
             or other medical condition, or clinically significant laboratory abnormality that
             would interfere with the patient's safety or trial outcome in the judgment of the
