  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a parallel design, nonblinded, randomized controlled superiority trial
      investigating the utility of a virtual reality (VR) experience to provide analgesia for
      external cephalic version (ECV).

      Subjects will be: Pregnant women, age &gt;18 years, with a singleton pregnancy at &gt;36 weeks
      gestational age, healthy (American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status class II),
      with an otherwise uncomplicated pregnancy (i.e. no fetal abnormalities or significant
      maternal morbidity, scheduled for ECV at Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC)
      with a plan to receive no anesthesia for the procedure.

      Patients will be randomly assigned to either the VR or No VR group. The intervention will be
      provided for the duration of the ECV procedure (typically 15 - 30 mins).

    <description>Virtual reality (VR) experience VR visualization of a 3-dimensional relaxing nature scene with the accompanying audio. The patient will be offered a selection of scenes from which to choose, played continuously on a Samsung Gear VRTM(San Jose, CA) headset and headphones. The goal is for the patient to use the intervention for the entire duration of the external cephalic version procedure (ECV), which typically lasts 15 - 30 minutes.The patient will also receive verbal reassurance and coaching as needed. The obstetrician will communicate as usual with the patient.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Group No VR</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>No Intervention</arm_group_type>
    <description>No intervention will be provided for the control group, who will receive usual management at CUMC, which involves provision of no analgesia or sedation for the procedure, which typically lasts 15 - 30 minutes. Verbal reassurance and coaching is routinely provided by caregivers, including encouraging deep breathing, particularly during painful manipulation of the abdomen, for the duration of the procedure. The obstetrician will communicate as usual with the patient - for example advising that he/she is about to begin the procedure and giving updates as to the degree of success.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant women, age &gt;18 years, with a singleton pregnancy at &gt;36 weeks gestational
             age, healthy (American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status class II), with an
             otherwise uncomplicated pregnancy (i.e. no fetal abnormalities or significant maternal
             morbidity, scheduled for ECV at CUMC with a plan to receive no anesthesia for the
             procedure.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1) severe claustrophobia or other psychological/psychiatric disorder which would
             prevent the use of a VR headset; 2) history of severe motion sickness, which may lead
             to nausea and vomiting or other discomfort with use of the a VR headset; 3) severe
             visual impairment, which may prevent appreciation of the visual aspects of the VR
             environment presented; 4) severe auditory impairment, which may prevent full
             appreciation of the sounds presented in the VR environment; 5) facial skin or scalp
             open lesions which could be irritated or risk infection to the patient or others if
             the VR headset is used; 6) other viral/bacterial/fungal infectious illnesses that
             could easily be spread by sharing of the device e.g. viral or bacterial
             conjunctivitis, meningitis, influenza, common cold, and other upper respiratory tract
             infections; 7) severe or uncontrolled seizure disorder, as the VR experience could
             invoke seizures 8) bulky hairstyles which would significantly impair correct fitting
             of the VR headset.
