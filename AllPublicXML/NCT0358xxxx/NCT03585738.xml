  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a heterogeneous, multifaceted and complex disorder
      characterized by insulin resistance (IR), hyperinsulinemia, and hyperandrogenism leading
      ovarian disfunction and infertility. Given the central pathogenic role of IR in the
      endocrine, reproductive, and metabolic disturbances of PCOS, several pharmacological and
      non-pharmacological approaches have been proposed to counteract the hyper insulinemic IR
      typical of the syndrome. Two Inositol stereoisomers, Myo-Inositol (MI) and D-chiro-inositol
      (DCI), captured the attention of researchers for their insulin-sensitizing actions, which
      configure them as proper candidates for the treatment of PCOS.

      Very few studies reported on spontaneous clinical pregnancy rates, none were powered for this
      outcome, and none reported on the clinically relevant outcome of live birth. Therefore, data
      about clinical pregnancy rate, live birth rate, and miscarriage rate comparing inositols with
      placebo are limited.

      Nevertheless, regarding infertility the primary outcomes that should be considered are
      clinical pregnancy rate, miscarriage rate and live birth rate. Although many studies showed
      improved hormonal and metabolic profile and improved ovulation rate and higher quality and
      number of oocyte retrieved in Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) in PCOS women after
      inositols administration, data about clinical pregnancy rate, live birth rate, and
      miscarriage rate are limited with several concerns regarding interpretation of the studies.

      Furthermore, independently by the effect on PCOS related infertility, few data are available
      about the role of inositol on obstetrics outcomes of pregnancies conceived after treatment
      with inositol and/or orally supplemented during pregnancy. Considering that the combination
      of MI and DCI alleviate many of the metabolic dysregulations typical of PCOS thanks to
      insulin-sensitizing actions, it is plausible consider a beneficial effects on pregnancy
      complications such as gestational diabetes and preeclampsia.
