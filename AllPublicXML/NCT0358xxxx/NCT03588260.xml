  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Respiratory muscle strength, dyspnea perception, physical activity and quality of life
      measurements will be performed and groups will be compared in two groups consisting of
      patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis referred to pulmonary rehabilitation clinic and
      healthy volunteers in similar age range.

      The patients who have agreed to participate in the study from patients diagnosed with
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis referred to the center of pulmonary rehabilitation from the
      interstitial lung disease polyclinic will be included in the study. In addition, a healthy
      adult control group will be established from similar age groups. The two groups will be
      compared in terms of outcome measures.The study outcome measurements are maximum
      inspiratory/expiratory muscle strength , international physical activity questionaire,
      modified Medical Research Council dyspnea scale, Short form 36 quality of lide questionaire,
      fatigue severity scale, six minute walking test.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Maximum inspiratory muscle pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The mouth pressure measurement was performed with the Micro-RPM® instrument from SensorMEDIC. Patient placed a rubber mouthpiece with flanges, on the device, sealed their lips firmly around the mouthpiece, exhaled/inhaled slowly and completely, and then tried to breath in as hard as possible. The patient was allowed to rest for about a minute and the maneuver was repeated five times. Verbal or visual feedback was provided after each maneuver. The aim is that the variability between measurements is less than 10 cm H2O. The maximum value was obtained.</description>

    <measure>The distance covered in six-minute walk test</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The test was conducted in a 30-meter corridor in line with American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines. Patients were told that they should walk as fast as they can walk. Before and after the test, oxygen saturation, heart rate, Borg fatigue rating, and walking distance were recorded.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>International Physical Activity Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) was developed as an instrument for cross-national monitoring of physical activity and inactivity. This measure assesses the types of intensity of physical activity and sitting time that people do as part of their daily lives are considered to estimate total physical activity in MET-min/week and time spent sitting.</description>

  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) scale</measure>
    <time_frame>3 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Dyspnea perceptions during daily life activities will assess according to the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) scale. The mMRC Dyspnea Scale is best used to establish baseline functional impairment due to dyspnea attributable to respiratory disease; tracking the mMRC over time or with therapeutic interventions is of less certain clinical utility.The severity of dyspnea is rated on a scale of 0 to 4. &quot;0&quot; means no dyspnea perception, &quot;4&quot; means severe dyspnea perception.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The fatigue severity scale</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>A 9-item questionnaire with questions related to how fatigue interferes with certain activities and rates its severity.
The items are scored on a 7 point scale with 1 = strongly disagree and 7= strongly agree
The minimum score = 9 and maximum score possible = 63. Higher the score = greater fatigue severity
Another way of scoring: mean of all the scores with minimum score being 1 and maximum score being 7
Self-report scale</description>
