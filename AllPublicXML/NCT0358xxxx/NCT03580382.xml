  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of this study is to test if it is safe and effective to give CDX-3379 together
      to treat advanced melanoma in patients with the NRAS mutation and BRAF/NRAS wildtype.

      Primary Objectives:

      Phase 1b: To determine the RP2D and assess the toxicity and tolerability of the combination
      of CDX-3379 (ERBB3 antibody) and trametinib (MEK inhibitor) in NRAS and BRAF/NRAS WT melanoma
      patients

      Phase 2: To estimate the response rates and duration of response of the combination of
      CDX-3379 (ERBB3 antibody) and trametinib in NRAS positive and BRAF/NRAS WT melanoma patients

      Secondary/Exploratory Objectives:

      Phase 1b: To assess clinical activity and steady-state pharmacokinetics of CDX-3379 and
      trametinib Phase 2: To compare the efficacy of the combination of CDX-3379 (ERBB3 antibody)
      and trametinib is more effective than a MEK inhibitor alone in NRAS positive and BRAF/NRAS WT
      melanoma patients alone using locally assessed progression free survival (PFS) and overall
      survival (OS).

                       (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago. In
                       the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the
                       woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she
                       considered not of child bearing potential.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Received CDX-3379 or other anti-ErbB3 targeted agents previously.

          2. Received trametinib or other MEK inhibitor agents previously.

          3. Any concurrent chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, biologic or hormonal therapy
             for cancer treatment. Concurrent use of hormones for non-cancer related conditions

             must have been previously treated and asymptomatic for 2 weeks and not progressive in
             size or number for 4 weeks prior to enrollment, documented via scans. Continued use of
             anticonvulsants (in the absence of any suspicion of progressive brain metastases) is
             acceptable. Patients must currently be on a stable, lowest possible dose of steroids.

          6. Radiation therapy within 14 days prior to the first scheduled dose in this study,
             including, in addition (if necessary), the timeframe for resolution of any actual or
             anticipated toxicities from such radiation.

             not require a wash-out), and all other immunotherapy (tumor vaccine, cytokine, or
             growth factor given to control the cancer) within 2 weeks, prior to the first dose of
             study treatment.

          9. Chemotherapy within 4 weeks (except for bis-chlorethynitrosurea (BCNU), which must
             have been completed a minimum of 6 weeks) prior to starting therapy.

         10. Major surgery within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment. Surgery
             requiring local/epidural anesthesia must be completed at least 72 hours before study
             drug administration and patients should be recovered.

         11. Use of other investigational drugs within 2 weeks or 5 half-lives (whichever is
             longer) prior to study treatment administration

         12. A marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTc interval (e.g., repeated demonstration of a
             QTc interval &gt;450 ms); additional risk factors for torsades de pointes (TdP) (e.g., a
             history of heart failure, family history of Long QT Syndrome, or active hypokalemia or
             uncorrectable electrolyte abnormality); significant cardiovascular disease including
             unstable angina pectoris, uncontrolled hypertension or arrhythmia, congestive heart
             failure (New York Heart Association Class III or IV) related to primary cardiac
             disease, uncontrolled ischemic or severe valvular heart disease; or any of the
             following within 6 months prior to the first dose of study treatment: myocardial
             infarction, severe/unstable angina, coronary artery bypass graft, congestive heart
             failure, cerebrovascular accident, transient ischemic attack.

             corticosteroids above the physiologic dose (defined as 20 mg/day prednisone or the
             equivalent).

         14. Any other acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality
             that could increase the risk associated with trial participation or trial drug
             administration or could interfere with the interpretation of trial results and, in the
             judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into the
             trial.

         15. Known alcohol or drug abuse.

         16. Sexually active males must use a condom during intercourse while taking the drug and
             for 3 months after stopping study drug and should not father a child in this period. A
             condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent delivery of
             the drug via seminal fluid.

         17. Inability to swallow pills

         18. Patients unwilling or unable to comply with the protocol.
