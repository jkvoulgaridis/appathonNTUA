             last 12 months.

          -  Subjects will not be eligible if they have current forms of psoriasis other than
             chronic plaque-type (e.g. erythrodermic, guttate, or pustular)

          -  Subject that has a current drug-induced psoriasis form (e.g. a new onset of psoriasis
             or an exacerbation of psoriasis from beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, or
             lithium)

          -  Subject that has a history of recurrent or medically important infections, a
             clinically significant candida infection or clinically significant skin infection with
             Staphylococcus aureus requiring systemic treatment in the last 12 months prior to the
             first administration of study drug

          -  Subject that smokes more than 15 cigarettes, or equivalent in tobacco, per day Subject
             with a history of suicide attempt or suicidal behavior

          -  Any live vaccination within 3 months prior to Screening
