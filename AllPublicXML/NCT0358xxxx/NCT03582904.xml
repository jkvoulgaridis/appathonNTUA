  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ability to change walking patterns is important for daily tasks such as stepping over an
      obstacle. This change of walking pattern can occur in a strategic manner, i.e., consciously
      making one step longer or shorter. Healthy individuals can learn a new walking pattern
      through perturbed visual feedback of their walking information (Kim et al., 2015; Kim et al.,
      2017). This type of learning is thought to largely involve explicit strategy. Transcranial
      direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a form of non-invasive brain stimulation that can
      enhance learning of some motor tasks (Reis et al., 2009), and primarily has been studied in
      the upper extremity. In locomotor learning, prior recent work by the investigators has
      suggested that tDCS does not affect non-strategy based locomotor learning, and the
      investigators speculate that tDCS may benefit learning of strategic tasks instead. The
      purpose of this study is to determine if tDCS can enhance learning and retention of a new
      walking pattern in a strategy-based, visually guided locomotor task in healthy individuals.
      Two groups of young, healthy participants will be recruited to learn a new walking pattern
      through perturbed visual feedback, with retention of learning tested on the second day. One
      group will receive tDCS, which is expected to enhance learning. The other group will receive
      placebo stimulation and serve as a control. Results from this work will provide information
      on which type of motor learning is sensitive to enhancement with tDCS, and may help pave the
      path for utilizing tDCS for neurorehabilitation.
