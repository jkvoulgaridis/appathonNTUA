  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is meant to assess clinically and radiographically the possible predictable
      results regarding the use of nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite bone graft substitute together
      with papilla preservation flap versus papilla preservation flap alone in the treatment of
      periodontal intrabony defects. Patients will be randomly assigned to either test or control
      group. The two groups will be equally prepared for both surgical procedures. Then the
      decision of which group will receive (PPF techniques + Nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite bone
      graft) and which will receive (PPF techniques only) will be taken.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of intrabony defects has been indicated mainly to decrease the residual probing
      depths and so improve tooth prognosis. However, the rationale behind periodontal regeneration
      was to decrease the pocket depth, improve clinical attachment level and achieve bone fill of
      severely compromised tooth. However, application of all regenerative strategies needed to be
      protected by stable soft tissues to avoid exposure and bacterial contamination. That's why
      modified and simplified papilla preservation flap techniques were developed to maintain the
      primary closure of interdental sites. The modified papilla preservation technique was
      developed in order to achieve and maintain primary closure of the flap and to increase the
      ability to create space for regeneration in the interdental area. The modified papilla
      preservation technique could be successfully applied in sites in which the interdental space
      width is at least 2 mm at the most coronal portion of the papilla and in conjunction with a
      variety of regenerative materials as bone grafts. When interdental sites were narrower, a
      different papilla preservation procedure had been proposed, the simplified papilla
      preservation flap In the past years, different Alloplastic synthetic bone graft materials had
      shown clinical acceptance in the treatment of periodontal osseous defects.Recently, it has
      been claimed that there were promising results from using nano-sized ceramics as a class of
      bone graft substitutes due to their improved osseointegration properties. That's why a
      synthetic nanocrystalline hydroxyapeptite bone grafting material has been introduced for the
      augmentation of intrabony defects. This gave the nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite bone graft
      many advantages such as providing a close contact with the surrounding tissues,
      bioresorbability and extremely high number of nano-sized particles and molecules on the
      surface.

    <description>Papilla preservation flap techniques will be conducted to gain access to the intrabony defects. In the narrow interproximal spaces (≤2 mm), incision with the preservation of the buccal papilla according to the simplified papilla preservation technique will be applied. Whereas, in the wide interdental spaces (&gt;2 mm), the modified papilla preservation technique will be applied. Vertical or horizontal mattress sutures and additional interrupted single sutures will be performed to obtain primary closure of the interdental space.</description>

Before suturing the flap, nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite bone graft substitute(Dentaurum, Germany) will be placed within the defect up to the existing level of the alveolar crest and care will be taken not to overfill the defect. The mucoperiosteal flaps will be repositioned and secured in place using non-resorbable # 6-0-suturing material. Vertical or horizontal mattress sutures and additional interrupted single sutures will be performed to obtain primary closure of the interdental space.</description>
