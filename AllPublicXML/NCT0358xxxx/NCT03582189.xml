  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single centre, single arm, prospective feasibility study that aims to see whether
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a source of image guidance before each radiation
      treatment fraction is feasible, and also if it may provide information that could potentially
      be used during the treatment to improve the radiation treatment plan.

      Patients will have 5 MRIs with each of their RT sessions. If patients' RT treatment will
      consist of more than 5 fractions, only 5 MRIs will be done with any 5 RT fractions. Patients
      will be completing a short questionnaire at the end of each MRI. A patient questionnaire will
      also be completed at the end of the study to assess for patient satisfaction.

      There will be 30 evaluable patients enrolled to the study.
