  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes (T2D) in youth is increasing in prevalence in parallel with the obesity
      epidemic. In the US, almost half of patients with renal failure have DKD, and ≥80% have T2D.
      Compared to adult-onset T2D, youth with T2D have a more aggressive phenotype with greater
      insulin resistance (IR), more rapid β-cell decline and higher prevalence of diabetic kidney
      disease (DKD), arguing for separate and dedicated studies in youth-onset T2D. Hyperfiltration
      is common in youth with T2D, and predicts progressive DKD. Hyperfiltration may also be
      associated with early changes in intrarenal hemodynamic function, including increased renal
      plasma flow (RPF) and glomerular pressure. Despite the high prevalence and gravity of DKD in
      youth-onset T2D, widely effective therapeutic options are lacking. The investigators'
      preliminary data support a strong association between IR and hyperfiltration in youth-onset
      T2D, but the pathology contributing to this relationship remains unclear. A better
      understanding of the pathophysiology underlying hyperfiltration and its relationship with IR
      is critical to inform development of new therapeutics. The investigators' overarching
      hypotheses are that: 1) hyperfiltration in youth-onset T2D is associated with changes in
      intrarenal hemodynamics, resulting in increased renal oxygen demand, 2) the demand is unmet
      by the inefficient fuel profile associated with IR (decreased glucose oxidation and increase
      free fatty acid [FFA] oxidation), resulting in renal hypoxia and ultimately renal damage. To
      address these hypotheses, the investigators will measure peripheral insulin sensitivity,
      adipose insulin sensitivity (FFA suppression), glomerular filtration rate (GFR), RPF, and
      renal oxygenation in youth with T2D (n=60), obesity (n=20) and in lean (n=20) controls. To
      further investigate the mechanisms of renal damage in youth with T2D, two optional procedures
      are included in the study: 1) kidney biopsy procedure and 2) induction of induced pluripotent
      stem cells (iPSCs) to assess morphometrics and genetic expression of renal tissue.
