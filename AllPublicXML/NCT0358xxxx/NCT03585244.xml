  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a completely text-messaging based study and all data will be collected via surveys
      administered on a mobile phone. For this study, we will gather and analyze data on changes in
      body weight over a 6-month interval in individuals aged 12 and over. This will help us learn
      more about the normal variation in weight, over time, in the PWS population.

      The incidence and natural history of several PWS symptoms are poorly defined. In this
      text-messaging based study we will gather and analyze data on changes in body weight over a
      6-month interval, in individuals aged 12 and over. We would like to learn about the normal
      weight variation in the PWS population.

      We anticipate that this study will inform future clinical trials for hyperphagia/obesity
      related therapies, and provide a basis for understanding how well potential therapies are
      working. For this study, there will be no intervention and the all data will be collected via
      texting.
