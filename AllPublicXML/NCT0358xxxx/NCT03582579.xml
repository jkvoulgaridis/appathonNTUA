  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of brain training in a Virtual
      Reality set up in neurotypical populations as well as in the traumatic brain injury
      population.

    <textblock>
      Brain training is a large and a growing field, both scientifically and commercially. Emerging
      evidence demonstrates that training can promote beneficial brain plasticity in both healthy
      individuals and clinical populations. Much of the recent interest in brain training can be
      traced back to the seminal work done at the University of Rochester, where Daphne Bavelier
      and colleagues showed that training with action video games (AVG) can lead to a wide range of
      cognitive and perceptual improvements. In our recent work, we developed a novel training
      paradigm that isolates and concentrates the key aspects of AVG-training while eliminating
      complex and often violent gameplay associated with AVGs. The results revealed similarly broad
      effects of training as with conventional AVGs. In this study, we aim to move this training
      paradigm to virtual reality (VR) and extend its application to cognitive aging and mild
      traumatic brain injury (TBI) populations.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        A person is eligible for inclusion in the study if he/she:

          -  Is an adult over the age of 18.

          -  Has the capacity to give consent.

          -  Has normal or corrected to normal vision.

          -  Has adequate hearing.

          -  Is a non-action video game player.

          -  Is a non-VR game player. All subjects will be assigned to one of four groups: a
             Control Group training in VR, a Control Groups training on a 2D display, an Older
             Adult Group without dementia training in VR, and a College Athletes with mild TBI
             Group training in VR.
