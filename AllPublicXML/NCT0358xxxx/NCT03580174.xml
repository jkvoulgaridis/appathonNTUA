      The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of Physiotherapy and rehabilitation
      program on body functions and structures, activity and participation levels, personal and
      environmental factors following Multilevel Botulinum toxin (BT) injections on ambulatory
      children with Cerebral Palsy (CP). Two physiotherapy and rehabilitation methods which are
      structural goal directed activity based physiotherapy (intervention group; 10 children with
      ambulatory Cerebral Palsy) and unstructured routine physiotherapy (control group; 10 children
      with ambulatory Cerebral Palsy) will be compared.

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of Physiotherapy and rehabilitation
      program following Multilevel Botulinum toxin (BT) injections on ambulatory children with
      Cerebral Palsy (CP). Children who are 3-12 years, have Diplegic CP, able to walk with/without
      support (between GMFCS level I-III), have multilevel botulinum toxin injections to lower
      extremity muscles, able to communicate, whose parents agree to participate will include in
      this study. Children who had lower extremity surgery in last six months, who have repeated BT
      during the study, do not want to continue the study will exclude the current study. It is
      planned to receive at least 20 children with CP. Children will be divided into two groups:
      ten children in routine physiotherapy (RPT) group (traditional methods, stretch, massage
      etc.) and ten children in goal directed activity based physical therapy (GDPT) group
      (structural concept).

      Routine Physiotherapy (RPT) group: Ten children with CP will RPT applications will consist of
      unstructured stretching exercises, massage, passive range of motions, muscle strengthening,
      orthotics etc.) .

      Goal Directed Activity Based Physical Therapy (GDPT) group: Ten children with CP will receive
      structural, comprehensive activity based, goal directed therapy protocol one hour in a
      session, 2 times in a week during 8 weeks. GDPT will be a structural protocol and consists of
      daily life activities as sit to stand and reach, treadmill exercises, balance exercises with
      bosu-ball, orthotics, home program, following with exercise-diary.

      Hypothesis 1: GDPT program applied after multilevel BT injection in children with CP affects
      the body structure and functions.

      Hypothesis 2: GDPT program applied after multilevel BT injection in children with CP affects
      the activity.

      Hypothesis 3: GDPT program applied after multilevel BT injection in children with CP affects
      the participation.

      Hypothesis 4: GDPT after BT injection in children with CP affects the activity of the child
      more than RPT.

      The first evaluation will be made in the first week after BT injection. After 8 weeks therapy
      program is applied, the second evaluation will be made.

      The assessments to be implemented under the International Classification of Functioning (ICF)
      framework are as follows:

      Body structure and functions

        -  Muscle tone (Modified Ashworth Scale-MAS)

        -  Muscle Strength (with Manual Muscle Tester Device)

        -  Lower Extremity Selective Motor Control (Selective Control Assessment of Lower
           Extremity- SCALE)

        -  Spatiotemporal characteristics of gait (Gait trainer)

      Activity and participation:

        -  Balance (Pediatric Balance Scale- PBS)

           . Trunk Control (Trunk Control Measurement Scale -TCMS)

        -  Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (PEDI)

        -  Gait Analysis (Modified Physician Rating Scale (MPRS); Gillette Functional Gait
           Assessment)

        -  Motor Function (Gross Motor Function Measurement -GMFM)

      Personal and Environmental Factors:

      Level of anxiety and satisfaction of parents and children will be rated between 11-point
      scale on self reported questionnaire.

    <measure>Modified Physician Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Modified Physicians' Rating Scale (MPRS) is an observational tool that has been used to evaluate gait and assess the outcome of botulinum toxin injection in children with cerebral palsy. This is a scale adapted from the Physicians rating scale which was created to examine the gait of children with CP in the sagittal plane after botulinum toxin A for equinus gait. It is a scale with 8 sections where you score both the left and right lower extremity from video record of child's gait. The score ranged 0 to 22 point. A perfect score would be a 22 on each limb. MPRS should be observed from front and sides of children with CP.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Manual Muscle Test</measure>
    <time_frame>10 min</time_frame>
    <description>Manual muscle tester (hand held dynamometer) will use for quantifying objectively strength of lower extremity muscles. Dynamometry provides an objective measure of isometric strength against examiner resistance by quantifying the mechanical force or torque. Hand-held dynamometry (HHD) was used to measure the force (in Newtons) generated during an isometric contraction. This device records force for intervals of 0.1 N up to a maximum 99.9 N, thereafter in whole Newtons. These were recorded in order, as trials 1 to 3.</description>

    <measure>Modified Ashworth Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>5 min</time_frame>
    <description>Tone of lower extremity muscles will be assessed with Modified Ashworth Scale. The Modified Ashworth scale s (MAS) is the most frequently cited of the available clinical rating scales to measure tonal abnormality. It is already being used to evaluate the effects of drug treatments for spasticity. The spasticity of each muscle ranged between 0 to 5. (0:No increase in muscle tone,1:Slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch and release or by minimal resistance at the end of the range of motion when the affected part(s) is(are) moved in flexion or extension, 2: Slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch followed by minimal resistance through the remainder of the range of motion but the affected part(s) is(are) easily moved, 3;More marked increase in muscle tone through most of the range of movement, but affected part(s) easily moved, 4:Considerable increase in muscle tone, passive movement difficult, 5:Affected part(s) is(are) rigid in flexion or extension).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Selective Control Assessment of Lower Extremity</measure>
    <time_frame>3 min</time_frame>
    <description>Lower Extremity Selective Motor Control will be evaluated with Selective Control Assessment of Lower Extremity (SCALE). The SCALE tool was designed for clinical administration and scoring by health car e professionals, to be used without specialized equipment. The tool includes 'Directions for Administration,' 'Instructions for Grading,' and a 'Score Sheet.' Hip , knee, ankle, sub-talar, and toe joints are assessed bilaterally. Selective movement control is graded at each joint as 'Normal' (2 points), 'Impaired' (1 point), or 'Unable' (0 points). The higher point is the better selectivity of movement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Trunk Control Measurement Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>15 min</time_frame>
    <description>Trunk Control will be assessed with Trunk Control Measurement Scale (TCMS) in children with CP. The TCMS divided three sub-dimensions like as static sitting balance, selective movement control and dynamic reaching. The maximum value for the total TCMS is 58 (20 points for the category static sitting balance, 28 points for selective movement control and 10 for dynamic reaching). A higher TCMS scores indicates a better performance in trunk control.</description>
