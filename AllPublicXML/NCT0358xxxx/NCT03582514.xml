  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pre-operative brain irradiation in GBM (POBIG) is a phase I-II study assessing the
      feasibility, safety and efficacy to irradiate (partially) the tumor in patients with a high
      suspicion of glioblastoma (GBM). After the single fraction of radiotherapy, patients will
      receive the standard treatment. The standard treatment consists of resection of the tumor
      followed by (chemo)radiation (i.e. radiotherapy +/- daily temozolomide (75mg/m2) for 6 weeks
      (60Gy/30fr) or for 3 weeks (40Gy/15fr)) and (if indicated) adjuvant temozolomide
      (150-200mg/m2, 5/28 days, 6 cycles).

    <description>Patients with a biopsy proven GBM referred to our hospital or patients who are diagnosed with GBM based on the MRI (judged by the neuro-oncology multidisciplinary team) are to be considered for this study.
This GBM study assesses the feasibility, safety and efficacy of a preoperative single fraction. The phase-I part has a 3+3 dose or volume escalation design. The choice of dose or volume escalation is based on tumor volume and location. After the single fraction of radiotherapy, patients will receive the standard treatment.</description>

          -  18 years or older

          -  Newly diagnosed GBM (based on MRI imaging or biopsy)

          -  Ability to undergo standard treatment consisting of (chemo)radiation and surgery (i.e.
             KPS &gt; 70, indication that more than 70% of the tumor can be removed during surgery)

          -  Neuro-oncology multidisciplinary team* consensus to include the patient for the
             current study

          -  Signed written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior or second invasive malignancy, except non-melanoma skin cancer, completely
             resected cervical or prostate cancer (with PSA of less than or equal to 0.1 ng/ml)

          -  Suspicion of primary tumor on CT thorax/abdomen in case no biopsy is available

          -  Inability to secure a &quot;cold-spot&quot; in the tumor (volume of 2 cc of the contrast
             enhancing tumor that should not receive irradiation dose, see Chapter 2 and 4)

          -  Inability to secure radiotherapy dose constraints for organs at risk for either the
             neoadjuvant stereotactic radiosurgery or adjuvant fractionated radiotherapy (see
             Chapter 2 and 4)
