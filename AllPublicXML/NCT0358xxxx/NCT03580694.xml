  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this trial is to study REGN4659 and cemiplimab in treatment-experienced,
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. There are 2 phases of this study: a dose
      escalation phase and a dose expansion phase.

        KEY Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with histologically or cytologically documented squamous or non-squamous
             NSCLC with unresectable stage IIIB or stage IV disease

          2. Combination dose escalation cohorts: Treatment-experienced patients who have received
             no more than 3 lines of systemic therapy including no more than 2 lines of cytotoxic
             chemotherapy, and for whom no available therapy has a high probability to convey
             clinical benefit.

          3. Dose escalation cohort C: Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 naïve patients who have received 1 to 2
             prior lines of cytotoxic chemotherapy including a platinum doublet-containing regimen

          4. Expansion cohort(s): Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 experienced patients who have progressed while
             receiving therapy or within 6 months of stopping therapy for stage III or IV disease.
             Patients must not have permanently discontinued anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy due to
             treatment related AE. Patients must have received one line of anti-PD--1/PD-L1
             immunotherapy. Patients may also have received one line of chemotherapy

        KEY Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Expansion cohort(s) only: Patients who have never smoked, defined as smoking ≤100
             cigarettes in a lifetime

          2. Active or untreated brain metastases or spinal cord compression. Patients are eligible
             if central nervous system (CNS) metastases are adequately treated and patients have
             neurologically returned to baseline (except for residual signs or symptoms related to
             the CNS treatment) for at least 2 weeks prior to enrollment. Patients must be off
             (immunosuppressive doses of) corticosteroid therapy

          3. Expansion cohort(s) only: Patients with tumors tested positive for epidermal growth
             factor receptor (EGFR) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene mutations or ROS1
             fusions.

          4. Radiation therapy within 2 weeks prior to enrollment and not recovered to baseline
             from any AE due to radiation

          5. Patients who received prior treatment with an anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated
             protein 4 (CTLA-4) antibody

          6. Previous treatment with idelalisib (ZYDELIG®) at any time
