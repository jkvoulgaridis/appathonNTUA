  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this diagnostic performance study is that, for patients treated for
      immunotherapy-treated melanoma or NSCLC, some metabolic parameters of the 18FDG dual-point
      PET scan distinguish inflammatory pseudo-progression from tumor progression true and thus
      improve the evaluation of tumor response to immunotherapy

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The originality of this study is based on the stakes of the early prediction of resistance to
      immunotherapy (early therapeutic escapes, side effects, cost of treatment etc.).

      No prospective study has been published to date on the value of 18FDG PET to distinguish
      between true tumor progression and pseudo-progression. Studies are therefore needed to define
      new criteria for evaluating the metabolic response specific to immunotherapy, as well as the
      optimal timing of the interim examination.

      The goal is to conduct a transversal, non-randomized, prospective, multi-center, diagnostic
      performance study, harmonizing the moments of the 18FDG PET scans, acquisition conditions and
      interpretation criteria. The use of a dual-point acquisition in PET will also make it
      possible to judge the kinetics of 18FDG lesion capture (calculation of the 18FDG retention
      index on the late image) with the objective of highlighting PET criteria to distinguish
      between inflammatory pseudo-progression and true tumor progression in patients with
      unresectable melanoma or advanced or metastatic NSCLC. Other metabolic parameters will be
      studied, such as changes in tumor metabolic volume and binding intensities.

      Finally, this study will include patients to assess the correlation between the metabolic
      tumor response observed after 7 weeks of immunotherapy, the morphological response after 3
      months of treatment (RECIST v1.1 and i-RECIST) and survival overall at 1 year.
