  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AROMA study is a randomised controlled parallel-group single-site study. Patients randomized
      in the experimental group benefit from the aromatherapy at their arrival in the operating
      theatre in the recovery room. 2 drops of essential oils are applied on a compress placed next
      to the head of the patient. This compress is kept until the patient is leaving the operating
      theatre. Patients randomized in the control group don't benefit from the aromatherapy. The
      anxiety evolution is measured in both groups with the Amsterdam Preoperative Anxiety and
      Information Scale (APAIS). The hypothesis is that aromatherapy alleviate peri operative
      anxiety during an ambulatory elective upper limb surgery under loco-regional anesthesia.
