  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study aims to investigate whether amniotic fluid injections are a better
      alternative to corticosteroid injections as a conservative treatment for stenosing
      tenosynovitis. Based on results from our most recent pilot study exploring patient outcomes
      after receiving an amnion injection, we were able to observe symptom resolution in more than
      half of the study population. Adverse events were extremely rare and not related to study
      participation. Given the numerous occurrences of successful symptom resolution, the next step
      is to compare patient outcomes to those of patients who receive the standard steroid
      injection. This study will compare outcome measurements of patients who receive amnion
      injections to those who receive steroid injections.
