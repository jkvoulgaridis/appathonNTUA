      Primary Objectives:

        -  Phase I: To assess the safety and tolerability of nivolumab and vorolanib in combination
           in patients with refractory non small cell lung cancer naïve to checkpoint inhibitor
           therapy, non small cell lung cancer progressed on prior checkpoint inhibitor therapy
           considered primary refractory, non small cell lung cancer progressed on prior checkpoint
           inhibitor therapy considered acquired resistance, small cell lung cancer progressed on
           platinum-based chemotherapy, and thymic carcinoma.

        -  Phase II: To evaluate the efficacy as measured by response to the combination nivolumab
           and vorolanib in patients with refractory non small cell lung cancer naïve to checkpoint
           inhibitor therapy, non small cell lung cancer progressed on prior checkpoint inhibitor
           therapy considered primary refractory, non small cell lung cancer progressed on prior
           checkpoint inhibitor therapy considered acquired resistance, small cell lung cancer
           progressed on platinum-based chemotherapy, and thymic carcinoma as compared to
           historical controls.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  Phase I: To assess antitumor activity as measured by response rate for this novel
           combination.

        -  Phase II: To assess, safety, progression free survival and overall survival

      Exploratory Objectives:

      • To assess the effects of combinatorial treatment on specific pharmacodynamic and
      pharmacogenetic biomarkers including PD-L1 expression and tumor mutation burden.

                  anti-estrogen/androgen therapy or bisphosphonates) is ongoing or required during
                  the trial period: non-melanoma skin cancers (e.g. basal or squamous cell);
                  superficial bladder cancer; or carcinoma in situ of the prostate, cervix, or

             participation; or to prohibit the understanding or rendering of informed consent or
             anticipated compliance with and interpretation of scheduled visits, treatment
             schedule, laboratory tests and other study requirements.
