  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is associated with long-lasting health, social and financial burden for
      patients, families, caregivers and society. Unfortunately, 25-30% of schizophrenia patients
      respond poorly to antipsychotic medication. Moreover, psychotherapeutic treatment
      alternatives are very limited for this suffering population. This unmet clinical need
      requires innovation and action. Psychotherapeutic treatment alternatives such as Cognitive
      Behavior Therapy (CBT) provide at best moderate results. Using immersive virtual reality, we
      recently tested a novel psychotherapeutic intervention, Avatar Therapy (AT), where the
      therapist engages in a dialogue with the patient through a virtual representation of the
      patient's distressing voice. This approach, being both relational and experiential, provides
      a unique opportunity to aid patients gain control over their voice. The results of our pilot
      study on AT were clinically promising for the severity and distress related to
      hallucinations, positive symptomatology and emotion regulation. To further research in this
      field, the primary goal of this randomized-controlled, single-site parallel study is to show
      that AT is superior to CBT for the treatment of persistent auditory hallucinations in
      schizophrenia. Our secondary goal is to examine the effects of these interventions on emotion
      regulation, mood symptoms (anxiety and depression), self-esteem, level of functioning and
      quality of life.

    <description>Participants will be offered 9 individual and weekly sessions of 1 hour, which will be administered in an individual format by a licensed psychologist or psychiatrist trained in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for psychosis (CBTp). The program is derived and adapted from current evidence-based treatments for hallucinations. The 9 CBTp sessions will consist of a succession of learning modules and suggested task assignments.</description>

    <description>Participants will be offered 9 individual and weekly sessions of 1 hour, which will be administered in an individual format by a licensed psychologist or psychiatrist experienced with psychosis patients. The therapy will consist in prompting participants to enter in a dialogue with their persecutor to better regulate their emotional responses. Over the course of the therapy, the avatar's speech and tone will gradually be changed by the therapist to echo participants' improved ability to regulate their emotions. That is, the avatar will progressively change from being abusive to becoming helpful and supportive. By doing so, the therapy will seek to reinforce participants' feeling of empowerment over their voices.</description>
