  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigated the ability of two zinc-containing toothpaste formulations (Zinc A
      and Zinc B) to reduce the level of bacteria in saliva in the two-hour period after their use,
      compared to the effect of rinsing with water alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a single centre, three treatment, randomized, blinded, cross-over study which
      involved rinsing with slurries of two sodium fluoride-silica dentifrices containing zinc
      chloride and sodium citrate, and with water alone. The study consisted of four Visits: Visit
      1 (Screening), Visit 2 (Treatment 1), Visit 3 (Treatment 2), Visit 4 (Treatment 3). There was
      a minimum two days wash out period before the first treatment visit and between treatment
      visits to avoid any treatment carry-over effect. During that time participants brushed as
      normal (twice-daily) at home with a washout toothpaste and a toothbrush which was provided at
      screening. Participants were required not to brush their teeth on the morning of the
      treatment visits and not to eat or drink for 2 hours prior to the treatment visits.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Area Under the Curve Between 0 and 2 Hours (AUC [0-2] Hours) for Total Viable Counts (TVCs) of Bacteria in Saliva Using Traditional Plating Technique</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline in log10-transformed AUC 0-2hr</time_frame>
    <description>Area Under the Curve (AUC) between 0 and 2 hours (hr) was assessed using traditional plating technique which provides the total viable counts (TVCs) of anaerobic bacteria. This outcome measure is AUC of change from baseline in log TVC. AUC for each time-point were calculated individually for each participant for each treatment and were aggregated into an AUC measurement. The aggregated AUC measurement was calculated in the order that first the collected data is logged which is further analyzed by change in log. Then, AUC 0-2hr change in log was calculated using the trapezoidal rule. The resulted values were then divided by 2hr to take out time units and are logged to calculate bacteria count. Hence, the outcome measure calculates change from baseline in log10-transformed AUC 0-2hr over the range from pre-treatment time point (0hr) to the concentration at 120 minutes (min) i.e., 2hr.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in AUC (0-2) Hours for the Ratio of Live:Dead Bacteria Using Live-dead Staining Technique</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 2 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Anaerobic bacteria were counted using live:dead staining technique. Change from baseline in AUC (0-2)hr was calculated for the ratio of live and dead bacteria. Viable bacterial counts for each time-point were calculated individually for each participant for each treatment and were aggregated into an AUC measurement. AUC was calculated using the trapezoidal rule and using nominal time points. The resulted values were then divided by 2hr to take out time units. The AUC was calculated over the range from pre-treatment time point (0hr) to 2hr. In this outcome measure, the change from baseline is calculated in log ratio of live: dead.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Area Under the Curve Between 0 and 2 Hours (AUC [0-2] Hours) for Total Viable Counts (TVCs) of Bacteria in Saliva Using Traditional Plating Technique</title>
        <description>Area Under the Curve (AUC) between 0 and 2 hours (hr) was assessed using traditional plating technique which provides the total viable counts (TVCs) of anaerobic bacteria. This outcome measure is AUC of change from baseline in log TVC. AUC for each time-point were calculated individually for each participant for each treatment and were aggregated into an AUC measurement. The aggregated AUC measurement was calculated in the order that first the collected data is logged which is further analyzed by change in log. Then, AUC 0-2hr change in log was calculated using the trapezoidal rule. The resulted values were then divided by 2hr to take out time units and are logged to calculate bacteria count. Hence, the outcome measure calculates change from baseline in log10-transformed AUC 0-2hr over the range from pre-treatment time point (0hr) to the concentration at 120 minutes (min) i.e., 2hr.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in AUC (0-2) Hours for the Ratio of Live:Dead Bacteria Using Live-dead Staining Technique</title>
        <description>Anaerobic bacteria were counted using live:dead staining technique. Change from baseline in AUC (0-2)hr was calculated for the ratio of live and dead bacteria. Viable bacterial counts for each time-point were calculated individually for each participant for each treatment and were aggregated into an AUC measurement. AUC was calculated using the trapezoidal rule and using nominal time points. The resulted values were then divided by 2hr to take out time units. The AUC was calculated over the range from pre-treatment time point (0hr) to 2hr. In this outcome measure, the change from baseline is calculated in log ratio of live: dead.</description>
