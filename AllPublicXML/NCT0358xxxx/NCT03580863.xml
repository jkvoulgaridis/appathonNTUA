  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since 80's, admissions in Emergency medical services increase regularly. Children represents
      30% of the patients in Emergency medical Service. Only 20% of admissions are hospitalized and
      only 3 % need emergency care. Consequences are team's exhaustion, a reduction of healthcare
      quality, a slowdown in emergency care.

      Investigator decided to realize an epidemiologic prospective study in Emergency medical and
      surgical Pediatric Service in Strasbourg Teaching Hospital to compare coverage of children
      who are referred by a liberal doctor with children who are coming by themselves matched with
      age and complaint.

      This study will analyze the relevance of complaints and decision-making factors for the
      liberal doctor to send children in Emergency Medical and Surgical Service. Investigator will
      talk about the importance of close collaboration between liberal doctor and hospital doctor,
      as well as patient's information about basic care service on nights and week-ends in order to
      decrease the number of emergency admission.
