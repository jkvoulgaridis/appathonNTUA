  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Reduced antiplatelet activity (low response (LR)/high on-treatment platelet reactivity (HPR))
      of aspirin (ALR) or clopidogrel (CLR) is associated with an increased risk of thromboembolic
      events. The prevalence figures for low-responders reported in the literature vary widely and
      there have been few investigations in vascular surgery patients to date. The aim of this
      prospective monocentric study was to increase the evidence base on vascular surgery patients
      and to detect any changes in the response following vascular surgery procedures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The activity of aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid, ASA) and clopidogrel is measured by whole
      blood impedance aggregometry using a multiple electrode aggregometer (Multiplate). The
      agonists used are arachidonic acid for aspirin and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) for
      clopidogrel. Vascular patients requiring treatment for peripheral artery disease (PAD) and/or
      carotid stenosis are included in the study. To identify possible risk factors demographic
      data, concomitant medication, laboratory parameters, co-morbidities, severity of the
      condition and the type of procedure performed are documented. In addition, a follow-up
      aggregometry is performed after completion of the vascular procedure.
