  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this feasibility study is to evaluate Dads in Gear, a tailored program to
      support expectant and new fathers efforts to quit smoking. The 8 week group program
      integrates peer support and resources to support cessation, physical activity, and knowledge
      and skills related to fathering.

    <textblock>
      Using a prospective, non-comparative design, the DIG program is implemented and evaluated in
      6 communities in this feasibility study. The program is offered by trained facilitators to
      fathers who currently smoke and want to quit. The RE-AIM framework is used to guide the
      evaluation. Open-ended questions in participant surveys, and semi-structured interviews and
      weekly telephone de-briefs with facilitators provide data for a process evaluation. Estimates
      of effectiveness include smoking behavior, fathering and physical activity measures at
      baseline, end of program, and 3-month follow up.

    <description>Fathering Self-efficacy Scale developed by Sevigney et al. (2016) is a measure of men's perceptions of their abilities (self-efficacy) related to parenting and fatherhood. Two of the three sub-scales in this tool will be used: Positive engagement (12 items; with scores ranging from 12 - 120) and direct care (4 items, with scores ranging from 4 - 40). A 10-point Likert scale response format is used for each item. The item scores in each sub-scale will be summed to obtain sub-scale scores. Sub-scale scores are summed for total Father Self-Efficacy score (range 16-160). Higher scores indicate better self-efficacy.</description>
