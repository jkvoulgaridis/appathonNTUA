    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the safety of administering single ascending doses (150, 300, 600, and
      900 mg) of a citrus extract of the flavonoid narigenin, and assesses the blood concentrations
      of naringenin following oral administration of the extract.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Naringenin is a component of food with therapeutic potential to improve glucose metabolism.
      In order to explore the mechanisms by which naringenin may increase energy expenditure and
      improve glucose metabolism in humans, it is of vital importance that the safety,
      tolerability, and bioavailability of naringenin are evaluated, when administered to humans.
      This study tests the safety of four doses of a citrus extract of naringenin and measures
      serum concentrations of naringenin at the 150 mg and 600 mg doses over a period of 24 hours,
      and at the 300 and 900 mg doses at four hours after subjects have been given the respective
      doses of naringenin.

    <intervention_model_description>The study consists of two cohorts of nine subjects each. In the first cohort subjects will receive the 150 mg dose and proceed to the 300 mg dose only if the 150 mg dose is deemed safe. The study is a double blind randomized controlled crossover trial, therefore, subjects could receive a placebo at the first or second visit. Similarly in the second cohort, 600 mg and 900 mg doses will be evaluated.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of Treatment-emergent Adverse Events Following a Single Dose of a Citrus Extract of Naringenin</measure>
    <time_frame>Adverse events were collected over approximately five weeks which included three study days and two washout periods of at least one week.</time_frame>
    <description>All adverse events will be recorded following the first administration of the study product or placebo. The study physician in consultation with the coordinator will review and determine whether a subject can be administered the next ascending dose. The cohorts will be run in series. There will be an interval of up to four weeks between the two cohorts. During this time an interim analysis will be conducted and a safety summary of adverse events for Cohort 1 will be compiled and reviewed by the investigators. Dose safety will be investigated by compiling by treatment (e.g. 150 mg dose, 300 mg dose, placebo) a list of adverse events. The frequency of these events will be counted and compared with the placebo group.</description>

        <title>Incidence of Treatment-emergent Adverse Events Following a Single Dose of a Citrus Extract of Naringenin</title>
        <description>All adverse events will be recorded following the first administration of the study product or placebo. The study physician in consultation with the coordinator will review and determine whether a subject can be administered the next ascending dose. The cohorts will be run in series. There will be an interval of up to four weeks between the two cohorts. During this time an interim analysis will be conducted and a safety summary of adverse events for Cohort 1 will be compiled and reviewed by the investigators. Dose safety will be investigated by compiling by treatment (e.g. 150 mg dose, 300 mg dose, placebo) a list of adverse events. The frequency of these events will be counted and compared with the placebo group.</description>

For example, appropriate questions included: “How are you feeling?”, “Have you had any (other) medical problems since your last visit/contact?” The study staff established a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. Subjects were asked about adverse events at each visit to the clinic for testing.</desc>
