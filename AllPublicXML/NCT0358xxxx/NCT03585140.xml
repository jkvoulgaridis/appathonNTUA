      Clinical trial to determine the effect of adding a diet with low glycemic index and load to
      adults for the treatment of moderate acne. Adult patients with acne where recruited in two
      groups, A and B. Group A received a normal diet according to their metabolic status and group
      B received a diet with low glycemic index and load. Outcomes were measured at week 12.

      Clinical trial to determine the effect of adding a diet with low glycemic index and load to
      adults for the treatment of moderate acne. Adult patients with acne where recruited in two
      groups, A and B. Both groups of treatment were treated with doxycycline 100 mg per day plus
      adapalene 0.1% gel daily for 12 weeks. During pharmacologic treatment, all patients had
      nutrition counseling monthly. Group A received a normal diet according to their metabolic
      status and group B received a diet with low glycemic index and load. At the end of the trial,
      the change in acne lesions count was analyzed and also their metabolic status. Quality of
      life was also measured.
