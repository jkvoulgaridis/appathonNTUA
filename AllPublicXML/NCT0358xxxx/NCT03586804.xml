  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study was planned with the aim of comparison of postural sway responses at menstrual
      cycles in women with and without the dysmenorrheal syndrome.

      Women will stand on a postural sway evaluation system on the first day of the menstrual
      cycles and a well-being day which they will select. Every participant will be evaluated same
      tool. They will be assessed for three times at every session: 1st evaluation will be
      performed at the normal standing position. 2nd evaluation will be performed at the normal
      standing position while individuals saying the numbers from 200 to 1. 3rd evaluation will be
      performed at the normal standing position while individuals holding the mini blocks on their
      hands.
