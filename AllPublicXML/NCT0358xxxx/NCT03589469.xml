  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase 2 study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of
      Loncastuximab Tesirine (ADCT-402) in patients with relapsed or refractory Diffuse Large
      B-Cell Lymphoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, multi-center, open-label, single-arm study of the efficacy and safety of
      loncastuximab tesirine used as monotherapy in patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL. The
      study will enroll approximately 140 patients

      Loncastuximab Tesirine is an antibody drug conjugate (ADC) composed of a humanized antibody
      directed against human cluster of differentiation 19 (CD19), stochastically conjugated via a
      valine-alanine cleavable, maleimide linker to a pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimer cytotoxin.
      Loncastuximab tesirine has been designed to target and kill CD19-expressing malignant
      B-cells.

      A 2-stage design will be used in this clinical study, with an interim analysis for futility
      on the first 52 patients. If ≥10 patients respond (CR+PR), the study will proceed to complete
      full enrollment. Enrollment will continue during the interim analysis; however, further
      enrollment will be halted if futility is confirmed.

      For each patient, the study will include a Screening Period (of up to 28 days), a Treatment
      Period (cycles of 3 weeks), and a Follow-up Period (approximately every 12 week visits for up
      to 3 years after treatment discontinuation).

      Patients may continue treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or other
      discontinuation criteria, whichever occurs first.

    <description>EQ-5D-5L is designed as an international, standardized, instrument for describing and evaluating QoL. The EQ-5D-5L consists of two parts:
The descriptive system: QoL is classified according to five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension comprises five levels of perceived problems (e.g., none, slight, moderate, severe, extreme).
The visual analog scale (VAS): patients are asked to indicate their health state today on a VAS with the endpoints labeled 'the best health you can imagine' (score 100) and 'the worst health you can imagine' (score 0).Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Lymphoma (FACT-Lym)(EQ-5D-5L)</description>

    <description>FACT-Lym is a lymphoma-specific subscale for the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) questionnaire. It consists of 15 specific items that are used together with the core 27-item questionnaire FACT-G (General). The patient is asked to respond to each item with a score of 0-4, where 0 = not at all, 1 = a little bit, 2 = somewhat, 3 = quite a bit, 4 = very much. A higher score equals a worse level of QoL.</description>
