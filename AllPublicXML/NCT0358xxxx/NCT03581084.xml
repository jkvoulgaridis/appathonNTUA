  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the beneficial effect of n-acetylcysteine (NAC), an
      inhaled medication that breaks down mucus, on lung function. NAC is a medication approved by
      the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of chronic diseases of the
      respiratory system, including asthma. With CT lung imaging, the investigators seek to
      identify a subgroup of patients with asthma with a 'mucus' profile. This is a single-arm
      study which means all participants will receive the same treatment.

    <textblock>
      N-acetylcystine (NAC) is a mucolytic medication, meaning that it breaks apart mucus.
      Investigators know that mucus is a factor in severe asthma attacks. However, mucus may be a
      factor in chronic severe asthma as well. This role has been hard to prove because of
      difficulty in showing that mucus occludes the lumen in chronic severe disease. Using a novel
      approach of scoring mucus occlusion, investigators have used CT imaging to uncover that a
      majority of people with severe asthma have at least one lung segment with a mucus plug and
      27% have more than four lung segments with mucus plugs.

      Historically, studies of mucolytics, like NAC, have not shown benefit in other obstructive
      lung diseases, like COPD. However, utilizing CT mucus scores as a biomarker, investigators
      believe that mucolytic treatment may prove useful for those with significant mucus impaction.

      This is a single-arm study of participants with asthma who also have evidence of mucus in
      their lungs as determined by CT imaging. Investigators hypothesize that by treating
      asthmatics, chosen based on the presence of mucus in the airways, with a mucolytic like NAC,
      will result in an improvement of lung function.

    <description>This study will look at the effects of a medication, called n-acetylcysteine or NAC, on lung function. NAC is already approved for use in people with chronic airway conditions, including asthma. However, it is not known who this medication works best in. We believe this medication will likely have the most benefit in people with asthma that have mucus in their airways or &quot;mucus plugging.&quot; Initial study procedures will include lung function measurements, a low dose CT scan, a blood draw, and a sputum induction. The CT lung imaging will identify asthmatics with mucus plugs.</description>
