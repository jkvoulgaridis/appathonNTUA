  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Closure of cutaneous defects is associated with many common and serious problems. For
      example, Mohs surgery involves the removal of skin and other soft tissues that have been
      proven to be infiltrated with cancer. Iterative stages of Mohs are processed and examined
      microscopically for residual tumor. Using specialized mapping, the surgeon can effectively
      achieve a high cure rate and minimize removal of unaffected tissue. This process usually
      takes a total of 2-3 hours, since the patient waits while the tissue is being processed, and
      complete clearance of margins can take multiple stages. In many cases, a cutaneous defect is
      produced of significant size. In certain areas of high tension, such as scalp and lower leg,
      this mandates either a lengthy course of wound care or that the surgeon perform a graft or
      flap. In many cases, performance of a graft is undesirable due to lack of vascularity to
      support graft survival. Creation of flaps involves incision and undermining of large areas of
      tissue in order to achieve wound closure. There is a current need for alternatives to graft
      and flaps in these locations.

      Human skin has biomechanical properties that can be harnessed to facilitate closure of larger
      wounds. Stress-relaxation refers to the natural relaxation exhibited by skin put under a
      given amount of tension (stress) over time. After a period of stress, the force required to
      close the wound is reduced. In a porcine skin wound model, there is a 40-60% reduction in
      stress after twenty minutes of stretch relaxation.

      There are several classic methods of delivering this stretch to skin intraoperatively. Most
      simply, a towel clamp can be used to bring edges together. However, the clamp, which is a
      sharp stainless steel instrument, can damage tissues. There are also commercial devices such
      as TopClosure. However, this device is intended for very large wounds with side plates that
      must be sutured or stapled to patient skin.

      The SUTUREGARD device presents a simple method to provide stress to a wound but not damage
      tissue. The SUTUREGARD device results in significantly lower pressure on the skin when
      compared with traditional sutures and creates a much greater volume of wound eversion than is
      possible with a traditional suturing method. Engineering tests performed at OSU showed that a
      given simple interrupted suture will exert about 30% less pressure on the skin when used
      performed with the device compared to without the device. With this protection, this creates
      the corollary that a suture could be safely tied to a greater force with the device than
      without. In animal testing, the device has been used on porcine wounds for up to 6 weeks,
      where it showed superior histologic tolerability over traditional sutures.

      The investigators have used the device to provide stress-relaxation within our clinic over
      the past several months and have seen reductions in wound width of about 30% with retention
      of the device for 30-60 minutes. Wounds exhibit significantly more reduction in width with
      overnight use. Unlike traditional retention sutures, which damage the skin, the skin appears
      normal with retention of the device for up to 2 days in our patients. Furthermore, all wounds
      that have been stress-relaxed with the device have healed without complication.

      The investigators plan to study the stress-relaxation created by use of a SUTUREGARD device
      applied to cutaneous defects for a specified time periods (30, 60 and 90 minutes).

    <description>Peak tension will be measured with a calibrated force gauge (Series 3 Digital Force Gauge; Mark-10 Corporation; Copiague, NY) until the wound edges touch. A clamp will be used to secure the sutures on top of the device between measurements. At each time point (5, 10 and 30 minutes), the clamps will be loosened and the wound allowed to relax. Photographs and measurements will be taken to document the wound size after stress-reduction. The suture will be re-tensioned while measurements of peak tension (as outlined above) are recorded with the force gauge.</description>
