    <textblock>
      A Phase II randomized, placebo controlled study design of anakinra (Kineret) in
      corticosteroid-resistant Meniere's disease (CR-MD)and corticosteroid-resistant autoimmune
      inner ear disease (CR-AIED) patients. Patients will be randomized by a 2:1 allocation to
      anakinra or placebo for 42 continuous days. After day 42, a second placebo-controlled period
      will begin for an additional 42 days. This will be followed by a 264 day observation period,
      during which, hearing declines may be re-treated with anakinra after 30 days following the
      initial drug.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be evaluating whether or not anakinra (kineret) is superior to placebo for
      improving sustained hearing thresholds in patients with CR-MD and CR-AIED. Final enrollment
      is contingent on an acute decline in hearing in the active ear and 2 sequential audiograms
      greater than or equal to 28 days apart that shows a stable or declining hearing threshold and
      word recognition score not improved with corticosteroid therapy. Anakinra (kineret)
      100mg/0.67ml prefilled syringes or placebo injection will be randomized at 2:1 allocation and
      will be self-administered by the patient daily for 42 days. After day 42, a second
      placebo-controlled period will begin for an additional 42 days (all patients will receive
      anakinra for either 42 or 84 days depending on the randomization assignment). A 264 day
      observation period will begin after day 84, during which the option to retreat with anakinra
      will be offered to those patients that responded to the therapy in the first 84 day period.

             ear declines. Active deterioration is defined as a 15dB decline at one frequency
             (excluding 250 or 8kHz as a sole indicator) on their audiogram, or 10dB at 2+
             frequencies developing in &gt; or equal 3 days but &lt; or equal 90 days, or if the hearing
