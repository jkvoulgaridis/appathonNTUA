  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most drugs used in general anesthesia work on various receptors in the human brain, causing
      unconsciousness, loss of memory, and loss of reflection of the autonomic nervous system.
      After the anesthesia, baseline physiological function will be attained by administration of
      some reversal drugs or as the time goes by. In this process, various side effects may occur.

      Emergence delirium (ED) is a representative behavioral disturbance after general anesthesia
      in children and that can cause several problems during the recovery period. Previous studies
      found that ED and postoperative behavioral problems might be connected. Preschoolers are the
      most vulnerable group in developing ED after general anesthesia, however, it is difficult to
      evaluate the psychiatric problems at this age.

      The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) 1.5-5 is an internationally well-known standardized tool
      for assessment of developmental psychopathology, consisted of 99 problem items. Items are
      categorized as following syndrome scales: Emotionally reactive, Anxious/Depressed, Somatic
      complaints, Withdrawn, Attention problems, Aggressive behavior, and sleep problems.

      In this study, the investigators would observe the behavioral and emotional changes of the
      child using the CBCL 1.5-5 between before and after the general anesthesia.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of T-score of total score of child behavior checklist 1.5-5 (CBCL 1.5-5)</measure>
    <time_frame>before anesthesia induction and 1 week after the surgery</time_frame>
    <description>T-score is the scale in order to indicate the relative position within the whole group that has been standardized, the average and standard deviation of the percentile distribution obtained through the origin sum of score. The CBCL 1.5-5 included 99 questions that describe specific kinds of behavioral and emotional problems for preschool children. Questions are scored on syndrome scales designated as emotionally reactive, anxious/depressed, somatic complaints, withdrawn, attention problems, aggressive behavior, and sleep problems. Higher scores mean great behavioral disturbances.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of T-score of each internalizing problems</measure>
    <time_frame>before anesthesia induction and 1 week after the surgery</time_frame>
    <description>T-score is the scale in order to indicate the relative position within the whole group that has been standardized, the average and standard deviation of the percentile distribution obtained through the origin sum of score. Internalizing problems are consisted of following 4 categories : emotionally reactive, withdrawn, somatic complaints, and anxious/depressed.
The subjects are asked to answer the questions with a 3 point scale:
0 for not true of the child; 1 for somewhat or sometimes true, and 2 for very true of often true. The scores for problems were calculated according to the CBCL manuals. Higher scores mean great behavioral disturbances.</description>

    <measure>Emergence Delirium (ED)</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately during 60 min after PACU admission</time_frame>
    <description>Whether ED is occurs during PACU stay in children. The determination of ED was made using parameters PAED &gt;12 and Watcha &gt;2.</description>

    <measure>modified Yale preoperative anxiety score (mYPAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>before anesthesia induction (about 30 min before the surgery)</time_frame>
    <description>mYPAS is the assessment tool for measure the anxiety before induction. Higher score indicates higher anxiety.</description>

    <measure>PAED score during PACU stay</measure>
    <time_frame>During 60 min after PACU admission</time_frame>
    <description>On arrival at post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) and every 10 min from then, patients were checked PAED. The PAED scale is a validated observational measure of 5 aspects of child behavior (caregiver eye contact, purposeful movement, evidence of awareness of surroundings, restlessness, and inconsolability). Ratings are summed to produce a total score ranging from 0 to 20; greater scores indicate greater severity.</description>
