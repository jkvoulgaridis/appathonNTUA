    <textblock>
      Durvalumab is a drug that stimulates the immune system to fight lung cancer. Durvalumab is
      FDA approved to treat lung cancer. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is a newer
      radiation treatment that gives fewer, but higher doses of radiation than standard radiation.

      With SBRT, radiation is focused toward the cancer and away from normal surrounding lung
      tissue. It is possible that when cancer cells are damaged by SBRT Durvalumab may be more
      effective in activating the immune system. SBRT is a standard FDA approved treatment for
      early stage (stage 1) lung cancer and is investigational in patients such as yourself with
      stage 3 lung cancer. The combination of Durvalumab and SBRT is investigational. This study
      will investigate the effects, good and bad, of the combination of Durvalumab and SBRT.
