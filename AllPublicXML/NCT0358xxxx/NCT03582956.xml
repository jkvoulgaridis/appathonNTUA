  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of adiposity on resistance to insulin's
      ability to suppress hepatic glucose production and to stimulate peripheral glucose metabolism
      in adolescents with type 1 diabetes. In addition, this study will also examine the role of
      fatty liver disease on the insulin resistance of obesity in adolescents with type 1 diabetes.

      A major focus of this program of research will be directed at advancing the understanding of
      the metabolic consequences of obesity and puberty in adolescents with T1D. Thus, an
      innovative aspect of this research is that it will be the first to use these sophisticated
      metabolic techniques to examine the effects of obesity and hepatic steatosis on insulin
      sensitivity in pubertal adolescents with T1D; namely, the 2-step hyperinsulinemic euglycemic
      clamp with tracer enhancement, which will allow for definition of hepatic and peripheral
      insulin resistance, glycerol turnover, and glucose and fat oxidation. Further, a second novel
      aspect is that this will be the first study to utilize gold standard MRI methods to quantify
      and compare intrahepatic fat content in lean and obese adolescents with T1D. This will allow
      a global and more detailed understanding of the potential alterations of insulin's effects on
      key insulin sensitive tissues in youth that are impacted by both T1D and obesity.
      Furthermore, evaluation of biomarkers for insulin resistance and fatty liver disease in this
      population will be performed for the first time.
