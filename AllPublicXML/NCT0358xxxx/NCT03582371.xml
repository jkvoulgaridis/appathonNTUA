  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postural instability is associated with falls and a decreased quality of life in Parkinson's
      disease (PD). Evidence supports physical activity rather than levodopa for postural
      instability management. Considering the proven effects of the Stand-up Paddle (SUP) activity
      on postural instability in sedentary people, the investigators wanted to develop this aquatic
      activity in a swimming pool on static conditions (Aqua SUP) for PD patients. The objective is
      to assess the postural instability change by measuring the Mini-Balance Evaluation Systems
      Test (miniBESTest) after 8 weeks of Aqua SUP compared to physiotherapy in PD patients with
      baseline postural instability.

    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is a relentless neurodegenerative disorder leading to functional
      impairment with postural instability. Postural instability is associated with an increased
      risk of falling and a decreased quality of life, and levodopa therapy may only have little
      effect on balance. Evidence supports physiotherapy and physical activity as an alternative
      treatment for postural instability in PD. Several types of physical activity have been tested
      in PD which target different specificities of rehabilitation such as stretching, muscle
      strengthening, balance, occupational therapy, cueing, treadmill training, with contrasting
      data regarding postural instability. The investigators want to develop an innovative physical
      activity with specific focus on the management of the postural instability in PD patients.
      Stand-up Paddle (SUP) is an aquatic sport improving postural instability in sedentary people
      that may be practiced in a swimming pool with static conditions for safety (Aqua SUP).

      In order to assess the effect on postural instability, PD patients with baseline postural
      instability will be scored by Mini-Balance Evaluation Systems Test (miniBESTest) before and
      after 8 weeks of Aqua SUP practice and compared to physiotherapy according to a randomized
      controlled trial with non-inferiority design.

      Patients will be clinically assessed at baseline regarding the primary outcome miniBESTest
      and secondary outcome measures. A secondary visit will take place at 2 months after inclusion
      (Aqua SUP versus physiotherapy). A tertiary visit will be completed at 6 months after
      inclusion to assess long term effects.
