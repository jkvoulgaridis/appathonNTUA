  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Delirium is an acute or subacute comorbid syndrome characterized by decreased awareness and
      cognitive dysfunction accompanied by attention deficit. It varies from 20% to 80%, depending
      on the report. If delirium occurs in intensive care unit, complications such as intubation
      tube and catheter removal that are not desired are increased, mechanical ventilation
      deviation is prolonged, and eventually the intensive care unit is extended. Prevention of
      delirium is therefore very important, but no medication has been found to prevent delirium.

      Recent studies have shown that pro-inflammatory cytokines play an important role in the
      development of delirium, and as a result of the stimulation of the peripheral inflammatory
      reaction, proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin (IL) -6, tumor necrosis factor- ), And
      IL-10) secretion, resulting in the induction of inflammatory responses of the central nervous
      system. In addition, sleep habits have been shown to affect the pro-inflammatory pathway, and
      sleep induction and inactivation of the pro-inflammatory pathway may be expected to prevent
      and treat delirium.

      Dexmedetomidine (DEX) is a highly selective a2-agonist with sedative and analgesic effects
      and reduces sympathetic response to stimuli. Compared to benzodiazepine and opioid, there are
      fewer side effects of respiratory depression.

      In animal studies, the possibility of intrinsic immune suppression of DEX has been
      demonstrated, and recent studies have shown that intravenous DEX administration reduces IL-6,
      IL-8, and TNF-a levels, resulting in anti-inflammatory effects. IL-6 plays a key role in
      neuroinflammation with both proinflammatory cytokines and anti-inflammatory cytokines,
      including infection, traumatic brain injury, ischemia, and neurodegenerative disorders. DEX
      plays a key role in IL-6 stimulated IL-6 And inhibits mRNA expression and thus has a brain
      function-protecting effect. In clinical trials, DEX administration compared with propofol
      decreased IL-6 secretion and decreased post-operative cognitive impairment in ICU patients
      after primary surgery. This is closely related to the formation of inflammatory complexes
      (Inflammasome). In addition, low-dose DEX infusion in patients with ICU at night has a low
      incidence of delirium during the ICU period, and studies have shown that sleep quality is
      improved in the DEX group in the mechanical ventilation group. Patients who did not undergo
      mechanical ventilation also reported improved sleep quality with prophylactic low-dose DEX.
      As such, the definitive mechanism has not yet been clarified, but the use of low-dose DEX is
      increasingly proactively used to improve sleep quality.

      The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of DEX on the inflammatory pathway
      during nighttime after ICU admission and to observe the quality of sleep and the prognosis of
      delirium.

      Delirium is an acute and subacute comorbid syndrome characterized by decreased awareness and
      cognitive dysfunction accompanied by attention deficit. It varies from 20% to 80% in patients
      entering the ICU. If delirium occurs in the intensive care unit, complications such as
      unintended intubation, unintentional drainage, and mechanical ventilation are prolonged.
      Prevention of delirium is therefore very important, but no medication has been found to
      prevent delirium. Recent studies have shown that the pro-inflammatory cytokine affects the
      etiology of delirium. In addition, sleep habits have been shown to affect the
      pro-inflammatory pathway, and sleep induction and inactivation of the pro-inflammatory
      pathway may be expected to prevent and treat delirium.

      DEX is a selective alpha-2 receptor agonist with sedative and anti-anxiety effects and
      reduces sympathetic response due to stimulation. Recent studies have shown that intravenous
      DEX is effective in reducing inflammation by decreasing levels of IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-a.

      This study investigated the effect of dexmedetomidine, which is continuously administered at
      night after ICU admission, on the development of delirium and inflammatory markers, and to
      observe the prognosis. Patients who underwent spine, hip or femur surgery and who were
      admitted to the ICU after institutional exhalation were randomly assigned to the DEX group
      and the control group. Both groups can be combined with remifentanil for appropriate
      postoperative analgesia. The DEX group injects DEX at 0.2 ug / kg / hr from 9 pm to 7 am. The
      control group is inoculated with saline solution. At this time, the patient's blood pressure,
      oxygen saturation and cardiopulmonary function are continuously monitored. If an adverse
      event occurs during DEX sedation, process it and record it. If hypotension occurs, 4 mg of IV
      ephedrine is administered. If hypotension occurs, 4 mg is added or infused with
      norepinephrine. If Bradycardia (HR &lt;45 bpm) occurs, IV glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg is administered.
      If bradycardia persists after administration, administer 0.5 mg IV atropine at a maximum of
      0.5 mg. If respiratory depression (RR &lt;10 / min) and hypoxia (SaO2 &lt;90%) occur, the patient
      may be awakened by loud or mild stimulation. If the respiratory depression and hypoxia
      persist despite these treatments, head extension , and maneuver for airway maintenance such
      as jaw thrust.

      IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, caspase-1, NLRP3 and ASC were measured at the onset of surgery in both
      the DEX group and the control group. Follow up.

      The following morning the subjects themselves and the researchers evaluate the quality of
      sleep (using RCSQ questionnaire) and delirium (ICDSC, CAM-ICU), respectively.
