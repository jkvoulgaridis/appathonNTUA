  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to investigate the safety and tolerability of BI
      1323495 in healthy male subjects following oral administration of single rising doses.

      Secondary objectives are the exploration of the pharmacokinetics (PK) including dose
      proportionality and pharmacodynamics (PD) of BI 1323495 after single dosing and the
      assessment of the PK/PD relationship.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male subjects according to the assessment of the investigator, based on a
             complete medical history including a physical examination, vital signs (Blood Pressure
             [BP], Pulse Rate [PR]), 12-lead Electrocardiogram [ECG], and clinical laboratory tests

          -  Age of 18 to 45 years (incl.)

          -  Any finding in the medical examination (including Blood Pressure [BP], Pulse Rate [PR]
             or Electrocardiogram [ECG]) is deviating from normal and judged as clinically relevant
             by the investigator

          -  Repeated measurement of systolic blood pressure outside the range of 90 to 140 mmHg,
             diastolic blood pressure outside the range of 50 to 90 mmHg, or pulse rate outside the
             range of 50 to 90 bpm

             investigator

          -  Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic,
             immunological or hormonal disorders

             repair)

          -  Diseases of the central nervous system (including but not limited to any kind of

             within 60 days prior to planned administration of trial medication, or current

          -  A marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTc interval such as QTc intervals that are
             repeatedly greater than 450 ms or any other relevant ECG finding at screening

          -  A history of additional risk factors for Torsades de Pointes (such as heart failure,

          -  Subject is assessed as unsuitable for inclusion by the investigator, for instance,
             because considered not able to understand and comply with study requirements, or has a
             condition that would not allow safe participation in the study

        In addition, the following trial-specific exclusion criteria apply:

          -  Male subjects with female partner of childbearing potential who are unwilling to use
             male contraception (condom or sexual abstinence) from the first administration of
             trial medication until 30 days after last administration of trial medication

          -  Current or history of relevant kidney, urinary tract diseases or abnormalities (e.g.
             nephrolithiasis, hydronephrosis, acute or chronic nephritis, renal injury, renal
             failure)

          -  Estimated glomerular filtration rate according to CKD-EPI formula &lt; 90 mL/min at
             screening
