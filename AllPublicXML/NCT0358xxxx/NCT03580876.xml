  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Loss of response under anti-TNF is frequent. 20% of patients with clinical relapse present an
      immune mediated pharmacokinetic failure. In the last AGA recommendations, switch to another
      anti-TNF drug is suggested with no indication of immunosuppressive agent. In a recent study,
      70% of patients with an immunogenic failure to a first anti-TNF agent developed a new
      immunogenic failure to the second anti-TNF drug using alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study in these patients with an immune mediated pharmacokinetic failure was to
      compare two strategies:

      Switch to a second anti-TNF alone or switch to a second anti-TNF with addition of
      azathioprine

      Comparing rates of clinical failure, rates of immunogenic failure and finally adverse events
      during a follow-up of 24 months
