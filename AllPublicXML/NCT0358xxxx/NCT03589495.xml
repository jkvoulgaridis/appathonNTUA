  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of antioxidant agents in the prevention or decreasing the severity of postoperative
      systemic inflammatory response syndrome after colonic surgeries adopted nowadays. Therefore,
      it is of interest to investigate safety and efficacy of administrating short term intravenous
      (IV) N acetyl cysteine as add on to l alany l glutamine and total parenteral nutrition on the
      marker of oxidative stress malondialdehyde and anti- inflammatory marker tumor necrosis
      factor alpha in patients undergoing colonic surgeries through a prospective, randomized,
      double blinded, controlled clinical trial

      A prospective, randomized, double blinded, controlled clinical trial will be carried out on
      60 patients, who will admit to the critical care unit, Ain Shams hospitals, Cairo, Egypt,
      following colon surgeries. Before the start of the study, eligible patients were randomized
      using computer generated list in order to allocate participants to either Group I (n acetyl
      cysteine group) or Group II (control group) in an equal manner No medication will take before
      the surgery and only oral fluids were allowed on the day before the operation. All eligible
      patients underwent bowel preparation with oral 1.745 g/ 30 ml magnesium citrate, and
      phosphate containing enema on the day before surgery. All patients received the general
      anesthesia with endotracheal intubation and muscle relaxant.

      Data management and analysis were performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences
      (SPSS) software for Windows version 18
