  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background. In the last two decades Internet usage has grown vastly. Pathological Internet
      usage (IUD; Internet Use Disorder) is associated with severe mental health problems affecting
      social, academic and daily life functioning. Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) has been already
      included in the DSM-V. Recently, the WHO declared to include Gaming Disorder (GD) in the
      upcoming ICD-11. Despite the increasing rates of adolescents with IUD and (I)GD, affected
      people are treated unsystematically and there is a lack of evidence based treatment programs.
      PROTECT+ is a low-threshold, cognitive behavioral short-term group intervention.

      Methods. 54 patients, aged 9-19 years, received PROTECT+ intervention in Heidelberg, Germany.
      The PROTECT+ intervention group underwent a cognitive-behavioral 4-session group therapy.
      Follow-up data were collected at 1, 4, and 12 months after admission. Primary outcome was the
      change in (I)GD and IUD related symptoms at the 12-months follow-up. Secondary outcomes were
      changes in comorbid symptoms as well as in problem solving, cognitive restructuring and
      emotion regulation skills

      Discussion. Treatment of IUD and IGD is still in its early stages. Recent reviews report
      increasing research on treatment but also a lack of well-designed studies and evidence based
      treatment programs. The PROTECT+ intervention is a theory driven and evidence based therapy
      program which is based on the PROTECT preventive intervention in school settings. In the
      intervention group a reduction of (I)GD and IUD symptom severity is expected over 12 months.

    <measure>Changes in IUD symptom severity (self-report)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 1 month, 4-months, 12-months</time_frame>
    <description>IUD symptom severity is assessed by the Compulsive Internet Use Scale (CIUS; Meerkerk, Van Den Eijnden, Vermulst &amp; Garretsen, 2009). The CIUS is a broadly used and validated questionnaire including 14 Items assessing IUD.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline, 1 month, 4-months, 12-months</time_frame>
    <description>(I)GD/IUD symptom severity is assessed via self-reports and via parental reports by the Video Game Dependency Scale (Computerspielabhängigkeitsskala; CSAS; Rehbein, Baier, Kleimann &amp; Mößle, 2015). The CSAS questionnaire has been adapted by including non-gaming IU.</description>

    <measure>Changes in (I)GD/IUD symptom severity (Clinical Interview based on DSM-5)</measure>
    <time_frame>12-months</time_frame>
    <description>At 12-months follow-up, we conduct a clinical interview based on the criteria of IGD according to the DSM-5. We adapted the criteria by non-gaming subtypes to assess IUD.</description>

    <measure>Emotion Regulation</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 1 month, 4-months, 12-months</time_frame>
    <description>For the measurement of emotion regulation the German Questionnaire for Assessment of Emotion Regulation in Children and Adolescents (Fragebogen zur Erhebung der Emotionsregulation bei Kindern und Jugendlichen; FEEL-KJ; Grob &amp; Smolenski, 2011) is used. The questionnaire includes a measure of functional and dysfunctional emotion regulation strategies for the negative emotions fear, sadness and anger.</description>

    <measure>Depressive Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 1 month, 4-months, 12-months</time_frame>
    <description>Depressive symptoms are assessed using the German Depression Inventory for Children and Adolescents (Depressionsinventar für Kinder und Jugendliche; DIKJ; Stiensmeier-Pelster, Braune-Krickau, Schürmann &amp; Duda, 2014; Stiensmeier-Pelster, Schürmann &amp; Duda, 1989). The instrument allows for the detection and estimation of severity of depressive disorders according to the DSM-5 criteria (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).</description>

    <measure>Comorbid emotional, oppositional, antisocial and attention deficit/ hyperactivity disorders</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 1 month, 4-months, 12-months</time_frame>
    <description>Comorbid Psychopathology is assessed using the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ; Goodman, Meltzer &amp; Bailey, 2003).
It includes the 5 scales (1) emotional problems, (2) behavior problems, (3) hyperactivity/ attention deficits, (4) interpersonal problems with peers and (5) prosocial behavior and can be used for epidemiological research and as an indicator for emotional, oppositional, antisocial and attention deficit/ hyperactivity disorder. The Total Difficulties Score of the SDQ indicates the risk for developing a mental health disorder.</description>

    <description>We assess social anxiety using the German version of the Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS; Mattick &amp; Clarke, 1998; Stangier, Heidenreich, Berardi, Golbs &amp; Hoyer, 1999). This questionnaire assesses anxiety in social interactions and allows for detection and the estimation of severity of social anxiety disorders.</description>

    <description>The PROTECT+ intervention group is a self-selected sample, which receives the PROTECT+ group therapy (4 modules in 4 subsequent weeks à 100 min). Participants are assessed at T1 (baseline), T2 (post treatment, 1-month follow-up), T3 (4-months follow-up), and T4 (12-months follow-up).</description>

    <description>The early intervention PROTECT+ consists of a cognitive-behavioral 4-session brief-protocol (100 minutes) and targets empirically identified risk factors of (I)GD/IUD, i.e. (1) boredom and motivational problems, (2) procrastination and performance anxiety, (3) social behavior and (4) emotion regulation. It addresses both risk-reduction and strength-promotion by cognitive behavioral (CB) interventions such as (1) psychoeducation, (2) cognitive restructuring (identification and modification of dysfunctional cognition), (3) behavior modification (improving problem solving skills, training of functional behavior and reinforcement) as well as (4) improving emotion regulation (training of sensory, imaginative and mindfulness based techniques).</description>
