    <measure>Effective Radiation Dose Following Injection of 18F-JNJ-64326067 per Organ</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>The Effective Dose (ED) per organ will be calculated using Organ Level Internal Dose Assessment (OLINDA) software. After injection of 370 megaBecquerel (MBq) of 18F-JNJ-64326067, a series of whole-body positron emission tomography (PET) images will be obtained over a period of up to 6 hours and corrected for attenuation by computed tomography (CT) transmission scans using PET/CT. The unit of radioactivity will be milli Sieverts per mega Becquerel (mSv/MBq) for each organ and the effective dose per participant. The final values will be averaged across the participants.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>The ED for whole body will be calculated using OLINDA software. After injection of 370 MBq of 18F-JNJ-64326067, a series of whole-body PET images will be obtained over a period of up to 6 hours and corrected for attenuation by CT transmission scans using PET/CT.

    <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical event that occurs in a participant administered an investigational product, and it does not necessarily indicate only events with clear causal relationship with the relevant investigational product.</description>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Otherwise healthy for their age group on the basis of physical examination, medical
             history, vital signs, and 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) performed at screening or
             Day 1 predose. If there are abnormalities, they must be consistent with the age of the
             study population. This determination must be recorded in the participant's source
             documents and initialed by the investigator

          -  Otherwise healthy for their age group on the basis of clinical laboratory tests
             performed at screening. If the results of the serum chemistry panel, hematology, or
             urinalysis are outside the normal reference ranges, the participant may be included
             only if the investigator judges the abnormalities or deviations from normal to be not
             clinically significant or to be appropriate and reasonable for the population under
             study. This determination must be recorded in the participant's source documents and
             initialed by the investigator

          -  Women must be postmenopausal (must be documented by medical records or physician's
             note). A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an
             alternative medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level at
             screening (greater than [&gt;] 40 International Units Per Liter/ milli International
             Units Per milliLiter [IU/L) or mIU/mL]) in the postmenopausal range may be used to
             confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal
             replacement therapy, however in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH
             measurement is insufficient

          -  During the study and for a minimum of 1 spermatogenesis cycle (defined as
             approximately 90 days) after receiving the last dose of study drug, a man:

             (a) who is sexually active with a woman of childbearing potential and has not had
             vasectomy must agree to use a barrier method of contraception (that is, condom). In
             addition, their female partner should also use a highly effective method of birth
             control (example, hormonal contraception) for at least the same duration, (b) who is
             sexually active with a woman who is pregnant must use a condom, (c) must agree not to
             donate sperm

          -  Willing and able to adhere to the prohibitions and restrictions specified for this
             clinical study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Radiation exposure through prior participation in other research protocols or clinical
             care in the last year in addition to the radiation exposure expected from
             participation in this clinical study, such that radiation exposure exceeds the
             effective dose of 50 milli sievert (mSv), which would be above the acceptable annual
             limits established by the United State (US) Federal Guidelines

          -  History of or current significant medical illness including (but not limited to)
             cardiac arrhythmias or other cardiac disease, hematological disease, bronchospastic
             respiratory disease, diabetes mellitus, renal or hepatic insufficiency, thyroid
             disease, Parkinson's disease, infection, epilepsy or fits or unexplained black outs,
             or any other illness that the Investigator considers should exclude the participant

          -  Serology positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis C virus
             antibodies (HCV) or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies at screening

          -  History of drug or alcohol use disorder according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
             of Mental Disorders (5th edition) (DSM-5) criteria within 6 months before screening or
             positive test result(s) for alcohol and/or drugs of abuse (opiates (including
             methadone), cocaine, amphetamines, cannabinoids, barbiturates,
             3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA) and benzodiazepines) at screening or
             admission

          -  History of malignancy within 5 years before screening (exceptions are squamous and
             basal cell carcinomas of the skin and carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or malignancy
             that in the opinion of the investigator, with written concurrence with the sponsor's
             medical monitor, is considered cured with minimal risk of recurrence)
