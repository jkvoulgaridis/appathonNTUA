          -  Baseline TIMI flow greater than or equal to 2 per visual estimate.

          -  Lesion Length less than or equal to 20 mm, able to be covered by a single scaffold

          -  No angiographic complications (e.g. distal embolization, side branch closure).

          -  No dissections greater than or equal to NHLBI type C.

          -  Patient has no ongoing chest pain or ECG ST-segment of T-wave changes.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient has a known allergy, intolerance, or is contraindicated to aspirin, both
             heparin and bivalirudin, clopidogrel and/or contrast media, and cannot be adequately
             pre-medicated.

          -  The patient has experienced an acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (AMI:
             STEMI) within 72 hours of the procedure and either CK-MB or Troponin has not returned
             to within ULN (Note: the patient with a recent NSTEMI with elevated biomarkers may
             still be enrolled).

          -  The patient has a left ventricular ejection fraction of &lt;30%.

          -  The patient has unprotected left main coronary disease with greater than or equal to
             50% stenosis.

          -  The patient has undergone prior PCI within the target vessel during the last 12
             months.

          -  Prior PCI of a non-target vessel within 24 hours prior to the procedure, or within 30
             days prior to the procedure if unsuccessful or complicated. Note: Prior PCI of a
             non-target vessel is acceptable if performed anytime &gt; 30 days before the index
             procedure or between a minimum of 24 hours and 30 days before the index procedure is
             successful and uncomplicated.

          -  Prior PCI within 3 years with a bioresorbable scaffold in any vessel.

          -  The patient requires future staged PCI of any lesion other than a target lesion
             identified at the time of the index procedure.

          -  The patient has received any solid organ transplant or is on a waiting list for any
             solid organ transplant.

          -  At the time of screening, the subject has a malignancy that is not in remission.

          -  The patient is receiving immunosuppressant therapy or has known immunosuppressive or
             severe autoimmune disease that requires chronic immunosuppressive therapy.

          -  The patient has a stent located within 3 mm of the target lesion borders.

          -  The target vessel is totally occluded (TIMI Flow 0 to 1).

          -  Excessive proximal tortuosity, vessel hinging at the lesion location or lesion
             angulation, such that in the operator's judgment it is unlikely that the Fantom
             Bioresorbable Coronary Scaffold or a standard scaffold could be delivered and/or
             expanded.

          -  The patient is currently participating in another investigational drug or device trial
             that has not reached its primary endpoint assessment

          -  The patient has co-morbidities which reduce life expectancy to less than or equal to
             24 months, or a condition that may interfere with the follow-up procedures of this
             protocol.

        The patient has:

          -  Known hepatic impairment (liver function tests (SGOT, SGPT, or ALT) &gt;3 times normal);

          -  Known impaired renal function (serum creatinine greater than or equal to 2.5 mg/dL).

          -  A platelet count &lt;100,000 cells/mm3 and/or &gt;700,000 cells/mm3

          -  The patient has a history of stroke (CVA) or TIA within the prior 6 months, or any
             permanent neurologic defect, or any prior history of intracerebral bleeding.

          -  The patient has an active peptic ulcer or upper GI bleeding within the prior 6 months.

          -  The patient has a history of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy or will refuse blood
             transfusions.

          -  The patient is a woman that is pregnant or lactating or is planning to get pregnant
             during the follow-up period of this trial. Note: Women of child-bearing potential
             should have a negative pregnancy test before enrollment.

          -  Target lesion ostial (within 3mm of vessel origin).

          -  Target lesion is located in the left main or there is a &gt; 30% diameter stenosis in the
             left main artery

          -  Target lesion has moderate to severe calcification.

          -  Target segment(s) has one or more side branches &gt;2.0 mm in diameter.

          -  Target segment(s) has a side branch with either an ostial or non-ostial lesion with
             diameter stenosis &gt;50% or requiring dilation

          -  Target lesion is located within an arterial bypass graft conduit or saphenous vein
             graft.

          -  Target lesion is located within a previously stented region.

          -  Target lesion is located within a segment supplied by distal graft.

          -  Target lesion has possible or definite thrombus.

          -  The patient is currently receiving or will require chronic anticoagulation therapy
             (e.g. coumadin, dabigatran, apixaban, rivaroxaban, or edoxaban for any reason).

          -  The patient is known to need or has a planned surgical procedure or any other reason
             is present which might require discontinuing aspirin and/or clopidogrel within 1 year
             of the Fantom scaffold implantation

          -  Patient has a known allergy to tyrosine derived polycarbonate or Sirolimus and its
             structurally related compounds.
