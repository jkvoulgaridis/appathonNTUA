  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Protein-energy malnutrition results from an imbalance between the body's intake and needs.
      Among the elderly in long-term care, the prevalence of undernutrition varies from 30% to 70%.
      It is responsible for or aggravates a state of fragility or dependence, and promotes the
      occurrence of morbidities. It is also associated with worsening prognosis for underlying
      diseases and increases the risk of death. Nutritional management of undernutrition is an
      issue, especially in health facilities. Among the various existing nutritional care methods,
      oral nutritional supplements should be considered in the event of failure of food enrichment
      measures or even at the outset in undernourished elderly people. However, compliance or
      acceptance of these products among the elderly remains limited and variable with consumption
      of oral nutritional supplements ranging between 48% and 94% according to studies, and,
      because of their ease of prescription, oral supplements are sometimes the only nutritional
      intervention.
