  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates whether surface perineal stimulation is as effective as anal stimulation
      in reducing urinary incontinence secondary to radical prostatectomy.

      Half of participants will receive a treatment with surface perineal stimulation, while the
      other half will receive a treatment with anal stimulation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pelvic floor muscle training is the most common non-invasive intervention for urinary
      incontinence secondary to radical prostatectomy. Perineal stimulation has a significant
      positive impact on the early recovery of urinary continence after this intervention.

      The perineal stimulation can be applied with surface electrodes or with an intra-cavitary
      probe placed in the anus. The two techniques are commonly used. Each techniques stimulates
      different anatomical points of perineum, and it is a question if both have the same
      effectiveness or, one of the two techniques has greater effect than the other.

    <description>Asses the perceived quality of life of patients in the study. It will be evaluated with the questionnaire I-QOL. It measures the effect of urinary incontinence on quality of life.
The I-QOL have 22 items and is divided into 3 subscales: avoidance and limiting behavior, psychosocial impact, social embarrassment. More puntuation means more quality of life.</description>

    <description>Patient is asked to lie down with legs slightly bend and two adhesive electrodes are attached transcutaneous on base of penis and on perineum. Stimulation current is administrated half time with a fixed frequency of 30 Hz and half time with 50 Hz. Pulse increased until the patient perceives the current. Sessions lasted for 30 minutes weekly for 10 weeks.</description>
