  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebrovascular reserve (CVR), defined as the increase in cerebral blood flow (CBF)in
      response to a vasodilatory stimulus, is known to reflect the compensative capacity of the
      brain to maintain adequate blood flow in the face of decreased perfusion due to arterial
      stenosis. CVR dysfunction has been identified as an independent risk factor for ischemic
      stroke. Limb remote ischemic preconditioning ï¼ˆLRIC) has been suggested as a protective
      therapeutic modality against brain ischemia. So it is worth to detect whether LRIC can
      improve the CVR ability in ischemic cerebrovascular disease patients.
