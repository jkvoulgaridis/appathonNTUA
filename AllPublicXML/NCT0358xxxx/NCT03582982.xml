  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Among Veterans, the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is reported to be as high as
      47.3% and a third higher than the general population. Muscle wasting and dysfunction have
      been identified as primary consequences of CKD. Disease-induced reductions in lean tissue
      adversely affect muscle fatigability. Consequently, muscle fatigability may serve as a
      potential limiting factor that contributes to activity limitations. However, there is a lack
      of evidence informing our understanding of muscle fatigability in patients with CKD. Dialysis
      treatment is a major factor contributing to the high financial costs of CKD care. Thus, in
      addition to potential health and quality of life benefits, treatments capable of maintaining
      kidney function or delaying the onset of dialysis treatment would provide substantial
      socio-economic benefit. Both lean body mass and muscle fatigability may be improved through
      strength training. Eccentric-overload (i.e. muscle lengthening) progressive resistance
      exercise (PRE) has been shown to be safe and effective for a variety of chronic conditions.
      Eccentric PRE using portable flywheel technology may provide a clinically viable treatment
      option to combat muscle impairments in CKD given the cost effectiveness and minimal space
      requirements for this mode of exercise.

      The purpose of this study is to assess feasibility of the eccentric-overload PRE regimen for
      Veterans with CKD stage 3 &amp; 4 predialysis using a prospective single-arm pre-test post-test
      intervention design. The primary aim of the project is to determine the effects of
      eccentric-overload PRE on muscle fatigability in Veterans with CKD Stages 3 &amp; 4 predialysis.
      Feasibility of the regimen will be determined by the time needed to complete the 4-exercise
      regimen and the perceived exertion levels reported by the study participants.
