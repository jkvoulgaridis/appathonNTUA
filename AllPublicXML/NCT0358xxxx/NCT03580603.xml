  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to assess the utility of a data visualization tool for providers'
      understanding patients' past microbiological culture sensitivities. Providers that are
      ordering antibiotics for patients with previous culture data in the medical record will be
      asked to answer questions regarding past sensitivity results. They will be randomized to
      either using the visualization tool before answering the questions or using the standard
      medical record tools. They will then be surveyed about their decision-making, knowledge, and
      the usefulness of the tool.

    <description>Provider knowledge of patients' previous culture sensitivity results as determined by the proportion of correct answers on a questionnaire:
Do you think this patient has had previous resistance to each of these antibiotics at BIDMC (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center)?
[List of the top 4 antibiotic classes to which resistance is seen at BIDMC that the patient has previously had tested for antibiotic sensitivities]
Yes (previous organisms resistant or with intermediate resistance)
No (no previous resistance noted)</description>

    <measure>Post-intervention survey</measure>
    <time_frame>To be assessed at the time of patient enrollment, up to one day after the initial antibiotic is ordered.</time_frame>
    <description>Providers will be asked survey questions regarding their decision-making and the usability and usefulness of the tool using a 5 point Likert scale:
I understand the previous culture data for this patient (Strongly disagree) 1 2 3 4 5 (Strongly agree)
I feel like I made an informed antibiotic choice (Strongly disagree) 1 2 3 4 5 (Strongly agree)
The tool provided new information that you were not previously aware of (Strongly disagree) 1 2 3 4 5 (Strongly agree)
The tool enabled you to more quickly understand this patient's microbiological data (Strongly disagree) 1 2 3 4 5 (Strongly agree)
The tool was easy to use (Strongly disagree) 1 2 3 4 5 (Strongly agree)</description>
