      This study evaluates the use of a wearable vest capable of non-invasively measuring lung
      fluid content in hospitalized patients with heart failure
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inpatient management of acute decompensated heart failure centers around the efficient relief
      of congestion with IV diuretics and vasoactive agents. For the majority of patients,
      non-invasive, clinical bedside tools such as jugular venous pressure, pulmonary auscultation
      and daily weights are used to estimate cardiac filling pressures and guide diuresis. However,
      these methods are subject to significant inter-observer variability and can be unreliable for
      various reasons. Furthermore, recent studies have shown that overt signs of clinical
      congestion correlate poorly with hemodynamic congestion assessed by invasive means. Remote
      Dielectric Sensing is a novel technology that enables the non-invasive assessment of lung
      fluid content using a wearable vest. ReDS measurements have been shown to correlate with
      fluid status in hospitalized HF patients and have been used to remotely monitor ambulatory HF
      patients for signs of pre-clinical hemodynamic congestion. In this prospective, randomized
      study, we will assess the utility of ReDS guided diuresis in hospitalized patients with acute
      decompensated heart failure. All patients will receive daily ReDS measurements, but only
      treating physicians in the intervention group will be able to use these values to guide
      treatment.
