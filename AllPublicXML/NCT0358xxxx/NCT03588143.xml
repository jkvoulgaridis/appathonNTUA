  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was performed to investigate the immediate effects of transcutaneous electrical
      nerve stimulation (TENS) and high voltage pulsed stimulation (HVPS) on resting pain and
      pain-free range of shoulder motion (pfROM) in patients with subacromial pain syndrome (SAPS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TENS) and high voltage pulsed current/stimulation
      (HVPS) are both electrotherapeutic agents which can be used for pain relief in
      musculoskeletal conditions. Standard TENS devices usually deliver biphasic pulsed currents
      with a pulse duration between 50 μs and 1000 μs and pulse frequencies between 1 and 250 pps.
      HVPS devices are TENS-like devices which deliver direct current with twin monophasic spiked
      pulses of 10-500 V (500-ohm load) with a short pulse duration (microseconds). In both
      conventional TENS technique and HVPS for pain relief, the aim is to activate spinal gating
      mechanism by selectively stimulating large diameter Aβ fibers. Theoretically, high-frequency
      (~10-250 pps), low-intensity (nonpainful) currents are most efficient in selectively
      activating Aβ fibers, which is practically recognized by the user reporting 'strong but
      comfortable' nonpainful electrical paresthesia beneath the electrodes. There is no available
      evidence for the efficacy of TENS in patients with subacromial pain. Also, there has been
      little experimental work on the effects of HVPS on pain relief in the literature, as well as
      no known study for its efficacy in SAPS.

    <description>Pain-free ranges of active shoulder flexion, abduction, internal and external rotation were measured by a digital inclinometer (Baseline Digital Inclinometer, 2008 New York-USA), which was calibrated on a flat surface before each measurement. All evaluations were performed before and after each modality application. All of the measurements were performed by a physiotherapist blinded to the modalities applied (placebo/TENS/HVPS).</description>

    <time_frame>Change of pain intensity from baseline at the end of 30 minutes of each intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The participants were asked to mark their resting pain intensity on a 0-10 cm visual analogue scale (VAS), where 0 cm indicated no pain and 10 cm indicated unbearable pain. The distance of the marked point from zero point was recorded as the intensity of pain. All evaluations were performed before and after each modality application. All of the measurements were performed by a physiotherapist blinded to the modalities applied (placebo/TENS/HVPS).</description>
