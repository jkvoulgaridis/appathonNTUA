  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Parkinson's Disease frequently present impaired postural control that leads to
      loss of stability and increased risk of falls.Core system, includes passive structures of the
      thoracolumbar spine and pelvis that work as a unit to stabilize the body and spine against
      forces generated from distal body segments as well as forces generated from expected or
      unexpected perturbations.The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of an
      intervention based on core stability in patients with Parkinson's Disease.

    <textblock>
      Core muscle coordination is important because lack of sufficient core muscle coordination can
      lead to decreased efficiency of postural control and functional activity. Clinical
      manifestations of patients with Parkinson's Disease include postural instability. Core system
      could be relevant to be included in an intervention. Thus, the objective of this study was to
      evaluate the effects of an intervention based on core stability in patients with Parkinson's
      Disease.

    <time_frame>Change from baseline dynamic balance at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Dynamic balance is going to be assessed with the Mini-Balance Evaluation System Test. It was developed to identify the postural control systems that underly poor functional balance. It contains four subscales: anticipatory postural control, reactive postural control, sensory orientation and stability in gait. It includes 14 items scored on a 3 level ordinal scale. The maximum total score is 28 points with higher scores indicating better balance.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Balance confidence</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The perceived level of balance confidence is going to be assessed using the Activities-Specific Balance Confidence Scale (ABC). There are 16 items, representing daily activities. Participants are asked to answer, with a score from 0% (not confident at all) to 100% (completely confident) in increments of 10%. A score lower than 67% suggests substantial risk of falling.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Static balance</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Static balance is going to be assessed using the Wii Balance Board.The 4 sensors in the balance board can sense weight changes and show the distribution of body weight. It will be assessed standing balance with eyes opened and closed, and standing over a foam with eyes opened and closed. Higher time in a stable position indicates greater static balance.</description>
