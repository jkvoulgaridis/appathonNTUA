  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over 30% of hospitalized patients are malnourished. These figures range from 20% to 60% in
      geriatric units. Undernutrition results either from a decrease in energy intake, an increase
      in needs, an increase in losses or a combination of these three causes. As a factor in
      mortality, morbidity and lengthening the time of hospital stays, undernutrition induces
      health costs 45 to 102% higher than a person who is not undernourished. The nutritional
      management of patients initially includes hygieno-dietary advice, then the implementation of
      an oral nutritional supplementation (ONS). A recent study conducted by our teams highlighted
      the low ONS consumption among women compared to men (39.48% vs 73.41%). Interviews with
      patients showed that 13 out of 17 had a negative opinion of ONS.

      The aim of this study is to show, on a larger scale, whether ONS consumption differs
      according to sex and if so, to highlight the obstacles to this consumption through the
      implementation of semi-directive interviews with patients. Ultimately, this research will
      lead to the implementation of alternative strategies to improve ONS consumption and to a
      better understanding of the obstacles to ONS consumption.
