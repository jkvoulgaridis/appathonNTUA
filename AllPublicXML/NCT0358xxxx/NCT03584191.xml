  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this survey is to collect the data on perceptions, behaviours and awareness
      related to obesity and obesity management for People with Obesity (PwO) and Health Care
      Professionals (HCP) treating obesity. Data will be collected via online surveys among each of
      the respondent groups. The surveys are expected to take approximately 25 minutes to complete
      and will be unique for PwO and HCP. As a cross-sectional study, there will be no treatment of
      patients.
