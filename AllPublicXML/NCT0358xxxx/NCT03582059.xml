  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinal cord stimulation by means of an electrode in the back is used to treat patients with
      persistent chronic pain after back surgery. Based on the stimulation patterns, there are
      mainly three different technologies available - conventional, burst frequency and the high
      frequency. It is known that the traditional frequency works through the lateral system of
      pain pathways in the spinal cord to cause pain reduction. Electroencephalographic(tracing of
      brain activity) recording of patients using burst have shown an additional effect on an
      adjacent medial pain pathway which decreases the attention to pain. We want to therefore find
      out if high frequency stimulation also has an effect on the same pathways. 20 patients who
      have persistent neuropathic chronic pain after previous spinal surgery, would be eligible to
      have this treatment as part of their normal care. They will be randomly chosen to undergo a 2
      week cycle of high frequency and 2 weeks of burst stimulation. We will record EEG's, pain
      scores and scores measuring attention to pain and compare findings. All patients will be
      recruited at the Leeds Pain and Neuromodulaton centre and the EEg analysis will be done by a
      research team based in Belgium. We hope that the study will improve our understanding of how
      different stimuation waveforms used for spinal cord stimulation work. We hope to have
      recruited all 20 patients in a 12 month period.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  I. Patient is 18 years of age or older and has given written informed consent. II. Has
             persistent chronic predominant low back pain of neuropathic origin, with or with out
             radiculopathy, for a minimum of 6 months as per NICE Tag 0159. III. Patient has had
             previous spinal surgery at least &gt; 6 months ago. IV. Numerical rating scale Scale

             neuropathic origin as per NICE guidance TAG 0159 VI. Total daily dose of opioids
             equivalent to ≤120mg of Morphine VII. In the investigators opinion the patient is a
             suitable candidate for SCS. VIII. Patient is willing to comply with the requirements
             of the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

             lumbar spine (documented in the last 6 months) II. Patient is pregnant, or pregnancy
             is suspected or planned within the first six months of the study timeframe.

        III. Patient has a cardiac pacemaker, automatic defibrillator, or any other implanted
        device, which will make the trial impossible. IV. Allergy to device components or drugs to
        be used in the intended procedure. V. Medical co-morbidities that preclude surgical
        intervention. VI. Patient is incapable of understanding or responding to the study
