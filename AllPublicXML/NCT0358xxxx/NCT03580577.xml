  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      patient with liver cirrhosis was supposed to have autoanticoagulation which approved to be
      wrong, with absence of conventional method to detect all abnormalities in coagulation state.
      Thromboelastography (TEG) give a broad picture for the coagulation defects.

      In addition to that no guidelines prescribed anticoagulants for venous thromboembolism in
      cirrhotic, so the investigators will do a study to demonstrate frequency and risk factors for
      acute venous thromboembolism in cirrhotic patients, find a conventional laboratory method and
      test TEG to assess risk of thrombosis in cirrhotic patients.Also, to validate current
      algorithm for use of anticoagulant and antiplatelet for thromboembolism for non cirrhotic in
      cirrhotic patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nowadays, the term &quot;autoanticoagulated&quot; ,which prescribed coagulopathy state in chronic liver
      disease (CLD) patients due to impaired synthesis of coagulation factors and elevated
      international normalized ratio(INR), has been approved to be wrong and those patients are
      liable for venous thromboembolism (VTE) with 0.5% - 6.3% incidence of deep venous thrombosis
      (DVT) and pulmonary thromboembolism (PE) among cirrhotic patients.

      This may be explained by normal or even increased production of factor VIII and von
      Willebrand factor, enhanced thrombin activity and Low level of protein C, protein S and
      antithrombin III due to impaired liver synthesis, other risk factor include sedentary
      lifestyle, fractures, immobility, hospitalization, elevated estrogen levels, surgery,
      concomitant disease states and cancer, damaged vasculature that increases inflammation, and
      sluggish splanchnic blood flow, which are all common in those patients.

      Absence of gold standard estimation for hypercoagulability in cirrhotic patients, is a big
      problem. During measurement of conventional parameters such as international normalized ratio
      (INR) or partial thromboplastin time, reagents used to measure the prothrombin time do not
      contain thrombomodulin on which protein C depend for activation, so it does not adequately
      reflect reduced levels protein C. Thromboelastography a device that has the ability to
      measure whole blood coagulation cascade including platelet function, It can be used to
      monitor coagulation status before liver transplantation operation to properly identify and
      treat coagulation abnormalities.

      No worldwide guidelines is established neither for management nor prophylaxis of VTE in
      cirrhotic patients, this may be due to safety concerns regarding the risk of bleeding related
      to anticoagulant drugs when used in people with advanced liver disease, especially if there
      is significant thrombocytopenia, and/or the presence of varices.
