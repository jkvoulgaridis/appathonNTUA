        Inclusion Criteria:

        In order to be eligible to participate in this study, an individual must meet all of the
        following criteria:

          1. Ability to sign and date the consent form.

          2. Stated willingness to comply with all study procedures and be available for the
             duration of the study.

          3. Be a male or female aged &gt; or = 18.

          4. Histologically confirmed new diagnosis of Stage II, III or IV Peripheral T-cell
             Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma not otherwise specified (NOS), Anaplastic large cell lymphoma
             (ALK negative) (ALK positive if IPI 3, 4, or 5), Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma,
             Enteropathy associated T-cell lymphoma (MEITL and EATL), Hepatosplenic T-cell
             lymphoma, gamma/delta T-cell lymphoma, subcutaneous panniculitis like T-cell lymphoma,
             and Nodal T-cell lymphomas with T-follicular helper phenotype.

          5. Available pathology material (fine needle aspirate is inadequate) for review at
             University of Colorado

          6. No prior therapy with the exception of prior radiation therapy and/or 1 cycle of
             chemotherapy (may be any chemotherapy regimen or even prednisone alone) based on
             current diagnosis and clinical condition. If given cytotoxic chemotherapy (one cycle
             only, e.g. CHOP), this cycle of treatment will count toward the 6 cycles of treatment
             given in the study.

          7. ECOG performance status 0 - 2.

          8. Laboratory status as follows:

               -  ANC &gt; 1000 cells/mm3, unless cytopenias due to lymphoma (i.e., bone marrow
                  involvement or splenomegaly)

               -  Platelet Count &gt; 100,000 /μL, or &gt; 50,000 /μL if bone marrow involvement or
                  splenomegaly

               -  Total bilirubin ≤1.5 x upper normal limit, or ≤ 3 x upper normal limit if
                  documented hepatic involvement with lymphoma, or ≤ 5 x upper normal limit if
                  history of Gilbert's Disease.

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 x upper
                  normal limit (≤ 5 x upper normal limit if documented hepatic involvement with
                  lymphoma).

               -  Serum creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dL or calculated creatinine clearance (CrCl) &gt; 45
                  mL/min (Cockcroft-Gault, Appendix)

               -  PT or INR, and PTT ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal unless patient is receiving
                  anticoagulants. If patient is on warfarin therapy, levels should be within
                  therapeutic range.

          9. Patients with measurable disease. Measurable disease is defined as having at least one
             objective measurable disease parameter. A clearly defined, bi-dimensionally measurable
             defect or mass measuring at least 1.5 cm in diameter on the CT portion of a PET/CT or
             CT scan or MRI (if appropriate) will constitute measurable disease. Proof of lymphoma
             in the liver is required by a confirmation biopsy unless there is measurable disease
             by imaging. Skin lesions can be used as measurable disease provided bi-dimensional
             measurements are possible. Patients with non-measurable but evaluable disease may be
             eligible after discussion with the PI. Abnormal PET/CT scans will not constitute
             evaluable disease, unless verified by the CT scan portion, CT scan, or other
             appropriate imaging.

         10. For women of childbearing potential: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from
             heterosexual intercourse) or use of contraceptive methods that result in a failure
             rate of &lt; 1% per year during the treatment period and for at least 180 days after the
             last study treatment. A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is
             post-menarchal, has not reached a postmenopausal state (≥ 12 continuous months of
             amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause), and has not undergone
             surgical sterilization (removal of ovaries and/or uterus). Examples of contraceptive
             methods with a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year include bilateral tubal ligation, male
             sterilization, hormonal contraceptives that inhibit ovulation, hormone-releasing
             intrauterine devices and copper intrauterine devices. The reliability of sexual
             abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and
             the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g. calendar,
             ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable
             methods of contraception.

         11. For men: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use
             contraceptive measures and agreement to refrain from donating sperm, as defined below:
             With female partners of childbearing potential or pregnant female partners, men must
             remain abstinent or use a condom during the treatment period and for at least 180 days
             after the last dose of study treatment. Men must refrain from donating sperm during
             this same period. The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation
             to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the
             patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or
             postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.

         12. Patient must be able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol
             requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        An individual who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation
        in this study:

             squamous cell skin cancer, or thyroid cancer; carcinoma in situ of the cervix or
             breast; prostate cancer of Gleason Grade 6 or less with stable PSA levels are allowed.

          2. Patients with a diagnosis of other PTCL histologies other than those specified in the
             inclusion criteria.

             insufficiency in the absence of auto-immune disease is also acceptable.

          9. Auto-immune condition requiring immuno-suppressive disease modifying therapy within
             the prior 2 years. Replacement therapy, e.g. levothyroxine for thyroiditis or insulin
             for diabetes are acceptable.

         10. History of non-infectious pneumonitis requiring immuno-suppressive therapy.

         11. Active hepatitis B or C (with measurable virus or antigen in serum) or HIV. Patients
