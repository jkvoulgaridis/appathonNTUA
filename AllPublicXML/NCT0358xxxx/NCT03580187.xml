      This is a prospective study carried out from 2014 to 2016 including patients aged ≥ 18 years,
      admitted for isolated chest trauma. Each patient received a nebulization of 10 mg morphine.
      If Visual Analog Score (VAS) assessed after 10 minutes still&gt; 4, nebulization was repeated
      every 10 minutes until pain relief. At 30 minutes, VAS&gt; 4 means failure.

      The aim of this study was to determine the predictive factors of nebulized morphine failure
      in patients with chest trauma and to establish a score based on these factors to guide the
      analgesic protocol.

      Methods: This is a prospective study carried out from 2014 to 2016 including patients aged ≥
      18 years, admitted for isolated chest trauma. Each patient received a nebulization of 10 mg
      morphine. If Visual Analog Score (VAS) assessed after 10 minutes still&gt; 4, nebulization was
      repeated every 10 minutes until pain relief. At 30 minutes, VAS&gt; 4 means failure.

    <intervention_model_description>Were included all patients aged 18 years and over, victims of isolated chest trauma, who were admitted to the intensive care unit. We excluded patients with any of the following criteria: not consent, pregnant woman, polytrauma, hemodynamic instability with systolic blood pressure less than 100 mmHg, treatment with morphine during transport or in the emergency room, need for initial ventilatory support, bradypnea (respiratory rate less than 12 cycles per minute), allergy to opiods, initial pain Visual Analog Scale (VAS) ≤ 4. Pain level was assessed by the pain VAS. We collected demographic, epidemiological, initial clinical examination data, explorations, lesions and we monitored the evolution of the VAS and the vital signs. Informed consent was obtained from all patients</intervention_model_description>

    <description>We performed a first nebulization of 10 mg (1mL) of morphine diluted in 4 mL of normal saline using a nebulizer with an oxygen flow rate of 8 L / min. The quality of analgesia was assessed by VAS at rest and cough after 10 minutes. If ≤ 4, we concluded to a success. If VAS was still&gt; 4, a second nebulization was performed. After 20 minutes, if VAS still higher than 4 we performed a third nebulization. If pain level was ≤ 4, we concluded to a success.
