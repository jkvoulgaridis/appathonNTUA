    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility, safety and oncological efficacy of
      hormonal therapy combined with autologous Tcm cells for patients with advanced prostate
      cancer.

    <textblock>
      Adoptive cancer immunotherapy,the infusion of tumor-reactive T cells to patients,represents a
      promising approach for the treatment of advanced metastatic disease.It has been shown that
      central memory T cells (Tcm) were the optimal antitumor T cells for adoptive cell transfer in
      cancer patients.However,the potential of autologous Tcm cells to treat the advanced prostate
      cancer has not been evaluated.

      This is an open-label pilot study to determine if the infusion of autologous Tcm cells
      combined with hormonal therapy is safe and effective for the treatment of advanced prostate
      cancer.This study will have the following two cohorts:Cohort A) metastatic hormone-sensitive
      prostate cancer (mHSPC) treated with maximal androgen blockade plus autologous Tcm cells and
      Cohort B) metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) treated with abiraterone
      acetate plus autologous Tcm cells.A total of 60 evaluable subjects will be enrolled over an
      enrollment period of 24 months.The study is planned to enroll approximately 30 evaluable
      subjects in each treatment cohort.
