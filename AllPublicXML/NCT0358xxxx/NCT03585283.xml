      Aim of this study is to investigate effectiveness of myofascial releasing on neck pain
      related to trigger points located on upper cervical region.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neck pain is the second most common musculoskeletal pain after lumbar pain. Prevalence is
      27.2% female and 17.4% in male population. Approximately 1/3 of acute onset neck aches become
      chronic. It causes increasing the cost of treatment and also the loss of labor.

      Myofascial pain is usually considered caused by myofascial trigger points. The trigger points
      in the neck muscles have been associated with a possible source of referred facial and
      cranial pain. Mechanical neck pain is a non-radicular pain caused by local musculoskeletal
      structures and is characterized by a spasm of the cervical muscles. Posture, emotional
      stress, cold and fatigue are etiologic causes, and pain is also reflected to the cervical,
      occipital and scapular regions depending on the severity of muscle spasm and the presence of
      trigger point in myofascial pain syndrome.

      Myofascial releasing is a specific type of passive soft tissue mobilization. Triggers points
      often considered as a pathology that occurs after excessive load or trauma on soft tissue
      which disturbs blood circulation. Fascial restriction can be found with triggers points and
      taut band.

      In this study effects of myofascial release on triggers points will be investigated.

    <intervention_model_description>Patients' information and contact will be obtained from physiatrist and willing participant's gender, age and pain onset data will be processed with a random number generator in order to form groups. Patients will divide randomly into two groups as intervention and control with a normal distribution of gender, age and pain onset.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Double (Participant, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Intervention group will receive myofascial release and control group will receive a sham therapy by using same treatment and handling position without applying myofascial release techniques.
Participant will be evaluated at baseline, 4 weeks later and 12 week later by an another investigator who does not aware of groups.</masking_description>

    <measure>Assessment of Pain Pressure Threshold on Trigger Points with Algometer</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Trigger points will be located with palpation and with slight pressure most painful one will be marked. Pressure will be applied by researcher and patient will be informed to notify researcher immediately after starting to feel pain from pressure.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neck Disability Index</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Neck Disability Index will be used to record perceived disability according to patients with neck pain. Neck disability index is a 10 question self administrated questionaire. Each question scored from 0-5 for a total of 50 point.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of Perceived Pain on Cervical Region</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Visual analog scale (VAS) will be used to assess patients' pain while doing neck rotations. Patients will mark their perceived pain on a 10 cm horizontal line. Left side of line considered as 0 (no pain at all) and right side considered as 10 (most intense pain experienced so far).</description>

    <measure>Global Rating of Change Scale-Turkish Version</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patients global perception on effects of treatment will be assessed with a 9 aspect scale. 5 was considered as no change from the baseline and 1-4 indicate decline in symptoms and 6-9 indicate improvement.</description>
