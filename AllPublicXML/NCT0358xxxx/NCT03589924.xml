    <textblock>
      This study is the first prospective randomized study assessing the safety and
      patient-reported outcomes of immediate one-stage IBBR compared with those of two-stage IBBR
      with TiLoop® Bra.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Studies comparing two-stage implant-based breast reconstruction with immediate one-stage
      implant-based breast reconstruction have inconsistent results and investigators find that
      there is a lack of high quality evidence focusing on comparing one-stage and two-stage
      implant-based breast reconstruction with TiLoop®Bra.

      This study is the first prospective randomized study assessing the safety and
      patient-reported outcomes of immediate one-stage IBBR compared with those of two-stage IBBR
      with TiLoop® Bra in breast cancer patients.

      The hypothesis is that one step method is not inferior to two step method in implant based
      breast reconstruction following skin-sparing and/or Nipple-sparing mastectomy using TiLoop®
      Bra.

      The current study is a randomized multicenter, open labeled, prospective, controlled study.

      Participants were enrolled at six hospitals in different places of China. All participants
      will undergo Skin Sparing Mastectomy(SSM)/Nipple Sparing Mastectomy(NSM) with one-stage or
      two stage IBBR with TiLoop® Bra.

      Based on earlier experience, investigators calculated that the surgical complication rate was
      approximately 30 percent in the one-stage group and 25 percent in the two-stage group.
      Consider a dropout rate of 5%, a total of 450 patients, with 225 in each group, are needed.

    <description>EORTC QLQ C30 /+ BR23(EORTC breast cancer-specific quality of life) questionnaire to evaluate quality of life.
Participants report the extent to which they have experienced those symptoms or problems during the past week. Each of the symptoms or problems is indicated with four extents, including &quot;not at all&quot; for 1 score,&quot;a little&quot; for 2 score, &quot;quit a bit&quot; for 3 score and &quot;very much&quot; for 4 score. A higher score indicated a worse quality of life.</description>

    <description>Breast-Q questionnaire to evaluate patients' satisfaction Using the reconstruction module of BREAST-Q to evaluate patient-reported outcome (PRO) of the surgery.For each subtheme, one or more BREAST-Q scales were developed to examine specific aspects of patient satisfaction.
Patient responses to each scale's items are transformed through the Q-Score scoring software to provide a total scale score that ranges from 0 to 100. For all BREAST-Q scales, a higher score means greater satisfaction.</description>
