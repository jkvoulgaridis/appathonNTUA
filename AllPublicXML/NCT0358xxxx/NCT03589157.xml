  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial aims to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of paclitaxel-eluting PTCA-balloon catheter (SeQuent® Please) combined with
      provisional spot stenting of DES versus DES for treating diffuse coronary artery lesions
      concerning interventional therapy and vessel patency.
