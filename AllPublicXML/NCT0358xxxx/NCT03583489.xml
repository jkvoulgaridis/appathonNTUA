        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects who have received any investigational medicinal product (IMP) in a clinical
             research study within the 3 months prior to IMP administration on this study

          2. Subjects who are study site employees, or immediate family members of a study site or
             sponsor employee

          3. Subjects who have previously been enrolled in this study

          4. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding

          5. Subjects who have received amisulpride for any indication within the previous 4 weeks

          6. Allergy to amisulpride or any of the excipients of APD421 or ondansetron

          7. History of any drug or alcohol abuse in the past 2 years

          8. Regular alcohol consumption &gt;21 units per week

          9. Current smokers and those who have smoked within the last 12 months; this includes
             cigarettes, e-cigarettes and nicotine replacement products (current smoking may be
             assessed by a validated technique such as urine or serum cotinine levels)

         10. Subjects who do not have suitable veins for multiple venepunctures/cannulation as
             assessed by the investigator at screening

         11. History of epilepsy

         12. History of clinically significant syncope

         13. Family history of sudden death

         14. Family history of premature cardiovascular death

         15. Clinically significant history or family history of congenital long QT syndrome (e.g.
             Romano-Ward syndrome, Jervell and Lange-Nielson syndrome) or Brugada's syndrome

         16. History of clinically significant arrhythmias or ischaemic heart disease (especially
             ventricular arrhythmias, atrial fibrillation (AF), recent conversion from AF or
             coronary spasm)

         17. Conditions predisposing the volunteer to electrolyte imbalances (e.g. altered
             nutritional states, chronic vomiting, anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa)

         18. Any clinically important abnormalities in rhythm, conduction or morphology of resting
             ECG that may interfere with the interpretation of QTc interval changes.

             This includes subjects with any of the following at screening:

               -  Absence of regular supraventricular rhythm

               -  Clinically significant PR (PQ) interval prolongation

               -  Intermittent second or third degree AV block

               -  Incomplete or complete bundle branch block.

               -  Abnormal T-wave morphology

               -  Prolonged QTcB &gt;450 ms or shortened QTcB &lt; 350 ms or family history of long QT
                  syndrome Subject with borderline deviations from these criteria may be included
                  if the deviations do not pose a safety risk, as judged by the investigator

         19. Clinically significant abnormal biochemistry, haematology or urinalysis at screening
             as judged by the investigator, especially:

               -  Creatinine clearance (estimated using Cockcroft-Gault formula) &lt; 60 mL/min

               -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt; 1.5 x upper limit of normal or bilirubin &gt; 3 x
                  upper limit of normal

         20. Positive drugs of abuse test result

         21. Positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis C virus antibody (HCV Ab) or
             human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) results at screening

         22. Donation or loss of greater than 100 mL of blood within the 3 months prior to
             screening or planned blood donation during the study until after final visit

         23. Subjects who are taking, or have taken, any prescribed or over-the-counter drug (other
             than 4 g per day paracetamol) or herbal remedies in the 14 days before IMP
             administration

         24. Failure to satisfy the investigator of fitness to participate for any other reason
