  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be collecting data on participants undergoing lower body negative pressure
      (LBNP) to simulate progressive blood loss. The goal of the study is to collect data to allow
      for development of an algorithm with machine learning to predict blood pressure responses to
      hypovolemia by analyzing the arterial waveforms collected during LBNP.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Death from exsanguination continues to be a major problem in combat casualty care and the
      care of civilians subjected to trauma. The ability to detect significant blood loss using
      traditional vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure) is marginal due to a variety of
      compensatory mechanisms that maintain blood pressure in the face of marked reductions in
      circulating blood volume. Along these lines, it is critical to develop monitoring devices and
      algorithms to non-invasively assess central blood volume in humans for the purposes of
      facilitating more timely interventions. The standard way to simulate hemorrhage in humans is
      to use Lower Body Negative Pressure (LBNP). In this technique, the lower body of a supine
      volunteer is enclosed in an airtight container while suction is applied to cause venous
      pooling in the legs and reduce central blood volume. This technique generates many
      physiological adaptations that are similar to that observed during blood loss studies in
      animals and human volunteers. Thus, the purpose of this study is to obtain data for use in
      developing monitoring technology to detect hemorrhage and other surrogate markers of central
      blood volume in humans.
