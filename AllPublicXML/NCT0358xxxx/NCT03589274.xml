  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study has 4 specific aims: (1) To modify our existing Individual Female Specific
      Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (I-FS-CBT) for Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) approach to treat
      women with alcohol dependence in a group format, Group Female Specific Cognitive Behavioral
      Therapy (G-FS-CBT); (2) To test the relative efficacy of I-FS-CBT and G-FS-CBT; (3) To test
      hypothesized mechanisms of change in drinking that are common to both treatments, including
      (a) coping skills and enhanced self-efficacy for abstinence; (b) enhanced sense of autonomy;
      (c) alleviation of negative affect, and (d) increased social network support for abstinence,
      and (4) To assess the relative cost-effectiveness of the individual and group treatment.

      Participants completed a telephone screen for initial eligibility and were scheduled for an
      in-person clinical intake interview. Consented women were scheduled for a baseline research
      interview (BL) approximately one week later. At the end of the BL, participants were
      randomized to treatment condition. During the 12 session treatment period, women completed
      assessments at the beginning and end of each therapy session on secondary outcome and therapy
      process variables.

      In I-FS-CBT each participant saw a therapist weekly. The first session was 90 minutes long,
      and subsequent sessions were 60 minutes long. The I-FS-CBT manual included core CBT,
      motivational enhancement, and relapse prevention components. Two core thematic women's issues
      were integrated into each session via discussion and illustrative material: (a)
      self-confidence and (b) self-care.

      The G-FS-CBT manual included material identical to I-FS-CBT, but the session organization was
      modified for a closed group format. The group treatment was designed to provide didactic
      presentation of coping skills and motivational enhancement material, and group discussion and
      rehearsal of new skills within a supportive atmosphere that facilitated mutual emotional
      support and support for abstinence. The first session of G-FS-CBT was 2 hours; remaining
      sessions were 90 minutes.

      In-person follow-up interviews were done at 3, 9, and 15 months post-session 1.
