      The main goals of the CARE-C study are to demonstrate the effectiveness of HCV models of care
      in a rural state (A) to overcome barriers to HCV treatment uptake, (B) to increase retention
      in care, and (C) to broaden access to care. To achieve these goals the following two systems
      interventions will be separately implemented: (1) Implementation of the Psychosocial
      Readiness Evaluation and Preparation for hepatitis C treatment (PREP-C) and related standard
      of care best practice PREP-C related interventions facilitated by a social worker-patient
      navigator team, and (2) implementation of a modified ECHO model (with one patient visit at
      specialty center to include PREP-C and fibrosis assessment in contrast to standard ECHO
      model). To test the effectiveness of our two systems interventions 600 patients will be
      equally distributed into three study arms representing 3 care models: Arm 1: Current Care
      Model (management with current interdisciplinary team); Arm 2: PREP-C Model (management with
      expanded interdisciplinary team (social worker, patient navigator, PREP-C); and Arm 3:
      Modified ECHO Model (management with expanded team in collaboration with community
      providers).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis C virus (HCV) related complications (end-stage liver disease, liver cancer, and
      death) are increasing in the U.S., and extrapolated from U.S. data most of the estimated
      49,200 patients with chronic hepatitis C in the state of Kentucky are untreated. In addition,
      the state of Kentucky is at the center of the rural opioid epidemic in the United States
      which has led to a dramatic increase in the transmission of hepatitis C virus (HCV)
      infection. HCV treatment uptake has been suboptimal in Kentucky despite the availability of
      highly effective, well-tolerated, timely limited treatment options due to multiple patient-,
      provider-, and system related barriers. Effective models of linkage to care, treatment, and
      retention in care are urgently needed to overcome the epidemiological challenges facing our
      rural state and put Kentucky on a path to planned elimination of HCV infection in the state.
      The demonstration of the effectiveness of new models of care in Kentucky which are
      appropriate to rural states will have great relevance and value to other states struggling
      with new HCV transmission and similar urgent need for effective models of linkage to care,
      treatment, and retention. Standardized care interventions expanding the reach of specialty
      providers (Project ECHO) and overcoming patient and provider related barriers to HCV
      treatment initiation (PREP-C assessment and interventions) have been evaluated, but the
      implementation of both models has been hampered by a lack of financial incentive, PREP-C has
      not been evaluated in rural populations, and the two models have never been used in
      conjunction.

      The main goals of the study are to demonstrate the effectiveness of HCV models of care in a
      rural state (A) to overcome barriers to HCV treatment uptake, (B) to increase retention in
      care, and (C) to broaden access to care. To achieve these goals the following two systems
      interventions will be separately implemented: (1) Implementation of the Psychosocial
      Readiness Evaluation and Preparation for hepatitis C treatment (PREP-C) and related standard
      of care best practice PREP-C related interventions facilitated by a social worker-patient
      navigator team, and (2) implementation of a modified ECHO model (with one patient visit at
      specialty center to include PREP-C and fibrosis assessment in contrast to standard ECHO
      model). To test the effectiveness of our two systems interventions 600 patients will be
      equally distributed into three study arms representing 3 care models: Arm 1, Current Care
      Model (management with current interdisciplinary team); Arm 2: PREP-C Model (management with
      expanded interdisciplinary team (social worker, patient navigator, PREP-C); and Arm 3:
      Modified ECHO Model (management with expanded team in collaboration with community
      providers).

      The specific aims are:

      Aim 1: To compare HCV treatment uptake within 12 months after the first clinic visit (time of
      enrollment) in all 3 arms. It is hypothesized that (A) treatment uptake will be higher in
      Arms 2 (PREP-C model) and 3 (modified ECHO model) as compared to Arm 1 (current care model)
      as a result of overcoming patient level treatment barriers (such as ongoing substance use,
      psychiatric instability, non-compliance, loss to follow up) facilitated by implementation of
      the PREP-C assessment, PREP-C related interventions, and assistance of the social
      worker-patient navigator team, and (B) treatment uptake in Arm 3 will be non-inferior to Arm
      2.

      Aim 2: To compare HCV treatment outcomes (treatment completion and sustained virologic
      response, SVR12) in all 3 arms. It is hypothesized that treatment completion and SVR12 in
      arms 2 and 3 will be noninferior to arm 1 due PREP-C enhancement, even though expected
      additional patients who start treatment in Arms 2 and 3 are expected to have less favorable
      treatment readiness scores prior to PREP-C interventions due to higher rates of treatment
      uptake as hypothesized in Aim 1.

      Aim 3: To compare retention in care in all 3 arms for patients who do not start treatment
      (within 12 months after initial appointment). It is hypothesized that retention in care will
      be higher in arms 2 and 3 due to implementation of PREP-C assessment and interventions, and
      the support through the patient navigator.
