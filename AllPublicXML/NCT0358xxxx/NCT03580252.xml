    <textblock>
      In this study workers are trying to test the correlation between Hammersmith Infant
      Neurological Examination and MRI brain/cranial ultrasound with early prediction of
      neurological developmental outcome of preterm neonates. This study is prospective
      cross-sectional collecting the data of patients according to daily standard medical practice

  <detailed_description>

      The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the neurobehavioural performance of infants born
      preterm using the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination (HINE) in standard medical
      practice and compare it with the gold standard MRI and ultrasound imagings. It would be
      possible to check do we need to use all the 3 examinations or Hammersmith examination would
      be enough reliable predictor. Secondary aim is to explore the relationships between MRI brain
      /cranial us abnormalities and HINE at term-equivalent age in infants born preterm in
      prediction of neurological outcome at 1 year of chronological age.

      This study will be only single arm/single group. This group would receive the regular
      practice of MRI, Ultrasound (US) and Hammersmith assessments. The 3 assessments would be
      compared in relationships with the neonatal developmental outcomes (developmental
      milestones).
