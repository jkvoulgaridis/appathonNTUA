    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the motor learning of patients with chronic stroke in
      virtual environments. Half the patients will undergo conventional therapy and half virtual
      reality training using virtual game. The study will also include healthy individuals matched
      for age, sex, schooling and hand laterality.

    <textblock>
      Stroke is the main cause of long-term disability in adults and motor learning is vital for
      recovering from motor sequelae. A number of approaches have been proposed to promote motor
      learning, including virtual reality, which simulates a real world environment and is based on
      the assumption that skills acquired in a virtual world will be transferred to the real world.
      Virtual reality induces use-dependent plastic changes in response to stimulation of higher
      motor areas, recruiting the memory system containing stored motor programs. As such, these
      interactive interventions of virtual reality are based on the idea that stimulating the
      action processing system activates the cortical areas involved in movement execution.

      These game characteristics allow activation of the mirror neuron system during the execution
      or observation of actions. Recent evidence suggests an important role for this neuron system
      in the improvement or motor recovery of patients. In this respect, observing an action in
      association with physical training may enhance the effects of motor training on the recovery
      of patients with stroke.

    <intervention_model_description>Eighty unilaterally brain injured right-handed patients, with lesion time of 6 months or more, aged 70 years or younger, 40 with left-brain and 40 with right-brain injury, will take part in the study. They will be randomly divided into a control group (GC), which will undergo conventional therapy and an experimental group (EG), which will be submitted to conventional and virtual reality training using the game virtual. The study will also include 40 healthy individuals matched for age, sex, schooling and hand laterality.</intervention_model_description>
