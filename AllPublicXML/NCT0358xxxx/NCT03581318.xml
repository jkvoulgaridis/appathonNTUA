  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an important non-invasive tool to study and diagnose
      cardiovascular disease. MRI scanners use strong magnetic fields and radio waves to create
      pictures of body organs. Researchers want to find better MRI methods and new ways of imaging
      cardiovascular disease and better understand normal and abnormal cardiovascular and brain
      function. Researchers are also interested in seeing if gadolinium, the commonly used MRI
      contrast agent, stays in the body long after the MRI was performed.

      Objectives:

      To develop new methods for imaging the heart and other organs of the body.

      To describe cardiovascular diseases using newer MRI methods

      To look at the relationship between cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular risk factors
      and other organ systems

      To look for gadolinium deposits in the brain from prior exams.

      Eligibility:

      Healthy people and people with known or suspected cardiovascular disease ages 7 and older may
      be eligible for this study.

      Researchers may be particularly interested in those who:

        -  Have suspected or known cardiovascular disease

        -  Were previously exposed to a gadolinium-based contrast agent,

        -  Need to have a heart MRI scheduled

        -  Need a test of the heart or other body part or will be undergoing a future cardiac
           catheterization

      Design:

      There are multiple arms to the study with optional components; therefore, there are multiple
      variations as to what an individual participant s experience may involve.

      Participants will have an MRI scan lasting up to 2 hours. The scanner is a large hollow tube.
      During the scan, there may be loud knocking and buzzing sounds caused by the scanner.
      Participants will lie on a table that slides in and out of the tube. Their vital signs may be
      monitored.

      Participants may have a test of heart electrical activity using wires connected to pads on
      the skin.

      Participants may have blood drawn.

      Participants may be injected with an MRI contrast agent through a plastic tube inserted in
      the arm.

      The purpose of this protocol is to develop and test new MRI techniques applicable to patients
      undergoing cardiovascular evaluation with the ultimate goal of translating the technical
      advances into improving clinical diagnosis and management of patients undergoing
      cardiovascular evaluation. Patients undergoing cardiovascular evaluation and healthy
      volunteers will be scanned under the protocol. We will evaluate new developments in
      non-contrast and contrast MRI of the heart and blood vessels and novel postprocessing
      methods.

      The use of the newer sequences will be used to improve clinical imaging workflow and disease
      diagnosis. We hope to use this protocol to clearly describe cardiovascular disease and
      associated problems using novel MRI methods and follow certain subsets of patients with
      disease as part of a natural history process. Inter-related physiologic systems may be
      phenotyped by MRI with characterization of disease associations between different organ
      systems.

      Additionally, information regarding gadolinium deposition of the brain will be gathered. The
      literature regarding deposition of gadolinium in the brain has a large void regarding
      information of prevalence of the phenomenon in healthy subjects. The National Institutes of
      Health has a large healthy subject pool who have participated in gadolinium contrast MRI
      studies. This pool of healthy subjects is not easily available at most clinical MRI centers,
      and thus, we are uniquely well-situated to be able to answer this outstanding question.

      For all objectives, MRI studies will be conducted in the NIH MRI systems located at the NIH
      Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. These procedures may involve the intravenous
      administration of commercially available MR contrast media and exercise or pharmacologic
      stress testing. Results will be used to evaluate the performance of various research pulse
      sequences, gradient coils, and radiofrequency receiver coils on human subjects and will
      provide essential ground work for specific patient protocols, both diagnostic and
      therapeutic.
