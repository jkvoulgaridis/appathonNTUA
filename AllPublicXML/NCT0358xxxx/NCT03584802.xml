  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fibroproliferative, irreversible disease of unknown
      cause, occurring mainly in patients older than 50. IPF is a rare but fatal lung disease, with
      an estimated prevalence of 14 to 28/100000 and a median survival time of 3 years. Acute
      exacerbation of IPF (AE-IPF) is a major event of IPF, as it is responsible for the death of
      30-50 % of IPF patients; its annual incidence varies between 5 and 10%. The current
      literature indicates that IPF is associated with the development of an auto-immunity process
      targeting epithelial and endothelial lung cells. Autoantibodies have been associated with a
      poorer prognosis. A study by DONAHOE et al. (Plos One, 2015) indicates that the combination
      of corticosteroids, plasma exchanges, rituximab and immunoglobulins may improve the prognosis
      of the most severe forms of AE-IPF. In that study, the observed survival rate in patients
      receiving this combination of treatment was 70% as compared with 20% in historical controls.
      This therapeutic combination approach is designed both to eliminate and inhibit the
      production of circulating antibodies targeting the lungs. Considering the high mortality rate
      of an AE-IPF episode and the potential benefit of such an original approach, a well-conducted
      randomized controlled trial is critical.

      Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fibroproliferative, irreversible disease of unknown
      cause, occurring mainly in patients older than 50. IPF is a rare but fatal lung disease, with
      an estimated prevalence of 14 to 28/100000 and a median survival time of 3 years. Acute
      exacerbation of IPF (AE-IPF) is a major event of IPF, as it is responsible for the death of
      30-50 % of IPF patients; its annual incidence varies between 5 and 10%. The current
      literature indicates that IPF is associated with the development of an auto-immunity process
      targeting epithelial and endothelial lung cells. Autoantibodies have been associated with a
      poorer prognosis. A study by DONAHOE et al. (Plos One, 2015) indicates that the combination
      of corticosteroids, plasma exchanges, rituximab and immunoglobulins may improve the prognosis
      of the most severe forms of AE-IPF. In that study, the observed survival rate in patients
      receiving this combination of treatment was 70% as compared with 20% in historical controls.
      This therapeutic combination approach is designed both to eliminate and inhibit the
      production of circulating antibodies targeting the lungs. Considering the high mortality rate
      of an AE-IPF episode and the potential benefit of such an original approach, a well-conducted
      randomized controlled trial is critical.

      The main objective is to evaluate the impact on overall mortality at day 28 of plasma
      exchanges, rituximab, intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg), and corticosteroid administration
      versus standard corticosteroid therapy in hypoxemic patients admitted in ICU for severe acute
      exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

      The primary assessment criterion will be overall mortality at day 28 after initiation of
      therapy (Day 1).

      Secondary objectives are the following:

        1. Efficacy:

           1.1. To compare the overall mortality at day 90, at 6 months and at 12 months after the
           initiation of therapy 1.2. To compare the exposition to mechanical ventilation 1.3. To
           compare the length of ICU and hospital-stay 1.4. To compare the evolution of Sequential
           Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score 1.5. To compare the radiological evolution 1.6. To
           compare the evolution of lung injury biomarkers in plasma 1.7. To compare the changes in
           circulating autoantibodies levels before and after therapy 1.8. To compare the evolution
           of blood fibrocytes proportion 1.9. To evaluate respiratory functional at 3 months and
           compare data previously available.

           1.10. To assess quality of life (SF36), autonomy (ADL) and muscle strength scores (MRC)
           at 3 months of inclusion (Cf annexe)

        2. Safety:

           2.1. To compare the occurrence of healthcare-associated infection 2.2. To describe the
           specific complications associated to the experimental treatment

           Secondary assessment criteria are the following:

        3. Efficacy:

           3.1. Overall mortality at day 90, at 6 months and at 12 months 3.2. Number of days alive
           without mechanical ventilation between inclusion and day 28 3.3. Length of ICU-stay and
           hospital-stay 3.4. Changes in SOFA score from D1 to D3, D7, D16, D21, D28 or
           discharge-day from ICU as appropriate 3.5. Variation of global extent of High Resolution
           Computed Tomography (HRCT) infiltrates between initial HRCT and D90 3.6. Changes in lung
           injury plasmatic biomarkers (KL-6, SP-D) from D1 to D16, D21, D28 and D90 3.7. Changes
           in circulating antibodies levels (anti-periplakin, anti-HSP70 and anti-vimentin
           antibodies) from D1 to D28 and D90 3.8. Changes in the proportion of blood fibrocytes
           from D1 to D16, D28 and D90

        4. Safety:

      4.1. Proportion of patients with at least one episode of any healthcare-associated infection
      between inclusion and D28 4.2. The following complications in the experimental group will be
      described: 4.2.1. Proportion of catheter-linked complications between inclusion and D16
      4.2.2. Number of blood units transfused between inclusion and day 28. 4.2.3. Proportion of
      major bleeding according to the International Society On Thrombosis And Haemostasis 4.2.4.

      Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines 4.2.5. Proportion of patients
      with anaphylactic reaction at day 28

        2. Nine therapeutic plasma exchanges of 1.5x the estimated plasma volumes using
           albumin:saline (3:1) or fresh frozen plasma in case of an International Normalised Ratio

           dose of intravenous immunoglobulin (100 mg/kg)
