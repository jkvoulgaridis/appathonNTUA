  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the current study was to produce a high quality evidence on the best frequency of
      performing umbilical artery Doppler for high risk pregnant women in the third trimester.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nowadays, high risk pregnancy forms a significant increasing proportion of any pregnant
      population, according to some authors up to 50% of all pregnancies would have the label of
      high risk pregnancies.

      At present, it is recommended that high risk pregnancies, thought to be at risk of placental
      insufficiency should be monitored with Doppler studies of the umbilical artery. Doppler
      assessment of the placental circulation plays an important role in screening for impaired
      placentation and its complications of intrauterine growth restriction.

      The purpose of umbilical artery Doppler surveillance is to predict fetal academia thereby
      allowing timely delivery prior to irreversible end-organ damage and intrauterine fetal death.

      According to a Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's systematic review and meta-analysis,
      in which Published and unpublished randomised and quasi-randomised trials evaluating the
      effects of one or more described antenatal fetal surveillance regimens were searched, the
      optimal frequency of umbilical artery Doppler surveillance is unclear.

      Our randomized controlled study was conducted on patients with high risk pregnancies at their
      third trimester who attended Ain Shams University Maternity Hospital. A total of 292 high
      risk pregnant women fulfilling the inclusion criteria were selected by random sampling and
      divided between two groups with 146 patients in each group. Group I underwent Doppler every
      other week and Group II underwent Doppler once weekly.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  I-Singleton pregnancy. II-In the third trimester (starting from 28 weeks of gestation
             till the time of delivery), Gestational age will be determined by the date of the last
             menstrual period and early ultrasound.

        III-Patient considered as high-risk pregnancies will be included in this study.

        The following will be considered as high-risk status:

          1. Previous obstetric history of preeclampsia or eclampsia, abruptio placenta,
             intra-uterine growth restriction or still birth.

          2. Pre-existing medical disorders like:

               1. Pregestational diabetes (Ang et al., 2006)

               2. Renal diseases (such as nephrotic syndrome, chronic renal failure, renal
                  transplant and hemodialysis) (Divon and Ferber, 2012).

               3. Autoimmune diseases (such as systemic lupus erythromatosis and rheumatoid
                  arthritis) (Divon and Ferber, 2012).

               4. Acquired thrombophilias (such as antiphospholipid syndrome). On the other hand,
                  inherited thrombophilias (such as protein C or S deficiency) are not associated
                  with IUGR (Reeves and Galan, 2012).

               5. Chronic maternal hypoxemia due to pulmonary disease (such as uncontrolled asthma,
                  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cystic fibrosis), cardiac disease (such
                  as cyanotic heart disease) or hematologic disorders (such as severe anemia,
                  sickle cell anemia and Î²-thalassemia) (Baschat et al., 2012).

          3. Current preeclampsia or pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH). PIH is diagnosed in
             women whose blood pressure reaches 140/90 mm Hg or greater for the first time after
             midpregnancy, but proteinuria is not identified. Preeclampsia is best described as
             pregnancy-specific syndrome that can affect virtually every organ system.It is much
             more than simply gestational hypertension with proteinuria (Cunningham et al, 2010).

        IV- Obtaining valid informed consent to participate in the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  I-Patients with congenital anomaly of the fetus. As this will affect fetal outcome
             with no effect of Doppler changes.

        II- Patients with multiple gestations. As they have different growth pattern. III- Patients
        with unconfirmed Gestational age due to lack of sure reliable date and absent early
        trimesteric scan. As we cannot diagnose small for gestational age without sure date.

        IV- Withdrawal of consent.
