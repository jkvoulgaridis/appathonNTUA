  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metabolic syndrome is a collection of metabolic disorders. Abdominal obesity, dyslipidemia,
      reduced levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, increased levels of serum
      triglyceride, insulin resistance are among the risk factors for metabolic syndrome and it has
      a global prevalence of 10 - 50 %.

      Alpha-lipoic acid or thioctic acid is an antioxidant that may have effects on inflammatory
      pathways, glucose control indicators, blood pressure, lipid profiles, body weight, fat mass,
      and food intake regulation.

      This study will be conducted as a parallel randomized double-blind clinical trial. In this
      study, 44 patients will be enrolled from endocrine and metabolism center of Shariati Hospital
      where their metabolic syndrome was diagnosed by an endocrinologist. At the beginning of the
      study written a self -administration will be taken from all patients.

      In this study, patient will be randomly divided into two groups, each will be received
      supplement or placebo for 12 weeks. 22 of patients will be consume 600 mg Alpha lipoic acid
      for 12 weeks and 22 of patients will be consume 600 mg placebo (starch-filled) capsules
      daily. Both supplementation and placebo are provided from &quot;Sepehr Drug and Treatment&quot;
      company. Before the study, containers will be coded as A and B by a person other than the
      study researchers according to concealment rules. Physical activity information will be
      collected using short-IPAQ (International Physical Activity Questionnaire) and demographic
      information through a general information questionnaire. In order to evaluate dietary intake
      of patients in terms of energy(kcal/(day), carbohydrate(gr/day), protein(gr/day), fat
      intake(gr/day), SFA (Saturated fatty acids) (gr/day), MUFA (Monounsaturated fatty acids)
      (gr/day), PUFA (Polyunsaturated fatty acids)(gr/day), Vitamin E(mg/day), Vitamin C(mg/day),
      Beta-carotene(mg/day) and Sodium intake (mg/day), 24-hr recalls will be completed by
      interviewing the patient for 3 days (two normal days and a weekend day). Weight will be
      measured with the minimum dress and without shoes by using a digital balance scale of 100
      grams and height will be measured without shoes by meters mounted to the wall with an
      accuracy of 0.1 centimeters. Then the body mass index will be calculated by dividing the
      weight (kg) by the square of the height (m), waist circumference will be measured in the
      narrowest area between the lowest lumbar spine and the iliac bone (cm), systolic and
      diastolic blood pressure will be measured after 15 minutes of rest, twice using the mercuric
      barometric measure and the mean will be reported as individual blood pressure. The blood
      sample will be taken after 12 hours of overnight fasting in two groups for measuring fasting
      blood glucose(mg/dL), lipid profile(mg/dL), glycosylated hemoglobin(percentage), serum
      insulin concentration (uIU/ml) ,TAC (Total antioxidant capacity) (umol/L), CRP (C-reactive
      protein) (ng/ml) and TNF-a (Tumor necrosis factor-a ) (pg/ml)and will be used the HOMA-IR
      (Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance) formula to determine insulin resistance.
      All these steps will be completed at the start and end of the study. At the end of the study,
      counting the remaining capsules, the patient's compliance rate will be evaluated, and
      patients who have not consumed less than 90% of their capsules will be excluded from the
      analysis.

      This is a randomized, double-blind, parallel clinical trial of lipoic acid for inflammatory
      factors, insulin resistance, glycemic control and anthropometric indices in patients with
      metabolic syndrome. patients are randomly shared into two groups and received 600 mg
      supplemental and placebo for 12 weeks, Then the body mass index, waist circumference,
      systolic and diastolic blood pressure, FBS (fasting blood sugar), lipid profile ,HbA1C, serum
      insulin concentration, TAC, CRP and TNF-a , Insulin resistance are measured ;All these steps
      will be done at the start and end of the study.
