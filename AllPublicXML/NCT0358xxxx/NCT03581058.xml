  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Driving is a set of complex tasks and requires use of multiple cognitive domains, including
      attention, planning, and memory. In laboratory studies, the main psychoactive component in
      cannabis, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), was shown to impair short-term memory,
      attention, reaction time, tracking, and coordination, resulting, for instance, in
      significantly more deviations from the lane and increased break latency. Surveys and
      epidemiological studies suggest that cannabis consumption is associated with increased risks
      of collision.

      The current study aims to evaluate individual driving behavior and performance on various
      neurocognitive tests and their correlated neural networks while under the influence of
      cannabis and while sober. The investigators will use the STISIM driving simulator, which is
      fully MRI compatible, to study brain activation, while participants are performing various
      driving maneuvers.

      The goals of the study are:

        1. identify driving performance and patterns in brain activation associated with cannabis
           exposure and compare them to brain patterns of the same participants while sober;

        2. compare participant's performance on cognitive tasks while under the influence of
           cannabis and sober;

        3. look for correlations between concentration of cannabinoids in the participants' blood
           and their driving performance and performance on cognitive tasks;

        4. correlate demographic variables and personal history (e.g. tolerance to drug) with
           performance and brain activation while driving under the influence of cannabis.
