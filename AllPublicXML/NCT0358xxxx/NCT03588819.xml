      This single arm, prospective study will determine the prostate-specific quality of life (QOL)
      of patients undergoing undergoing a 2 fraction MRI-guided stereotactic ablative body
      radiation (SABR) protocol. We propose prescribing a prostate dose of 26 Gy in 2 fractions and
      a dose of up to 32 Gy to the dominant intraprostatic lesion (DIL) in 2 fractions over one
      week.

      Stereotactic Ablative Body Radiation Two weekly fractions of:

      13 Gy to whole prostate +/- seminal vesicles AND Up to 16 Gy simultaneous boost to dominant
      MRI nodule

      Treatment Delivery and Quality Assurance Treatment will be delivered on treatment units
      equipped with with volumetric arc therapy and hexapod couches. Only photons with megavoltage
      energies of 6 MV will be used. Cone-beam CT imaging will be performed using the implanted
      fiducials to set up each treatment. Imaging after each fraction of radiation will be
      performed and the shifts in prostate positioning (as measured by displacement of gold seed
      fiducials) will be measured and recorded. Also, the total treatment time for each fraction of
      radiotherapy will be recorded.

      Patient Assessments / Follow-up Time zero will be the start of radiotherapy. Baseline and
      follow-up parameters are as listed in Appendix A. Baseline rectal and urinary function will
      be recorded. Acute toxicities will be assessed at weeks 1, 4, and 13 and late toxicities will
      be assessed at month 6 and every 6 months until year 5 using the Common Terminology Criteria
      Adverse Events, version 4.0. Bloodwork (PSA and testosterone), will be performed at months 3,
      6 and every 6 months until year 5. QOL using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite
      (EPIC) will be obtained at baseline, weeks 1, 4, 13, month 6 and every 6 months until year 5.
