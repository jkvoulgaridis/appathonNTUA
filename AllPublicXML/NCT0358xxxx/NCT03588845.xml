  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pragmatic study in which will compare a detailed treat-to-target (T2T) treatment
      algorithm to standard care for SSc SIBO at multiple sites around the world. The treatment
      algorithm was developed from the results of a survey of SIBO treatment preferences of
      rheumatologists and gastroenterologists. Although the drugs in the algorithm are already used
      in SSc, there is no uniform way of doing this and assessing the patient response. A very
      standardized protocol was created with details of how to use the medications, the duration of
      use and the timing of different drugs. In addition, symptoms of SIBO will be dectected by
      having patients complete a validated screening questionnaire, the global symptomatic score
      (GSS), online every 3 months for the duration of the study. A score &gt; 5 is very strongly
      related to bacterial overgrowth. In other studies, about 40% of unselected patients score at
      this level. This same questionnaire will be used in the T2T doctors' offices to decide if
      response is adequate and will also be used to assess outcome in the algorithm group versus
      standard care group.

      The primary outcome is the change in symptoms based on the total GSS. Secondary outcomes will
      include examination of all GSS subscales. HRQoL will be assessed by the social scale of the
      newly developed UCLA SSc GIT 2.0 questionnaire, which has become the standard GI
      questionnaire in SSc trials.

      Objectives: To determine the feasibility of the full project. This will be a trial with 3
      months of recruitment and 6 months of follow up for each case.

      Specific Aims:

        1. Determine if REBs perceive any major issues regarding the full trial.

        2. Determine if the sites are consenting all eligible patients.

        3. Determine the signing rate of consent.

        4. Determine patient adherence to web access for questionnaires.

        5. Assess the method for detecting eligible cases from web questionnaires.

        6. Assess whether physician notifications are being sent out quickly after detecting
           eligible cases.

        7. Assess the timeliness and completeness of physician receipt of notification of patient
           eligibility.

        8. Assess physician adherence to treatment protocol:

             1. how soon protocol patients are brought in to see doctor after receipt of notice.

             2. does doctor record what he does accurately.

             3. does he/she schedule return visits according to protocol.

             4. does he/she use in office questionnaires for treat to target.

             5. does he/she base decisions on these questionnaires.

             6. does he/she follow algorithm sequentially.

        9. For control sites,

             1. Record how soon protocol patients are brought in to see doctor after receipt of
                notice.

             2. Assess whether the doctor accurately records what he/she does.

                10 international sites will be chosen from the INSYNC cohort located in Australia,
                Canada, the U.S., the Netherlands, Spain, Germany and Sweden. In each country one
                site will be randomly selected to be a protocol site and one standard care site.
                This selection will provide representation from English and non-English speaking
                centres and from an array of countries with different medical cultures.

    <description>The primary outcome is the total Gastrointestinal Symptom Scale score. Each symptom carries a score from 0 (no symptoms) to 3 (severe). The maximum overall score is 33. An improvement in the score, ie a lower score, indicates an improvement in GI symptoms.</description>

    <description>If a score on the GSS is &gt; 5, the computer will send an automatic notice to the office of the doctor and to the doctor him/herself telling them of this.
Upon receipt of the notice, the protocol doctors will be expected to make an appointment within the timeframe outline in the protocol. Upon receipt of this notice the secretaries or clerks at the site will be asked to insert a treatment sheet in the doctor's chart. This sheet will be used to assess the timeliness of the first visit after notification, about the adherence of protocol doctors to protocol treatment.</description>

    <description>Standard care doctors, who will not know the details of this protocol, will decide on their own if and when to see the patient. Upon receipt of this notice the secretaries or clerks at the site will be asked to insert a treatment sheet in the doctor's chart. This sheet will be used to assess types of medications and general pattern of treatment of the standard of care doctors.</description>

    <description>Protocol treatment sites will be expected to see the patient within a pre-specified window of time. The doctors at that site will apply the treatment algorithm and will make decisions about response to treatment based on the algorithm and on specific patient answers to questionnaires. The treatment protocol will only be made available to IRBs, not to any site personnel before randomization. This was derived from a survey of rheumatologists in many countries and gastroenterologists, mostly in North America, who were asked multiple questions about how they would treat and follow up patients with suspected SIBO. Successful treatment is a response on GSS of no diarrhea plus a total GSS of &lt; 5.</description>
