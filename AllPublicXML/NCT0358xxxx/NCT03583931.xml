  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to standardize the treatment of pleural space (parapneumonic) infections by
      comparing the difference in outcomes between 2 methods of treatment: early VATS (Video
      Assisted Thorascopic Surgery) decortication versus fibrinolytic therapy. During treatment,
      the patient's coagulopathy status will also be evaluated.

    <textblock>
      The treatment of parapneumonic infections (infection in the pleural space) at the Denver
      Health Medical Center is not standardized, and timing for advanced interventions such as
      fibrinolytic therapy or surgical decortication remain unclear. The definitive treatment
      strategy in these patients may be sub-optimal, and lead to prolonged hospitalization and
      morbidity. This is concerning as the mortality rate of community acquired pneumonia triples
      in the presence of a parapneumonic process (5-15%) and can reach over 25% if it becomes
      bilateral(1). Prompt recognition of pleural space infections is essential for reducing
      morbidity and mortality. This is attributable to the progression of the disease from a simple
      fluid collection amenable to pleural space drainage, to necrotizing empyema requiring
      thoracotomy decortication and open drainage. The keys to management of parapneumonic
      effusions are early diagnosis, appropriate therapeutic intervention, and recognition of
      failure of conservative management. The investigators propose that a standardized pathway for
      identifying and treating parapneumonic effusions will be an important quality improvement. A
      key gap in the literature remains if patients with parapneumonic infections that cannot be
      drained with a chest tube should undergo a trial in intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy, or if
      they should go directly to video assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) for decortication of all
      infectious material.
