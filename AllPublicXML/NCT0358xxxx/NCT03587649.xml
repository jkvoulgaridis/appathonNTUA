      The primary objective of this protocol is to examine [18F]MNI-1126 as a tool to assess
      synaptic density loss.The specific objectives are:

        -  Examine [18F]MNI-1126 as a tool to assess synaptic density loss.

        -  To measure the dynamic uptake and washout of [18F]MNI-1126 in the brain using positron
           emission tomography (PET) in subjects with AD, PD, and healthy volunteers.

        -  To measure blood metabolites of [18F]MNI-1126 and perform kinetic modeling to assess its
           ability to measure synaptic density loss in the brain using the tracer plasma
           concentration or a reference region as indirect input.

        -  To acquire safety data following injection of [18F]MNI-1126.
