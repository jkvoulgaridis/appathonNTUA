    <textblock>
      Retrospective observational comparative and multicentric study of the microenvironment of
      HPV-induced head and neck cancers, with comparison between West Indies and Metropolitan
      populations, and therapeutic implications. This assessment is carried out by in situ
      multiparametric study with multiple immunofluorescence staining for cluster of
      differentiation 3, cluster of differentiation 4, cluster of differentiation 8, PROGRAMMED
      DEATH-1, PROGRAMMED DEATH-L1, PROGRAMMED DEATH-L2, cytokeratin and cluster of differentiation
      68 and automated reading. HPV genotypes will be characterized. Learning these techniques will
      allow me to promote them in West Indies on my way back, and they may be applicable to other
      HPV-induced cancers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Global annual incidence of head and neck (HN) cancers is high. It is even a greater concern
      in West Indies compared to other American countries. Most represented histological type is
      squamous carcinoma and several risk factors are involved , including tobacco exposure.
      Moreover, it is now clear that Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is a causal factor in the
      development of HNSCCs : as many as 5 to 10% of tumors are induced by HPV in the world, and it
      is responsible of 25,9% of HN tumors. HPV 16 is the most involved (87%). However, HPV
      epidemiology is different in West Indies with the implication of various genotypes. Detection
      of HPV infection can be achieved through several methods such as polymerase chain reaction
      (PCR) or RNAscope, which is a new reliable precise technique which reflects the
      transcriptional activity of the virus. The differences between the genotype of HPV involved
      within both populations need to be consider to better identify therapeutic targets.Studying
      the microenvironment may allow a better understanding of anti-tumoral immunity and may help
      patient selection in order to achieved better responses to immunotherapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Primitive head and neck squamous cells carcinoma diagnosed on surgical resection or
             biopsic sample, between 2008 and 2015 in metropolitan and Antillean populations. For
             metropolitan they were included when expressing p16 as assessed by immunochemistry and
             positive HPV DNA by in situ hybridation or positive HPV PCR. For Antillean population
             they were included when expressing p16 as assessed by immunochemistry with regards of
             genotype as assessed by in situ hybridation or by PCR (to be completed).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Secondary tumors,

          -  Tumor recurrence in a patient for whom we have already tumor tissue, nasopharyngeal
             tumors, p16 expression by immunochemistry with negative PCR testing for HPV.
