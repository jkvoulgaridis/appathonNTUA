  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS) uses electrical signals to disrupt noxious signals arising from
      painful areas, thereby reducing pain perception. Successful SCS implants lead to a broad
      range of positive outcomes: 1) long-term pain can be expected to be reduced by at least by
      50%; 2) quality of life as assessed by subjective measurements improves substantially; 3)
      patients can significantly reduce opioid medication intake.1 However, the impacts of SCS
      intervention on neuromuscular and biomechanical outcomes including gait and balance have not
      been fully explored. Fifty subjects with symptomatic leg pain and/or low back pain (LBP) who
      are deemed appropriate SCS candidates and are scheduled for surgery will undergo gait and
      balance analyses preoperatively as well as 6 weeks and 3 months post operatively. In
      addition, 50 control subjects having no pain will undergo 1 session of gait and balance
      assessment. Objective spine and lower extremity motion and neuromuscular control will be
      evaluated using dynamic surface EMG and a video motion capture system during functional
      evaluation. Also, explored will be the relationship of changes in gait and balance to
      psychosocial factors that have previously been shown to be correlated with SCS outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain is reported in 75-80% of the population and can significantly influence
      patients' quality of life. Fortunately, 80-90% of individuals recover from their back pain,
      whether they receive treatment or not. However, the small percentage of people who do not
      recover quickly present a costly problem to society and a great challenge to health care
      providers. Low back pain is the second leading cause for missed days at work, potentially
      having disability and major socioeconomic consequences. Chronic LBP can also limit
      flexibility and/or range of motion, which may contribute to an overall decrease in functional
      capacity, and may ultimately heighten the risk for additional lower extremity injury. Many
      chronic LBP patients have conditions not amenable to spine surgery, or they have failed to
      achieve successful outcome with previous spine surgery. For these patients, SCS can be an
      effective alternative. For example, in a recent demonstration, randomized 100 failed back
      surgery syndrome (FBSS) patients to either SCS or conventional medical management. At 6
      months post-implant, 64% of patients had achieved the 50% reduction in leg pain criterion
      (vs. 18% of conventional medical management patients). Similarly, North et al. found 52% of
      patients had achieved at least the 50% reduction in pain when they investigated 171 patients
      treated with SCS.

      SCS uses electrical signals to decrease nociception of impulses arising from painful areas in
      the spine and or leg. In order to accomplish this goal, SCS involves implantation of a small
      electrical pulse generator, along with thin leads strategically placed into the epidural
      space. Stimulation provided by the generator to electrodes on the leads inhibits ascending
      pain signals, thereby decreasing pain perception. Occasionally, some patients feel a mild
      paresthesia as a result of the stimulation.

      While the effectiveness of SCS on reduction of subjective pain complaints is now
      well-established, such improvement may not translate into improved functional ability.
      Previous research found that, for FBSS patients treated with SCS, patients' scores on
      Oswestry Disability index did not correlate significantly with improvements in function as
      measured by an accelerometer contained within the stimulator device. Very few studies have
      examined the effect of SCS on objectively-measured functional abilities, including gait and
      balance. Those studies suffer from a small sample size and lack of electromyography (EMG) and
      full body kinematics analyses. Despite that, those studies did find improvement in the
      spatiotemporal variables (i.e. gait speed, step length and width) while other variables
      (ground reaction force and trunk motion) were not significantly different using the SCS.

      Therefore, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of SCS, on the biomechanics of
      the lower extremities and spine, using dynamic EMG, video motion capture, and force plate
      analysis, during gait and static balance testing, in patients with chronic low back and/or
      leg pain, before and after intervention. In addition this study will compare these same
      biomechanical parameters found in the chronic low back pain and /or leg pain patients to an
      asymptomatic control group.

               1. Leg pain and/or LBP lasting than 6 months.

               2. Therapy consists of a short trial with a percutaneous implantation of
                  neurostimulator electrode(s) in the epidural space for assessing a candidate's
                  suitability for ongoing treatment with a permanent surgically implanted SCS.
                  Performance and documentation of an effective trial is required for consideration
                  of permanent SCS.

               3. The implantation of the stimulator is used only as a late or last resort for
                  patients with chronic intractable pain.

               4. Other treatment modalities (pharmacologic, surgical, physical/and psychological
                  therapies) have been tried and did not prove satisfactory; were judged
                  unsuitable, or were contraindicated for the patient.

               5. Patient has undergone appropriate psychological screening, including psychometric
                  testing using the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 Restructured Form
                  (MMPI-2-RF), and diagnosis by a multidisciplinary team before implantation; to
                  include patient education, discussion and disclosure including an extensive
                  discussion of the risk and benefits of therapy.
