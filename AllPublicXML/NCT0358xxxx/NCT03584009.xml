    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, multicenter, open-label, randomized study to compare the efficacy of
      venetoclax in combination with fulvestrant compared with fulvestrant alone in women with ER+,
      HER2-negative, inoperable, locally advanced or MBC who experienced disease recurrence or
      progression during or after treatment with CDK4/6i therapy for at least 8 weeks.
