  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Norgestrel 75 mcg is a progestin-only pill (POP), which is a kind of oral birth control pill.

      To be effective in preventing pregnancy, this kind of birth control pill is supposed to be
      taken every day at the same time, without delaying the intake for more than 3 hours.

      This study aims to find out if taking the pill 6 hours late or not taking it for one day will
      affect the way it works.

      This study is an exploratory, prospective, multi-center, randomized, cross-over study to
      assess the effect of norgestrel 75 mcg on cervical mucus and ovarian activity during reported
      perfect daily use, after a delayed intake of 6 hours and after a missed pill.

      After a screening period up to one month, depending on the menstrual cycle of the subject,
      the subjects will take norgestrel 75 mcg for three 28-day treatment periods, every day at the
      same time except for one day in the middle of treatment period 2 and treatment period 3 where
      they will either take it 6 hours late or not take it.

      They will be randomized to 2 sequences, either 6 hours delayed intake in treatment period 2
      and missed pill in treatment period 3 or the opposite.

      After the end of treatment period 3, a follow-up up to 12 days may be required to follow
      ovarian activities.

      Subjects will have visits twice a week and sometimes more often to assess the effects of the
      pill on:

        -  cervical mucus properties by a cervical mucus sampling

        -  ovarian activity by a vaginal ultrasound (TVUS)

        -  reproductive hormones levels by a blood sample (Progesterone (P4), Estradiol (E2),
           Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH), Luteinizing Hormone (LH))

        -  plasma drug level by a blood sample
