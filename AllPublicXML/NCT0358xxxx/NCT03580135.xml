      The study will be self-funded by investigator and carried out on patients from outpatient
      clinic in Pediatric Dentistry and Public Health Department- Faculty of Dentistry, Cairo
      University- Egypt. The procedures will be carried out by postgraduate student Rawda Nader
      Fathy who has B.D.S. (2011) -Alexandria University- Egypt. The procedures will be carried out
      on a Knight Midmark Biltmore dental unit (Midmark Corporation 1700 S. Patterson Blvd. Suite
      400 Dayton, Ohio 45409, USA) in the post graduate clinic of Pediatric Dentistry and Public
      Health Department- Faculty of Dentistry, Cairo University- Egypt.

    <description>One and half gram of Standardized Propolis Extract powder (Y.S. Eco Bee Farms Propolis Powder) at 100% was mixed with 1.75 mL of polyethylene glycol (Continental Chemicals, New Delhi, India) to form a thick consistency on a clean dry glass slab with a metal spatula. The paste was carried to the pulp stumps with a metal carrier and then condensed lightly to a thickness of 2 - 3 mm followed by placement of thick mix of GIC to seal the cavity and covered by st.st crown.</description>

    <description>MTA paste will be prepared as per the manufacturers' instructions to obtain a putty-like consistency. The mixture will be delivered to the pulp stumps and condensed lightly with a moistened sterile cotton pellet to ensure a thickness of 2 to 3 mm. A thick mix of glass ionomer cement (GIC) will applied over the MTA and covered by st.st crown.</description>
