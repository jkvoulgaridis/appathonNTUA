      This multisite prospective study seeks to determine if HLA-identical sibling donor
      transplantation using alemtuzumab, low dose total-body irradiation, and sirolimus (Sickle
      transplant Using a Nonmyeloablative approach, &quot;SUN&quot;) can decrease the toxicity of transplant
      while achieving a high cure rate for children with sickle cell disease (SCD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter phase II study of HLA-identical sibling donor HSCT in 30
      pediatric patients with SCD using nonmyeloablative conditioning with alemtuzumab, total-body
      irradiation, and sirolimus. The primary Objective of this study is to determine if the SUN
      regimen can decrease the incidence of grade II-IV acute graft-versus host disease (GVHD) by
      day +100 while maintaining similar disease-free survival compared to establish HLA-identical
      donor hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) regimens in children with SCD. The secondary
      Objective is to determine if health-related quality of life (HRQoL) for children undergoing
      SUN HSCT is preserved during the early post-transplant time period. To determine if the SUN
      regimen can decrease the number of platelet transfusions compared to established
      HLA-identical HSCT regimens in children with SCD. The tertiary/Exploratory Objectives: To
      describe other markers of toxicity (duration of neutropenia, mucositis, length of
      hospitalization) and indicators of a successful HSCT (HRQoL at 1 year, proportion needing
      additional immunosuppression during the first year, proportion able to wean sirolimus at 1
      year).

HLA-identical sibling donor transplantation using alemtuzumab, low dose total-body irradiation, and sirolimus (Sickle transplant Using a Nonmyeloablative approach, &quot;SUN&quot;) can decrease the toxicity of transplant while achieving a high cure rate for children with sickle cell disease (SCD).</description>

    <intervention_type>Drug</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Alemtuzumab intravenously, low dose total body irradiation, Sirolimus</intervention_name>
    <description>The conditioning regimen (SUN regimen) will consist of alemtuzumab intravenously daily for 5 days (0.03mg/kg on Day -7, 0.1mg/kg on Day -6, 0.3mg/kg on Days -5 to -3) and low dose total body irradiation (TBI) 300 cGY on Day -2 with gonadal shielding if possible. The HSCT graft will be G-CSF mobilized PBSCs with minimum CD34+ of 5 x106/kg recipient weight, goal of 10 x 106/kg (no upper limit). A peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) graft was selected as it engrafts faster than bone marrow and would lead to shorter period of neutropenia and infection and less thrombocytopenia and need for platelet transfusion.
GVHD prophylaxis will be sirolimus with a loading dose 3 mg/m2 on day -1. Sirolimus will be continued at 1 mg/m2/day starting on day 0 and dose adjusted to maintain a target trough level 5-15 ng/mL for the first 3 months and 5-10 ng/mL for the remainder of the first year.</description>
