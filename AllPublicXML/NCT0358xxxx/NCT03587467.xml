  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis B Virus(HBV) infection is a common infectious disease affecting up to 2 billion
      people worldwide. Around 650 thousand people died of liver failure, cirrhosis and primary
      liver cancer caused by chronic hepatitis B every year. Age is the main factor affecting the
      chronicity of hepatitis B, while 90% and 25% to 30% of hepatitis b virus(HBV) infection in
      perinatal and infant period will develop into chronic infection respectively. Whereas the
      proportion in patients above 5 years old is only 5% to 10%. Intestinal microbiota plays an
      important role in maintaining nomal physiological function of the intestine and the immune
      function of the body. It has been found that the disorder of intestinal microbiota is
      associated with numerous intestinal and parenteral diseases. Recently, the relationship
      between immune response and intestinal microbiota has been claimed. In a previous study using
      IMT to treat HBeAg positive chronic hepatits B patients combined with antiviral theraopy, 80%
      of them has reached HBeAg clearance. Increasing evidence suggests that the gut microbiota has
      evolved as a new important player in the pathogenesis of hepatitis B virus-induced chronic
      liver disease. However, the composition and structure alteration of the gut microbiota
      associated with the stage and progression of HBV infection remains unknown. Hence, we
      proposed a trial to detected gut microbiota of chronic HBV infected patients high-throughput
      16S rRNA gene sequencing to elucidate the microbial influence which contribute to the
      microbial shift of patient in different stage.
