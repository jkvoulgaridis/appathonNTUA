  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to estimate the prevalence of penicillin allergy, evaluate the
      diagnostic value of the allergologic work-up used in the study, and the health effects of
      penicillin allergy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Penicillin allergy is the most common of self-reported drug allergies and un-verified
      penicillin allergy is a significant and growing public health problem. 10% of all patients
      report penicillin allergy. However, there is large discrepancy between reported penicillin
      allergy and true allergy. Despite its high prevalence, greater than 90% of such patients are
      in fact able to tolerate the medication without allergic reactions.

      In this study patients having a penicillin allergy label will be investigated to confirm or
      to exclude the allergy diagnosis. The diagnostic value of the allergen test panel and the
      allergologic work-up will be evaluated. Clinical parameters as well as immunological will be
      assessed.

    <description>Patients going through an allergy workup with negative results, will be retrospectively contacted within one year after investigation. Telephone interview where the following questions will be asked:1) &quot;Have you received antibiotic therapy since being seen in the allergy clinic?&quot; 2) &quot;If you have been treated, what drug did you take?&quot; 3) &quot;As a result of this, did you have a reaction to the antibiotics?&quot; &quot;If yes, what kind of reaction have you developed?&quot; 4) &quot;If you didn't take the drug you were challenged with what was the reason for that?&quot;</description>
