  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if adult survivors of childhood Acute Lymphoblastic
      Leukemia (ALL) enrolled on the SJLife (St. Jude Life) protocol are at increased risk for
      postural control deficits compared to individuals with no cancer history. All participants
      will be assessed for their ability to maintain an upright posture, walk at their usual speed,
      and to tandem walk, all while engaged in a cognitive task.

      Primary Objective

      To compare changes in postural control in ALL survivors to changes in postural control in
      healthy controls, matched on age- and sex- in simple versus complex standing and walking
      activities (complex: standing or walking with added cognitive load).

      Secondary Objective

      To identify demographic and performance related risk factors for decreased postural control
      during complex standing or walking activities in survivors and controls and to evaluate
      associations between treatment and the changes in postural control during complex activities
      among survivors.

      Cognitive performance (attention and working memory) will be evaluated using the auditory
      N-Back test. The 0-back condition and the 2-back condition will be used. After cognitive
      assessment, participants will perform 3 different postural control tasks (standing balance,
      regular gait, and tandem gait) in a random order. Postural tasks for each participant will be
      determined by using random allocation envelopes.

      Computerized dynamic posturography will be used to evaluate standing balance with no added
      cognitive load. Standing balance assessment will be repeated two more times, once with
      participants engaged in performing the auditory 0-back task, and then with simultaneously
      performing the auditory 2-back task. Regular gait at participants' preferred speed will be
      examined using 6 light-weight wearable inertial sensors. The regular walking assessment will
      be repeated with simultaneous performance of the 0-back task and then with simultaneous
      engagement in the 2-back task. We have also included a tandem gait (placing one foot directly
      in front of the other) in order to make the postural task more challenging. The wearable
      inertial sensors will be used to record participants' gait characteristics while tandem
      walking. The tandem walk assessment will be repeated once with the participant simultaneously
      perform the 0-back task and then with the 2-back task. The estimated required time to perform
      all of the assessments and with inclusion of 3 rest intervals is 2 hours.

      In addition, data from the overall SJLIFE assessment will be used in analysis.

    <description>Regular gait will be evaluated in three different testing conditions: regular gait assessment while participants are engaged in performing a challenging cognitive task (2-back), regular gait assessment while participants are engaged in performing an easy cognitive task (0-bak) and regular gait assessment with no additional cognitive load (baseline). In each condition, the difference in gait speed of each survivor and his/her matched control will be obtained. Then the obtained differences at regular gait assessment with no additional cognitive load (baseline) and regular gait while performing the challenging cognitive task (2-bck) will be compared using a paired t-test.</description>
