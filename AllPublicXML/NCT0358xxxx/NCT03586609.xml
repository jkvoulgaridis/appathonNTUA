      This phase II trial studies how well venetoclax, cladribine, low dose cytarabine, and
      azacitidine work in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia that has previously not
      been treated. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as venetoclax, cladribine, and low dose
      cytarabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Azacitidine may
      stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.
      Giving venetoclax, cladribine, low dose cytarabine induction followed by cladribine, low dose
      cytarabine, and azacitidine consolidation may work better in treating patients with acute
      myeloid leukemia.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the complete response (CR/complete response with incomplete recovery [CRi]) rate
      of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) treated with venetoclax combined with
      cladribine (2-CDA) plus low-dose cytarabine (LDAC) alternating with 5-azacytidine (AZA).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess overall survival (OS) of patients with AML treated with venetoclax added to
      cladribine plus LDAC alternating with 5-azacytidine.

      II. To assess the disease free survival (DFS) patients with AML treated with venetoclax added
      to cladribine plus LDAC alternating with 5-azacytidine and achieved a complete response
      (CR/CRi).

      III. To assess the overall response rate of patients with AML treated with venetoclax added
      to cladribine plus LDAC alternating with 5-azacytidine.

      IV. To assess toxicity and induction mortality of patients with AML treated with venetoclax
      added to cladribine plus LDAC alternating with 5-azacytidine.

      OUTLINE:

      INDUCTION: Patients receive cladribine intravenously (IV) daily over 1-2 hours on days 1-5,
      cytarabine subcutaneously (SC) twice daily (BID) on days 1-10, and venetoclax orally (PO)
      daily on days 1-21. Treatment continues for 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients who do not achieve a CR or CRi after course 1 may receive a
      second induction cycle. Patients who do not achieve CR or CRi after second induction cycle
      may proceed to cycle 3 of consolidation per investigator.

      CONSOLIDATION/MAINTENANCE:

      Patients who achieve CR or CRi after cycle 1 of induction receive cladribine IV over 1-2
      hours daily on days 1-3, cytarabine SC BID on days 1-10, and venetoclax PO once daily (QD) on
      days 1-21 of cycle 2. All patients receive cladribine IV daily over 1-2 hours of cycles 5-6,
      9-10, 13-14, and 17-18, cytarabine SC BID on days 1-3 of cycles 5-6, 9-10, 13-14, and 17-18,
      venetoclax PO QD on days 1-21 of cycle 3-18, and azacitidine SC daily or IV over 30-60
      minutes on days 1-7 of cycles 3-4, 7-8, 1-12, and 15-18. Treatment repeats every 28 days for
      up to 18 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6-12 months for 5 years.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with previously untreated acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Prior therapy with
             hydroxyurea, hematopoietic growth factors, HMA, all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), or a
             total dose of cytarabine up to 2 g (for emergency use for stabilization) is allowed.

             infiltration.

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (AL)T =&lt; 3 x ULN.
             Unless liver enzyme abnormalities are determined by the treating MD and PI to be due

             childbearing potential prior to enrolling on this trial.

          -  Patient must have the ability to understand the requirements of the study and signed
             informed consent. A signed informed consent by the patient or his legally authorized

             the chemotherapy agents, breastfeeding should also be avoided.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active
             uncontrolled infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina
             pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would
             limit compliance with study requirements.

          -  Patient with documented hypersensitivity to any of the components of the chemotherapy
             program.

          -  Men and women of childbearing potential who do not practice contraception. Women of
             childbearing potential and men must agree to use contraception prior to study entry
             and for the duration of study participation.

          -  Prior therapy with venetoclax.

          -  Patients with a diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (AML-M3) will be excluded
             from this study.
