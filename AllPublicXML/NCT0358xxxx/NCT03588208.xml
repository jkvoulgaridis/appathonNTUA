  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients in the experimental group underwent a progressive resistance training program,
      performed twice a week for 12 weeks. The charge intensity was progressively increased from
      40% to 80% of 1 repetition maximum. The following muscle groups were worked: trunk flexors
      and extensors, elbow flexors and extensors, knee flexors and extensors, hip abductors and
      adductors and shoulder abductors. In addition to strength training, the experimental group
      also conducted a structured education program in one hour class once a week for five weeks.
      Patients in the control group performed the same education program.
