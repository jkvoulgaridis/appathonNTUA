  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The SUPPORT-AF study aims to improve rates of anticoagulation (AC) in atrial fibrillation
      (AF) patients by developing and delivering supportive tools and educational materials to
      providers treating patients with AF. The investigators hypothesize that AC percentage will
      increase among providers receiving tools and educational content.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nearly 1 million patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) who meet guideline criteria for
      anticoagulation (AC) are being left untreated, often due to providers over-estimating risks
      of bleeding and falling and under-estimating risks of stroke. The objective of this project
      is to improve rates of adherence to AC guidelines by creating supportive and educational
      materials for cardiology as well as primary care providers to evaluate the risks and benefits
      of prescribing AC to patients with AF. The investigators will email providers individual
      auto-updating reports containing their AC prescription rate compared to their peers and
      compared to practice level AC prescription goal. This report will also contain a list of the
      provider's AF patients who are eligible to receive AC based on their CHA2DS2-VASc stroke risk
      score â‰¥ 2 and a list of eligible AF patients with upcoming appointments to focus providers on
      an actionable group of patients with whom they might review the use of AC. The investigators
      will also message providers through the EHR prior to an upcoming appointment with an eligible
      patient reminding them to discuss AC if they deem appropriate. In addition, the investigators
      will directly engage with providers through academic teledetailing to educate providers on AC
      and address misconceptions and barriers to initiating or resuming AC in AF patients.
