  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter cohort observational; study to compare treatment outcomes
      in patients admitted to the hospital with Stevens-Johnsons Syndrome/Toxic Epidermolysis,
      aiming to assess the utility of medical management. The hypothesis of this study is that one
      or more treatment options will demonstrate improved patient outcomes. The primary objectives
      are cessation of progression of disease, time to complete re-epithelialization, length of
      stay, and mortality rate in the treatment groups as compared to those receiving supportive
      care alone. Exploratory analyses will assess the cause, risk factors, and severity prediction
      factors associated with the disease.
