  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Conventional CMR is based on breath-hold 2D cine image acquisitions which are sequentially
      acquired in different imaging planes. The necessity of precisely planning and then acquiring
      multiple 2D imaging planes during breath-hold is relatively inefficient and leads to CMR exam
      times of ≤60 minutes. However, some patients are too ill or young to hold their breath.
      Furthermore, 2D images sometimes fail to provide a complete picture of complex 3D anatomy of
      patients with complex morphology.

      To address these limitations, we have recently developed a 3D cine (3 spatial dimensions plus
      time) CMR technique. Rather than acquiring 2D cine images in multiple orientations during
      breath-hold, this approach allows one to acquire a free-breathing 3D block of data for each
      phase of cardiac cycle that can be reformatted offline into the desired views without adding
      to the exam time. This added efficiency should lead to a reduction in CMR exam time,
      increasing patient comfort, and making CMR exam easy and available for all. In addition, the
      3D nature of the data may yield more complete information about the anatomy and physiology.

      In this proposal, we will examine the agreement between the 2D cine and 3D cine CMR
      techniques with regard to left and right ventricular volumes and systemic and pulmonary blood
      flow circulation. The internal consistency of the measurements between the 2 techniques will
      be also investigated. This study will focus on children because they may benefit the most
      from the short, improved efficiency, and free-breathing CMR exams.
