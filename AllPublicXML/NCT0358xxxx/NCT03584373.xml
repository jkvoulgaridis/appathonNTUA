  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are two options for postoperative pain management: opioid and non-opioid analgesia.
      Pain outcomes will be compared in patients undergoing ureteroscopy and percutaneous
      nephrolithotomy by randomly administering opioid and non-opioid analgesia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Perioperative pain is often managed by opioids. However, post surgical pain management with
      opioids can often lead to long-term opioid use; additionally, opioids can cause unwanted side
      effects including respiratory depression that can lead to hypoxia and respiratory arrest, as
      well as nausea, vomiting, pruritus, ileus, and constipation. As an alternative to opioid
      perioperative pain management, non-opioid analgesia has been proven to be as effective as
      opioid management in acute pain. Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) and
      acetaminophen are often utilized as alternatives to opioid analgesia, and have an increased
      efficacy when combined. Both NSAIDS and acetaminophen have been proven to decrease opioid
      requirements and have minimized opiate-induced adverse events.

      In this randomized clinical trial, pain outcomes after ureteroscopy and percutaneous
      nephrolithotomy will be investigated in patients who are treated with opioids versus a
      non-opioid regimen of ketorolac and acetaminophen. Percutaneous nephrolithotomy and
      ureteroscopy are minimally invasive surgical techniques to surgically remove kidney stones.
      This trial will seek to determine whether non-opioid therapy is noninferior to opioid therapy
      in the determination of pain intensity as measured by an 11-point numeric rating scale, in
      which 0 indicates no pain and 10 indicates the worst possible pain, one week after the
      surgery by telephone call.

    <intervention_model_description>This will be an open label, prospective study of approximately 112 subjects undergoing either ureteroscopy or percutaneous nephrolithotomy. Patients who are eligible and choose to undergo ureteroscopy or percutaneous nephrolithotomy will then be asked if they would like to participate in the study and informed consent will be obtained. Patients will then be randomized to control (opioid analgesia) or non-opioid analgesia groups, and given this medication at discharge.</intervention_model_description>
