  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuromuscular blocking agents' (NMBA) use during surgery is associated with postoperative
      respiratory complications and increased risk of readmission to the hospital following
      ambulatory surgery. Residual neuromuscular block (rNMB) after surgery is difficult to
      identify. We have recently developed the REsidual neuromuscular block Prediction Score
      (REPS), that predicts the risk for postoperative rNMB. Our primary objective is now to assess
      the predictive ability of the REPS for respiratory complications within seven days following
      general anaesthesia. The secondary objective is to compare the predictive values of REPS and
      train-of-four (TOF)-ratio below 0.90 for respiratory complications.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Residual neuromuscular blockade occurs in about 20-60% of patients and depends on compound
      and dose of NMBA reversal agent used. While on the one hand, NMBAs optimize surgical
      conditions and facilitate mechanical ventilation in patients with ventilator asynchrony, on
      the other hand, these agents have been associated with respiratory complications and
      increased risk of readmission after ambulatory surgery. A consensus in regard to guidelines
      and thresholds to define the optimal strategy to optimize surgical conditions is yet to be
      achieved. We have shown that utilization of non-depolarizing muscle relaxants and their
      reversal agents can be improved by dedicated quality improvement techniques. We have also
      recently developed the REPS, a tool that predicts postoperative rNMB.

      This is a retrospective, observational, cohort study based on on-file hospital data from Beth
      Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts.

      The primary aim is to validate the dichotomized REPS (high-risk versus low-risk for rNMB
      which corresponds to a REPS &gt;4 and &lt;4, respectively) for the outcome of postoperative
      respiratory complications with BIDMC data. The investigators will utilize the pre-defined
      variables identified to predict residual neuromuscular blockade (REPS) at BIDMC.

      The secondary aim is to compare the predictive values of the dichotomized REPS with
      dichotomized train-of-four (TOF)-ratio (low TOF-ratio versus high TOF ratio which corresponds
      to a TOF-ratio &lt;0.9 and &gt;=0.9, respectively) for respiratory complications.
