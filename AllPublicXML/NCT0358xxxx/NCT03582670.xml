  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long term goal of this work is to reduce disability among people with Parkinson disease
      (PD) by enabling them to cope with cognitive decline so they can perform and participate in
      desired activities and roles. This project focuses on prospective memory, or the ability to
      remember to execute delayed intentions at the appropriate moment in the future. The current
      study tests the effects of two primary cognitive intervention approaches (process training &amp;
      strategy training) on prospective memory performance in PD. The investigators will conduct a
      single-blind randomized controlled trial in which individuals with mild cognitive impairment
      in PD (PD-MCI; N = 90) will complete pre-training assessment, randomization to training group
      (control, process training, strategy training), four training sessions (process and strategy
      training groups), and post-training assessment.

      RANDOMIZATION

      Once a participant is enrolled in the study and completes the Pre-testing session (described
      in detail below), they will be randomized into one of the following study groups:

        1. Process Training Group - the trainer teaches the participant about event- and time-based
           prospective memory tasks, respectively. The trainer simply tells the participant that
           s/he will be practicing both types of tasks in training games.

        2. Strategy Training Group - In training sessions 1 and 2, in addition to teaching about
           event- and time-based tasks, the trainer teaches the participant specific strategies for
           each type of task (implementation intentions for event-based and strategic
           clock-checking for time-based; and instructs in their use before and during the training
           games.

        3. Contro1 Group - Receives no training sessions. Only Completes the PRE, POST and 1-month
           &amp; 3-month Follow Up portions of the study.

      STUDY VISITS

        -  On the day of their testing appointment, participants will arrive at their designated
           location at the WUSM Movement Disorders Clinic for their testing session. All
           participants will provide written informed consent before their first testing session
           begins, and the examiner will answer any questions before beginning testing. Scheduled
           participants will be mailed or emailed (depending on their preference) study information
           and a copy of the consent form. Participants will receive reminder calls 1-2 days before
           their appointments.

        -  Demographics will be collected on all participants. This includes age, gender, years of
           education, living status, race, and ethnicity after consent is obtained. This can be
           completed online via Redcap or on paper at the testing session.

        -  Investigators will collect PD clinical characteristics from the Movement Disorders
           Clinical Record. Clinical Characteristics includes: Hoehhn &amp; Yahr Stage, year of first
           PD symptoms, year of initial PD diagnosis, MoCA score at most recent clinic visit, Side
           of symptom onset, type of symptom onset (tremor vs. bradykinesia), PD medications, and
           most recent Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale Motor Score.

      Participant Questionnaires:

      Participants will complete the PRMQ, CAPM, IPA and BDI questionnaires.

        -  Prospective and Retrospective Memory Questionnaire (PRMQ; attached) - Used to rate the
           participant's everyday retrospective and prospective memory.

        -  Comprehensive Assessment of Prospective Memory (CAPM; attached) - Used to rate the
           participant's everyday prospective memory

        -  Impact of Participation and Autonomy (IPA; attached)- A questionnaire about the
           participant's ability to take part in daily activities.

        -  Beck Depression Inventory (BDI, attached) - Used to characterize current depression,
           which is common in PD.

      Informant Report Questionnaires:

      Participant's will identify an informant (spouse, relative, or close friend) to fill out the
      PRMQ Proxy Report, a Self-Reported CAPM, and a CAPM - Proxy Report.

      Demographics will be collected on all informants. This includes age, gender, years of
      education, living status, race, and ethnicity.

      Participant and Informant questionnaires can be filled out prior to the study session via
      Redcap. Most participants request this method because it saves them time on the day of the
      study session. The online questionnaires have a consent form to look over before filling them
      out (see attached online consent), and the participant agrees to the consent by clicking
      &quot;Next&quot; in the online form, and completing the questionnaires; if participants elect to
      complete the questionnaires on paper, they can complete them at their testing session. The
      research team will will first go over the written consent with them at the session before the
      participant fills out the written questionnaires. Experimenters will check the questionnaires
      for completion. This procedure will also be followed if the participant elects to fill out
      the online questionnaire in Redcap.

      Testing sessions:

      Participants will perform testing while on their regular PD medications.

      Pre-training Assessment: (1.5 hours) - MoCA and Virtual Week.

        -  The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA; attached) will be administered to assess global
           cognition at the time of the study visit.

        -  The Virtual Week test (attached) will be administered to the participant. It is a
           computerized board game that simulates daily life and real-world prospective memory
           challenges. Each circuit represents one day in which the participant completes
           time-appropriate activities and makes choices about them (i.e. the ongoing activity).
           Each day has 8 prospective memory tasks (4 event based, 4 time based). Participants
           complete a practice day and then three test days, with equivalent versions
           counterbalanced across Pre and Post testing. The main outcome variable is the proportion
           of correct prospective memory responses for each task type (12 event based, 12 time
           based).

      Strategy Training Sessions (GROUPS 1-Process Training AND 2-Strategy Training ONLY): These
      are 4 sessions that occur over the next 2 weeks after the Pre-training Assessment. (1 HOUR
      EACH) GROUP 1, Process training: In sessions 1 and 2, the trainer teaches the participant
      about event- and time-based prospective memory tasks, respectively. In sessions 3 and 4, the
      trainer simply tells the participant that s/he will be practicing both types of tasks in the
      training games. In all sessions, the participant completes the training games with no
      strategy instruction from the trainer. Feedback on accuracy is provided after each training
      game. This is typical of a process training approach and expects that either practice of the
      training tasks will improve prospective memory ability per se or participants will develop
      effective strategies for completing prospective memory tasks on their own. At the end of each
      session after completing both training games, the trainer reminds the participant of his/her
      real-life prospective memory goals, provides a handout that lists the goals, and instructs
      the participant to try to complete them as intended. It should be noted that the inclusion of
      even this minimal level of discussion of real-life cognitive tasks is not typical of process
      training interventions.

      GROUP 2, Strategy Training: In training sessions 1 and 2, in addition to teaching about
      event- and time-based tasks, the trainer teaches the participant specific strategies for each
      type of task (implementation intentions for event-based and strategic clock-checking for
      time-based) and instructs in their use before and during the training games. In sessions 3
      and 4, the trainer tells the participant s/he will be practicing both types of tasks in the
      training games and can support the participant's strategy use if needed. Feedback on accuracy
      and strategy use are provided after each training game. At the end of each session after
      completing the training games, the trainer and participant discuss how the strategies can be
      applied to the participant's real-life prospective memory goals, and the trainer helps the
      participant develop written action plans to do so. Plans are reviewed (and modified if
      necessary) at each session.

        -  The Bangor Goal-Setting Interview (BGSI) - The BGSI is a structured assessment developed
           for use in cognitive rehabilitation research. It offers a standardized means of
           eliciting individual goals and rating goal attainment over time and has been
           successfully used in RCTs with older adults, including those with mild to moderate
           dementia. During the first two training sessions, after an explanation of the
           prospective memory task types (session 1: event, session 2: time), participants complete
           the BGSI with the trainer to identify and set goals for their real-life prospective
           memory tasks. Participants identify up to 6 prospective memory tasks they anticipate
           having to complete over the next 2 weeks (before Post assessment), define goals for
           completing each task, and describe what needs to happen for the goal to be considered
           partially (25%, 50%, and/or 75%) and fully achieved.

        -  Credibility/ Expectancy Questionnaire (CEQ; attached) - this will be completed by the
           participant after the second training session to rate how credible they think the
           strategy instruction training is, and how well they think it will work on 1) their
           performance on the computer task, and 2) their performance in everyday life.

      Post-training Assessment (1.5 hours) - (For Groups 1 (Process) and 2 (Strategy) = One week
      after the last training session; For Group 3 (Control) = 3-4 weeks after the Pre-Training
      Assessment): Virtual Week and NIH Toolbox Cognitive Battery

        -  The Virtual Week Task will be administered again, but with new tasks to remember.

        -  The NIH Toolbox Cognitive Battery (instructions attached) will be administered to obtain
           an overall measure of executive function. This battery includes a Picture Vocabulary
           Test, Picture Sequence Memory Test, Flanker Inhibitory Control and Attention Test,
           Dimensional Change Card Sort Test, List Sorting Working Memory Test, Pattern Comparison,
           and Oral Reading Test.

        -  GROUPS 1 (Process) and 2 (STRATEGY) ONLY: Based on their BGSI interview during the
           training sessions, participants report on their performance of each task and, in
           collaboration with the trainer, rate each task for attainment on a 10-point scale using
           the previously determined descriptors as reference (higher scores indicate better goal
           attainment). Task attainment scores are averaged to yield a mean attainment score.

      One-month Follow-up Assessment (40 minutes) (One month after the Post Training Assessment):

      The PRMQ, IPA and CAPM Questionnaires will be given to participants for a second time as
      follow-up online in Redcap or by mail (depending on the participant's preference).

      The study informant will fill out proxy-reported PRMQ and CAPM for a second time as a
      follow-up online in Redcap or by mail (depending on the informant's preference).

      Three-month Follow-up Assessment (40 minutes) (Three months after the Post Assessment):

      The PRMQ, CAPM, and IPA Questionnaire will be given to participants for a third time as
      follow-up online in Redcap or by mail (depending on the participant's preference).

      The study informant will fill out proxy-reported PRMQ and CAPM for a third time as a
      follow-up online in Redcap or by mail (depending on the informant's preference).
