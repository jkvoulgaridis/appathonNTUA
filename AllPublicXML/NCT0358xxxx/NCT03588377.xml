      The study assesses and compares the effect of 'pulse oximetry' (PO) used by Lady Health
      Workers (LHWs) at household level on increasing hospital referral acceptance rates in
      intervention clusters (district Jamshoro) for 2-59 months old children with severe pneumonia
      with the effect of LHWs using clinical signs alone in non-intervention clusters of the same
      district.

    <textblock>
      Pneumonia accounts for an estimated 18% of under-5 mortality across the globe. Majority of
      these pneumonia-specific deaths occur in 15 countries, in which Pakistan ranks fifth. Failure
      to seek early care and delays in hospital referral are commonly acknowledged determinants of
      mortality in childhood pneumonia with a higher proportion reported from rural settings than
      urban. Acceptance rates of 'facilitated' hospital referral advice have been reported as low
      as 8-23% for sick young infants in peri-urban Karachi. They are even lower for
      non-facilitated referral in rural settings in children under five with severe pneumonia in
      rural settings.

      Hypoxemia is an important sign of cardio-respiratory compromise in acutely ill children with
      a reported prevalence of 5.9%-58.9% in children aged 0-59 months from facilities and
      16.1%-38.7% from community settings. Pulse oximetry (PO) is a rapid, portable, non-invasive
      and accurate method of measuring arterial hemoglobin oxygenation (Sp02), and has therefore
      been used in trial and clinical settings to detect hypoxemia. According to literature,
      mortality increases 4.3 times in children with pneumonia and hypoxemia than in those without
      hypoxemia.

      The study hypothesizes that hypoxemia is a valuable sign of severe and very severe pneumonia
      in children 2-59 months and early identification at the community level followed by
      appropriate management with supplemental oxygen and antibiotics at the facility will improve
      acceptance of hospital referral and clinical outcomes

      Study objectives

      Primary Objectives:

      To assess and compare the effect of 'pulse oximetry' (PO) used by LHWs at household level on
      increasing hospital referral acceptance rates in intervention clusters (district Jamshoro)
      for 2-59 months old children with severe pneumonia with the effect of LHWs using clinical
      signs alone in non-intervention clusters of the same district

      Secondary Objectives:

      Intervention Clusters (clinical signs plus PO at household level to capture severe
      pneumonia):

        1. To determine referral pathways in intervention (PO) clusters in Jamshoro through a
           baseline survey among households and selected health facilities

        2. To determine prevalence of severe pneumonia Â± hypoxemia in 2-59 month olds in
           intervention clusters in Jamshoro

        3. To assess feasibility of deploying and using low cost oxygen systems (oxygen
           concentrators and/or low flow CPAP) at 1 referral health facility (DHQ Kotri) for
           intervention clusters in district Jamshoro

        4. To assess effect of oxygen availability and delivery on clinical outcomes of children
           2-59 months admitted with severe pneumonia at this facility and compare with clinical
           outcomes at home of those who refused admission.

      Non-Intervention Clusters (clinical signs alone at household level to capture 'severe'
      pneumonia):

        1. To determine referral pathways in non-intervention clusters in Jamshoro through a
           baseline survey among households and selected health facilities

        2. To determine prevalence of severe pneumonia in 2-59 month olds in non-intervention
           clusters in Jamshoro

        3. To assess feasibility of deploying and using low cost oxygen systems (oxygen
           concentrators and/or low flow CPAP) at 1 referral health facility (Sehwan Institute
           Hospital) in district Jamshoro

        4. To assess effect of oxygen availability and delivery on clinical outcomes of children
           2-59 months admitted with severe pneumonia at this facility and compare with clinical
           outcomes at home of those who refused admission

      Sample size estimation:

      Defining a cluster as (the catchment area of ) one Lady Health Worker (LHW), and assuming a
      power of 80% in detecting 15% increase in referral acceptance from a baseline 10% to 25%
      among 2-59 month old children with severe pneumonia (pneumonia prevalence at 2 week recall
      (MICS Sindh):7.5% (18% of which is assumed severe) a total of 116 clusters/LHWs will be
      selected from both intervention and control areas to capture 4640 children overall with
      severe pneumonia.

      Study methods: An enhanced acute respiratory infections training module will be developed
      with training videos emphasizing classification of acute respiratory infections according to
      the new WHO algorithm, use of pulse oximeters to identify hypoxemia, identification of danger
      signs with addition of hypoxemia as a danger sign in intervention clusters, case management
      of pneumonia at home with oral amoxicillin and severe pneumonia with stat dose of antibiotic
      before referral to hospital. The faculty members of the Department of Pediatrics and Child
      Health at Aga Khan University Karachi, Pakistan will lead these training sessions with
      trainers of the LHW program.

      Intervention (At the household Level):

      All children aged 2-59 months with cough, fever, and difficult breathing or other unrelated
      symptoms during regular home visit, or whose mothers sought care for any reason at the nearby
      health house (active and passive surveillance), will be assessed for study eligibility by
      LHWs. After determination of eligibility (age 2-59 months, signs and symptoms of pneumonia)
      and informed consent by a legal guardian, LHWs will conduct the WHO classification of
      pneumonia (no pneumonia, pneumonia, severe pneumonia) and take a pulse oximetry reading using
      a handheld pulse oximeter (Masimo corporation CA) on all children with or without clinical
      signs and symptoms of pneumonia.

      These pulse oximeters will be provided to the LHWs and the physicians at the basic health
      units (BHU) and rural health centers (RHC) in the intervention clusters (UCs Kotri City, Nago
      line, Son Wahar 2, AB Shoro, Son Wahar 1, HM Shoro, Son Wahar 3 in taluka Kotri). All the
      LHWs and staff at the BHU/RHC will be trained on the use, and maintenance of these pulse
      oximeters. Children with severe pneumonia with or without hypoxemia will be advised to go to
      hospital for antibiotics and oxygen, using the PO reading as a tool to convince parents. Name
      of a pre-designated health facility (DHQ Kotri) with available oxygen and study physician
      will be provided to all the LHWs so that follow up visits can be made to ensure the patient
      receives safe and recommended care at referral facility. Project staff will pretest and
      regularly monitor PO accuracy and quality of readings.

      Hypoxemia will be defined as an arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) &lt;92%. SpO2 measurement will
      be recorded after 1 minute of stable observation. If the SpO2 comes 92% or less, the child
      will first be assessed for nasal obstruction with readings repeated after applying nasal
      saline drops. If repeat reading shows hypoxemia, the child will be referred to nearest
      designated referral hospital and admitted for oxygen via nasal or nasopharyngeal route and
      intravenous antibiotics, as per recommendations. If the child with hypoxemia is diagnosed by
      the LHW, the subject will be referred to the designated referral health facility (RHC or
      district general hospital) through the usual channels if the child fulfills the criteria for
      admission i.e. SpO2 less than 92 or signs of severe pneumonia.

      A small qualitative focused group discussion (LHWs, local families) may be planned midway to
      explore contexts behind decisions to accept or refuse hospital referral in both intervention
      and non-intervention clusters.

      Control (At the household level):

      Control clusters will also be chosen from Jamshoro district (UCs Sehwan 1 and 2, Channa,
      Jhangara, RHC Bhan, Talti, Bubak, Dall from Taluka Sehwan, UCs Laki and Sann/Aamri from
      Taluka Manjhand). All children identified to have clinical signs and symptoms of severe
      pneumonia in the community through LHWs using clinical signs alone at the household level
      and/or at the BHU/DHQ by the LHW/Physician using examination skills in non-intervention
      clusters shall be advised referral to hospital (Sehwan Institute Hospital) after a single
      stat dose of antibiotic.

      At the referral facility (both intervention and control clusters):

      All children identified to have severe pneumonia both in the intervention and control
      clusters in the community through PO done or clinical signs at the household by the LHW
      and/or at the referral facility by the LHW/Physician in intervention clusters shall be
      referred to higher level of health care. A referral hospital serving both the intervention
      and control clusters will have PO monitoring of all severe pneumonia children and delivery of
      oxygen through oxygen concentrators.

      It would be of paramount importance to ensure proper equipment at the health facility with
      sustained supplies. In this regard preliminary meetings have been held with the EDOH Jamshoro
      and DG Health and their cooperation has been ensured. Emergency and pediatric staff at the
      facilities along with our study physician will also be trained on the management of severe
      severe pneumonia according to the integrated management of neonatal and childhood illnesses
      (IMNCI) guidelines. Oxygen and supplies availability would also be ensured at the facilities
      so that children who are referred receive appropriate and timely care. The child would be
      assessed 2-3 days after receiving referral advice for acceptance or refusal and in either
      case for clinical outcomes. Even though it is ideal to provide sustainable oxygen systems to
      the two chosen referral public sector hospitals, the study does not provide oxygen and
      therefore aims to assess 'real-life' situations in public hospitals and their impact on
      severe pneumonia outcomes.

      LHWs will have to be incentivized on basis of their contribution to the study activities.
