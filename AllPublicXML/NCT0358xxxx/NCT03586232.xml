  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the perioperative use of Arnica Montana and the
      combined use of Arnica Montana and Bromelain in aiding the body's wound healing functions
      during the postoperative period after rhinoplasty. The secondary objective of the study is to
      determine if there is a reduction in postoperative edema when Arnica Montana and Bromelain
      are combined. Another secondary objective is to demonstrate increased patient satisfaction
      with the use of Arnica Montana and the combination Arnica Montana and Bromelain.

    <measure>Change in patient satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 28 days</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete the validated Rhinoplasty Outcome Evaluation (ROE) at their initial consultation visit (preoperative responses) which will be compared to their postoperative survey to assess overall patient satisfaction in regards to their rhinoplasty one month postoperatively. The ROE questionnaire has 6 questions, each with 5 answer options, graded from 0 to 4 so scores can range from 0 to 24. In order to make understanding easier, the score obtained must be divided by 24 and multiplied by 100, which leads to a score varying between zero and 100, and the higher the score, the greater is the patient's satisfaction with the nose surgery.</description>

    <description>Arnica Montana is from the Asteraceae plant family and is native to the mountain areas in Europe and western North America. It is reported to have anti-inflammatory, antiseptic, and vasodilatory properties and is often used in plastic surgery to help reduce pain, edema, and ecchymosis postoperatively.</description>
