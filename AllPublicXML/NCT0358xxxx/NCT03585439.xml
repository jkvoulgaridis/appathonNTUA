    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate clinical and radiological outcomes of isthmic spondylolisthesis
      surgically treated with combined approach. The goal is to demonstrate that it is a safe and
      efficient technique to treat isthmic spondylolisthesis. There is very little literature
      concerning this procedure.

    <textblock>
      Isthmic spondylolisthesis can cause back and leg pain. If pain persists after well conducted
      medical management, a surgical treatment can be proposed. Even though the goal is consensual,
      there are plenty of ways to reach vertebral fusion: ALIF, PLIF, TLIF, Posterior fusion only,
      etc… This study aims to evaluate clinical and radiological outcomes of isthmic
      spondylolisthesis surgically treated with combined approach. The goal is to demonstrate that
      it is a safe and efficient technique to treat isthmic spondylolisthesis using standard XRays,
      CT Scan and patient reported outcome measurements. There is very little literature concerning
      this procedure.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Fusion status</measure>
    <time_frame>From 6 months to 1 year after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Every patient has a CT-Scan of the lumbar spine done to check fusion status. The interpretation is made by the surgeon who did the surgery and one independent reviewer.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Restoration of the foraminal diameter</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months and 1 year after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The foraminal diameter is measured to quantify the restoration of the foraminal diameter after surgery, making more room for the nerve root.</description>

    <measure>Correction of the spondylolisthesis-induced kyphosis after surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months and 1 year after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The lumbo-sacral angle is measured to quantify the correction of the spondylolisthesis-induced kyphosis after surgery.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Segmental lordosis</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months and 1 year after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Segmental lordosis is measured with the L5-S1 lordosis, quantifying the correction at the spondylolisthesis level</description>

    <measure>Back pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-operative, 3 months and 1 year after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Measured with Lumbar Visual Analogic Scale. The patient quantifies his back pain with a number, ranging from 0 to 10 (0 = no pain, 10= worst possible pain)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sciatica</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-operative, 3 months and 1 year after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Measured with Radicular Visual Analogic Scale. The patient quantifies his leg pain with a number, ranging from 0 to 10 (0 = no pain, 10= worst possible pain)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disability</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-operative, 3 months and 1 year after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Measured with the ODI (Oswestry Disability Index). The patient answers 10 questions concerning his daily life and the disability caused by his back problem, giving a global score. 0 is equated with no disability and 100 is the maximum disability possible.</description>

    <intervention_name>Observational study evaluating the results of an intervention for isthmic spondylolisthesis: surgical procedure with double approach: Anterior lumbar Interbody Fusion then postero-lateral fusion</intervention_name>
    <description>First in supine position, an ALIF is performed: with a Pfannenstiel incision, through a retroperitoneal approach, a discectomy is performed at the level of the spondylolisthesis then a cage is placed between the two vertebral bodies. Then, in prone position, a standard posterior approach is performed, pedicle screws are placed to achieve a postero-lateral fusion. A decompression may be associated.</description>
