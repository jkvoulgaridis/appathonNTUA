  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemiparesis is the most common motor disorder after a stroke. Most patients do not recover
      functional use of their paretic upper limb.

      The use of robotic assistance provides intensive motor training through a large number of
      repetitive movements, usually oriented and interactive tasks (pointing tasks, tracking paths
      tasks...). These feature have been demonstrated to be critical to stimulate brain plasticity
      after a brain damage. The InMotion Arm 2.0 manipulator works with an adaptive algorithm that
      provide patients with real-time Assistance-as-Needed™ desgned to enhance motor performance.

      Hypothesis: In the sub-acute phase of stroke, the structured practice of a large number of
      repeated movements will increase motor function of the upper limb compared to conventional
      rehabilitation. Secondly, this practice will be more effective in a free active mode (without
      assistance) than an active assisted mode (Assistance-as-Needed™).

      Expected secondary benefits: Subjective impression of improved use of the upper limb in
      activities of daily living and reduction of spastic cocontractions affecting the agonist and
      antagonist muscles during movements of the upper limb.

      Objectives: This randomized controlled trial will evaluate the effects of structured
      repetition programs of arm movements, on the function of the hemiparetic upper limb and motor
      control, between 4 and 10 weeks after the stroke, using a robotic device with or without
      assistance in partial substitution of conventional rehabilitation care, compared to a program
      with conventional care alone.

    <measure>Functional performance score change on Modified Frenchay Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Between the pre-rehabilitation state on the day of program start (Day1) and the state at the end of the program (Week6)</time_frame>
    <description>The scale measures active upper limb function in hemiparesis based on 10 everyday living tasks, each rated on a 10-point visual analogic scale. Six tasks are bimanual and four are unimanual performed with the paretic hand. Final score is an average of the 10 subscores (10 is the higher score).</description>

    <description>Fugl-Meyer (FM) assessment for measures of the motor impairment of the upper-limb; the test includes items related to movements of the shoulder, elbow, forearm (proximal arm), and wrist and hand (distal arm). The total scores range between 0 and 66.</description>

    <measure>Change in perceived function score on the Disability Assessment Scale (DAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>between Day1(day of program start), Week6(end of the program) and Week22 (16 weeks after the end of the program)</time_frame>
    <description>The scale evaluates upper limb functional disability in patients with spasticity following stroke. Patients are interviewed to determine the extent of functional impairment for the following 4 areas: hygiene,dressing, limb position, pain.The DAS Scale uses a 4-point rating scale according to the following criteria: 0(no disability),1 (mild disability), 2 (moderate disability) and 3(severe disability).</description>

    <time_frame>between Day1(day of program start), Week6(end of the program) and Week22 (16 weeks after the end of the program)</time_frame>
    <description>Three questions were asked to the patient, relating to pain, stiffness-induced discomfort and active function. Each rating was registered by the patient using a visual analogue scale ranging from 0 (worst pain imaginable, worst discomfort imaginable, arm totally useless, respectively) to 10 (no pain, no stiffness-induced discomfort, normal function, respectively).</description>
