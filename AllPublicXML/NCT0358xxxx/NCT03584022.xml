  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is safety study. Subjects will be undergoing the surgical procedure of nerve biopsy.
      After routine surgery without grafting, patients develop swelling, redness, tenderness and
      dysesthesia at the biopsy site. In order to determine whether grafting is safe compared to
      not repairing the nerve, it is necessary to compare treated vs. untreated patients using
      systematic, sensitive and reproducible criteria.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be evaluated for eligibility and then, after gaining informed consent, the
      surgical procedure will be scheduled. Baseline evaluations include physical/neurological
      examination, nerve conduction study and ultrasonography of the sural nerve, and testing for
      erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein and complete blood counts (with white
      blood cell differential). Surgery is done in an operating room under local or monitored
      anesthesia, depending on patient preference. An incision will be made above the ankle.
      Immediately after the surgery, the patient will repeat the baseline physical/neurological
      exams, and sural nerve ultrasonography.

      Participants will be evaluated either in the clinic or by phone on a regular basis and will
      be required to keep a journal and fill out symptom questionnaires for up to 12 months
      post-procedure.

      Development of a grade 4 local reaction at any time will fulfill criteria for review by the
      Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) for implant removal and definition as a failure.

    <intervention_model_description>Patients planned for diagnostic sural nerve biopsy will be screened. Nerve conduction study of the sural nerve is part of standard of care for patients who are screened for the study. If the amplitude of sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) is equal to or greater than 2 μV and the patient meets the other inclusive criteria, the patient will be recruited to enter the study. Ultrasonography of the sural nerve will be conducted. If the diameter of the sural nerve is greater than 2.75mm, the patient will be assigned to the control group. If sural nerve diameter is equal to or smaller than 2.75mm, the patient will be randomized to either the control or study group. A study team member (clinical coordinator) will draw a number from an envelope that holds equal amount of odd and even numbers. If the number drawn is an odd number, the patient will be assigned to the control group. If the number drawn is an even number, the patient will be assigned to the intervention group.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>up to 12 months post surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Post-surgical reactions will include evaluations of the following:
Percussion tenderness at site of proximal stump or repair site;
Skin redness at the site of biopsy (length and width measured with calipers);
Development of mild or moderate swelling along the site (yes or no). It is anticipated that this will resolve to a lower grade or progress to grade 4.
Development of severe swelling or pustules or evidence of tube extrusion or wound dehiscence.</description>

    <measure>Neuropathic pain as measured by SNAP</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months &amp; 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) will be measured at the ankle using small electric shocks and recording pads on the skin. This will be done by an experienced and board-certified electrophysiologist.</description>

    <measure>Neuropathic pain as measured by visual analogue pain scale</measure>

    <description>The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) consists of a straight line with the endpoints of 'No pain' and 'Pain as bad as it could possibly be'. The subject is asked to mark his or her pain level on the line between the two endpoints. The distance between 'no pain at all' and the mark defines the subject's pain.</description>

    <description>Subjects will be asked to check all of the following that apply: 1) fever, 2) unexplained or new joint aches and pain, 3) increased skin redness at or near the site of the biopsy, 4) increased swelling at or near the site of the biopsy, 5) some degree of pain or discomfort at or near the site of the biopsy</description>
