  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ulcerative colitis is a chronic condition that results in the inflammation of the colon and
      rectum. Patients suspected to have ulcerative colitis are diagnosed via colonoscopy.
      Moreover, colonoscopy is considered to be the preferred procedure for assessing the activity
      and extent of the disease, as well as monitoring treatment response and development of
      lesions. Therefore, optimal performance and visualization of mucosal lesions via adequate
      bowel preparation is essential in such patients. In addition, the nature of the disease and
      the need for multiple colonoscopies throughout a patient's lifetime makes compliance to
      repeated procedures difficult.

      It is well known that colonoscopy preparations are generally poorly tolerated, disliked and,
      consequently serve as an additional burden on patients.Polyethylene glycol (PEG), despite
      being the golden standard, is not very well tolerated. Inadequate bowel preparations are
      associated with cancelled procedures, prolonged procedure time, incomplete examination,
      increased cost and possibly complications, physician frustration and patient anxiety, but
      most importantly, with missed pathology. A good bowel preparation would need a solution with
      reasonable volume, acceptable taste, minimal diet restrictions, and easy-to-follow
      instructions. The strict need for adherence to drinking a relatively large volume of solution
      preparation may result in poor compliance.

      Despite the emergence of several types of low volume preparations, the evidence on the use of
      such solutions remains sparse. This is especially true in terms of patients' tolerability to
      the solution, and its relation with adequate bowel preparation during colonoscopy.

      The investigator's aim is to assess how small volume preparations such as sodium
      picosulfate/magnesium citrate (Citrafleet®) enhance participants tolerability to the
      solution, compliance, and adequacy of bowel preparations when compared to 2L polyethylene
      glycol + ascorbic acid (MoviPrep®) in patients with Ulcerative Colitis.

    <description>A data collection sheet will be handed to the blinded endoscopist to answer questions related to the quality of the preparation. A description ranging from Poor to Excellent is assigned to the quality of the prepped colon.
Poor - Re-preparation required; large amount of fecal residue precludes a complete examination
Inadequate - Inadequate but examination completed; enough feces or turbid fluid to prevent a reliable examination; less than 90%mucosa seen
Fair - Moderate amount of stool that can be cleared with suctioning permitting adequate evaluation of entire colonic mucosa; more than 90% mucosa seen
Good - Small amount of turbid fluid without feces not interfering with examination; more than 90% mucosa seen
Excellent - Small amount of clear liquid with clear mucosa seen; more than 95% mucosa seen</description>

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>A data collection sheet will be handed to the blinded endoscopist to answer questions related to the quality of the preparation. A score ranging from 0 to 3 is assigned to each of the three segments of the colon: Right colon, Mid colon and Left colon. The scores are calculated as follows:
0 = Unprepared colon segment with mucosa not seen due to solid stool that cannot be cleared.
= Portion of mucosa of the colon segment seen, but other areas of the colon segment not well seen due to staining, residual stool and/or opaque liquid.
= Minor amount of residual staining, small fragments of stool and/or opaque liquid, but mucosa of colon segment seen well.
= Entire mucosa of colon segment seen well with no residual staining, small fragments of stool or opaque liquid.</description>
