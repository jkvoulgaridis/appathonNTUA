  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed project is the first pilot test to examine interoceptive function as a
      mechanistic biomarker underlying Mindful Awareness in Body-oriented Therapy (MABT). MABT, an
      empirically-validated and manualized protocol is explicitly designed to teach interoceptive
      awareness skills for emotion regulation and is thus an ideal intervention approach in which
      to address this gap in research. This study uses a two group, randomized design to examine
      neural and physiological biomarkers in response to MABT. Twenty-four individuals reporting
      moderate stress will be recruited from the community and randomized to 8-week MABT
      intervention or the control condition. The study aims are to: 1) evaluate whether
      interoceptive training improves interoceptive function in the MABT vs control condition, and
      2) explore whether changes in interoceptive function correlate with improved health outcomes.
      Analyses will include within and between-group ANOVA of brain activity with symptom change as
      a covariate. This is the first study to test whether a clinical intervention aimed
      specifically at cultivating interoceptive awareness effects change on interoceptive
      biomarkers. The results will support larger NIH proposals to more comprehensively validate
      neuro and behavioral biomarkers of interoceptive training to enhance mental health,
      particularly targeting depression and substance use disorder that have identified
      interoceptive dysfunction and poor emotion regulation.
