  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to assess the impact of a physician-supervised non-surgical medical
      weight management program on prevalence of metabolic syndrome and to examine the relationship
      between program retention and levels of key indicators of metabolic syndrome among
      participants that self-enrolled to the program. A total of 479 overweight or obese
      participants aged 19 years or older were observed. The revised National Cholesterol Education
      Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP ATP III) criteria were used to define metabolic
      syndrome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each individual self-enrolled to a physician-supervised non-surgical weight management
      program, hereafter referred to as the Program. They received a weight loss intervention as a
      part of routine medical care in the Program. At the end of their first consultation, each
      individual that met the inclusion criteria and failed to meet the exclusion criteria was
      asked if he or she would like to join the study. Each individual was informed that the study
      would not change the type or level of care that he or she would receive while enrolled to the
      program; however, researchers would be studying the effects of their care through additional
      screenings. Individuals who thereafter signed an informed consent form were monitored for
      changes in health outcomes without change to the Program.

      This study was observational. Health outcomes were assessed in individuals that predefined
      their program status (i.e., enrolled or not enrolled). Each participant received routine
      medical care, and the investigators studied the effects of the intervention. No new
      intervention or intervention specific to participants only was assigned.

    <description>Participants of a physician-supervised nonsurgical weight management program were observed as they received weekly in-person coaching sessions with licensed clinicians. In-person coaching sessions were focused on educating participants on strategies to manage their weight and adopt a healthy lifestyle. Prescribed diets were individualized based on each participant's behavior, level of physical activity, and total energy expenditure. Supplements, appetite suppressant medications, and compounded injections were used to control appetite and/or boost energy during a period of low-caloric intake. The program was generally divided into three phases: Acute, Short-Term Maintenance, and Wellness.</description>
