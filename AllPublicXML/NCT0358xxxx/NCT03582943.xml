  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to determine if the beneficial effects of remote limb
      ischemic conditioning on learning seen in young adults are found in middle-aged and older
      adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ischemic conditioning is an endogenous phenomenon in which exposing a target organ or tissue
      to one or more brief episodes of ischemia results in protection of that organ against
      subsequent ischemia. The effects of ischemic conditioning are not confined within an organ
      but can be can be transferred from one organ to another, a technique called remote ischemic
      conditioning. A clinically feasible method for this is remote limb ischemic conditioning
      (RLIC), where episodes of ischemia and perfusion are induced with a blood pressure cuff
      placed on the arm.

      The overall goal of this line of work is to use ischemic conditioning to enhance learning and
      outcomes in persons with neurologic injuries. Two previous studies have shown that remote
      limb ischemic conditioning (RLIC) can enhance learning a motor task in healthy young adults.
      The next step is to determine which individuals would receive maximum benefit from RLIC
      before applying these findings to clinical rehabilitation populations such as stroke.
      Numerous factors, such as age, body mass index (BMI), sex, and cardiovascular comorbidities
      may influence the response. The current study determines if RLIC can enhance learning in
      middle-aged and older adults with their burden of co-morbidities.

        <title>Change in Balance Score</title>
        <description>Balance score at the end of training - balance score at baseline, where balance score is the average amount of time in seconds that a participant maintains the stability platform within ±3° of horizontal position during 5 trials of 30 seconds each. Five trials are averaged to form the balance score at each time point.</description>

            <title>Remote Limb Ischemic Conditioning (RLIC)</title>
            <description>RLIC is achieved via blood pressure cuff inflation to 20 mmHg above systolic blood pressure on the dominant arm. RLIC requires 45 minutes and involves 5 cycles of 5 minutes blood pressure cuff inflation followed by alternating 5 minutes of cuff deflation. RLIC is performed on visits 1-7.
RLIC: See descriptions under arm/group descriptions. RLIC is delivered for 7 visits, occurring on consecutive weekdays.
Balance training: All participants undergo training on a balance board, learning to hold the board level with equal weight on each leg. This is a motor learning task. Participants perform the balance task for 15, 30-second trials per day at visits 3-7.</description>
