      The current trial will explore the feasibility of a larger efficacy trial to test a newly
      developed form of online CBT called Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (which we have called
      &quot;ACT OPEN&quot;) for people with HIV and painful peripheral neuropathy. Participants will be
      recruited from HIV clinics in London, UK. Participants will be randomly chosen to receive the
      new ACT OPEN treatment right away or after waiting for 5 months. The treatment lasts for 8
      weeks. Participants will complete self-report questionnaires to assess pain, functioning, and
      mood at the beginning of the study and 8 weeks and five months later.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a major health problem in the United Kingdom and
      worldwide. Neuropathic pain in the feet related to peripheral neuropathy is one of the most
      common symptoms associated with HIV. This pain is difficult to treat and medications are not
      effective. Chronic pain in people with HIV is related to higher levels of disability and poor
      quality of life.

      Psychological treatments like cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) can improve quality of life
      for people with chronic pain in general (not HIV-related), and there have been efforts to
      provide more accessible versions of CBT over the Internet. However, it is not known whether
      Internet-based CBT is helpful for people with HIV and chronic pain.

      The current trial will explore the feasibility of a newly developed form of online CBT called
      Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (which we have called &quot;ACT OPEN&quot;) for people with HIV and
      painful peripheral neuropathy. Participants will be recruited from HIV clinics in London, UK.
      Participants will be randomly chosen to receive the new ACT OPEN treatment right away or
      after waiting for 5 months. The treatment lasts for 8 weeks. Participants will complete
      self-report questionnaires to assess pain, functioning, and mood at the beginning of the
      study and 8 weeks and five months later.

      The purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility of a larger trial evaluating the
      impact of online ACT for people with HIV and chronic pain in their feet. Key feasibility
      parameters that will be evaluated will include an estimate of the recruitment and retention
      rates, treatment completion rate and satisfaction, and an estimate of the effect size of
      changes in standard pain outcome measures.

    <description>Participants will access the ACT OPEN treatment through a secure online platform. Each session consists of brief videos and audio recordings that provide information about pain and guide participants through experiential exercises (e.g., mindfulness, values clarification, goal-setting). Participants will respond to questions assessing their experiences during the session and their progress using online messaging and/or brief telephone calls according to their preference. Therapists will provide individualised feedback. ACT OPEN consists of 12 sessions over 6 weeks. Participants will be given two further weeks to finish any uncompleted sessions, or to complete additional sessions (up to four) as agreed with their therapist.</description>

    <intervention_name>Waiting list control</intervention_name>
    <description>Participants will receive their usual treatment for 5 months, after which they will complete ACT OPEN as described. A waiting list control was chosen as there is no clearly credible active psychotherapy to serve as the comparator in this context, particularly in light of high drop-out rates in two previous studies of CBT for pain in HIV. Providing the online treatment without therapist support may appear to be a logical comparison group instead of a waitlist control. However, there is evidence that therapist support is a key component of online CBT and, therefore, without this support it may not represent a credible treatment against which to judge the full treatment. In the context of the feasibility aims of this trial these reasons, the use of a waiting list control is thus justified.</description>
