    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate clinical and laboratory safety of eribulin mesylate
      in treating participants with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, who have
      progressed after at least one regimen of chemotherapy which has included anthracycline and
      taxane therapy.

    <description>Clinical Safety will be assessed by recording the adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs) observed during the study period and its relation to the study medication. AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a treatment of medicinal product. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, results in life-threatening event, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect.</description>

    <description>AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a treatment of medicinal product. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, results in life-threatening event, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect. TEAEs are defined as those events that started on or after the date and time of administration of the first dose of study drug and those events that were present prior to the administration of the first dose of study drug and increased in severity during the study.</description>

    <measure>Objective Tumor Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to first date of documented CR, PR, SD, or PD, up to end of study treatment (approximately up to 17 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Radiological confirmation of objective response rate (ORR) will be assessed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors(RECIST)criteria version 1.1. The response would be assessed based on the four response parameters -complete response(CR), partial response(PR), stable disease(SD), progressive disease(PD).CR is defined as disappearance of all target lesions. PR is seen when there is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum longest diameters. When there is neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum of longest diameters since the treatment started then, the response is evaluated as SD.PD is seen when there is at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions.</description>

    <measure>Objective Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to first date of documented CR, PR, SD, or PD, up to end of study treatment (approximately up to 17 months)</time_frame>
    <description>ORR measures the response rate using the formula - CR+PR/ (number of eligible participants)*100. CR is defined as disappearance of all target lesions. PR is seen when there is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum longest diameters.</description>
