    <time_frame>weeks 1-6</time_frame>
    <description>CGI-I: 7-point clinician rated scale ranging from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse). Clinician responded to a question: &quot;Compared to your subject's condition at the beginning of treatment, how much has your subject changed?&quot;. Improvement was compared to baseline and was defined as a score of 1 (very much improved), 2 (much improved), or 3 (minimally improved) on the scale. Higher score = more affected.</description>

    <description>CBCL was standardized for children ages 4 to 18 years and measured child internalizing and externalizing behaviors and total problems. The 4-18 years' checklist contains 140 questions and responses were recorded on a Likert scale: 0 = Not True, 1 = Somewhat or Sometimes True, 2 = Very True or Often True. The range of possible values was 0-280 (0=good to 280=worst).</description>

    <measure>Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>CGAS: clinician-rated global assessment item for children based on symptoms and social functioning in home, school, and community settings. Scores on this single item range from 1 (most impaired) to 100 (healthiest); higher levels indicate greater health, with descriptive anchors for every 10-point interval. Scores above 70 on this scale are considered within the &quot;normal&quot; range; lower score indicates need for increased supervision.</description>
