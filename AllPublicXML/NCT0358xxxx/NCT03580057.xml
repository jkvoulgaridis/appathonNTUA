    <measure>Changes in quality of life (QOL) measured by RAND 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey Instrument (SF-36) between visits.</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 1 (2 weeks postpartum, visit 2 (6 months postpartum) and visit 3 (post weaning ~15 months postpartum)</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 RAND consists of 36 questions grouped into 8 dimensions: physical functioning, limitations in physical role functioning, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, limitations in emotional role functioning, and mental health. Each dimension is scored from 0 (worst imaginable health) to 100 (best imaginable health).</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in quality of life (QOL) measured by EuroQol 5D (EQ-5D-5L) between visits.</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 1 (2 weeks postpartum, visit 2 (6 months postpartum) and visit 3 (post weaning ~15 months postpartum)</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D-5L measures 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression (self-classified). Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems. The respondent is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking (or placing a cross) in the box against the most appropriate statement in each of the 5 dimensions (levels of perceived problems from 1. level indicating no problem to 5. level indicating extreme problems). This decision results in a 1-digit number expressing the level selected for that dimension. The digits for 5 dimensions can be combined in a 5-digit number describing the respondent's health state. EQ-5D-5L health states may be converted into a single index value.The index values, presented in country specific value sets, facilitates the calculation of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) that will be used to inform economic evaluations of the interventions.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in quality of life (QOL) measured by EuroQol Visual Analog Scale (EQ-VAS) between visits.</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 1 (2 weeks postpartum, visit 2 (6 months postpartum) and visit 3 (post weaning ~15 months postpartum)</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-VAS records the respondent's self-rated health on a 20-cm visual analogue scale . The scale is numbered from 0 (the worst health you can imagine) to 100 (the best health you can imagine.) This information can be used as a quantitative measure of health.</description>

    <description>12-week program of dietary behavior modification treatment (LEVA-method by Bertz et al. Am J Clin Nutr 2012;96:698), leading to 6 kg weight loss (0.5 kg per week) and a healthier diet (less sugar, snacks, full fat products, more vegetables and fruit, smaller portion sizes). Weight is monitored by phone contact every second week. After 12 weeks, the women are followed up by e-mail contact for 9 additional months.</description>
