  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research uses the Liquid Chromatography coupled to tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS / MS)
      technique on dried blot spot samples for the neonatal screening of congenital adrenal
      hyperplasia.

      The main objective of this study is to demonstrate that this technique allow dosage of
      adrenal steroids on dried blot spot samples as efficiently and with the same sensitivity than
      the current technic on a cohort of 132 newborns aged 2 to 5 days, with a gestational age
      greater than or equal to 30 weeks of amenorrhea.

        National neonatal screening covers all newborns aged between 48 and 120 hours, regardless
        of birth term. Premature babies born before 30 weeks of amenorrhoea are cared for in
        specialized neonatal or intensive care units and are intensively monitored to rule out any
        risk of not diagnosing HCS in a child with it. This is why our study will be conducted on a
        newborn population with a birth term greater than 30 weeks of amenorrhoea.
