  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Almost one-third (30%) of persons 65 years and older suffer from cLBP and cause a significant
      negative impact on individuals and society in the U.S. The goal of managing cLBP is decreased
      pain and disability.To accomplish this, cLBP sufferers often use analgesics including opioids
      to decrease pain and facilitate activity, but the side effects caused by these medications
      are problematic. A better pain management strategy clearly needs to be developed.

      The investigators propose to test auricular point acupressure (APA), a non-invasive, easily
      administered, patient-controlled, and non-pharmacological strategy, to provide rapid, safe,
      and an innovative solution for chronic low back pain (cLBP) in older adults. APA involves an
      acupuncture-like stimulation of the ear without needles. With APA, small seeds are taped to
      specific ear points. The patient is taught to apply pressure to the seeds, with the thumb and
      index finger, three times a day (morning, noon, and evening) for three minutes each session
      to achieve pain relief. The investigators have developed a detailed APA protocol to teach
      health-care providers without experience in acupuncture and traditional Chinese Medicine that
      investigators can learn about APA in brief educational seminars as a treatment including the
      systematic identification of ear points (called auricular diagnosis). The investigators teach
      methods that enable patients to continue using APA to self-manage participants' pain.

      Brain imaging studies in acupuncture indicate that acupuncture can restore normal functional
      connectivity related to pain reduction. Studies suggest that stimulation of ear points (1)
      excites the somatotopic reflex system in the brain and that pathological brain patterns are
      electrically reset to stop the unwanted activation of spinal pain pathways, explaining the
      possible immediate pain relief that patients feel after APA and (2) cause a broad spectrum of
      systemic effects, such as vasodilation, by releasing endorphin to elicit short-term analgesic
      effects or neuropeptide-induced anti-inflammatory cytokines, which may explain long-term
      effects.

      The Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) smartphone app will be used to collect real-time
      cLBP outcomes and adherence to APA practice. Treatment and nonspecific psychological placebo
      effects will be measured via questionnaires for all participants. Neuro-transmitters is
      measured by inflammatory biomarkers. Blood samples will be collected for serum collection and
      a multiplex bead-based immunofluorescence assay performed to check for serum levels.
      Mini-Mental State Examination will be used to screen for cognitive function, also HRQoL,
      satisfaction, treatment beliefs and expectations, sleep, relaxation effects, catastrophizing
      and fear/avoidance, and placebo effects will be measured.

    <description>The Brief Pain Inventory-short form (BPI-sf) questionnaire includes assessment of pain location and multiple aspects of severity of pain, numbness, tingling, and stiffness, including worst, least, average pain, and present, as well as the interference with daily activities. The Brief Pain Inventory-short form (BPI-sf) has a total score ranging from 0 to 10 with higher scores indicating more pain.</description>

    <description>The Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ), 24-item measure, was used to assess the impact of back pain on their daily functioning. The score ranged from 0 (no disability) to 24 (maximum disability).</description>

    <description>The Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) was used to measure a participants impairment and quality of life on 10 items with 0-5 point scales [37]. The score ranges from 0-100%; a lower score indicates less disability.</description>

    <measure>Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>The WHO Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF), used to measure quality of life. The WHOQOL-BREF, is self-administered, and measures the following broad domains: physical health, psychological health, social relationships, and environment. Each individual item of the WHOQoL is scored from 1 to 5 on a response scale, which is stipulated as a five-point ordinal scale.</description>

    <measure>Treatment Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>The participants will be assessed using a 12-item scale, each item with score between 0-5 with 5 being most satisfied with treatment progress. Highest score of 60 (maximum satisfaction) and lowest score of 0 (least satisfaction)</description>

    <measure>Fear-Avoidance</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>It is measured by Fear-avoidance beliefs questionnaire (FABQ) that focuses on participants beliefs about how physical activity and work affect their pain. The questionnaire consists of 16 items in which a participant rates their agreement with each statement on a 7-point Likert scale. Where 0= completely disagree, 6=completely agree. A higher score indicates more strongly held fear-avoidance beliefs.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment and nonspecific psychological placebo effects will be measured via HEAL treatment expectation and HEAL provider connection questionnaires. The participants will be asked few questions about their; confidence in treatment, treatment expectations, their value to the treatment, how good they feel about the treatment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain and Catastrophizing Scale (PCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>The PCS was included to detect exaggerated and negative interpretations of pain. It is a self-report scale that consists of 13 items. Participants were asked to reflect on past painful experiences and to indicate to which degree he/she experienced symptoms such as helplessness or rumination when feeling pain.This is a 0-4 Likert scale (score sum 0-52) with responses ranging from &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;all the time,&quot; and high scores indicate stronger catastrophizing.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Sham Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>The same procedure for APA will be applied but the tapes/seeds will be placed on five different ear points, comprising mouth, stomach, duodenum, internal ear, and tonsil.
These points are chosen for the sham APA treatment for two reasons. First, they are distinct from the zones of the ear (and the points therein) associated with the lower back, and correspond to body regions in which the participant is usually pain-free. Second, they are equivalent in number to those points used in the APA treatment group.</description>
