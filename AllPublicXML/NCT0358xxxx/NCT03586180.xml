  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hospitalized children who undergo painful procedures are more susceptible than others to
      experiencing iatrogenic effects, such as anxiety, pain, and severe stress. Clowns in clinical
      setting have been found to be effective in reducing children's experiences of these effects
      during hospitalization and before procedures. This article provides an overview of clowning
      in health care settings; reviews major studies conducted on clowning for hospitalized
      children, discussing evidence that clown interventions decrease pain and distress in
      pediatric patients; and concludes with a discussion of health care clowning as a profession.
