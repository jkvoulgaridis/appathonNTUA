    <textblock>
      A prospective multi-center study to define the sensitivity and specificity of CAPTURE for
      identifying previously undiagnosed patients with clinically significant COPD in a broad range
      of primary care settings.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The CAPTURE tool consists of a 5-item self-administered questionnaire and selected use of
      peak expiratory flow (PEF) measurement, designed to identify clinically significant COPD.

      For Aim 1 approximately 5,000 patients will be recruited across 100 participating primary
      care clinics. Eligible participants will undergo a baseline visit during which the CAPTURE
      tool and PEF will be obtained, as well as spirometry and other participant characteristics.
