  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vanderbilt University Medical Center is one of the largest-volume DBS centers in the country.
      From 2007 through October 2017, 265 Parkinson's disease (PD) patients underwent deep brain
      stimulation (DBS), 168 of those implanted in subthalamic nucleus (STN) and 97 in globus
      pallidus interna (GPi). Pre-operatively, each patient is extensively evaluated with a battery
      of validated motor, cognitive, and mood instruments. This information is stored in RedCAP, a
      secure online database platform. In an attempt to capture longitudinal outcomes in this
      population of interest, we will recruit all PD patients two years or more status post DBS who
      are receiving regular care at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Study participants will
      undergo a condensed evaluation of motor function (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale
      Part III), cognitive performance (Mini-Mental Status Examination), mood (Beck Depression
      Inventory), and quality of life (Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39). These results will be
      compared to baseline measures performed pre-operatively, allowing for assessment of interval
      change. STN and GPi DBS patients will be analyzed separately.

      Patients will be recruited from review of movement disorders neurologists' outpatient census.
      All patients with PD two or more years status post DBS will be contacted via phone and/or
      mailed letter. Any interested patient will be mailed or e-mailed (via RedCAP) a copy of the
      study informed consent form. Willing patients will present to the Vanderbilt Movement
      Disorders Clinic for an opportunity to inquire further about the study and sign the informed
      consent form in person.

      Participants will have a single study visit, ideally coordinated with their regularly
      scheduled neurology follow-up. During the study visit, the following evaluations will be
      performed by a trained research assistant:

      Video-recorded UPDRS III BDI MMSE PDQ-39 In addition, current PD medications and number of
      falls in the past 6 months will be recorded. Assessments will occur in the on-medication,
      on-DBS state.

      The video-recorded UPDRS III will be reviewed and score at a subsequent date by a blinded
      rater (movement discord trained neurologist).
