  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mechanical ventilation may be necessary to save the life of a patient due to an accident,
      pneumonia or surgery. The ventilator then temporarily takes over the function of the
      respiratory muscles. During treatment in the Intensive Care, the amount of support provided
      by the ventilator is usually lowered gradually, until the point that the patient can breathe
      unassisted once again. However, in a large fraction of patients (up to 40%) it takes days to
      weeks before the patient is able to breathe unassisted, even after the initial disease has
      been treated. This is called prolonged weaning.

      A possible cause of prolonged weaning is weakness of the respiratory muscles. The diaphragm,
      the largest respiratory muscle, can become weakened if it is used too little, much like all
      other muscles in the body. Additionally, damage and weakness of the diaphragm can occur when
      the diaphragm has to work excessively. Therefore, it is important that the diaphragm works
      enough; not so little that it becomes weakened, but not too much either.

      Measurements of pressure generated by the diaphragm are needed to determine the current level
      of diaphragm activity in a patient on mechanical ventilation. However, these measurements are
      rarely performed, because they are time-consuming and require placement of two additional
      nasogastric catheters. This is a shame, as adequate loading of the diaphragm might prevent
      development of weakness, leading to shorter duration of mechanical ventilation. Finding
      alternative measurements of diaphragm effort might be a solution to this problem.

      It has been hypothesized that the electrical activity of the diaphragm provides a reliable
      indication of diaphragm effort. This study aims to determine whether there is a correlation
      between pressure generation by the diaphragm and electrical activity of the diaphragm over a
      wide range of respiratory activity, from low effort to extreme effort, in healthy volunteers.
