  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In healthy individuals, unimanual movement (with either the left or right hand) is associated
      with activity in a network of predominantly contralateral brain regions, including the
      primary motor cortex (PMC). This laterality is often compromised following a middle cerebral
      artery (MCA) stroke. Neuroimaging studies of these patients have shown that unimanual
      movements with the effected hand are associated with elevated Blood Oxygen-Level Dependent
      (BOLD) signal in both the lesioned and the nonlesioned primary motor cortices. Elevated
      activity in the contralesional PMC is well-established in chronic stroke patients and is
      associated with poor motor rehabilitation outcomes. Yet the neurobiologic basis for this
      aberrant neural activity is equivocal. The overarching goal of this project is to determine
      the neurobiologic basis for elevated activity in the contralesional primary motor cortex.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One factor that may contribute to elevated activity in the contralesional PMC is increased
      cortical excitatory tone within the contralesional hemisphere (Aim 1).

      While approximately 80% of the descending corticospinal neurons that control the right hand
      originate in the left PMC, 20% originate in the right PMC. Elevated activity in the right PMC
      of left-sided stroke patients may reflect compensatory activity of these descending fibers.
      Neural activity in the PMC reflects the balance of local excitatory (glutamatergic) and
      inhibitory (GABAergic) processing. It can be measured in two manners: 1)
      electrophysiologically, using single hemisphere paired pulse transcranial magnetic
      stimulation (TMS), and 2) neurochemically, using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).

      Another factor that may contribute to elevated activity in the contralesional PMC is a loss
      of transcallosal inhibition between the hemispheres (Aim 2). During right hand movement, the
      left PMC of healthy individuals actively inhibits the right PMC via inhibitory projections
      through the corpus callosum. In left MCA stroke patients, elevated activity in the
      contralesional (right) PMC when moving the right hand may reflect a loss of typical
      inhibition from the left PMC. The integrity of inter-hemispheric information transfer can be
      measured in two manners: 1) using bi-hemispheric paired-pulse TMS, and 2) using a multimodal
      brain stimulation/brain imaging approach, interleaved TMS/MRI.

      Through interleaved TMS/MRI, the investigators can selectively stimulate the ipsilesional PMC
      and quantify the amount of TMS-induced activity in the contralesional PMC. These two
      explanations will be tested through a cross-sectional investigation of neural function in
      left MCA stroke patients with mild-moderate right upper extremity impairment and controls
      matched for age and cardiovascular risk factors. To assess the clinical relevance of these
      factors on motor dysfunction, the investigators will perform a detailed kinematic assessment
      of movement efficiency, smoothness and compensation (Aim 3).

    <description>Using spectroscopy investigators will determine if the ratio of glutamate/GABA is higher in stroke patients than controls. Furthermore, in healthy controls prepulse inhibition will be positively correlated with the concentration of GABA, and prepulse facilitation will be positively correlated with the concentration of glutamate. Although we expect this relationship to be true in both the controls and the stroke patients, variation from this pattern in the stroke patients would suggest that there is another factor beyond simple within-hemisphere measurements that is affecting the contralesional cortex activity.</description>

    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of two weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Impairment on bimanual tasks will be related to the outcome measures of previous Aims. That is, individuals with less transcallosal inhibition will perform worse on the bimanual task (less efficiency and smoothness) than individuals with transcallosal inhibition closer to healthy controls. This is based on pilot data from Dr. Woodbury of the Quantitative Behavioral Assessment and Rehabilitation Core that suggests during bimanual tasks the kinetics of the impaired arm remain the same but the previously unimpaired limb performs worse. This suggests that loss of inhibition 'infects' the arm movement typically controlled by the contralesional hemisphere.</description>

    <description>Briefly, patients will be given two pressure-sensitive bulbs (one to be held in each hand and fastened lightly to their wrists with Velcro such that they do not drop it during the scan. During two 2½ minute runs they will be prompted to squeeze the bulb in either their affected or unaffected hand in blocks of 15 seconds. These blocks will be interspersed with blocks of rest. The pressure from the bulbs will be digitally recorded and quantified offline in order to: 1) verify that the patient was squeezing the ball, and 2) assess the presence of 'mirror movements' from the opposing hand that may inform the imaging results regarding loss of laterality).</description>
