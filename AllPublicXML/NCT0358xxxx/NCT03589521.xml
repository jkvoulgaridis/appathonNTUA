  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The specific aims of the ABCT_Military project are as follows: 1) To modify the existing,
      Alcohol Behavioral Couple Therapy (ABCT) model to treat service members in the reconstitution
      (post deployment, reintegration, or separation) stage of service, and develop optional
      psychoeducation modules to address relevant co-morbid problems and challenges in this
      population in a weekly, 15 session, stand-alone outpatient format. 2) To test feasibility and
      preliminary efficacy of the study intervention protocol in a successive cohort design for one
      cohort of 8 couples and one cohort of 22 couples, with iterative manual revision.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study staff will screen potential participants over the phone, and arrange Baseline (BL)
      research interviews for appropriate couples. The couple will meet with the program
      interviewer for approximately 2 hours. After the BL interview, couples will be scheduled to
      attend therapy sessions. Couples will complete brief within treatment self-report
      assessments. Couples will complete a post treatment follow up interview four months after
      session 1.
