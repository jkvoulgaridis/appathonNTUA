      This phase Ib trial studies the best dose and side effects of niraparib and copanlisib in
      treating patients with endometrial, ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer
      that has come back. Niraparib and copanlisib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking
      some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of
      the combination of niraparib and copanlisib in patients with recurrent high-grade serous or
      BRCA mutant ovarian cancer or recurrent endometrial, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal
      cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the tolerability of the RP2D of niraparib and copanlisib. II. To determine
      the safety and observed toxicities of the combination of niraparib and copanlisib in patients
      with recurrent endometrial, recurrent high-grade serous ovarian, or BRCA mutant ovarian
      cancer.

      III. To estimate the activity of the drug combination at all dose levels in each patient
      cohort by objective response rate and proportion of patients surviving progression free (PFS)
      at 6 months.

      IV. To determine response duration of the drug combination at all dose levels. V. To
      determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of the combination to assess the presence of any drug
      interaction between the two co-administered agents.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if response to therapy is associated with molecular profile of the tumor
      (including, but not limited to, molecular aberrations in the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway or defects
      in homologous recombination) before treatment.

      II. To examine associations with early changes in functional proteomic biomarkers in tumor
      biopsies before and after treatment and tumor response in patients with recurrent
      endometrial, recurrent high-grade serous ovarian, or BRCA mutant ovarian cancer treated with
      the investigational agents.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive niraparib orally (PO) daily on days 1-28 and copanlisib intravenously (IV)
      over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 and 90 days, then every 3
      months for up to 5 years.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Any histologically confirmed recurrent endometrial adenocarcinoma (except for
             carcinosarcoma), recurrent high-grade serous ovarian/primary peritoneal/fallopian tube
             carcinoma, or deleterious BRCA mutant recurrent ovarian/primary peritoneal/fallopian
             tube cancer for whom no curative option is available will be eligible. DOSE ESCALATION
             ONLY: For patients with ovarian cancer in the dose escalation cohort, only patients
             with recurrent, platinum resistant disease are eligible to enroll on study. Platinum
             resistance is defined as progression within 6 months from completion of platinum based
             therapy (the date should be calculated from the last administered dose of platinum
             therapy). In addition, patients in this cohort with a BRCA mutation must have also
             progressed after treatment with PARP inhibitor.

          -  Patients may have unlimited prior chemotherapeutic regimens for management of
             recurrent endometrial or ovarian carcinoma. Patients who have received prior PARP
             inhibitors ARE allowed to participate. Patients who have received prior PI3K-pathway
             inhibitors ARE allowed to participate on the dose escalation phase ONLY. Patients may
             have progressed on prior PARP inhibitor and/or PI3K-pathway inhibitor but they may not
             have discontinued drug for toxicity.

          -  With the exception of alopecia, peripheral neuropathy, and bone marrow parameters, any
             unresolved toxicities from prior chemotherapy should be no greater than Common
             Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) (version 5.0) grade 1 at the time of
             starting study treatment.

          -  Patients should have measurable disease as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in
             Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1. If no measurable disease is present, patients should have
             assessable disease such as pleural effusion, ascites, with CA125 Gynecological Cancer
             Intergroup (GCIG) criteria.

          -  Patients must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of
             0 or 1.

          -  The effects of niraparib and copanlisib on the developing human fetus are unknown. For
             this reason, women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum
             pregnancy test within 7 days prior to taking study treatment. Female patients and
             their male partners must also agree to use effective contraception when sexually
             active. This applies since signing of the informed consent form and 6 months (for
             women of child bearing potential) after the last study drug administration. A woman is
             considered of childbearing potential (WOCBP), i.e. fertile, following menarche and
             until becoming post-menopausal unless permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization
             methods include but are not limited to hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy and
             bilateral oophorectomy. A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months
             without an alternative medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level
             in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a post-menopausal state in women
             not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy.

          -  A man is considered fertile after puberty unless permanently sterile by bilateral
             orchidectomy. The investigator or a designated associate must advise the patient
             (WOCBP or men who have not undergone bilateral orchidectomy) how to achieve highly
             effective birth control method. Birth control should be used from the signing of the
             patient consent form and for 180 days following the last dose of niraparib. Acceptable
             methods of birth control include:

               -  Two highly effective forms of contraception, defined as contraceptive methods
                  with a failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and
                  correctly. Patients and their sexual partners who've undergone vasectomy or tubal
                  occlusion must also use a male condom with spermicide.

               -  Permanent sterilization, defined as hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy,
                  bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral orchidectomy; postmenopausal, defined as a
                  female patient or sexual partner &gt; 45 years of age who has not menstruated for at
                  least 12 consecutive months; total sexual abstinence.

          -  It is unknown if niraparib or copanlisib are expressed in human breast milk. For this
             reason, women must not breast-feed while taking the study medications.

          -  Total bilirubin =&lt; 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) (within 7 days
             prior to entry/randomization) (&lt; 2 x ULN for patients with Gilbert-Meulengracht
             syndrome or for patients with cholestasis due to compressive adenopathies of the
             hepatic hilum).

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) =&lt; 2.5 x ULN unless
             the liver is involved with tumor, in that case, ALT/AST must be =&lt; 5 x ULN (within 7
             days prior to entry/randomization).

          -  International normalized ratio (INR) =&lt; 1.5 x ULN and partial thromboplastin time
             (PTT) =&lt; 1.5 x ULN (within 7 days prior to entry/randomization). Prothrombin time (PT)
             can be used instead of INR if PTT =&lt; 1.5 x ULN.

          -  Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &gt;= 50% (within 7 days prior to
             entry/randomization).

             Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation. If not on target, the
             evaluation may be repeated once after at least 24 hours either according to the
             CKD-EPI equation or by 24 hour sampling. If the later result is within acceptable
             range, it may be used to fulfill the inclusion criteria instead.

          -  Patients must be able to swallow and tolerate oral medications and not have
             gastrointestinal illnesses that would preclude absorption of niraparib (e.g.
             uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea; malabsorption syndrome; ulcerative
