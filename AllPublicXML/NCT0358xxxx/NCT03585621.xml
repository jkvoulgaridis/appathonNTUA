    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single institution, phase I-II study of stereotactic body radiotherapy
      (SBRT) for unresected breast cancer. Twenty-four patients with advanced breast cancer who are
      not candidates for surgery (metastatic disease, unresectable, medically inoperable) or
      decline surgery will be enrolled in a prospective study using SBRT (4 fractions of radiation
      therapy over 12-15 days) as the primary treatment modality.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Histologically confirmed diagnosis of invasive breast carcinoma of non-lobular histology.

        Unifocal tumour Previously assessed by a breast surgeon and medical oncologist, with no
        surgery being recommended at time of enrollment.

        Primary breast and axillary surgery not recommended/performed due to any of the following:

          -  distant metastatic disease

          -  unresectable T4 disease and/or

          -  medically inoperable and/or

          -  patient declined breast surgery Stages T1-T4, N1-N2, M0-M1 disease Ability to attend
             radiation planning and therapy, able to attend for follow-up care Able to provide
             written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Received chemotherapy within 3 weeks prior to breast SBRT. (Concurrent endocrine therapy is
        permitted) Multifocal or multicentric tumours. Ipsilateral supraclavicular or
        infraclavicular nodal disease &gt;= 1cm size that is at the level of or superior to the
        brachial plexus Unable to meet the brachial plexus dose constraints despite compromising
        coverage of target volumes - as per the discretion of the treating physician Treatment
        target volume estimated to occupy &gt; 50% of the ipsilateral whole breast volume.

        Locally recurrent breast cancer, with previous radiotherapy to the breast, or previous
        lumpectomy or mastectomy. Ipsilateral breast implant. Serious non-malignant disease that
        precludes definitive surgical or radiation treatment (e.g.

        scleroderma, systemic lupus erythematosus, cardiovascular/pulmonary/renal disease).

        Women who are pregnant or lactating. Psychiatric or addictive disorders that preclude
        obtaining informed consent or adherence to protocol
