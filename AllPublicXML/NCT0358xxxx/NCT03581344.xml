    <textblock>
      This is a randomized multicentric clinical trial in patients affected by resectable rectal
      cancer, cT2N1-2, cT3N0-2, MRF -, aiming to evaluate the impact of the interval between
      chemoradiotherapy and surgery on the pathological response.

      Patients will undergo a neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy treatment and those achieving a major
      or complete clinical and instrumental response will then be randomized and submitted to
      surgery with two options: the first group will be operated after an interval of 9-11 weeks,
      while the second will undergo surgery at 13-16 weeks, after a further clinical and
      instrumental re-evaluation 11-12 weeks after the end of chemoradiotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a randomized multicentric phase III study. The Patients included in the
      study will undergo a chemoradiotherapy neoadjuvant treatment.

      Patients will undergo a clinical-instrumental restaging at 7-8 weeks and will be randomized
      in two groups in case of major or complete response:

        1. Surgery 9-11 weeks after the end of neoadjuvant treatment

        2. Second clinical and instrumental re-evaluation after 11-12 weeks and then surgery 13-16
           weeks after the end of chemoradiotherapy.

      Only patients who underwent preoperative chemoradiotherapy and achieved a complete or major
      response at the clinical-instrumental restaging 7-8 weeks after the end of neoadjuvant
      treatment will be included in the study.

      The control arm of the BRIDGE-1 study is represented by patients undergoing surgery 9-11
      weeks after the end of chemoradiotherapy, whose major/complete response has to be assessed
      with clinical-instrumental exams to be performed 7-8 weeks after the end of
      chemoradiotherapy.

      The experimental arm of the the BRIDGE-1 study is represented by patients undergoing surgery
      13-16 weeks after the end of chemoradiotherapy, showing a major/complete response at the
      clinical-instrumental exams to be performed 7-8 weeks after the end of chemoradiotherapy.
      These patients will undergo a new clinical and instrumental evaluation, 11-12 weeks after the
      end of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy treatment, prior to be submitted to the delayed surgical
      procedure.

      Patients will be recruited in the two different arms, according to a randomized assignment,
      realized through an electronic table, in order to assure the efficacy of this study. Patients
      will be divided according to gender, age, stage and tumour site (low, medium and high) in
      each centre.

      When a patient will be assigned to a specific arm, the randomization procedure will recruit a
      similar patient in the other arm.

      CLINICAL STAGING AND RESTAGING EVALUATION TNM clinical and pathological stages are reported
      according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer 7th Edition, adenocarcinoma histological
      grading according to WHO classification.

      Staging and baseline clinical evaluation

        1. Patient history

        2. Digital rectal examination

        3. Recto-colonoscopy + biopsy (in case of impossibility to perform colonoscopy due to
           stenosing lesion, rectoscopy + biopsy and double-contrast barium enema or colon CT or
           colonoscopy within 6 months from surgery are suggested)

        4. Pelvic MRI for loco-regional staging

        5. CT of the thorax and abdomen for distant metastases staging

        6. PET-CT (optional)

        7. CEA test

        8. Quality of Life (QoL) questionnaires compilation

      Restaging at 7-8 weeks

        1. Digital rectal examination

        2. Pelvic MRI

        3. PET-CT if performed during staging

        4. Rectoscopy (in case of major/complete response)

        5. CEA test

        6. Quality of Life (QoL) questionnaires compilation

      7.3 Restaging at 11-12 weeks (for patients randomized in the delayed surgery arm)

        1. Digital rectal examination

        2. Pelvic MRI

        3. PET-CT if previously performed

        4. Rectoscopy

        5. CEA test

      As secondary outcomes, acute and late toxicities, quality of life, bowel function, rectal
      continence and sexual activity will be evaluated in this study.

      PREOPERATIVE CHEMORADIOTHERAPY TREATMENT Chemoradiotherapy treatment schedule considers a
      total radiotherapy dose of 55 Gy in 5 weeks, delivered with a 3D concomitant boost or
      Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) Simultaneous Integrated Boost (SIB) technique.

      Concomitant chemotherapy considers administration of Capecitabine for the whole radiotherapy
      course.

      SURGICAL APPROACH Surgery will be performed according to standard techniques using the &quot; open
      &quot; approach, laparoscopic or robotic, according to surgeon's preference and including both
      anterior resection of the rectum and abdominoperineal rectal resection with mesorectal total
      excision (Total Mesorectal Excision, TME).

      The possibility of sphincter salvage will be evaluated collectively by the members of the
      multidisciplinary team at the time of diagnosis, at first re-evaluation and in case of second
      re-evaluation.

      PATHOLOGICAL EVALUATION Resected rectal specimens will undergo gross examination in order to
      macroscopically evaluate the status of the mesorectal margin.

      After marking with indian ink the mesorectal margin, cutting axially the colorectal segment
      on its anti-mesorectal side and fixating it in formalin, transverse sections of the surgical
      specimen will be serially cut.

      In case of macroscopic evidence of disease, sampling of the most infiltrated area and of the
      tumoral area with the minimum distance from the mesorectal margin, which will be included,
      will be performed.

      In case of macroscopic absence or in the suspect of residual disease, the initial tumour site
      will be completely included in the specimen, localizing it from clinical reports with the
      potential aid of endoscopic tattoos and/or tissue alterations by the treatment (scar
      retraction or increase of tissue consistency).

      In case of negative reports of the first histological sections, each inclusion will undergo
      three levels of histological section series.

      The histopathological evaluation of the response to the therapy will be scored according to
      the following classifications: Mandard A.M., et al; Washington MK et al/College of American
      Pathologists; in presence of positive nodes, the Nottingham Rectal Cancer Prognostic Index
      (NRPI) score will also be used.

      ADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY The protocol does not establish criteria for the administration of
      adjuvant systemic treatment.

      The single center maintains the discretion to administer postoperative chemotherapy.

      FOLLOW-UP The follow-up program recommended in the study is described in the national
      guidelines in effect.

      Patients will undergo a clinical evaluation 1 month after surgery, every third month during
      the first year and then every sixth month up to the fifth year.

      During follow-up visits the following tests will be performed and evaluated :

        1. Physical examination and digital rectal exam ;

        2. CEA and routine blood chemistry screen ;

        3. Colonoscopy (at 1 year, if negative repeat after 3 years, if still negative repeat after
           5 years) ;

        4. Thoracic-abdominal-pelvic CT 3 months after surgery and then every sixth 6 month for the
           first 2 years, then annually (unless different clinical indication, i.e. suspicious
           lesions requiring short-term monitoring), in rotation with abdominal US ;

        5. Complete abdominal US, each 6 months for the first 2 years, the annually (unless
           different clinical indication, i.e. suspicious lesions requiring short-term monitoring),
           in succession with Thoracic-abdominal-pelvic CT ;

        6. Adverse events report (CTCAE v.04)

        7. Quality of life (QoL) questionnaires to be filled during first follow up visits and then
           at 6 and 12 months.

    <description>Evaluating impact of therapy on bowel function according to MSKCC questionary (Temple LK and al, Dis Colon Rectum 2005: 48: 1353-1365)
The MSKCC Bowel Function questionnaire is a selfadministered psychometric instrument designed to assess bowel function in patients who undergo sphincterpreserving surgery for rectal cancer. The questionnaire includes 18 items involving three subscales (frequency, dietary and urgency/soilage), four individual items of clinical significance (Q4: incomplete emptying after a bowel movement, Q6: a second bowel movement within 15 min, Q7: knowing difference between gas and bowel movements, Q12: unable to control the passage of flatus) and one total score that is obtained by summing all 18 items.</description>

Total of 29 items; these items form four scales: Lifestyle (10 items), Coping/Behavior (9 items), Depression/Self-Perception (7 items), and Embarrassment. (3 items).
Scales range from 1 to 5, with a 1 indicating a lower functional status of quality of life. Scale scores are the average (mean) response to all items in the scale Scale 1. Lifestyle, ten items: Q2a Q2b Q2c Q2d Q2e Q2g Q2h Q3b Q31 Q3m Scale 2. Coping/Behavior, nine items: Q2f Q2i Q2j Q2k Q2m Q3d Q3h Q3j Q3n Scale 3.

    <description>Evaluating impact of therapy on fecal incontinence according to European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ - CR29 It is composed of 29 items that evaluate symptoms (gastrointestinal, urinary, pain and others) and functional areas (sexual, body image and others) that are associated with colorectal cancer and its treatments. There are separate scales for patients with or without stoma (which can be compared) and separate items to evaluate sexual function for men and women. The questionnaire has a Likert scale of four response categories.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Impact of therapy on quality of life (QoL)</measure>
    <time_frame>24-60 months</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluating impact of therapy on fecal incontinence according to EORTC QLQ-C30 It is composed of both multi-item scales and single-item measures. These include 5 functional scales, 3 symptom scales, a global health status / QoL scale, and 6 single items. Each of the multi-item scales includes a different set of items. All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100.
Thus a high score for a functional scale represents a high / healthy level of functioning, a high score for the global health status / QoL represents a high QoL, but a high score for a symptom scale / item represents a high level of symptomatology / problems.
For scoring these scales:
Estimate the average of the items that contribute to the scale; this is the raw score.
Use a linear transformation to standardise the raw score, so that scores range from 0 to 100; a higher score represents a higher (&quot;better&quot;) level of functioning, or a higher (&quot;worse&quot;) level of symptoms.</description>
