      This phase II trial studies the side effects of bevacizumab and anetumab ravtansine or
      paclitaxel in treating participants with ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal
      cancer that does not respond to treatment. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab and
      anetumab ravtansine, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Drugs
      used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor
      cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from
      spreading. It is not yet known whether giving bevacizumab and anetumab ravtansine or
      paclitaxel may work better in treating participants with ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary
      peritoneal cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety and tolerability of the combination of weekly anetumab ravtansine
      (anetumab) and bi-weekly bevacizumab.

      II. To determine whether the progression free survival (PFS) of the combination weekly
      anetumab and bi-weekly bevacizumab is superior to weekly paclitaxel and bi-weekly
      bevacizumab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the overall response rate (ORR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in
      Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v)1.1.

      II. To evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of weekly anetumab in serum and in
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).

      III. To evaluate anti-drug antibody (ADA) titers (only for patients receiving anetumab).

      IV. To evaluate mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) function, Fc-gamma receptors (FcgammaRs),
      hormone and chemokine mediators.

      V. To correlate the expression of CA125 (immunohistochemistry [IHC] &amp; serum) with mesothelin
      expression in archival tissue and circulating megakaryocyte potentiating factor (MPF).

      VI. To investigate blood-based angiome profiling as a potential biomarker. VII. To
      characterize the molecular profile of archival tumor tissue using the Oncomine panel, and
      explore whether genomic mutations such as BRCA1/2 and homologous repair deficiency status are
      associated with clinical outcome.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess tumor tissue-based VEGF-dependent gene expression signature as a biomarker of
      response.

      OUTLINE:

      PHASE I: Participants receive anetumab ravtansine intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1,
      8, 15, and 22 and bevacizumab over 30-90 minutes IV on days 1 and 15. Courses repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PHASE II: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Participants receive anetumab ravtansine and bevacizumab as in Phase I.

      GROUP II: Participants receive paclitaxel on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 and bevacizumab over 30-90
      minutes IV on days 1 and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 30-37 days and then
      every 8 weeks thereafter.

                  mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure [DBP] &gt; 90 mmHg despite antihypertensive
                  medication)
