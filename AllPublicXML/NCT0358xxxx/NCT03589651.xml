  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, preliminary evidence of clinical
      activity, and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of INCMGA00012 in combination with other agents
      that may improve the therapeutic efficacy of anti-PD-1 monotherapy.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically proven, locally advanced unresectable or metastatic solid tumors for
             whom no approved therapy with demonstrated clinical benefit is available or
             participants who are intolerant to or have declined standard therapy

          -  Measurable or nonmeasurable tumor lesions per RECIST v 1.1.

          -  Willing to provide fresh or archival tumor tissue for correlative studies.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 to 1.

          -  Willingness to avoid pregnancy or fathering children based on protocol-defined
             criteria.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Receipt of anticancer therapy within 21 days of the first administration of study
             treatment, with the exception of localized radiotherapy.

          -  Toxicity of prior therapy that has not recovered to â‰¤ Grade 1 or baseline (with the
             exception of alopecia and anemia not requiring transfusional support).

          -  Laboratory values outside the protocol-defined range at screening.

          -  Active autoimmune disease requiring systemic immunosuppression in excess of
             physiologic maintenance doses of corticosteroids.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs, excipients, or another monoclonal
             antibody which cannot be controlled with standard measures (eg, antihistamines and
             corticosteroids).

          -  Evidence of interstitial lung disease or active, noninfectious pneumonitis.
