  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cow's milk (CM) allergy is the most frequent food allergy in the first years of life, with
      prevalence rates estimated in the range of 2-3%.

      The elimination of CM is the mainstay of treatment, but accidental exposure to CM proteins is
      not uncommon, with a considerable risk of severe allergic reactions.

      Recent evidence suggests that early oral exposure in young children may protect to the
      development of allergy. On the same way, strategies have been developed for the use of oral
      exposure as immunotherapy for the treatment of children with established food allergy even if
      available data on the use of oral immunotherapy in infants with food allergy are very
      limited.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of an oral immunotherapy protocol,
      started in the first year of life, in children with CM allergy.

    <description>In hospital setting: three increasing doses every 30 minutes of 1ml, 5ml and 10ml of cow milk (CM). Oral food challenge (OFC) stopped at 10ml even if no clinical reactions occurred.
At home: every child will take the dose tolerated in hospital, starting the day after the OFC, for 3-4 weeks.Once reached the dose of 40ml of CM without reactions for at least 2 weeks, families increment the dose of 5 ml every week, till the tolerance of 50 ml, then of 10 ml every week, till the tolerance of 100ml and then, of 10 ml every 3 days till the tolerance of 150 ml of milk.</description>
