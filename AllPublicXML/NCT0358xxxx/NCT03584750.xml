  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years there has been a novel approach for the treatment of chronic pain: Floatation
      REST (restricted environmental stimulation therapy). Floating is a therapeutic approach, in
      which patients float in a specialized pool or tank on water that contains high concentrations
      of Epsom salt (Magnesium sulfate). Water is kept at skin temperature (35-36Â°C) and the pool
      or tank is shielded to provide almost complete darkness and silence. This therapeutic
      approach has proven to be effective in alleviating chronic pain.

      Due to the difficulties associated with designing a credible placebo control there have been
      no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with patients blinding so far. Such blinding, however,
      is crucial, to assess the true therapeutic effect of the intervention.

      The investigators will conduct the first patient blinded RCT of Floatation REST for chronic
      pain with a credible placebo control for floating and a no-treatment group.

          -  Previous experience with floating

          -  Acute illnesses that may exacerbate or shadow the chronic pain condition (acute

          -  History of alcohol and drug abuse

          -  Any clinically relevant abnormal findings in the clinical history, which, in the
             opinion of the investigator, may either put the subject at risk because of
             participation in the study or may influence the results of the study or the subject's
             ability to participate in the study.

          -  Any clinical condition that may prevent the subject from floating, such as: open
             injuries, contagious diseases (influenza, GI infections, athlete's foot), GERD,
             epilepsy, claustrophobia, schizophrenia, incontinence or acute skin disorders.

          -  Suspected inability to understand the protocol requirements, instructions and
             study-related restrictions, the nature, scope, and possible consequences of the study.
