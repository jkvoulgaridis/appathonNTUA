      The primary objective of this study is to determine the effects of Mikei® Red Reishi Essence
      EX extract powder on the immune function of prostate cancer patients and patients with
      non-cancerous conditions of the prostate.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of Mikei® Red Reishi Essence EX, a
      natural supplementary dietary product, on the immune function of prostate cancer patients and
      patients with non-cancerous conditions of the prostate. According to limited published
      scientific research and clinical studies, Reishi mushroom extract may support the body's
      immune function. According to cancer immunology research, at early stage of tumor
      development, the immune system can mount defensive actions to eliminate or inhibit tumor
      growth. This study is to examine the specific effect of Mikei® Red Reishi Essence EX on the
      immune function of prostate cancer patients and patients with non-cancerous conditions of the
      prostate.

    <measure>Changes in the immune function of the prostate cancer patients and patients with non-cancerous prostate conditions by taking reishi extract product. The immune function will be analyzed using D2Dx test by measuring the relative IgG level in the blood.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>D2Dx test is a two-step blood test that can measure the amount of IgG antibody adsorbed to a gold nanoparticle. Using a goat anti-human IgG antibody, the relative amount of IgG against autoantibodies is detected.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Correlation between the immune function as expressed in the IgG level in the blood and the disease status (determined by PSA, DRE changes, and Gleason score) of prostate cancer patients.</measure>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male age between 50-85

          2. Diagnosed with prostate cancer or high-grade PIN within the last 24 months through the
             most recent biopsy; or patients who have a total PSA level above 4.0 but have not been
             diagnosed with prostate cancer yet

          3. Has not received any prostate cancer therapy including surgery, chemotherapy, hormone
             therapy, or radiation therapy

          4. Clinical Gleason score of the tumor is ≤6 for patients ≤70 years or ≤7 for &gt;70 years;
             (non-applicable for non-cancer patients with elevated PSA or high-grade PIN)

          5. The clinical stage of the cancer is T1c or below (non-applicable for non-cancer
             patients with elevated PSA or high-grade PIN)

          6. The patients have been recommended for and placed under active surveillance without
             immediate treatment
