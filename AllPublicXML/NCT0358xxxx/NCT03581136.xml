  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stereotactic radiation has been implemented more than 3 decades ago, initially to radiate
      benign and later malignant tumors within the brain. Doses up to 24 Gy in one session have
      been used. Hundreds of thousands of patients have been treated worldwide with very good
      outcomes . Over the last decade, the stereotactic radiation techniques have been implemented
      to treat extra-cranial tumors. The challenges of extra cranial tumors were in part target
      motion during the radiation session, but also accurate re positioning of the patient and of
      the target volume at time of radiation treatment. Specific immobilization devices are now
      available to improve accuracy of target localization. Stereotactic radiation therapy is
      widely available, non-invasive for the patient and less operator dependent as the planning
      process (from target volume to dose calculation) can be done and verified by different
      operators through a quality assessment procedure. Stereotactic radiation is a complex type of
      3D CRT that is a very attractive technique making the 3D CRT more conformal and more accurate
      delivery of the prescription dose within the target volume with a very good sparing of
      surrounding normal tissue. The principles of stereotactic radiation are the following:
      precise image definition of target volume and OARs, very conformal radiation treatment.

    <textblock>
      The GammaPod is a new external beam radiotherapy device dedicated for stereotactic
      radiotherapy of breast cancer (Xcision Medical Systems, LLC, Columbia, Maryland). The design
      goal of the GammaPod has been the ability to deliver ablative doses with sharp gradients
      under stereotactic image guidance. Highly focused radiation is achieved at the isocenter due
      to the cross-firing from 36 radiation arcs generated by rotating 36 individual Cobalt-60
      beams.In order to immobilize the breast during imaging and treatment and in order to get a
      stereotactic localization of the breast target volume, a vacuum-assisted breast
      immobilization cup with built-in stereotactic frame is used. The patient can be imaged on a
      CT or MRI wearing the vacuum-assisted breast cup and then be transferred to the GammaPod for
      treatment. Then, the planner is required to delineate the gross tumor volume (GTV) and its
      subclinical extensions. Multiple targets within a breast are allowed.Different doses can be
      prescribed to different targets.One benefit of using the GammaPod over the cyberknife for
      breast SBRT, is elimination of the need for internal gold fiducial markers, which are
      required for the cyberknife treatment.

      Using a stereotactic technique for APBI allows smaller margins in comparison to a 3DCRT
      technique. The total expansions on the RAPID trial (3DCRT APBI) were 1.0 cm CTV expansion on
      the lumpectomy cavity and an additional 1.0 cm for PTV, for a total expansion of 2.0 cm. As a
      3DCRT technique was used on the RAPID trial limited number of radiation beams were employed,
      no Intensity Modulated Radiation Techniques allowed, and the margins used to create a PTV
      were relatively large (total margin 2 cm).

      As the GammaPod will allow us to minimize the volume of normal breast being irradiated, and
      decrease the PTV volume we hypothesize that a stereotactic technique with the GammaPod will
      allow us to improve on the 3 year global cosmesis rates (physician and patient) reported in
      the RAPID trial (3DCRT) by 40% despite 5 daily fractions of SBRT (in contrast to 38.5Gy/10
      fractions 3DCRT BID on the RAPID trial) The GammaPod was FDA approved 12-2017.

The US version of the EQ-5D will be used, to enable mapping of general HR-QOL scores from EQ-5D scores into health state utility scores (ranging from 0 to 100) for the US population.Analyses will be performed for all subjects having received at least one fraction of radiation.The study will use the CTCAE version 4.0 for reporting of acute and late adverse events related to breast will be reported by the physician through exam/assessment during research visit, encompassing events since last research visit. Research will collect and log breast related events for up to 5 years.</description>
