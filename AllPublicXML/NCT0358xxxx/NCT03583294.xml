    <textblock>
      The French L.E.A. (Leucémie Enfant et Adolescent) program was implemented to prospectively
      evaluate the long-term health status, quality of life and socio-economic status of childhood
      acute leukemia (CAL) survivors enrolled in French treatment programs from 1980 to present, in
      15 cancer centers. Eligible patients for the study are adult women (≥18 years) from L.E.A.
      cohort. Project has been approved by the Scientific Advisory Board and the Steering Committee
      of LEA Cohort. MRI uterus anatomy, follicular ovarian reserve and reproductive function will
      be assess in 212 adult women who received a hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)
      for CAL. The investigator's objective is to correlate uterus and ovarian function to the
      conditioning regimen received before HSCT (total body irradiation (TBI) or busulfan - based
      conditioning) and the pubertal status at the HSCT (before or after puberty).Inclusion period
      is planned for 2 years. Four patient groups will be compared:

        -  Group 1: HSCT before nine years and after conditioning regimen with TBI (12 Gy)

        -  Group 2: HSCT before nine years and after a busulfan-based conditioning regimen

        -  Group 3: HSCT after nine years and after conditioning regimen with TBI (12 Gy)

        -  Group 4: HSCT after nine years and after a busulfan-based conditioning regimen

      Information will be collected during specific medical visit in one of the investigatory
      centers. Pelvic MRI and hormonal blood tests will be performed and a medical consultation
      with a physician specialized in reproductive medicine and oncofertility will be proposed to
      eligible patients. Data assessed for each women are the following:

        -  Disease type, age and pubertal status at HSCT, age at evaluation, therapy lines before
           and after HSCT, conditioning regimen, relapse after HSCT if applicable. Cumulative doses
           of cyclophosphamide, melphalan, busulfan and radiation will be collected from the LEA
           database.

        -  Gynecological characteristics: spontaneous or induced puberty, spontaneous menstrual
           cycles or Hormone Substitutive treatment (HRT) or amenorrhea without HRT; gestity parity
           (if pregnancy: spontaneous, after Assisted Reproductive Technologies?), history of
           ovarian cryopreservation, was information given (and at what age?) about risk of
           premature ovarian failure and about the gyneco-obstetrical impact of conditioning
           regimen for HSCT?

        -  Ovarian follicular reserve: FSH, LH, estradiol, Anti-Müllerian Hormon (AMH) at the day
           2-3 of the cycle or whenever if amenorrhea. Ovarian volume and antral Follicle Count
           will be performed with pelvic sonography.

        -  Uterine anatomy by MRI, at the end of follicular phase or after estrogen therapy, in
           order to measure proliferative endometrium. Anatomical parameters will be compare to
           normal measurements of uterus: uterine volume, myometrial, endometrial and junctionnal
           zone thickness, cervical length, apparent diffusion coefficient values.

        -  Reproductive function: spontaneous pregnancy rate or after ART (IVF, oocyte donation),
           term and mode of delivery, health of the child.
