  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to measure the effect of host human genetics on the resulting
      immunological responses and long-term protection following rotavirus immunization of a study
      population of infants in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.

      The secondary objectives are to assess the temporal immunological responses following
      rotavirus vaccination, and to investigate the role of maternally derived antibodies, and
      other factors that could potentially affect immunological responses following rotavirus
      vaccination. Also to assess infecting rotavirus genotypes in the vaccine failure cases.

      This study will be an open single arm, single centre, interventional study conducted in Ho
      Chi Minh City, Vietnam. A sample size of 1,000 infants will be recruited to the study between
      8 to 9 weeks (which is around 2 months) of age. These infants will receive two doses of the
      rotavirus vaccine, Rotarix with an interval of 28-37 days (or 4-5 weeks). The parents will be
      requested to bring the infants 2-3 days following each Rotarix vaccination to receive the
      standard EPI vaccinations. The infants will then be under passive and active surveillance for
      rotavirus-associated diarrhoea until 18 months of age. Blood samplings during pre and post
      vaccination and at 6, 12 and 18 month old visits will be collected.

    <description>The Rotarix vaccine package consist of 1.5 ml of oral suspension in a pre-filled oral applicator (type I glass) with a plunger stopper (rubber butyl) and a protective tip cap (rubber butyl) in pack sizes of 1.
The vaccination course consists of two doses. The first dose may be administered from the age of 6 weeks. There should be an interval of at least 4 weeks between doses. The vaccination course should preferably be given before 16 weeks of age, but must be completed by the age of 24 weeks. Rotarix is for oral use only and should under no circumstancies be injected.
All participating infants will receive two doses of Rotarix vaccine following the standard Rotarix immunization protocol.</description>

    <description>In this study, the 1st dose of Rotarix vaccine will be administered when infants are at ages between weeks 8-9 and the 2nd dose is 28-37 days after the 1st dose, which means that there is an interval of 28-37 days or 4-5 weeks between doses. A reminding call will be set at about 4 weeks after the 1st dose to remind parents to bring their children back to Hung Vuong Hospital for the 2nd dose of Rotarix to ensure the completion of the 2nd dose of Rotarix vaccine.</description>
