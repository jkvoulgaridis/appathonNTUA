  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prompt treatment of pain due to minor trauma is often an unmet need in both Emergency
      Room Department and Ambulance Rescue. Most of the available drugs are intravenously
      administered and such route of administration may account for delay in the pain relief onset.

      Methoxyflurane is an halogenated anesthetic, self-administered by the patient at
      sub-anesthetic dose through an easy to handle inhaler (Penthrox®). The efficacy and safety of
      Penthrox® in the treatment of acute traumatic pain will be investigated in an out-of-hospital
      and in hospital emergency medical care setting.

    <intervention_model_description>Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to Penthrox (test group) or standard analgesic treatment (comparison group). As per local clinical practice, the standard analgesic will vary according to pain intensity score measured by Numerical Rating Scale (NRS): morphine, in case of score ≥ 7 or paracetamol/ketoprofen in case of score 4-6. Penthrox treatment will be performed by inhalatory route and will last maximum 25 minutes. the standard of care will be administered by an intravenous drip lasting at maximum 10 minutes.</intervention_model_description>
