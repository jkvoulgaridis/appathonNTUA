      This study evaluates if hand therapy have an impact on the patients' preformance of and
      satisfaction with everyday activities or not following collagenase injection treatment for
      Dupuytren's contracture. Differences on this between patients with contracted proximal
      interphalangeal joint(s) and patients with affected metacarpophalangeal joint(s) only, will
      also be investigated. Two equal sized groups will either receive hand therapy or no treatment
      following the injection and extension procedure.

    <textblock>
      Today it varies if patients with collagenase treated Dupuytren's contracture (DC) are
      referred to hand therapy or not. No studies are found looking at the effect of therapy
      following collagenase treatment compared to no therapy.

      The main purpose of the study is to find if hand therapy improves patients' performance of
      and satisfaction with everyday activities or not, one year after collagenase treatment for
      DC. Differences on this between patients with contracted proximal interphalangeal joint(s)
      (PIPJ) and patients with affected metacarpophalangeal joint(s) (MCPJ) only, will also be
      investigated.

      A Norwegian randomised controlled trial will be conducted with two parallel intervention
      groups in a pre-test - post-test design. Hand therapy includes oedema control, scar
      management, night-time splinting, movement exercises and use of everyday activities as
      therapy. Additional individualised therapy will be provided if needed. Test times are right
      before, straight after, six weeks, four months and one year after collagenase treatment.
      Sample size needed is 160 participants. Appropriate methods of statistical analysis will be
      used.

      Discussion Research on DC is challenging as the clinical picture is heterogeneous, no cure
      exists and no agreement on who should receive collagenase treatment. Hand therapy in the
      study will be individualised and not equal for every patient.

    <description>URAM, the Norwegian translation will be used. The scale evaluates the patients ability to perform 9 specific daily activities, which the patient are asked to score. The values are 6 ranges of difficulty: from no difficulties with doing the activity (score 0) to impossible to do (score 5). The possible total score ranges from 0 to 45, where 45 is the worse case.</description>
