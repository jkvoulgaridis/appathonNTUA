  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to explore possible predicting factors associated with physical
      activity (PA) level change in a 6-month period of physical activity on prescription (PAP)
      treatment. This is done in order to highlight potential predictors important for increased
      PA-level and to identify which primary care patients who may benefit from the
      PAP-intervention.

      Four hundred forty four patients are included in the study, 27-85 years, physically inactive,
      having at least one component of the metabolic syndrome (MetS) present and receiving
      PAP-treatment. Possible predicting factors of PA change at baseline and PA-level at 6-month
      follow-up are analyzed.

      Aim:

      To explore possible predicting factors associated with PA-level change in a 6-month period of
      PAP-treatment. This is done in order to highlight potential predictors important for
      increased PA-level and to identify which primary care patients who may benefit from the
      PAP-intervention.

      Methods:

      Study design:

      This is a longitudinal prospective observational cohort study with a 6-month follow-up of
      PAP-treatment. The treatment is carried out as part of a daily clinical primary care
      practice.

      Study population:

      The 444 patients included in the study, are selected from 15 primary health care centres in
      Gothenburg, Sweden, and are 27-85 years, physically inactive, having at least one component
      of the MetS present and receiving PAP-treatment. The patients have to understand the Swedish
      language to fill in the questionnaires.

      Intervention:

      The PAP-treatment is offered by authorized personnel, educated in PA-effects and
      PAP-intervention and consists of an individual-based dialogue with the patient, an
      individually tailored recommendation of PA including a written prescription, and customized,
      structured support during 6 months. The patients health status, previous respectively current
      PA level, preferences for different physical activities, motivation, self-efficacy and
      readiness to change PA behavior are evaluated. An agreed individually dosed PA is written
      down and the support during the 6-month intervention is individually structured either by
      revisits or by telephone contacts.

      Measurements:

      The following measurements are conducted at baseline and the 6-month follow-up: PA-level,
      self-efficacy expectations, outcome expectations, enjoyment, social support, readiness to
      change PA, body mass index (BMI), and health related quality of life. Age, sex, social
      situation, economy, education, and smoking is also measured.

      Statistical analysis:

      A per-protocol analysis is used. In the predictor analysis, Spearman rank correlation and a
      univariate regression analysis is used, respectively, to examine the association between
      possible predicting factors at baseline and PA level at 6-month follow-up. Significant
      predictors from the regression analysis are dichotomized into positive and negative values,
      respectively, and a Chi-square test for independence is used in analysing the predictors at
      baseline to increased PA level at 6-month follow-up. Statistical significance is set at p
      ≤0.05.

      Hypothesis:

      It is possible finding predicting factors among the patient´s answers according to
      self-reported questionnaires for the purpose of identifying responders/non-responders to
      increased physical activity level at 6 month follow-up of PAP-treatment.

      Clinical implication:

      Highlighting possible predicting factors to increased PA in an early stage of
      PAP-intervention, offers the opportunity to support the patient in the behavioural change
      process and to individualize the PAP-treatment, with the aim to increase physical activity
      level.

    <description>Self-assessment of PA-level according to American college of sports medicine (ACSM) and American heart association (AHA) public health recommendation 2007. The patient responds to two PA questions, where 30 minutes of moderate-intensity PA per day results in 1 point and 20 minutes of more vigorous-intensity PA per day results in 1.7 point during each specific day of the week. A value of &lt;5 points indicates an inadequate PA level.</description>

    <measure>Self-efficacy expectations - Self-Efficacy for Exercise Scale (SEE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Association between baseline value of secondary outcome and 6-month value of primary outcome.</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire focusing on the ability to exercise for 20 minutes, three times per week in the face of barriers to exercise. The questionnaire is culturally adopted, translated into Swedish, and includes nine items (e.g. &quot;The weather was bothering you&quot;, &quot;You had to exercise alone&quot;, &quot;You felt depressed&quot;), rated on an ordinal 10 point scale ranging from 1 (Not confident) to 10 (Very confident). The item scores are summarized and divided by the number of responses indicating the strength of self-efficacy expectations. The SEE has been tested for older adults and older women post-hip fracture displaying high internal consistency, acceptable reliability measured with squared multiple correlation coefficients and sufficient to strong evidence for construct- and criterion validity.</description>

    <measure>Outcome expectations - Outcome Expectations for Exercise-2 Scale (OEE-2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Association between baseline value of secondary outcome and 6-month value of primary outcome.</time_frame>
    <description>A 13-item measure with 9 positive worded items (e.g. &quot;Helps me feel less tired&quot;) and 4 negatively worded items (e.g. &quot;Is something I avoid because it causes me to be short of breath&quot;) divided into two subscales: positive OEE and negative OEE. The items are rated on a 5 point Likert scale ranging from 1 (Strongly agree) to 5 (Strongly disagree). The negative OEE items are reversed scored and the numerical ratings for each response are summarized and divided by the number of items. The OEE-2 questionnaire was revised in year 2005 to include 4 items concerning negative expectations with exercise based on qualitative findings and has shown some evidence for convergent validity, internal consistency and person-, item reliability.</description>

    <measure>Enjoyment - Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale (PACES)</measure>
    <time_frame>Association between baseline value of secondary outcome and 6-month value of primary outcome.</time_frame>
    <description>Consists of 16 items whereof 9 positively worded (e.g.&quot; I think it´s fun&quot;, &quot;It gives me energy&quot;, &quot;It is very pleasant&quot;) and 7 negatively worded (e.g. &quot;I feel bored&quot;, &quot;I don´t like it&quot;, &quot;It´s frustrating for me&quot;). Each item is rated on a 5 point Likert scale from 1 (Does not apply at all) to 5 (Truly applies), the negatively worded items are reversed scored and the responses are added to a score ranging from 16 to 80. The PACES has been tested for 18-24 year old students and adults with functional limitations showing acceptable test-retest reliability, internal consistency and criterion validity correlated to physical function.</description>

    <measure>Social support - Social support for exercise scale (SSES)</measure>
    <time_frame>Association between baseline value of secondary outcome and 6-month value of primary outcome.</time_frame>
    <description>Including 13 items, divided in a family and friends part and measured on a 5 point Likert scale. Eleven items are positively worded (participation and involvement) and two items negatively (rewards and punishments) describing social interactions possibly linked to exercise behaviour during the previous three months. Responses were ranged from 1 (none) to 5 (very often) and &quot;not applicable&quot; was given a score of 1. The item scores are summarized in three subgroups: Family support - positive, Friend support - positive and Family support - negative. The Friend support - negative subgroup scores were excluded by Sallis et al. because it did not emerge in the factor analysis. The SSES has shown acceptable test-retest reliability, high internal consistency and significant criterion validity correlated with a vigorous exercise measure.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The readiness to change PA level</measure>
    <time_frame>Association between baseline value of secondary outcome and 6-month value of primary outcome.</time_frame>
    <description>Measured at baseline including three questions estimated on a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS): How prepared are you? How important is it for you? How confident are you to succeed (self-efficacy)? The VAS line is anchored in each ends with words describing the minimal respectively maximal extremes of the dimension being measured. The questions derives from MI and behaviour change counselling according to Rollnick et al where a higher value on the VAS indicates increased readiness to change. VAS has been used in the social and behavior sciences both as a research and clinical tool and is considered to have acceptable reliability and validity.</description>
