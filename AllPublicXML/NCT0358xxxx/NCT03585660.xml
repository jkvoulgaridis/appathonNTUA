      The purpose of the proposed research is to test and validate an artificial intelligence-based
      Risk Map decision-support system (DSS) for prostate cancer Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
      interpretation and identification of clinically significant tumor site(s).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with known or suspected prostate cancer who have been referred to the
             Department of Radiology at the University of Chicago Medical Center for a diagnostic
             MRI exam of the prostate, to be followed by an MRI-guided fusion biopsy of the
             prostate.

          -  Written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients incapable of giving informed written consent;

          -  Patients who cannot adhere to the experimental protocols for any reason, or have an
             inability to communicate with the researcher;

          -  Patients with psychiatric disorders that affect their ability to consent for
             themselves will be excluded and not the entire population of patients with psychiatric
             disorders.

          -  Prisoners;
