      22), plus 40 mg dexamethasone (20 mg IV the day of daratumumab and selinexor and 20 mg oral
      administration the day after daratumumab and selinexor) both weekly as continuous therapy.

      Bortezomib will be given via subcutaneous at dose of 1.3 mg/m2 once weekly on days 1, 8, 15

          -  Patient has given voluntary written informed consent before performance of any
             study-related procedure not part of normal medical care, with the understanding that

             disease is performed by serum FLC, the involved FLC should be ≥ 10 mg/dL, with an
             abnormal serum FLC ratio.

          -  Patients must have an ECOG performance status of 0, 1 or 2.

          -  Patients must have received ≥ 3 prior lines of therapy and be refractory to the last
             line of therapy, or be double refractory to proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory

          -  Women of childbearing potential must be practicing a highly effective method of birth
             control consistent with local regulations regarding the use of birth control methods

             or implanted hormonal methods of contraception; placement of an intrauterine device or
             intrauterine system; barrier methods: condom with spermicidal
