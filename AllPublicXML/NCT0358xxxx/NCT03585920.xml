  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study aims to investigate the effect of fat level and fat type of a snack on
      self-reported satiety and associated biomarkers. The relevant individual differences will
      also be investigated.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aims are: (1) To determine whether reducing fat in a snack leads to rebound hunger and
      higher food intake at the subsequent meal, (2)To determine whether a low fat snack product
      matched for expected satiety leads to differences in post-ingestive satiety (i.e. mouth-gut
      discordance), (2) To determine whether individual differences in sensory perception influence
      expected or post-ingestive satiety.

      Stage 1, Characterising Volunteers:

      Fat is perceived through three sensory modalities; mouthfeel, taste and odour. Humans vary in
      their perception of fat across all sensory modalities. Volunteers will be characterised on
      their ability to taste fatty acids and perceive mouthfeel.

      Stage 2, Establish Sensory Tolerance in Expected Satiety of a fat reduced snack model:

      Reduced fat products are typically reformulated to match the perceived texture and mouthfeel
      of the original product. This stage aims to quantify sensory tolerance to fat reduction.

      Stage 3, Establish Mouth Gut Discordance of a fat reduced snack model:

      Using a standard preload study design, and the same fat-emulsion snack model from stage 2,
      the investigators will contrast effects of 3 test samples in a balanced cross-over design.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a 3 way crossover design using a pre-load study protocol that is standard for behavioural appetite studies. The study will be conducted single-blind, as it is not feasible to blind the researcher to the pre-load food products. Each participant will attend 3 visits, the pre-load study foods will be presented to them with random blinding codes.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Individual differences in sensory perception (fatty acid sensitivity)</measure>
    <time_frame>Sensory perception measures taken once in stage 1 (in the first visit of the study)</time_frame>
    <description>Volunteers will have been characterised on their ability to taste the emulsions samples with the added fatty acid at the level of 0.016% and 0.11% (weight by weight) in Stage 1 (in the first visit). A discrimination forced choice test will be used, where the participant is asked to state the odd sample out of a set. If they can detect fatty acid in the samples correctly three times, they will be classified as hyper-sensitivity, otherwise they will be classified as hypo-sensitivity.</description>

    <time_frame>Sensory perception measures taken once in stage 1 (in the first visit).</time_frame>
    <description>A mouthfeel discrimination test will be carried out using savoury biscuits which are constant in overall fat content but vary in mouthfeel characteristics. Four samples will be prepared varying in mouthfeel and participants will be asked to taste the samples and then rate them for the mouthfeel attributes of Crunchiness, Hardness, Greasiness, on visual analogue structured line scale (from 0 (not at all) to 100 (extremely)).</description>

    <measure>Individual differences in sensory perception (Tactile sensitivity )</measure>
    <time_frame>Sensory perception measures taken once in stage 1 (in the first visit).</time_frame>
    <description>Von Frey filaments will be used to evaluate tactile sensitivity on the tongue, and to relate this to taste sensitivity. Participants will be asked to wear a blindfold, the middle of their tongue is then either stimulated or not stimulated with two Von Frey filaments of 0.008g and 0.02g sizes. The participant responds to say whether they have felt the stimulation and how sure they are (signal sure, signal not sure, no signal sure, no signal not sure). This is repeated 10 times in rapid succession. Responses are analysed using an R-index (%) value which is standard for a signal-noise detection test.</description>

    <time_frame>Sensory perception measures taken once in stage 1 (in the first visit).</time_frame>
    <description>A simple short questionnaire will be used, which has been validated in the USA, to categorise people as &quot;Crunchers&quot;, &quot;Chewers&quot;, &quot;Suckers&quot; and &quot;Smooshers&quot;. Whereas &quot;Chewers&quot; tend to chew foods to a fine particle size before swallowing, &quot;Crunchers&quot; rapidly crunch and swallow. This questionnaire has been validated in the United States.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Individual differences in sensory perception (Fungiform papillae (FP) density)</measure>
    <time_frame>Sensory perception measures taken once in stage 1 (in the first visit).</time_frame>
    <description>In order to determine fungiform papillae density on the tongue, a digital camera will be used to record an image of the number of fungiform papillae in two one cm2 areas of the tongue. A small area of the participant's tongue will be temporarily dyed blue using food colour applied by a cotton wool bud. The tongue will then be blotted dry to remove excess moisture prior to recording a digital image. The blue colour will fade after approximately 1 hour and the extent of the colouration is similar to eating certain coloured sweets (e.g. blue Smarties).The number of the fungiform papillae (FP) density will be counted afterwards and quantified as papillae / cm square.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Individual differences in expected satiety</measure>
    <time_frame>Expected satiety measures taken once in stage 2 (in the second visit).</time_frame>
    <description>7 snack samples will be presented to subjects in a monadic sequential manner (i.e. one at a time) in a balanced order. After tasting each sample, participants will rate expected satiety ( &quot;If you were to consume a full portion of this product, how full do you think you would feel?&quot;and &quot;How long do you think it would be before you felt hungry again?&quot;). Visual analogue unstructured line scales (from 0 (not at all) to 100 (extremely)) will be used.</description>
