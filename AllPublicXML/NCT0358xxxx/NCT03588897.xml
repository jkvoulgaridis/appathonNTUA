    <textblock>
      The study compares nutritional status of two groups elderly patient aged 65 and more. One
      group of the patients received nutritional support (Nutridrink Multi Fibre) for 14 days.
      Nutritional status of the patients were compared 2 months after the start of the
      intervention.

      The aim of the study was to compare nutritional status of two groups of elderly patients (&gt;
      65 years old). Total of 120 patients were randomly assigned into two groups. One group
      received normal diet whereas the second group received 300 kcal nutritional support
      (Nutridrink Multi Fibre 2x100 ml) between meals for 14 days. Two months after start of the
      intervention following examinations were performed:

        -  functional status of the patient (Barthel's scale, MMSE scale)

        -  nutritional status based on: weight, height, BMI; Mini Nutritional Assessment, plasma
           concentration of prealbumin, albumin, transferrin, total lymphocyte count.

      The clinical status of the patient was evaluated based on clinical data on different organ
      infections. In addition costs of supplementary nutrition were taken into consideration.
