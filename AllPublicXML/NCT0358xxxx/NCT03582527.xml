  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The expression level of PD-L1 on tumor cells is a pivotal point which might have some
      influence on prognosis, especially for those who might use PD-1 or PD-L1 antibody for
      treatment. The aim of this study is to detect the expression of PD-1 on advaced osteosarcoma
      patient who might use these antibodies for treatment. All those specimen should be taken by
      pathologist and confirmed with high tumor cellularity.
