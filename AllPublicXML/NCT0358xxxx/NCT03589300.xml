      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate clinical performance for the commercially
      available Persona TM Tibia used in primary cementless tibia total knee arthroplasty.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, non-randomized clinical study designed to facilitate the
      collection and evaluation of radiographic parameters, pain and function, survival of the
      device,and adverse event data.

      The study will require each site to obtain IRB approval prior to study enrollment. All
      potential study subjects will be required to participate in the Informed Consent Process.

      All study subjects will undergo preoperative clinical evaluations prior to their cementless
      tibia total knee arthroplasty. An immediate postoperative radiograph will be required.
      Postoperative clinical follow-up and radiographic evaluations will be conducted at 6 weeks, 6
      months, 1 year, and 2 years.

      The primary endpoint of this study is to evaluate the clinical performance of the implant at
      2 years postoperatively using radiographic parameters. Radiographs will be assessed for the
      absence of progressive tibial radiolucencies, as defined in the radiographic protocol.

      The secondary endpoints of this study will evaluate the clinical performance of the implant
      at 2 years postoperatively, based upon:

        -  No revisions for any reason

        -  Oxford Knee Score &gt;38

    <description>Progressive Tibial Radiolucency will be derived in accordance with the following definitions:
Absent: No evidence of an increase in either radiolucency extent (number of zones involved) or measured width within a zone.
Present: Presence of either:
An increase in the number of zones with a measured Tibial Radiolucency, OR
An increase in the measured Tibial Radiolucency width within a zone of &gt;0.5 mm.</description>

    <description>The Oxford Knee Score is a patient completed 12 question metric to rate a patient's knee pain and function using an ordinal 0 - 4 point scale. The total score is obtained by calculating the sum of the 12 items. The minimum score is 0 and the maximum score is 48 points.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient is at least 18 years of age.

          2. Patient qualifies for a primary cementless tibia total knee arthroplasty based on
             physical exam and medical history, including diagnosis of severe knee pain and
             disability due to at least one of the following:

               1. Rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, traumatic arthritis, polyarthritis.

               2. Collagen disorders and/or avascular necrosis of the femoral condyle.

               3. Post-traumatic loss of joint configuration, particularly when there is
                  patellofemoral erosion, dysfunction or prior patellectomy.

               4. Moderate valgus, varus, or flexion deformities.

               5. The salvage of previously failed surgical attempts that did not include partial
