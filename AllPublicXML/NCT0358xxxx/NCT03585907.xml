  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess if/how dietary interventions (i.e., the Modified Atkins Diet (MAD)
      and/or the Mediterranean-Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Intervention for
      Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND)) might prevent, delay onset, alleviate symptoms, or otherwise
      alter the course of subjective cognitive decline (SCD) likely due to Alzheimer's disease
      (AD).

      We hypothesize that participants will tolerate both diets well and that the MAD will result
      in more favorable changes in cognition and other functioning.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Specific aims are to 1) to establish the feasibility of implementing the MAD in older adults
      with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) likely due to AD, 2) to examine whether changes in
      participants' cognition, mood, or other functioning are more favorable in patients using the
      MAD than in patients using the MIND diet, 3) to assess the role of Apolipoprotein E (ApoE)
      epsilon 4 genotype in response to the MAD in individuals with SCD. We hypothesize that 1)
      participants will be able to adhere to and tolerate the MAD and the MIND, determined by
      review of patients' food records and urine ketone production, 2) participants who adhere to
      the MAD will demonstrate a more favorable change on neuropsychological tests than
      participants on the MIND diet, and 4) the neuropsychological effects of the MAD will be
      greatest in those participants without a ε4 allele of the ApoE gene.

    <measure>Change in Memory Functioning Questionnaire (MFQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline/week-0, week-6, completion/week-12</time_frame>
    <description>This is a self-report assessment of cognitive decline. It is rated on a 1-7 scale, with 1 indicating &quot;major problems&quot; and 7 indicating &quot;no problems.&quot; It includes 8 sections, each including 1-18 sub-questions. It will be assessed by comparing changes in scores between groups and across time (12 weeks).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Loewenstein-Acevedo Scales of Semantic Interference and Learning (LASSI-L)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline/week-0, week-6, completion/week-12</time_frame>
    <description>This is an assessment of verbal learning and memory for lists of 15 words. More words learned and remembered indicate better learning and memory. It will be assessed by comparing changes in scores between groups and across time (12 weeks).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Para-Rodriguez Short-term Visual Memory Binding Test (SVMBT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline/week-0, week-6, completion/week-12</time_frame>
    <description>This is an assessment of visual recognition memory for shapes and colors. More accurate recognition indicates better recognition memory. It will be assessed by comparing changes in scores between groups and across time (12 weeks).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Ketone levels</measure>
    <time_frame>Checked by the participant daily, for 12 weeks/3 months (i.e., from the start day of the diet until the end of the 12 weeks) and checked by the study staff at each study visit (i.e., baseline/week-0, week-3, week-6, and completion/week-12)</time_frame>
    <description>This is detected in urine and measured in mg/dL, with higher levels indicating greater production of ketones and greater adherence to the MAD diet. Adherence will be assessed by percent of participants in the MAD group in at least moderate ketosis (&gt;40 mg/dl) at 3 or more follow-up visits.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>MIND Diet Score</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks/3 months (i.e., from the start day of the diet until the end of the 12 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>This is assessed by dietitian review of participants daily food logs. Scores range from 0 (not at all adherent) to 15 (perfectly adherent). Any score greater than 9 is considered adherent. It will be assessed by percent of participants in the MIND group with scores of at least 9 at 3 or more follow-up visits.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>ApoE epsilon 4 status</measure>
    <time_frame>Tested via venipuncture or buccal swab at baseline/week-0</time_frame>
    <description>This is a genetic marker of Alzheimer's disease risk. It will be coded as positive (one or more epsilon 4 alleles) or negative (no epsilon 4 alleles). It will be evaluated by stratifying the sample by the presence of at least one ε4 allele and conditioning the efficacy analyses by this variable.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Trail Making Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week-6, week-12</time_frame>
    <description>This is a timed test of processing speed and executive functioning. Faster time to completion and fewer errors indicate better processing speed and executive functioning. It will be assessed by comparing changes in scores between groups and across time (12 weeks).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Prospective Memory Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week-6, week-12</time_frame>
    <description>This is a test of remembering to ask that a borrowed item be returned. The possible scores range from 0 (no cues needed to remember to ask) to 4 (4 cues needed to remember to ask). More cues required indicates worse prospective memory. It will be assessed by comparing changes in scores between groups and across time (12 weeks).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Geriatric Anxiety Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week-6, week-12</time_frame>
    <description>This is a self-report measure of symptoms of anxiety in older persons. It is rated on a 0 (not at all) to 3 (all of the time) scale. Scores range from 0-90, with higher scores indicating more anxiety. It will be assessed by comparing changes in scores between groups and across time (12 weeks).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Geriatric Depression Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week-6, week-12</time_frame>
    <description>This is a self-report measure of symptoms of depression in older persons. Items are rated as yes/no. Scores range from 0-30, with higher scores indicating more depression. It will be assessed by comparing changes in scores between groups and across time (12 weeks).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Cognitive decline concern questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week-6, week-12</time_frame>
    <description>This is a one question questionnaire that asks how concerned/worried a person is about their subjective cognitive decline on a 1 (majorly worried) to 7 (not at all worried) scale, with higher scores indicating a greater degree of concern/worry. It will be assessed by comparing changes in scores between groups and across time (12 weeks).</description>
