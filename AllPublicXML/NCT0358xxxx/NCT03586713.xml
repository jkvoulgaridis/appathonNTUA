  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted to assess diagnostic predictive values of a light induced
      fluorescence intraoral camera versus those of the visual-tactile assessment method according
      to modified ICDAS-II criteria in clinical

      volunteers patients will be assigned in this study. Each patient should have at least one
      posterior tooth with pits and fissure discoloration and maximum 4 teeth. The teeth will be
      evaluated by two diagnostic methods (D), where D1 represents visual-tactile assessment method
      (ICDAS-II) and D2 represents light induced fluorescence intraoral camera.Three operators, the
      researcher and the 2 supervisors, from the Conservative Dentistry Department, Faculty of
      Dentistry, Cairo University, will be the examiners in this study. Each examiner will record
      the dental findings using both the visual- tactile assessment method and the
      fluorescent-aided identification method. The visual-tactile assessment method includes the
      use of mirror, probe under good illumination condition, while the fluorescent-aided
      identification method will be performed by light induced fluorescence intraoral camera.

    <intervention_model_description>Screening of patients that come to the conservative dentistry department seeking dental care will continue until the target population is achieved. The patients' teeth will be subjected to visual examination and diagnosis using dental charts. Once the patients that are potentially eligible for this study are identified, they will be contacted by the research investigator who will explain the study and ascertains the patient's interest. If interested, more detailed evaluations and preparations are made</intervention_model_description>

    <description>According to the international caries detection and assessment system (ICDAS-II). The visual examination was performed using the ICDAS-II criteria, which provides a standardized method of lesion detection. The ICDAS-II detection codes for coronal categories the score will be 0 =surface not restored or sealant then according to caries categories range from 0 to 6 depending on the severity of the lesion with the corresponding clinical views.</description>

    <description>The light induced fluorescence intraoral camera works with a visible blue light frequency (wavelength 450 nm) for the illumination of the dental surface and produces an overlapping image of the green fluorescence image on the image of the white light. The green fluorescence image is considered an indicator of healthy dental tissues. The colour of the fluorescence signal is green when the dentin is healthy. The healthy enamel is blue due to the scattered green light of the dentin, despite the lack of a fluorescence signal. On the other hand, caries can be easily detected by dark red fluorescence.</description>
