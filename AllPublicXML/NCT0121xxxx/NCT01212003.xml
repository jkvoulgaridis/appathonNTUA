      Background:

      - Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease that affects numerous people worldwide. However,
      most clinical studies of individuals with TB take place at international sites because there
      are many fewer cases of TB in the United States than elsewhere in the world. To provide
      better training for infectious disease staff members at the National Institutes of Health
      Clinical Center in Washington, D.C., researchers are interested in actively recruiting
      individuals with TB for research and treatment studies.

      Objectives:

        -  To provide staff at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center with increased
           experience in hands-on treatment of individuals with tuberculosis, including
           drug-sensitive or drug-resistant forms of the disease.

        -  To collect blood and other samples to study the natural history of tuberculosis.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals 2 years of age and older who have either active or latent tuberculosis.

      Design:

        -  Latent TB patients: Participants will have a single study visit with a physical
           examination and medical history, and will provide blood samples for testing.

        -  Active TB patients: Participants will have an initial visit with a physical examination
           and medical history, and will provide blood samples for testing. Participants will also
           provide sputum samples if required, and may have an optional skin punch biopsy to
           collect a sample of skin tissue for study.

        -  Treatment for active TB will be provided as part of this protocol.

        -  Active TB participants will return for study visits every 2 months while receiving
           treatment, and will return every 6 months for 1 year after the end of treatment.
           Participants may be asked to return more often if researchers determine that additional
           care is needed to treat the infection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a slow-growing bacterium that establishes latent infection in
      millions of persons worldwide, but only leads to disease in 10% or less of these individuals.
      It typically causes pneumonia, however dissemination to almost any other organ is possible.
      Drug resistance of the organism, co-infection with HIV, and paradoxical reactions upon
      treatment are all factors that may complicate treatment.

      Host defense against mycobacterial infections is important. Specific defects within the
      innate immune system lead to Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial infections. Human
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected individuals and persons treated with anti-tumor
      necrosis factor antibodies are highly susceptible to tuberculosis infection. Genetic
      influence on susceptibility to TB disease is complex and does not seem to be confined to a
      single gene or pathway.

      Advancement in molecular techniques has expanded our understanding of the pathogenesis and
      epidemiology of M. tuberculosis. Identification of gene mutations that confer antibiotic
      resistance are being exploited as alternatives to conventional drug susceptibility testing.

      The natural history of all forms of TB disease (including co-infection with HIV and other
      infections) will be followed, and M. tuberculosis isolates and blood from 100 infected
      patients will be obtained in order to study organism virulence and host immune function and
      genetic/epigenetic factors. While it is recognized that the number of tuberculosis cases that
      occur in the Washington, DC area and nationally is low, it is imperative that a mechanism is
      in place to evaluate and treat these patients at the NIH Clinical Center. This protocol will
      allow NIH infectious diseases trainees to manage challenging cases of tuberculosis.

        Patients will be referred by their physicians for study participation. In many cases,
        participants will be referred by physicians at their local health department tuberculosis
        clinics (where they often receive DOT for TB treatment). Family members may be recruited
        through requests made by the index case that family members contact study personnel for
        participation. A patient can be referred at any time point while he or she is receiving
        active treatment for tuberculosis. Male and female patients will be accepted without
        preference. Patients age 2 and older are eligible; however, severe infections may require
        highly specialized pediatric teams and institutions. Some referrals of pediatric cases will
        not be able to be handled appropriately at the NIH and may be deemed ineligible for
        admission, as determined by the Principal Investigator (PI). NIH employees and members of
        their immediate families may participate in this protocol.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        For All Patients

        Patients may be included in this study who:

          -  Have a type of TB disease which, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator (PI),
             will assist in meeting the Primary Objective of this study (i.e., Develop experience
             in the standard of care of tuberculosis patients ).

          -  Are aged 2 years or older.

          -  Have a primary care physician, infectious diseases physician, pulmonologist, or
             tuberculosis specialist outside of the NIH who can provide care of his or her TB
             infection outside the NIH, provide directly observed therapy (DOT) if necessary, and
             monitor for side effects and toxicity of TB medications.

          -  Are willing to consent to storage of specimens for future research.

          -  Subjects enrolled will be able to provide informed consent for themselves, or if they
             lack the capacity to provide informed consent, the study team will comply with MAS
             M87.4, if the Principal Investigator believes there is the prospect of direct benefit
             for the patient.

        For Patients with Latent TB

        In addition to the above described inclusion criteria for all patients, patients may be
        included in the Latent TB part of this protocol who:

        - Have documented evidence of a positive PPD skin test or Interferon Gamma Release Assays
        (IGRA) test meeting American Thoracic Society (ATS)/CDC guidelines for latent TB (Appendix
        B); conversion can have occurred at any time.

        For Patients with Active TB

        In addition to the above described inclusion criteria for all patients, patients may be
        included in the Active TB part of this protocol who:

          -  Have active tuberculosis of any drug susceptibility pattern and any site of infection
             as determined by smear, culture, or biopsy.

          -  Have appropriately documented clinically suspicious active tuberculosis without
             definitive microbiology confirmation.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients will be excluded from this study who:

          -  Are incarcerated.

          -  Have been ordered by a court to take TB medications.

          -  Are unwilling or unable to comply with prescribed therapy.

          -  Subjects that lack the capacity to provide informed consent autonomously are excluded;
             unless there is an appropriate legal guardian, Durable Power of Attorney (DPA) or
             surrogate who is willing to provide consent. A Bioethics consult will make this
             determination, based on an assessment of the patient and potential surrogate, in
             accordance with policy MAS M87-4.
