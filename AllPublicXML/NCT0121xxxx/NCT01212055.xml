      Background:

      - Gene therapy is being investigated as a possible treatment for individuals with
      immunodeficiency diseases or other conditions that make it difficult to fight off infection.
      Gene therapy avoids problems with donor identification and possible rejection of bone marrow
      transplant by using the patient s own modified blood cells to help treat the disease.
      Researchers are interested in collecting stem cells from the blood of individuals with
      immunodeficiency diseases in order to use the cells to develop potential gene therapy
      treatments.

      Objectives:

      - To collect blood stem cells from patients with immunodeficiency diseases tto test our
      ability to correct the defects of these cells in the test tube.

      Eligibility:

        -  Individuals between 18 and 40 years of age with immunodeficiency diseases.

        -  Individuals with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) will not be able to participate in
           this study.

      Design:

        -  Participants will provide an initial blood sample for disease screening (such as
           hepatitis B and C, syphilis, or viruses like the Epstein-Barr virus, herpes simplex
           virus, or toxoplasmosis) and to check kidney and liver function.

        -  Starting 5 days before blood donation, participants will receive daily injections of a
           drug called G-CSF (granulocyte colony stimulating factor, or filgrastim), which pushes
           stem cells out of the bone marrow and into the bloodstream. Participants will receive
           the injections at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center.

        -  On day 5, participants will have a single leukapheresis procedure to collect the stem
           cells from the blood.

        -  No additional treatment will be provided as part of this protocol. The cells that are
           collected will be used fore experiments in the lab and will not be used to treat
           individuals with these diseases.

      Background

      Primary immunodeficiency diseases (PID) represent candidate genetic disorders for new
      therapeutic approaches. Our laboratory is developing new therapies for patients with PID
      using autologous CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). Newer therapies may circumvent
      problems with allogeneic HSC transplantation, especially graft rejection and
      graft-versus-host-disease. We are particularly interested in three PID: Dedicator of
      CytoKinesis-8 (DOCK8) deficiency, Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency type 1 (LAD-1), and GATA2
      Deficiency. For all three diseases the gene has been cloned. Testing new therapies for these
      diseases would be considerably enhanced by the acquisition of peripheral blood CD34+ cells
      from patients with these immunodeficiency diseases.

      Objectives

      To provide a source of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (Filgrastim) mobilized
      peripheral blood CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) for laboratory research studies for
      DOCK8 deficiency, LAD-1, and GATA2 Deficiency.

      Eligibility

      Patients 18-40 years old with DOCK8 deficiency, LAD-1, and GATA2 Deficiency who meet the
      eligibility requirements will be considered for this protocol.

      Design

      Patients 18-40 years old with DOCK8 deficiency, LAD-1, and GATA2 Deficiency will receive five
      days of G- Filgrastim followed by a single apheresis. CD34+ cells will be selected and frozen
      in aliquots by the Cell Processing Section of the Department of Transfusion Medicine. No
      treatments, or investigational therapy will be administered on this protocol.
