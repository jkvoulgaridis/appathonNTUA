    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well giving temozolomide and irinotecan
      hydrochloride together with or without bevacizumab works in treating young patients with
      recurrent or refractory medulloblastoma or central nervous system (CNS) primitive
      neuroectodermal tumors. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide and irinotecan
      hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing
      the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Monoclonal
      antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the
      ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or
      carry tumor-killing substances to them. It is not yet known whether temozolomide and
      irinotecan hydrochloride are more effective with or without bevacizumab in treating
      medulloblastoma or CNS primitive neuroectodermal tumors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      l. To compare the overall survival (OS) of subjects receiving the combination of temozolomide
      and irinotecan with that of subjects receiving temozolomide, irinotecan (irinotecan
      hydrochloride), and bevacizumab for recurrent medulloblastoma (MB)/primitive neuroectodermal
      tumor (PNET) of childhood.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the response rate for each treatment arm amongst patients who are enrolled with
      measurable disease.

      II. To determine event-free survival (EFS) for each patient compared across regimens.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive temozolomide orally (PO) and irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 90
      minutes on days 1-5.

      ARM II: Patients receive temozolomide PO and irinotecan hydrochloride IV as in arm I and
      bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15.

      In both arms, treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 5 years.
