  <brief_summary>

      Background:

      - Non-invasive functional near infrared (fNIR) imaging techniques use infrared light to
      detect changes in blood volume and oxygen levels during brain activity. fNIR is being studied
      as a possible way to examine the brain activity of individuals who are unable to undergo
      standard brain function imaging techniques (such as functional magnetic resonance imaging, or
      fMRI). For instance, war veterans who have iron shrapnel in the body are not able to have
      fMRI scans, and very young children or children with autism and related disorders are often
      not able or willing to cooperate long enough in the MRI environment to allow full imaging
      studies to take place. Researchers are interested in comparing the results of fNIR and fMRI
      performed on healthy volunteers to determine if fNIR produces similarly accurate results.

      Objectives:

      - To examine the capabilities of non-invasive functional near infrared imaging techniques on
      healthy volunteers and compare the results with the existing outcomes of functional magnetic
      resonance imaging.

      Eligibility:

      - Healthy volunteers at least 18 years of age.

      Design:

        -  Participants will have one study visit. Depending on the complexity of the task, the
           whole exam will take between 5 minutes and 1 hour to perform.

        -  Participants will be asked to sit as still as possible while wearing a headband that
           includes light sources and detectors (the fNIR device).

        -  Participants will be asked to perform a set of tasks (e.g., reading sentences or
           counting numbers in one s head). Data will be collected during these experiments.

      Objective: to cross-validate our near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) imaging system with
      existing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalogram (EEG) data,
      and b) to investigate any significant technical issues associated with optode placement and
      motion artifacts, and to explore techniques that will potentially improve the feasibility and
      reliability of the system according to the needs of the population whom existing imaging
      systems are unsuitable.

      Study population: 250 healthy volunteers

      Design: The study will look for correlations between NIRS signal changes in healthy subjects
      when performing functional tasks, and existing fMRI data.

      Outcome Measures: graded changes in blood flow and oxygen, measured with NIRS, in response to
      different functional tasks.
