    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the effect of high intensity non-invasive
      positive pressure ventilation (HINPPV) for stable, hypercapnic COPD patients. The
      investigators believe that HINPPV, used at least 6 hours nocturnally over three months, will
      benefit the stable hypercapnic COPD patient through a reduction in the daytime partial
      pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood (PaCO2) levels.

      The High Intensity Non-invasive Positive Pressure trial is a single arm interventional study.
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of High Intensity Non-invasive
      ventilation (HINPPV) in stable Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary patients with chronically
      elevated carbon dioxide levels. Participants will undergo various testing ( arterial blood
      gas (ABG), Pulmonary Function Test (PFTs), Polysomnography (PSGs), 6 minute walk tests)over a
      3 month period to determine if this type of therapy will improve daytime carbon dioxide
      levels. The participants will also complete quality of life questionnaires to help ascertain
      improvements in their daily living activities.

    <measure>Health Status</measure>
    <time_frame>Before and after 3 months of therapy</time_frame>
    <description>Health status was assessed by completing different surveys at baseline and after 3 months of therapy. The Calgary Sleep Apnea Quality of Life was administered at baseline and 3 months. It is a 35-item, interview-administered scale, the SAQLI evaluates four domains of quality of life associated with sleep apnea: daily functioning, social interactions, emotional functioning, and symptoms. The SAQLI use a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (maximal impairment) to 7 (no impairment).</description>

    <measure>Maximal Inspiratory Pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>Before and after 3 months of therapy</time_frame>
    <description>The Maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) is the maximum negative pressure that can be generated from one inspiratory effort starting from functional residual capacity (FRC) or residual volume (RV). This was assessed at baseline and after 3 months of therapy.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Exercise Capacity</measure>

    <measure>Dyspnea at Rest and With Exertion</measure>
    <time_frame>Before and after 3 months of therapy</time_frame>
    <description>The modifed Borg scale was used to measure dyspnea. The Dyspnea Borg scale measures patients perceived level of dyspnea. The scale ranges from 0 to 10, 0- nothing at all and 10 is maximal.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sleepiness</measure>
    <time_frame>Before and after 3 months of therapy</time_frame>
    <description>Sleepiness will be evaluated by measuring the the baseline and 3 month Epworth Sleepiness Scale. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale is an 8 question survey regarding daytime sleepiness. The higher the score the higher the chance of dozing during the day. Each question is rated on a 0 to 3 scale of chance of dozing or sleeping. 0 would be no chance, 3 would be the highest chance.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Sleep</measure>
    <time_frame>Before and after 3 months of therapy</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of sleep will be measured using total sleep time. Total sleep time is the overall number of minutes of sleep, this will be compared from baseline to 3 months.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Efficiency of Sleep</measure>
    <time_frame>Before and after 3 months of therapy</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep efficiency will be measured by taking the total sleep time by the total time in bed. This is measured as a percentage and compared from baseline to 3 months</description>
