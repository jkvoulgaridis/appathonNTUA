  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is to determine the recommended Phase 2 regimen of study drug that may be safely
      administered to participants with advanced and or metastatic cancer. The study consists of
      two parts: a dose escalation and a dose confirmation.

    <measure>Recommended Dose for Phase 2 Studies : Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline Up to 32 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>MTD was determined after the evaluation of Part A portion of the trial. Dose escalation proceeded at 1.3 times the preceding cohort once a Grade 3 non-laboratory toxicity or Grade 2 laboratory toxicity was noted in ≥ 1 participant until MTD was achieved. Doses up to 24 mg (48 mg/day) were evaluated in Part A. The effects at this dose and at 18 mg (36 mg/day) suggested that a reasonable number of participants might not tolerate LY2874455 for chronic administration at these dose levels because of the constellation of effects observed individually or in combination in participants at these dose levels. Therefore, the dose of 16 mg BID of LY2874455 (total dose 32 mg per day) was selected as the initial dose for Part B. Selection of the dose level was based on the tolerability of this dose and without specific toxicities identified.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline Up to 60 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are events which were not present at baseline or pre-existing conditions at baseline that worsened in severity following the start of treatment. A summary of other non-serious Adverse Events (AEs), and all Serious Adverse Events (SAE's), regardless of causality, is located in the Reported Adverse Events section.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Best Overall Response Rate (BORR) and Objective Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>BORR: Baseline Up to 60 Weeks ; ORR: Baseline Up to 60 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>BORR is evaluated using response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST, version 1.1) criteria. Complete Response (CR): disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions, with the short axes of any target lymph nodes reduced to &lt;10 millimeters (mm). Partial Response (PR): at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions (including the short axes of any target lymph nodes), taking as reference the baseline sum diameter.
Best overall response rate = (unconfirmed CR+ unconfirmed PR) / subjects in efficacy population.
Objective response rate = (confirmed CR+ confirmed PR) / subjects in efficacy population.</description>

             participants must agree to use 2 medically acceptable methods of contraception, 1
             being an oral contraceptive, dermal patch, or progestin (implantation or injection),
             and the other being a medically acceptable barrier method; alternatively, 2 medically
             acceptable barrier methods may be used. Medically acceptable barrier methods of
             contraception that may be used by the participant and/or his/her partner include:
             abstinence; diaphragm with spermicide; intrauterine device (IUD); condom together with
             foam, spermicide, or vaginal spermicidal suppository. Prohibited methods include the
             rhythm method, withdrawal, condoms alone, or diaphragm alone

          -  Have an estimated life expectancy of greater than or equal to 12 weeks

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have received treatment with an investigational drug, which has not received
             regulatory approval for any indication, within 28 days of study treatment with
             LY2874455

          -  Currently taking agents to control serum phosphate or calcium levels. This includes
             dietary restrictions

             participation in this study

          -  Have symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) malignancy or metastasis. Participants
             with treated CNS metastases are eligible provided their disease is radiographically
             stable, asymptomatic, and they are not currently receiving corticosteroids and/or
             anticonvulsants. Screening of asymptomatic participants without history of CNS
             metastases is not required

          -  Have a history of major organ transplant (for example: heart, lungs, liver, and
             kidney)

          -  Have current acute leukemia

          -  Females who are pregnant or nursing

             msec (male), history of unexplained recurrent syncope, history of congenital long QT
             syndrome, family history of sudden death, or the presence in the screening
             electrocardiogram (ECG) of a conduction abnormality that in the opinion of the
             investigator would preclude safe participation in this study

          -  Have had an autologous or allogenic bone marrow transplant

          -  Previously treated with LY2874455

        <title>Recommended Dose for Phase 2 Studies : Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)</title>
        <description>MTD was determined after the evaluation of Part A portion of the trial. Dose escalation proceeded at 1.3 times the preceding cohort once a Grade 3 non-laboratory toxicity or Grade 2 laboratory toxicity was noted in ≥ 1 participant until MTD was achieved. Doses up to 24 mg (48 mg/day) were evaluated in Part A. The effects at this dose and at 18 mg (36 mg/day) suggested that a reasonable number of participants might not tolerate LY2874455 for chronic administration at these dose levels because of the constellation of effects observed individually or in combination in participants at these dose levels. Therefore, the dose of 16 mg BID of LY2874455 (total dose 32 mg per day) was selected as the initial dose for Part B. Selection of the dose level was based on the tolerability of this dose and without specific toxicities identified.</description>

        <description>BORR is evaluated using response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST, version 1.1) criteria. Complete Response (CR): disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions, with the short axes of any target lymph nodes reduced to &lt;10 millimeters (mm). Partial Response (PR): at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions (including the short axes of any target lymph nodes), taking as reference the baseline sum diameter.
Best overall response rate = (unconfirmed CR+ unconfirmed PR) / subjects in efficacy population.
Objective response rate = (confirmed CR+ confirmed PR) / subjects in efficacy population.</description>
