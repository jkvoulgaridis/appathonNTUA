  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety, immunogenicity and clinical activity
      of GSK2241658A antigen-specific cancer immunotherapeutic (ASCI) for the treatment of patients
      with non-operable and progressing metastatic cutaneous melanoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, patients were to receive a maximum of 24 doses of recNY-ESO-1 + AS15 ASCI
      according four cycles over a period of four years. An active follow-phase (up to five years
      after registration into the study) was planned for all patients.

      As of Amendment 3, there will no longer be an active follow-up of patients after
      discontinuation or completion of the treatment. The study will end 30 days after the last
      dose will be administered.

      In addition, no more biological samples will be collected for protocol research purposes. For
      each biological sample already collected in the scope of this study and not tested yet,
      testing will not be performed by default, except if a scientific rationale remains relevant.

      Blood sampling for safety monitoring as per protocol will continue.

    <measure>Number of Patients With Severe Toxicities During the Study Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>During the study treatment period (maximum duration = 49 months).</time_frame>
    <description>Severe toxicity was defined, according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) (version 4.0), as 1)an Antigen-Specific Cancer Immunotherapeutic (ASCI) related or possibly related Grade 3 or higher toxicity. Grade 3 myalgia, arthralgia, headache, fever, rigors/chills and fatigue (including lethargy, malaise and asthenia) should persist for 48 hours despite therapy to be taken into account and as 2)an ASCI related or possibly related Grade 2 or higher allergic reaction occurring within 24 hours of the dose administration.</description>

    <description>Severe toxicity was defined, according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) (version 4.0), as 1)an Antigen-Specific Cancer Immunotherapeutic (ASCI) related or possibly related Grade 3 or higher toxicity. Grade 3 myalgia, arthralgia, headache, fever, rigors/chills and fatigue (including lethargy, malaise and asthenia) should persist for 48 hours despite therapy in order to be taken into account and as 2)an ASCI related or possibly related Grade 2 or higher allergic reaction occurring within 24 hours of the dose administration. All active follow-up visits and procedures were stopped, hence this follow-up analysis was not performed as initially planned.</description>

    <measure>Number of Patients With the Best Overall Response in the Overall Population</measure>
    <time_frame>During the study treatment period (maximum duration = 49 months).</time_frame>
    <description>Best response was recorded from the start of treatment until disease progression. Response assessment was essentially based on a set of measurable lesions (target lesions [TL]), and any other lesions (non-target lesions [NTL]), both identified at baseline. Complete Response (CR)=disappearance of all TL or NTL; Partial Response (PR) = at least 30 percent (%) decrease in the sum of the longest diameter(LD) of TL compared to baseline, stable disease (SD) = neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for Progressive disease (PD) compared with baseline; PD = at least 20% increase in the sum of LD of TL compared with baseline, or the appearance of one or more new lesions, or both of these, and/or unequivocal progression of existing NTL; NE =non-evaluable; Clinical response: any CR or PR best overall response; Disease control: any CR, PR, SD or SD/PR best overall response.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Patients With Best Overall Response Including Mixed Response (MxR) and Slow Progressive Disease (SPD) Criteria</measure>
    <time_frame>During the study treatment period (maximum duration = 49 months).</time_frame>
    <description>Patients with Slow Progressive Disease (SPD) status met the following criteria: patient's Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status was 0 or 1, patient's lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) value was not greater than twice the normal upper limit, there was no appearance of visceral metastases other than in the lung, patients did not meet any of the criteria for permanent stopping of study treatment. Mixed response (MxR) criteria was defined as follows: at least 30% decrease in the longest diameter (LD) occurring in at least one target lesion recorded and measured at baseline. Such response occurring in otherwise stable disease (SD) or progressive disease (PD) status of LD of target lesions and without the appearance of one or more new lesions were classified as &quot;SD with target lesion regression&quot; or &quot;PD with target lesion regression&quot;. The appearance of new lesions in otherwise partial response (PR) status of the LD of target lesions were classified as &quot;PR with new lesion&quot;.</description>

    <measure>Number of Patients With Adverse Events (AEs) by Maximum Grade</measure>
    <time_frame>During the study treatment period (maximum duration = 49 months).</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation patient, temporally associated with the use of a medical product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. For marketed medicinal products, this also includes failure to produce expected benefits (i.e. lack efficacy), abuse or misuse.</description>

    <measure>Time to Treatment Failure (TTF)</measure>
    <time_frame>From first treatment administration (i.e. at Week 0) until the last treatment administration (i.e. at Month 48)</time_frame>
    <description>Time to Treatment Failure (TTF) was defined as the time from first treatment until the date of the last treatment administration, for patients who discontinued the treatment prematurely, regardless of the reason for study treatment discontinuation. Patients who completed their full treatment phase or who were still on treatment at the time of analysis were censored on their last study treatment administration date..</description>

    <measure>Progression-free Survival (PFS) Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>From first treatment administration (i.e. at Week 0) until the last tumor evaluation (i.e. at Month 49)</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from first treatment to either the date of first disease progression (PD) or the date of death (for whatever reason), whichever came first. Patients alive and without disease progression were censored at the date of the last visit/contact.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From first treatment administration (i.e. at Week 0) until the last tumor evaluation (i.e. at Month 49)</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time from first treatment until death. Patients alive at the time of analysis were censored at the time of last visit/contact.</description>

    <measure>The Duration of Response for Patients With CR, PR or Stable Disease (SD) Status</measure>
    <time_frame>From first treatment administration (i.e. at Week 0) until the last tumor evaluation (i.e. at Month 49)</time_frame>
    <description>The duration of response was measured from the time when the measurement criteria for CR/PR (whichever was recorded first) or SD evaluation were met until the first date that first PD or death was objectively documented (taking as reference for PD the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). Stable disease (SD) was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD taking as references the sum of LD of target lesions recorded previously but not necessarily at baseline (The minimal time interval required between two measurements for determination of SD was at least 16 weeks.). The analysis was not performed as initially planned.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Patients With Progression-free Survival Events</measure>
    <time_frame>From first treatment administration (i.e. at Week 0) until the last tumor evaluation (i.e. at Month 49)</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival was defined as the time from the date of registration of the patient to either the date of disease progression or the date of death (for whatever reason), whichever came first. Patients alive and without disease progression were censored at the date of their last tumor evaluation. PFS events included progressive disease (PD), death in absence of PD and events (Any event which was part of the natural course of the disease under study, was captured as an efficacy measure. Therefore it did not need to be reported as an SAE).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Summary of Deaths Related to Progressive Disease of Cancer Under Study Reported After the Study Treatment, in the Period of Long-term Follow-up for Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>During the long-term Follow-Up period for progressive disease and survival [1 year after the study treatment end (at Month 49) or up to 5 years after the first study treatment administration, regardless of disease progression and study discontinuation.]</time_frame>
    <description>Summary of deaths included death, autopsy performed and cause of death. Progression of the tumor was recorded in the clinical assessments. Death due to progressive disease was to be recorded on a specific form in the case report form but not as a serious adverse event (SAE). However, if the investigator considered that there was a causal relationship between the administration of the treatment or protocol design/procedures and the disease progression, then this must be reported as an SAE.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Among 169 subjects screened, 33 were vaccinated and 6 completed the study. Following the NCT00480025 and NCT00796445 studies, which failed to demonstrate clinical efficacy of the MAGE-A3 antigen-specific cancer immunotherapeutic (ASCI), GSK decided to stop the development of ASCI studies and recruitment in ongoing studies.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Accordingly, patients still on treatment in the study, at the time of protocol amendment 3, either continued until last dose or until recurrence, whichever came first, or until patient or investigator decided to stop study treatment. Therefore, the results summary contain limited primary and secondary endpoints results, and are merely descriptive.</pre_assignment_details>

Mixed response (MxR) criteria was defined as follows: at least 30% decrease in the longest diameter (LD) occurring in at least one target lesion recorded and measured at baseline. Such response occurring in otherwise stable disease (SD) or progressive disease (PD) status of LD of target lesions and without the appearance of one or more new lesions were classified as &quot;SD with target lesion regression&quot; or &quot;PD with target lesion regression&quot;.

        <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation patient, temporally associated with the use of a medical product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. For marketed medicinal products, this also includes failure to produce expected benefits (i.e. lack efficacy), abuse or misuse.</description>

          <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation patient, temporally associated with the use of a medical product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. For marketed medicinal products, this also includes failure to produce expected benefits (i.e. lack efficacy), abuse or misuse.</description>

      <time_frame>AEs and SAEs were collected during the study treatment period, i.e. from Month 0 to Month 49 (maximum treatment duration) in the overall population. All-Cause Mortality events were collected during the long-term Follow-Up period for progressive disease and survival [1 year after the study treatment end (at Month 49) or up to 5 years after the first study treatment administration, regardless of disease progression and study discontinuation.]</time_frame>
      <desc>As planned per study protocol, any event which was part of the natural course of the disease under study was captured as an efficacy measure (i.e.: Progression of the tumor and death due to progressive disease) and did not need to be reported as an SAE or fatal SAE. However, if the investigator considered that there was a causal relationship between the administration of the ASCI or protocol design/procedures and the disease progression, then this was reported as an SAE.</desc>
