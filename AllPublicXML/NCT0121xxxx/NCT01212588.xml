    <textblock>
      Participants will be randomized to either Mifepristone 600mg once daily for seven days or
      Placebo tablet once daily for seven days. Rating scales, vital signs, cortisol levels will be
      collected for evaluation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mifepristone is an antagonist of type II glucocorticoid (GR-II) receptors, which has shown
      safety, efficacy, and good tolerability in the treatment of psychotic major depression (PMD).
      Like BPD, Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis hyper-responsiveness appears to play a
      role in PMD pathophysiology. Belanoff et al. (2002) hypothesized that mifepristone causes a
      normalizing &quot;resetting&quot; of HPA axis rhythm, accounting for its efficacy in PMD. Mifepristone
      produces a marked (2- to 3- fold) compensatory increase in central cortisol levels via its
      antagonism of GR-II receptors. This consequent central cortisol elevation may then be able to
      counteract abnormally heightened corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) activity via enhanced
      negative feedback mechanisms.

      This is a proof of principle study of mifepristone in the treatment of individuals with BPD
      and histories of childhood abuse, which aims to translate neurobiological research concerning
      HPA axis abnormalities in BPD into a novel clinical intervention for patients. This project
      will also explore an innovative approach to the structure of pharmacotherapy for BPD.
      Specifically, we will employ the circumscribed (finite) drug administration period used in
      prior studies of mifepristone in neuropsychiatric illness, which differs from the current
      clinical practice of indefinite daily usage of medications. We hypothesize that mifepristone
      will beneficially impact stress response neurobiology and consequently ameliorate associated
      BPD symptoms.

    <description>To evaluate whether mifepristone will produce rapid symptom change after seven days of active treatment, as measured by Borderline Personality Disorder Severity Index (BPDSI) total score. The BPDSI is a semi-structured clinical interview assessing the frequency and severity of manifestations of Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) during a circumscribed period of the previous 7 days. The BPDSI measures 9 symptoms associated with BPD on a Likert scale ranging from 0-7 (0 = never; 7 = daily). Each symptom measure produces a mean score ranging from 0-7, with a higher score indicating more prevalent symptoms. A total score is then calculated using the summed symptom mean scores, ranging from 0-63, with a higher score indicating more prevalent symptoms.</description>

        <title>Rapid Symptom Change</title>
        <description>To evaluate whether mifepristone will produce rapid symptom change after seven days of active treatment, as measured by Borderline Personality Disorder Severity Index (BPDSI) total score. The BPDSI is a semi-structured clinical interview assessing the frequency and severity of manifestations of Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) during a circumscribed period of the previous 7 days. The BPDSI measures 9 symptoms associated with BPD on a Likert scale ranging from 0-7 (0 = never; 7 = daily). Each symptom measure produces a mean score ranging from 0-7, with a higher score indicating more prevalent symptoms. A total score is then calculated using the summed symptom mean scores, ranging from 0-63, with a higher score indicating more prevalent symptoms.</description>

          <description>To evaluate whether seven days of mifepristone treatment will result in a durable change in symptoms persisting after active treatment discontinuation, as measured by Borderline Personality Disorder Severity Index (BPDSI) total score. The BPDSI is a semi-structured clinical interview assessing the frequency and severity of manifestations of Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) during a circumscribed period of the previous 7 days. The BPDSI measures 9 symptoms associated with BPD on a Likert scale ranging from 0-7 (0 = never; 7 = daily). Each symptom measure produces a mean score ranging from 0-7, with a higher score indicating more prevalent symptoms. A total score is then calculated using the summed symptom mean scores, ranging from 0-63, with a higher score indicating more prevalent symptoms.</description>

        <description>The Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R) instrument helps evaluate a broad range of psychological problems and symptoms of psychopathology. The instrument is also useful in measuring patient progress or treatment outcomes. The SCL-90-R contains 90 items on a 5-point rating scale, with a higher score indicating more severity. The items are categorized into 12 domains (9 scores along primary symptom dimensions and 3 scores among global distress indices). A t-score for each domain is then obtained by norming by sex and ranges between 19-81, with a higher score indicating more severity.</description>

        <description>The Indiana Psychiatric Illness Interview (IPII) is a semi-structured interview developed to assess illness narratives. Responses are audio taped and later transcribed. It is scored using the Metacognition Assessment Scale- Abbreviated (MAS-A), which has four domains of metacognition: i) Self-Reflectivity ranging from 0-9; ii) Understanding the Mind of Other ranging from 0-7; iii) Decentration ranging from 0-3; and iv) Mastery ranging from 0-9. Lower scores indicate metacognitive deficits, higher scores indicate more integrated and nuanced metacognition. MAS-A total score is the sum of the scores on each of the domains of metacognition, ranging from 0-28, with a lower score indicating metacognitive deficits and a higher score indicating more integrated and nuanced metacognition.</description>

The BPDSI is a semi-structured clinical interview assessing the frequency and severity of manifestations of Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) during a circumscribed period of the previous 7 days. The BPDSI measures 9 symptoms associated with BPD on a Likert scale ranging from 0-7 (0 = never; 7 = daily). Each symptom measure produces a mean score ranging from 0-7, with a higher score indicating more prevalent symptoms.</description>

        <description>The Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R) instrument helps evaluate a broad range of psychological problems and symptoms of psychopathology. The instrument is also useful in measuring patient progress or treatment outcomes. The SCL-90-R contains 90 items on a 5-point rating scale, with a higher score indicating more severity. The items are categorized into 12 domains (9 scores along primary symptom dimensions and 3 scores among global distress indices). A t-score for each domain is then obtained by norming by sex and ranges between 19-81, with a higher score indicating more severity.</description>

        <description>The Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R) instrument helps evaluate a broad range of psychological problems and symptoms of psychopathology. The instrument is also useful in measuring patient progress or treatment outcomes. The SCL-90-R contains 90 items on a 5-point rating scale, with a higher score indicating more severity. The items are categorized into 12 domains (9 scores along primary symptom dimensions and 3 scores among global distress indices). A t-score for each domain is then obtained by norming by sex and ranges between 19-81, with a higher score indicating more severity.</description>
