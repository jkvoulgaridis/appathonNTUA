    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to obtain preliminary data that will test whether the antidepressant
      medication escitalopram resets the body clock: a collection of nerve cells in the brain that
      control the timing of many body processes. The study will also test whether the improvement
      in depression symptoms with escitalopram correlates with the degree to which the timing of
      the body clock is properly aligned with the timing of sleep.

      Background: The human biological clock (circadian pacemaker) has long been thought to play a
      role in non-seasonal depression. A connection is suggested by the demonstration of 24-hour
      rhythms in mood, subjective and objective changes in sleep with depression, and reports of
      changes in the timing and amplitude of biological rhythms in depression. Furthermore, it is
      known that the neurotransmitter serotonin has a significant role in regulating biological
      rhythms and that drugs that act on serotonin (such as some antidepressants) are able to reset
      the biological clock in animals.

      Objective: The aim of the study is to obtain preliminary data that will test whether the
      antidepressant medication escitalopram has a resetting effect on the human biological clock
      and whether the improvement in depression symptoms with escitalopram correlates with the
      degree to which the timing of the biological clock is realigned with the timing of sleep.

      Design: 14-16-week, fixed dose (after titration), open label trial.

      Setting and Subjects: 50 individuals will be screened for participation. 15 individuals with
      unipolar, non-seasonal depression will be studied over 1 year.

      Intervention: Subjects will first complete a one week, single-blind placebo lead-in phase.
      Subjects will then receive escitalopram for 8 weeks (10 mg/day for the first 2 weeks of
      treatment and then 20mg/day for the remaining 6 weeks of treatment).

      Measurements: Subjects will keep a sleep diary and wear a wrist activity monitor throughout
      the study to document the timing and quality of sleep. On two occasions (end of placebo week
      and end of last treatment week) blood and/or saliva will be sampled every 30 minutes for 7
      hours and the resulting samples will be assayed for melatonin. The onset of melatonin
      secretion (dim light melatonin onset or DLMO) will be used to mark the timing of the
      biological clock (circadian phase). Circadian misalignment will be measured using the time
      interval between the DLMO and the average midsleep of the prior week (phase angle difference
      or PAD). Mood will be assessed throughout the study using the Hamilton Depression Rating
      Scale (HAM-D) as well as the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and Beck Anxiety Inventory
      (BAI).

    <measure>Change in Dim Light Melatonin Onset</measure>
    <time_frame>8 Weeks: Study Visit 3 (after 1 week of placebo) to study Visit 11 (after 8 weeks of escitalopram)</time_frame>
    <description>The Dim Light Melatonin Onset (DLMO) is the time of the onset of melatonin secretion under dim light conditions using the equivalent thresholds of 10 pg/ml in plasma and 3 pg/ml in saliva. It is a marker of biological time. Data are provided in decimal and military time (e.g., 9:30 pm equals 21.50).
This measure is used to determine if there was a change in the time of the dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) before treatment with escitalopram (at Study Visit 3) and after treatment with escitalopram (at Study Visit 11).</description>

    <time_frame>8 Weeks: Study Visit 3 (after 1 week of placebo) to study Visit 11 (after 8 weeks of escitalopram)</time_frame>
    <description>The HAM-D is the total score on the 21-question Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Scores range from 0 to 53 with higher scores indicating worse symptoms of depression.</description>

    <measure>Change in Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>8 Weeks: Study Visit 3 (after 1 week of placebo) to study Visit 11 (after 8 weeks of escitalopram)</time_frame>
    <description>The BDI-II is the total score on the 21-question Beck Depression Inventory II questionnaire. Scores range from 0 to 63 with higher scores indicating worse symptoms of depression.</description>

    <measure>Change in Phase Angle Difference (PAD)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 Weeks: Study Visit 3 (after 1 week of placebo) to study Visit 11 (after 8 weeks of escitalopram)</time_frame>
    <description>The PAD is the time interval (number of hours) between the Dim Light Melatonin Onset (DLMO) and the average midpoint of sleep during the prior week. Larger PADs indicate a longer time interval between the DLMO and midpoint of sleep. A negative change in PAD value indicates a shortening of the time interval from Study Visit 3 to Study Visit 11.</description>

        <title>Change in Dim Light Melatonin Onset</title>
        <description>The Dim Light Melatonin Onset (DLMO) is the time of the onset of melatonin secretion under dim light conditions using the equivalent thresholds of 10 pg/ml in plasma and 3 pg/ml in saliva. It is a marker of biological time. Data are provided in decimal and military time (e.g., 9:30 pm equals 21.50).
This measure is used to determine if there was a change in the time of the dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) before treatment with escitalopram (at Study Visit 3) and after treatment with escitalopram (at Study Visit 11).</description>

            <description>Subjects will have a total of 12 visits to Oregon Clinical &amp; Translational Research Institute at Oregon Health &amp; Science University over the 14-16 weeks of study. An initial screening visit will determine eligibility. Subjects who meet criteria and agree to participate will then stop taking their current antidepressant medication (if applicable), during which time the study doctor and staff will conduct weekly mood assessments to ensure safety. Subjects will then have a study initiation/materials visit followed by 9 visits during treatment with placebo or escitalopram. A final post-study follow-up safety visit will be scheduled at the end of treatment.
Placebo/escitalopram: Subjects will first complete a one week, single-blind placebo lead in phase. Subjects will then receive escitalopram for 8 weeks. Subjects will receive 10 mg/day for the first 2 weeks of active treatment, and then 20 mg/day for the remaining 6 weeks of treatment. Medication will be dispensed weekly.</description>

    <reported_events>
      <time_frame>Participants were assessed over 14 weeks (or 16 weeks in two subjects who were on fluoxetine at enrollment and therefore had a 4-week, instead of a 2-week, washout period per the protocol). Subjects had a weekly contact with study personnel throughout the 14 or 16 weeks of study except for the two week medication taper period between the last two study visits.</time_frame>

          <title>Visit 1: Screening &amp; Consent, Washout</title>
          <description>Subjects will have a total of 12 visits to Oregon Clinical &amp; Translational Research Institute at Oregon Health &amp; Science University over the 14-16 weeks of study. An initial screening visit will determine eligibility. Subjects who meet criteria and agree to participate will then stop taking their current antidepressant medication (if applicable), during which time the study doctor and staff will conduct weekly mood assessments to ensure safety.</description>
