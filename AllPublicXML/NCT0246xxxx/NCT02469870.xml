      The evaluation of the program efficacy will be conducted via a randomized control study with
      136 parents of children aged 3-8 who have autism. Investigators will test whether, compared
      to a content comparison group (CC), administration of the APT program over a 3-week
      intervention period (a) improves child behaviors, (b) increases perceived quality of life,
      (c) decreases parental stress, (d) increases positive parenting practices, and (e) increases
      parent knowledge of evidence-based support practices.

      Participants. The sample will consist of parents who have at least one child diagnosed with
      autism (aged 3 to 8) and have access to the Internet. From investigators experience in the
      Phase I and similar studies, an attrition rate of less than 30% is expected. 180 parents (90
      per condition) will ensure that the final sample will be no fewer than 136, with 68 in each
      condition. Participation will be open to two-parent and single-parent families; only one
      parent per family will be invited to participate in data collection. No parental age, gender,
      or race exclusions will apply.

      Procedure. All research will be conducted online. IRIS Ed has extensive experience conducting
      online studies, and has developed successful recruitment, retention, and assessment
      procedures. Screening, consent, and data collection will be conducted using Qualtrics (see
      Human Subjects). Google+ Hangouts will be used to conduct the interactive APT training. The
      CC training materials will be hosted on irisEd.com. Additional training materials will be
      hosted on YouTube and SoundCloud. Participants will be recruited nationally using approaches
      and resources that have yielded results in past online interventions.

      The APT study will adhere to the following procedures: potential participants will be
      directed to the recruitment website on Qualtrics and will be screened for eligibility on the
      following inclusion criteria: (a) have a child aged 3-8 diagnosed with autism and living with
      the parent, (b) have access to email and an Internet connection, and (c) have access to a
      computer or other mobile device with a camera and a microphone. Eligible participants will be
      given a brief explanation of the study and participation requirements, and will be asked to
      complete an online informed consent (see Human Subjects). Participants will then complete the
      pretest measures (see Table 3). Upon pretest completion, parents will be randomly assigned to
      either the APT intervention condition or a content comparison (CC) group.

      Content Comparison (CC). Parents assigned to the CC will be given access to a self-paced
      online training program covering the same content as APT. The CC group will receive an online
      program that delivers antecedent-behavior-consequence (ABC) multimedia instruction that is
      targeted to parents. For this purpose, investigators and the curriculum designer will adapt a
      program developed by IRIS entitled Teaching Routines to Children Who Have ASD, A Parent's
      Guide to the ABC Method. The ABC Method demonstrated in a pre-posttest design that web-based
      instruction in applied behavioral analytical (ABA) strategies, such as ABC, was effective in
      helping parents teach children basic self-help skills, and allowed parents to apply this
      method to a range of skills. The original ABC Method program consisted of nine multimedia
      lessons (modeling videos, animated sequences, interactive exercises, downloadable summaries)
      designed to help parents understand and use the antecedent-behavior-consequence concept
      derived from ABA. Each lesson contained a 3 to 5 minute video that uses simple language,
      realistic live action, and animation to illustrate a concept and to model how parents can
      apply the concept as they teach a routine. Each lesson also contained an interactive exercise
      and printed summary to guide parents through the steps of creating a teaching plan tailored
      to the needs of their children.

      To ensure that the CC group receives a dosage equivalent to that of the APT Intervention
      group, the original program will be reformatted so that it is delivered in 3 rather than 9
      lessons. This will require re-editing the original materials, creating new introductions to
      the three lessons, and making corresponding changes in how the program is delivered by our
      online Learning Management System. Investigators will also ensure that the reformatted
      program possesses equivalent validity with the original program. Investigators and the
      development team will achieve this by enlisting a small test group of parents in an iterative
      process of review and refinement as the program is reformatted. Parents in the CC will have 3
      weeks in which to access the program. Web metrics will allow investigators to track adherence
      to program fidelity.

      Treatment. Parents in the APT group will be presented with the dates and times of available
      training groups and asked to select their preference. They will then receive an access code
      for logging on to the APT web hub to view the training materials. Participants will also be
      given access to the videoconferencing workshops, and will test to ensure they can access the
      site and that their camera and microphone are operating. IRIS Ed technical staff will be
      available to assist with any difficulties. Each week, for three weeks participants in the APT
      condition will meet with their training group and the APT Parent Educator for 120 minutes of
      instruction, discussion, and problem solving. They will also complete assigned homework,
      including watching online video trainings.

    <measure>Child Behavior Measured by Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (Goodman, 1997)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre (0 weeks), Post (3 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Examining change over time points (T2-T1) This 25‐item parent‐report version of a behavioral screening questionnaire has been used with children aged 3 to 16 years of age. It assesses both positive and negative behaviors in the following domains: conduct problems, inattention‐hyperactivity, emotional symptoms, peer problems, and pro‐social behavior. The SDQ‐P has demonstrated acceptable psychometric properties and is available in Spanish (Goodman, 2001).Total range of scores is from 0 to 50. The prosocial items are reverse scored for the total scale so that on the total scale higher scores indicate worse behaviors.</description>

    <time_frame>Pre (0 weeks), Post (3 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Examining change over time points (T2-T1) Quality of Life was measured using the Family Quality of Life survey (FQOL; Summers et al., 2005), which is a 25‐item measure of the quality of life for a family raising a child with intellectual or developmental disabilities. The outcomes measured are: quality of life in the domains of parenting, emotional well‐being, physical/material well‐being, and disability‐related supports using a 5‐point scale with responses ranging from (1) very dissatisfied to (5) very satisfied. The average score on the total scale was used in the analysis. The range is from 1 to 5 with higher scores indicating more positive outcomes.</description>

    <measure>Parenting Scale (Arnold, O'Leary, Wolff, &amp; Aker, 1993)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre (0 weeks), Post (3 weeks),</time_frame>
    <description>Examining change over time points (T2-T1) Parenting Practices will be assessed using the Parenting Scale (PS; Arnold, O'Leary, Wolff, &amp; Aker, 1993) a 30‐item, 7 point Likert-like scale with three subscales (laxness, over‐reactivity, and hostility). The scale has internal consistency for the total scale and subscales (α = .78 and ‐ .83 respectively) and has been evaluated for factor structure and validity (Rhoades &amp; O'Leary, 2007). The average score on the total scale was used in the analysis with a range of 1 to 7 with lower scores indicating more positive outcomes.</description>

    <description>Examining change over time points (T2-T1)
The SBI-R is a 40-item, 7-point scale that measures 14 areas of adaptive behaviors and 8 areas of maladaptive behaviors.
We used the total adaptive scale with a total range of 0 to 120 with higher scores indicating better outcomes.</description>

    <measure>Knowledge About Applied Behavior Analysis and Acceptance Commitment Training Measured by Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre (0 weeks), Post (3 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Examining change over time points (T2-T1) 20 multiple choice knowledge items were developed during the project and were used to determine the extent to which participants understood basic program content, e.g., techniques parents can use to help their child master self‐care routines. These included questions about the principles of behavior support (gathering information, evaluating possible reinforcers, etc.), definitions of behavioral concepts (tantrums, reinforcement, antecedent), and application of these concepts. The total score ranged from 0 to 20 with higher scores indicating better outcomes.</description>

        <description>Examining change over time points (T2-T1) This 25‐item parent‐report version of a behavioral screening questionnaire has been used with children aged 3 to 16 years of age. It assesses both positive and negative behaviors in the following domains: conduct problems, inattention‐hyperactivity, emotional symptoms, peer problems, and pro‐social behavior. The SDQ‐P has demonstrated acceptable psychometric properties and is available in Spanish (Goodman, 2001).Total range of scores is from 0 to 50. The prosocial items are reverse scored for the total scale so that on the total scale higher scores indicate worse behaviors.</description>

Participants were assigned six activities using fillable forms and provided additional resources including examples, a glossary of terms, and a list of websites. No feedback was given to the parents apart from the automated completion responses. The participants were given access to the TR LMS for the duration of the study, but post and follow-up assessments were completed at 6 and 10 weeks (i.e., same as the PR condition).</description>

The outcomes measured are: quality of life in the domains of parenting, emotional well‐being, physical/material well‐being, and disability‐related supports using a 5‐point scale with responses ranging from (1) very dissatisfied to (5) very satisfied. The average score on the total scale was used in the analysis. The range is from 1 to 5 with higher scores indicating more positive outcomes.</description>

The topics overlapped with those in the TR program, but included more explicit information on function-based strategies, as well as mindfulness practice. Participants were assigned six fillable forms, and provided supplemental data collection tools. Additional resources focused on mindfulness and PBS within family routines. Eighteen brief guided audio meditations were available to participants via the Practiced MindTM mobile application. The meditations focused on bringing the parents’ awareness to both internal and external experiences and helping them act intentionally.

The scale has internal consistency for the total scale and subscales (α = .78 and ‐ .83 respectively) and has been evaluated for factor structure and validity (Rhoades &amp; O'Leary, 2007). The average score on the total scale was used in the analysis with a range of 1 to 7 with lower scores indicating more positive outcomes.</description>

          <description>Examining change over time points (T2-T1) Parenting Practices will be assessed using the Parenting Scale (PS; Arnold, O'Leary, Wolff, &amp; Aker, 1993) a 30‐item, 7 point Likert-like scale with three subscales (laxness, over‐reactivity, and hostility). The scale has internal consistency for the total scale and subscales (α = .78 and ‐ .83 respectively) and has been evaluated for factor structure and validity (Rhoades &amp; O'Leary, 2007). The average score on the total scale was used in the analysis with a range of 1 to 7 with lower scores indicating more positive outcomes.</description>

Practiced Routines was a facilitated program. It was organized into four modules that included a total of seven videos ranging from 3-13 minutes each. The topics overlapped with those in the TR program, but included more explicit information on function-based strategies, as well as mindfulness practice. Participants were assigned six fillable forms, and provided supplemental data collection tools. Additional resources focused on mindfulness and PBS within family routines. Eighteen brief guided audio meditations were available to participants via the Practiced MindTM mobile application. The meditations focused on bringing the parents’ awareness to both internal and external experiences and helping them act intentionally.</description>
