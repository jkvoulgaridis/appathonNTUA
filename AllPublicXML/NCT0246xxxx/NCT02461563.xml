  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and the ability of MK-1075 to
      suppress viral load (VL) in HCV-infected participants during 7 days of once daily dose
      administration. The primary hypothesis is at a once-daily dose that is sufficiently safe and
      well tolerated in HCV-infected participants, the mean maximum HCV RNA (log10 IU/mL) reduction
      is at least 3 log10 IU/mL as compared to baseline following multiple dose oral administration
      of MK-1075 in HCV genotype 1 (GT1) and genotype 3 (GT3) infected participants.

    <time_frame>Up to Day 42</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor's product, is also an AE.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Maximum log10 HCV RNA Following Multiple Dose Oral Administration of MK-1075</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (pre-dose, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours postdose); Days 3, 4, 5, 6 (pre-dose); Day 7 (predose, 4, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, and 192 hours postdose); Days 21, 28 and 42</time_frame>
    <description>Blood was collected on Days 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 21, 28 and 42, where baseline measurement was defined as the measurement obtained pre-dose on the first day of dosing. Change from baseline in log10 HCV RNA levels, was determined, and the maximum reduction in HCV RNA was analyzed by an ANOVA model with a fixed effect for treatment. The primary hypothesis is, with a posterior probability larger than 70%, there is at least a 3 log10 reduction from baseline in HCV RNA.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Who Experienced an Adverse Event (AE)</title>
        <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor's product, is also an AE.</description>

        <description>Blood was collected on Days 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 21, 28 and 42, where baseline measurement was defined as the measurement obtained pre-dose on the first day of dosing. Change from baseline in log10 HCV RNA levels, was determined, and the maximum reduction in HCV RNA was analyzed by an ANOVA model with a fixed effect for treatment. The primary hypothesis is, with a posterior probability larger than 70%, there is at least a 3 log10 reduction from baseline in HCV RNA.</description>

        <title>Area Under the Plasma Concentration Time Curve From Time 0 to Last (AUC 0-last) of MK-1075 Following Multiple Dose Oral Administration of MK-1075</title>
        <description>Blood was collected from pre-dose up to 120 hours post-dose in order to determine the plasma AUC 0-last of MK-1075 for pooled GT1 and GT3 genotypes. A non-compartmental analysis on MK-1075 plasma concentrations was performed where actual sampling times, converted to elapsed time relative to dosing times, by using the software Phoenix WinNonlin® Professional (Version 6.3). AUC was calculated using the linear-up/log-down trapezoidal method.</description>
