  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      hRPC is a cell therapy for retinitis pigmentosa. This is a first-in-human, dose escalation
      study in which participants with retinitis pigmentosa will receive a single subretinal
      injection of hRPC cells in one eye to evaluate safety and tolerability.

      Participants will be followed for two years to evaluate the safety and tolerability of hRPC
      Additional testing will seek to establish any preliminary efficacy from hRPC.

      This is a first-in-human open label phase I/II dose-escalation study in which participants
      with retinitis pigmentosa will receive a single uni-ocular subretinal implantation of one of
      three doses of hRPC.

      Treated eyes will be carefully monitored for any ocular or systemic adverse events for 2
      years.

      Testing will comprise a series of detailed ophthalmic examinations and imaging together with
      blood testing and systemic evaluations, as necessary.

      Ophthalmic testing will also be evaluated for any preliminary efficacy signal.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Have ability to give written informed consent as evidenced by signature on the subject
             consent form.

          3. Have clinical diagnosis of RP, based upon one or more of the following: clinical
             features, medical imaging, electrophysiological measures and genetic testing, if
             available. Genetic confirmation is not obligatory.

          4. Have Best Corrected ETDRS visual acuity of 35 letters or less (approximately 20/200 or
             worse) in the study eye for cohorts 1-5; have Best Corrected ETDRS visual acuity of 63
             letters (approximately 20/63) to 36letters (approximately 20/200) in the study eye for
