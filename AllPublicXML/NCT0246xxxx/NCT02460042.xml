  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to assess the safety and efficacy of the paclitaxel-releasing balloon
      catheter SeQuent® Please OTW to treat de novo and restenotic lesions in peripheral arteries.
      It is the intention of this trial to treat suitable target lesions with drug coated balloon
      (DCB) only.

        Inclusion Criteria (patient):

          -  Willingness to treat the target lesion according to the DCB only concept

          -  Patients in Rutherford classes 2 through 5

          -  Patients eligible for peripheral revascularization by means of Percutaneous
             Transluminal Angioplasty (PTA)

          -  Patients must be 18 years of age

          -  Patients who are mentally and linguistically able to understand the aim of the study
             and to show sufficient compliance in the following study protocol

          -  Patients must agree to undergo at least the 12-month clinical follow-up

          -  Patient is able to verbally acknowledge an understanding of the associated risks,
             benefits, and treatment alternatives to therapeutic options of this trial, e.g.
             balloon angioplasty by means of the paclitaxel-eluting PTA-balloon catheter or other
             suitable devices. Patients, by providing their informed consent, agree to these risks
             and benefits as stated in the patient informed consent document.

        Inclusion Criteria (lesion):

          -  Peripheral lesions in peripheral arteries above and below the knee with reference
             vessel diameters between 1.5 and 8.0 mm, lesion lengths ≥ 2 cm and ≤ 27 cm as
             angiographically documented*

          -  Diameter stenosis pre-procedure must be 70%

          -  Target lesion above and below the knee

          -  Vessels must have adequate runoff with at least one vessel to the foot. *Lesions
             separated by less than 2 cm are considered as one lesion

        Exclusion Criteria (all comers):

          -  Patient not suitable for revascularization by interventional means
