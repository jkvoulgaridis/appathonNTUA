      The primary objective for this study is to evaluate the safety of lebrikizumab compared with
      Topical Corticosteroids (TCS) alone in patients with persistent moderate to severe Atopic
      Dermatitis (AD) that is inadequately controlled with TCS.

    <description>During the 2-week run-in period, participants will receive topical corticosteroid creams to be self-applied two times per day to active skin lesions only. During the 12-week treatment period, lebrikizumab monotherapy will be administered by subcutaneous (SC) injection, but participants assigned to this group will not receive topical corticosteroids. During the 8-week safety follow-up period, all participants will receive topical corticosteroids to be self-applied to active skin lesions as decided by the participant and study investigator.</description>
