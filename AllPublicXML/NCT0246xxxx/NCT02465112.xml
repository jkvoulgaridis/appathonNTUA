  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TERAVECT is a phase III randomized study of patients with digestive neuroendocrine tumors
      after complete surgical resection of liver metastases treated with In111-Pentetreotide-based
      adjuvant radiotherapy.

      In this study, targeted radionuclide therapy is used at an earlier stage of the disease.The
      objective is to target residual tumor cells and/or micrometastases which escaped surgical
      resection. Given the poor prognosis associated with recurrence, this treatment should prevent
      relapse.
