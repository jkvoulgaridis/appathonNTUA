  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators want to demonstrate that a new organization with telemedicine could
      rationalize the treatment pathway of patient suffering from rare skin disease. A diagnosis
      and a personalised treatment pathway could be performed before the consultation in the
      hospital.
