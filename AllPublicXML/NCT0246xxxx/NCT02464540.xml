  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this randomized clinical trial is to evaluate the influence of luting agent,
      thickness and color of laminate veneers (LVs) and color of dental substrate on the optical
      properties of LVs.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The following date will be collected (i) the color of dental substrate obtained before and
      after dental preparation, (ii) the thickness and color of the LVs obtained before of the
      cementation procedures on white and black value background, (iii) and the final color of the
      LVs bonded to dental substrates obtained after cementation. For LVs cementation two cements
      will be used, the light-cured resin cement and the flowable composite, which will be randomly
      divided into two groups (n=31). The color of LVs will be performed with visual evaluation
      based on Vita and 3D Master scales and with a spectrophotometer Vita Easyshade (Vita
      Zahnfabrik / Bad Saeckingen, Germany) based on CIEL*a* b system. Data collected will be
      evaluated for translucency parameter (TP) and color variation (ΔE) according to luting agent,
      thickness and color of the LVs as well as color of dental substrate. Additionally, the color
      obtained with visual evaluation and with spectrophotometer will be compared to evaluate the
      level of agreement between the color observed by the operator and the color named by the
      spectrophotometer.

    <description>The color of laminate veneers will be performed with a spectrophotometer Vita Easyshade (Vita Zahnfabrik / Bad Saeckingen, Germany) based on Vita and 3D Master scales and on CIEL*a* b system. Data collected will be evaluated for translucency parameter (TP) and color difference (ΔE) according the thickness and color of the laminate veneers as well as color of dental substrate.
The acceptable threshold color difference for the CIEDE2000 method is 1.8 (Paravina et al, 2015). Greater color variation is desirable when a shade match between darker and lighter adjacent tooth substrates is required and values above the clinical thresholds for acceptability of color differences indicating lower masking ability of the material.
&quot;Level of Agreement Between the Color Observed by the Operator and the Color Named by the Spectrophotometer&quot; was included as a Primary or Secondary Outcome Measure, but data was not collected.</description>
