  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if electrical stimulation (small levels of
      electricity) can safely and effectively reduce pain following total knee replacement (or
      total knee arthroplasty (TKA)). This study involves a device called the SPRINT System. The
      SPRINT System delivers mild electrical stimulation to nerves in the leg that received the
      knee replacement. The SPRINT System includes a small wire (called a &quot;lead&quot;) that is placed
      through the skin in the upper leg. It also includes a device worn on the body that delivers
      stimulation (called the SPRINT Stimulator).

    <measure>Amount of Analgesic Usage</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 4 (Day of Surgery) and Visits 6-11 (weeks 1-6 post-Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA))</time_frame>
    <description>The amount and type of analgesics used by subjects was recorded in daily diaries. Narcotic usage was converted into a morphine equivalent dosage (MED), which is measured in units of morphine milligram equivalents (MME). Diaries were collected at various visits throughout the study, and for consistency, these data were translated into post-operative days. The average MED was calculated for each subject for the first 42 days (6 weeks) following surgery, and the median of these averages was determined across subjects.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants That Experienced at Least One Opioid-Related Side Effect</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 1 (Baseline), Visit 2 (Lead Placement), Visits 5-13 (in-hospital days through 3-months post-Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA))</time_frame>
    <description>Throughout the study, subjects were asked if they experienced any side effects related to opioid pain medications. The occurrences of these side effects were recorded and were not reported as Adverse Events. The number of subjects that experienced at least one opioid-related side effect at each visit is reported.</description>

    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline on the Western Ontario McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 1 (Baseline), Visit 5 (In-Hospital), Visit 7 (2-weeks Post-Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA)), Visit 11 (6-weeks Post-TKA), Visit 13 (3-months Post-TKA)</time_frame>
    <description>The Western Ontario McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) questionnaire consists of 24 items that evaluate pain, stiffness, and physical functional disability. Each item is scored on an 11-point numerical rating scale from 0 to 10, where higher scores indicate greater pain, stiffness, and disability. For each subject, the scores from each of the 24 items were summed to calculate the subject's total score, with a minimum score of 0 and a maximum score of 240. Percent change from baseline was calculated for each subject at each time point (i.e., value at Visit 5 vs. Baseline rating, value at Visit 7 vs. Baseline rating, value at Visit 11 vs. Baseline rating, and value at Visit 13 vs. Baseline rating). The median percent change across subjects was determined. Negative values indicate worsening since Baseline, while positive values indicate improvement from Baseline.
Percent improvement = 100 x ([rating at each study visit]-[rating at baseline]) / [rating at baseline].</description>

    <measure>Knee Pain Interference With Daily Activities</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 1 (Baseline), Visit 2 (Lead Placement), Visits 5-13 (in-hospital days through 3-months post-Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA))</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects were asked to rate the degree to which their knee pain has interfered with 7 different aspects of their daily life on a scale from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating greater interference. Those 7 scores were averaged for each subject to provide an overall pain interference score, with a possible range of 0 to 10 with higher scores indicating greater interference. The median score was then calculated across subjects.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Reporting Meaningful Improvement, Minimal or No Change, or Meaningful Worsening on the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>Visits 5-13 (in-hospital through 3-months post-Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA))</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) asks subjects to rate their improvement with treatment on a 7-point scale ranging from &quot;very much worse&quot; to &quot;very much improved&quot; as compared to before their knee replacement surgery. The subjects combine all the components of their experience into one overall score. Ratings of Much- or Very Much Improved are considered Meaningful Improvements; similarly, ratings of Much- or Very Much Worse are categorized as Meaningfully Worse.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 1 (Baseline), Visit 11 (6-weeks post-Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA)), Visit 13 (3-months post-TKA)</time_frame>
    <description>The Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) questionnaire has 13 questions that assess rumination, magnification, and helplessness. Subjects are asked to think back on painful experiences in the past and reflect on how often they had specific thoughts or feelings. Each of the 13 questions is scored on a 5-point scale where 0 represents &quot;not at all,&quot; and 4 represents &quot;all the time.&quot; The scores from each question were summed for each subject to provide a total PCS score, with a possible range from 0 to 52 with higher scores indicating a greater tendency to catastrophize pain (i.e. a higher score indicates a worse outcome). The median scores were then calculated across all subjects.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Meet Recovery Milestones up to Three Months Post-Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Day of Surgery through completion of milestone or 3-months from Day of Surgery, whichever came first</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were queried weekly from the date of their Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) until they met specific, post-surgical recovery milestones. Participants were queried up through the time at which they meet each milestone or through their completion of the study, whichever came first (up to three months post-surgery).</description>

        <title>Amount of Analgesic Usage</title>
        <description>The amount and type of analgesics used by subjects was recorded in daily diaries. Narcotic usage was converted into a morphine equivalent dosage (MED), which is measured in units of morphine milligram equivalents (MME). Diaries were collected at various visits throughout the study, and for consistency, these data were translated into post-operative days. The average MED was calculated for each subject for the first 42 days (6 weeks) following surgery, and the median of these averages was determined across subjects.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline on the Western Ontario McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC)</title>
        <description>The Western Ontario McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) questionnaire consists of 24 items that evaluate pain, stiffness, and physical functional disability. Each item is scored on an 11-point numerical rating scale from 0 to 10, where higher scores indicate greater pain, stiffness, and disability. For each subject, the scores from each of the 24 items were summed to calculate the subject's total score, with a minimum score of 0 and a maximum score of 240. Percent change from baseline was calculated for each subject at each time point (i.e., value at Visit 5 vs. Baseline rating, value at Visit 7 vs. Baseline rating, value at Visit 11 vs. Baseline rating, and value at Visit 13 vs. Baseline rating). The median percent change across subjects was determined. Negative values indicate worsening since Baseline, while positive values indicate improvement from Baseline.
Percent improvement = 100 x ([rating at each study visit]-[rating at baseline]) / [rating at baseline].</description>

        <title>Knee Pain Interference With Daily Activities</title>
        <description>Subjects were asked to rate the degree to which their knee pain has interfered with 7 different aspects of their daily life on a scale from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating greater interference. Those 7 scores were averaged for each subject to provide an overall pain interference score, with a possible range of 0 to 10 with higher scores indicating greater interference. The median score was then calculated across subjects.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Reporting Meaningful Improvement, Minimal or No Change, or Meaningful Worsening on the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) Survey</title>
        <description>The Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) asks subjects to rate their improvement with treatment on a 7-point scale ranging from &quot;very much worse&quot; to &quot;very much improved&quot; as compared to before their knee replacement surgery. The subjects combine all the components of their experience into one overall score. Ratings of Much- or Very Much Improved are considered Meaningful Improvements; similarly, ratings of Much- or Very Much Worse are categorized as Meaningfully Worse.</description>

        <title>Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS)</title>
        <description>The Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) questionnaire has 13 questions that assess rumination, magnification, and helplessness. Subjects are asked to think back on painful experiences in the past and reflect on how often they had specific thoughts or feelings. Each of the 13 questions is scored on a 5-point scale where 0 represents &quot;not at all,&quot; and 4 represents &quot;all the time.&quot; The scores from each question were summed for each subject to provide a total PCS score, with a possible range from 0 to 52 with higher scores indicating a greater tendency to catastrophize pain (i.e. a higher score indicates a worse outcome). The median scores were then calculated across all subjects.</description>
