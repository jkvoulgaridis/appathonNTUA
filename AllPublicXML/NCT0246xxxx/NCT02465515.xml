  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Albiglutide is an analogue of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), used to treat type 2 diabetes
      This study will test whether albiglutide affects the occurrence of major cardiovascular
      events such as heart attacks or strokes and other important medical outcomes in persons with
      type 2 diabetes, when used alone or added to other diabetes treatments.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Treatment Related Impact Measures-Diabetes (TRIM-D) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Months 8 and 16</time_frame>
    <description>The TRIM-D is a 28 item treatment satisfaction measure with 5 domains assessing Treatment Burden, Daily Life, Diabetes Management, Compliance and Psychological Health. The raw score ranges for each subscale were: treatment burden (6 to 30), daily life (5 to 25), diabetes management (5 to 25), compliance (4 to 20) and psychological health (8 to 40), higher scores indicating better health state. Total raw score was determined by summing the raw scores for each of the subscales and the total score (transformed) was determined as [(raw score minus lowest possible raw score)/possible raw score range] x100. The possible total (transformed) score range is 0−100, where higher scores indicated better health state. Baseline is the last non-missing value assessed on or before treatment start date. Change from Baseline is the value at specified time point minus the Baseline value.</description>

    <description>The EQ-5D is a standardized instrument used to evaluate generic health-related quality of life, comprising 5 domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. It provides a simple descriptive profile and a single index value for health status. The EQ-5D self-reported questionnaire includes a visual analog scale (VAS), which records the respondent's self-rated health status on a graduated (0-100) scale, where 0 represents the worst imaginable health state and 100 represents the best imaginable health state. Baseline is the last non-missing value assessed on or before treatment start date. Change from Baseline is the value at specified time point minus the Baseline value.</description>

          <title>Time to Initiation of Prandial Insulin in Those Participants on Basal Insulin at Study Start</title>
          <description>Time to initiation of prandial insulin in those participants on basal insulin at study start was analyzed using a Cox Proportional Hazards regression model with treatment group as the only covariate. The incidence rate per 100 person years (100*number of participants with at least 1 event)/first event person-years) is presented along with 95% confidence interval. First event person-years=(cumulative total time to first event for participants who have the event+cumulative total of censored time for participants without the event)/365.25, based on the on-therapy and post-therapy AE time period. The analysis was performed on Basal Insulin Population which comprised of participants in the ITT Population who were on basal insulin but not on other insulin at Baseline (i.e., will not include a participant on a mixed insulin or on a prandial-only insulin).</description>

Time to first occurrence of a clinically important microvascular event was analyzed using a Cox Proportional Hazards regression model with treatment group as the only covariate. The incidence rate per 100 person years (100*number of participants with at least 1 event)/first event person-years) is presented along with 95% confidence interval.

          <description>Change from Baseline in HbA1c was analyzed using mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) including observed case data (does not impute any missing data). Baseline is the last non-missing value assessed on or before treatment start date. Change from Baseline is the value at specified time point minus the Baseline value. Change from Baseline in HbA1c using Baseline data from Local or Central Laboratory, and post-Baseline Central Laboratory data is presented.</description>

        <description>The TRIM-D is a 28 item treatment satisfaction measure with 5 domains assessing Treatment Burden, Daily Life, Diabetes Management, Compliance and Psychological Health. The raw score ranges for each subscale were: treatment burden (6 to 30), daily life (5 to 25), diabetes management (5 to 25), compliance (4 to 20) and psychological health (8 to 40), higher scores indicating better health state. Total raw score was determined by summing the raw scores for each of the subscales and the total score (transformed) was determined as [(raw score minus lowest possible raw score)/possible raw score range] x100. The possible total (transformed) score range is 0−100, where higher scores indicated better health state. Baseline is the last non-missing value assessed on or before treatment start date. Change from Baseline is the value at specified time point minus the Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in EuroQol- 5 Dimension (EQ-5D) Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) Score</title>
        <description>The EQ-5D is a standardized instrument used to evaluate generic health-related quality of life, comprising 5 domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. It provides a simple descriptive profile and a single index value for health status. The EQ-5D self-reported questionnaire includes a visual analog scale (VAS), which records the respondent's self-rated health status on a graduated (0-100) scale, where 0 represents the worst imaginable health state and 100 represents the best imaginable health state. Baseline is the last non-missing value assessed on or before treatment start date. Change from Baseline is the value at specified time point minus the Baseline value.</description>
