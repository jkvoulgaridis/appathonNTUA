  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Vitality HealthyFood benefit is a three-tiered incentive program designed to encourage
      healthier food choices amongst members of Discovery Health's Vitality program. Once enrolled
      in the benefit, participating members can receive 10%, 15%, or 25% cash-back on the healthy
      foods they purchase at selected grocers. And, while overall enrollment in the program is
      high, there is particular interest in increasing enrollment in the benefit amongst Vitality
      members with diabetes. One presumed barrier to enrollment in the benefit amongst members with
      diabetes is a misperception of the particular relevance of the benefit and healthier food
      choices for their personal health. Improved messaging regarding the HealthyFood benefit and
      its particular salience for individuals with diabetes may be an effective means of increasing
      activation of the benefit in this population. The proposed study will be a collaboration
      between Discovery Health/Vitality and researchers at the Perelman School of Medicine at the
      University of Pennsylvania. In the proposed RCT, Vitality members with diabetes will be
      randomised to different types of messages regarding the HealthyFood benefit. The
      investigators will then compare the effectiveness of these different messaging strategies at
      increasing activation of the HealthyFood benefit amongst Vitality members with diabetes.

    <participant_flow>
      <pre_assignment_details>5467 individuals were eligible in 1/2015. This sample was identified months before randomization to allow individuals time to learn about HF from other sources and enrol if interested. Prior to randomization, we excluded participants who joined HF of left Vitality since identification. This is why the initial and randomized samples are unequal.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>This group will receive a message that includes a quote from the perspective of a Vitality member with diabetes who uses the HealthyFood benefit. Given the need to standardise message content across study arms, the quote was written by the study team and not an actual member. The quote emphasizes the positive impact the benefit has had for the memberâ€”both the financial benefit, as well as the two specific diabetes health benefits.
