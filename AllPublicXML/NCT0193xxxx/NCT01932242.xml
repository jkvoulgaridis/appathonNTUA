      A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, study in 70 healthy adult subjects. The total
      duration of the study for each subject will be approximately 220 days divided as follows:

        -  Screening: Days -28 to -2

        -  Three In-Unit Stays: Days -1 to 2; Days 13 to 15; and Days 119 to 121

        -  Out-of-Unit Visit Days: Day 8 (±2 days); Day 28 (±3 days); Day 43 (±3 days); Day 71 (±3
           days); Day 85 (±3 days); Day 128 (±3 days); Day 134 (±3 days); Day 149 (±3 days); and
           Day 163 (±3 days)

        -  Final Visit: Day 191 (±3 days)

      Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the following two treatment sequences:

        -  Sequence A: ETI-204 on Days 1 and 14 and placebo on Day 120

        -  Sequence B: ETI-204 on Days 1 and 120 and placebo on Day 14

      Subjects who qualify for entry into the study following completion of the Screening visit
      will arrive at the clinical research unit (CRU) on Day -1. The next day, Day 1, qualified
      subjects will be randomized and will receive a single IV dose of ETI-204. Subjects will be
      pretreated with 50 mg oral diphenhydramine approximately 30 minutes prior to the start of the
      study drug infusion.

      Subjects will be discharged from the CRU on Day 2, and will return to the CRU for an
      additional visit on Day 8.

      Subjects will return to the CRU on Day 13 for their second in-unit stay. The next day, Day
      14, subjects will be pretreated with 50 mg oral diphenhydramine and will receive study drug
      according to their randomized treatment assignment. Subjects will be discharged on Day 15 and
      will return to the CRU for four additional visits on Days 28 (±3 days), 43 (±3 days), 71 (±3
      days), and 85 (±3 days).

      Subjects will return to the CRU again on Day 119 for their third in-unit stay. On Day 120,
      subjects will be pretreated with 50 mg oral diphenhydramine and will receive study drug
      (either ETI 204 or placebo) according to their randomized treatment assignment. Subjects will
      be discharged on Day 121 and will return to the CRU for five additional visits on Days
      128,134, 149, 163, and 191.

      The first 20 subjects randomized and treated in the study will be dosed in groups of no more
      than 4 subjects/day. For the first 8 subjects, dosing of individual subjects on Day 14 and
      Day 120 will be separated by 30-60 minutes for safety monitoring. If no severe infusion
      reactions occur in any of the first 8 subjects at the time of the second dose, staggered
      dosing is not required for the remaining subjects receiving their second dose. Similarly, if
      no severe infusion reactions occur in any of the first 8 subjects at the time of the third
      dose, staggered dosing is not required for the remaining subjects receiving their third dose.

      Enrollment of additional subjects will be paused until the first 20 subjects have received
      their second dose of study drug and a blinded review of the available clinical and laboratory
      AE data up to and including Day 15 is completed for the first 20 subjects. This review will
      be conducted by the Investigator in conjunction with the Clinical Trial Steering Committee
      and will focus on the possible development of new or more severe AEs with the Day 14 dose. If
      the outcome of this review is satisfactory, dosing of additional subjects will be permitted
      to continue in groups larger than 4 subjects. In the event that significant AEs are observed
      and unblinding should become necessary, it will be performed by an independent statistician
      who is not involved with the conduct of the study.

      A second blinded safety review will be completed at least two weeks before any subject
      receives the third dose of study drug, (i.e. before any subject is dosed on Day 120). The
      Investigator in conjunction with the Clinical Trial Steering Committee will review all AEs
      seen to date in the study. This review will focus on AE data seen in association with the
      second infusion (Day14). If the outcome of this review is satisfactory, subjects may receive
      their third dose of study drug.

      A third blinded safety review will be conducted after the initial cohort of 20 subjects has
      completed Day 121. No additional subjects should receive a third dose of study medication
      until the Investigator along with the Clinical Trial Steering Committee has completed a
      blinded safety review of the Day 120 and 121 clinical and laboratory AE data. This review
      will focus on the development of new or more severe AEs seen with repeat dosing. If the
      outcome of this review is satisfactory, the remaining subjects may receive their third dose
      of study drug.

      In the event that significant AEs are observed and unblinding becomes necessary it will be
      performed by an independent statistician who is not involved with the conduct of the study.

All 70 subjects who received ETI-204 were included in the PK population: 35 in Sequence A and 35 in Sequence B; however, the full complement of PK parameters could not be determined in all subjects.</description>

    <description>Serum anti-ETI-204 antibody titers were determined for all subjects in the safety population. Blood samples were collected and serum samples were assayed at an initial dilution of 1:10. Samples that were positive at the 1:10 dilution were serially diluted 1:2 and assayed until a negative result was attained. The titer of the most dilute sample yielding a positive result was recorded as the titer for that time point. Immunogenicity was measured by the number of participants in each study arm with anti-ETI-204 antibody values post-treatment ≥ 4-times higher than baseline at Day 8, 43 or 71, or if the titer was negative at baseline, the post-treatment sample(s) required a titer of at least 1:20 for it to be considered positive.</description>

        <title>Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration of ETI-204 (Cmax) After a Dose of 16 mg/kg on Day 1(Sequence B) or Two Doses on Days 1 and 14 (Sequence A)</title>
        <description>Blood samples were obtained and serum concentrations were determined using a validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method with an assay range of 100 ng/mL to 5000 ng/mL.The PK parameter, Cmax, was derived from ETI-204 serum concentrations by sequence group and treatment period for the PK analysis population.
Sequence A - there were insufficient serum concentration data to adequately characterize ETI 204 PK separately after each dose administration (Day 1 and Day 14), therefore it was treated as one 32 mg/kg dose split into two 16 mg/kg administrations. Sequence B was treated as 2 separate 16 mg/kg doses (Day 1 and Day 120).
All 70 subjects who received ETI-204 were included in the PK population: 35 in Sequence A and 35 in Sequence B; however, the full complement of PK parameters could not be determined in all subjects.</description>
        <time_frame>On Days 1 and 14 predose, at the end of infusion, and 3 and 8 hours after the start of infusion, and on Days 2, 8, 15, 28, 43, 71, 85, 121, 128, 134, 149, 163, and 191.</time_frame>
        <population>One subject in Sequence A was prematurely discontinued from the study by the investigator after the 1st dose of ETI-204 because of AEs. This subject did not receive the 2nd dose of ETI-204 on Day 14 and therefore all PK parameters from this subject were excluded from descriptive statistics.</population>

          <title>Time to Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration of ETI-204 (Tmax) After a Dose of 16 mg/kg on Day 1(Sequence B) or Two Doses on Days 1 and 14 (Sequence A)</title>
          <description>Blood samples were obtained and serum concentrations were determined using a validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method with an assay range of 100 ng/mL to 5000 ng/mL.The PK parameter, Tmax, was derived from ETI-204 serum concentrations by sequence group and treatment period for the PK analysis population. Sequence A - there were insufficient serum concentration data to adequately characterize ETI 204 PK separately after each dose administration (Day 1 and Day 14), therefore it was treated as one 32 mg/kg dose split into two 16 mg/kg administrations. Sequence B was treated as 2 separate 16 mg/kg doses (Day 1 and Day 120). All 70 subjects who received ETI-204 were included in the PK population: 35 in Sequence A and 35 in Sequence B; however, the full complement of PK parameters could not be determined in all subjects.</description>
          <population>One subject in Sequence A was prematurely discontinued from the study by the investigator afte the 1st dose of ETI-204 because of AEs. This subject did not receive the 2nd dose of ETI-204 on Day 14 and therefore all PK parameters from this subject were excluded from descriptive statistics.</population>

          <title>Area Under the Concentration-Time Curve From Time Zero to 120 Days (AUC0-120days) After a Dose of 16 mg/kg ETI-204 on Day 1 (Sequence B)</title>
          <description>Blood samples were obtained and serum concentrations were determined using a validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method with an assay range of 100 ng/mL to 5000 ng/mL.
Sequence A - there were insufficient serum concentration data to adequately characterize ETI 204 PK separately after each dose administration (Day 1 and Day 14), therefore it was treated as one 32 mg/kg dose split into two 16 mg/kg administrations. Sequence B was treated as 2 separate 16 mg/kg doses (Day 1 and Day 120). All 70 subjects who received ETI-204 were included in the PK population: 35 in Sequence A and 35 in Sequence B; however, the full complement of PK parameters could not be determined in all subjects.</description>
          <population>One subjects in Sequence B was missing the final 3 or more scheduled samples (subject withdrew from the study on Day 8 due to conflict with work schedule) and therefore AUC and lamda z-based parameters were not reported. AUC0-120days was not calculated for Sequence A.</population>

          <description>Blood samples were obtained and serum concentrations were determined using a validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method with an assay range of 100 ng/mL to 5000 ng/mL.
Sequence A - there were insufficient serum concentration data to adequately characterize ETI 204 PK separately after each dose administration (Day 1 and Day 14), therefore it was treated as one 32 mg/kg dose split into two 16 mg/kg administrations. Sequence B was treated as 2 separate 16 mg/kg doses (Day 1 and Day 120). All 70 subjects who received ETI-204 were included in the PK population: 35 in Sequence A and 35 in Sequence B; however, the full complement of PK parameters could not be determined in all subjects.</description>
          <population>PK parameters for 1 subject in Sequence A were excluded because the subject was discontinued after the1st dose of ETI-204 because of AEs and did not receive the 2nd dose. 2 subjects in Sequence A and 1 subject in Sequence B were missing the final 3 or more scheduled samples and therefore AUC and lambda z-based parameters were not reported.</population>

Sequence A - there were insufficient serum concentration data to adequately characterize ETI 204 PK separately after each dose administration (Day 1 and Day 14), therefore it was treated as one 32 mg/kg dose split into two 16 mg/kg administrations. Sequence B was treated as 2 separate 16 mg/kg doses (Day 1 and Day 120). All 70 subjects who received ETI-204 were included in the PK population: 35 in Sequence A and 35 in Sequence B; however, the full complement of PK parameters could not be determined in all subjects.</description>
          <population>4 subjects in Sequence B were excluded because they did not receive the 2nd dose of ETI-204 on Day 120. For 4 subjects in Sequence B the AUC and lambda z-based parameters were excluded from descriptive statistics for Day 120 (1 for missing the final 3 or more scheduled samples, 3 because the t1/2 values were &gt;50% of the sample collection interval).</population>

        <title>Number of Participants With Anti-ETI-204 Antibodies</title>
        <description>Serum anti-ETI-204 antibody titers were determined for all subjects in the safety population. Blood samples were collected and serum samples were assayed at an initial dilution of 1:10. Samples that were positive at the 1:10 dilution were serially diluted 1:2 and assayed until a negative result was attained. The titer of the most dilute sample yielding a positive result was recorded as the titer for that time point. Immunogenicity was measured by the number of participants in each study arm with anti-ETI-204 antibody values post-treatment ≥ 4-times higher than baseline at Day 8, 43 or 71, or if the titer was negative at baseline, the post-treatment sample(s) required a titer of at least 1:20 for it to be considered positive.</description>
