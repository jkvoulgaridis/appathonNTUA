      The primary purpose of this study is to determine the interrater reliability and validity of
      the Sportcord Test as a measure of physical performance following anterior cruciate ligament
      (ACL) reconstruction. A secondary purpose is to systematically track subjective and objective
      outcomes on patients following ACL reconstruction to help identify differences between those
      who have subsequent knee problems and those who do not. The study hypotheses are the
      following:

      1) The Sportcord Test will provide a valid and reliable measure of functional performance
      following ACL reconstruction. 2) Patients who have subsequent knee problems in the 12 month
      study period will exhibit different scores on clinical special tests compared to those who do
      not.
