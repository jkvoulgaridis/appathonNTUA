      The purpose of this study is to qualify the biomarker risk algorithm for prognosis of the
      risk of developing Mild Cognitive Impairment due to Alzheimer's Disease (MCI-AD), and also to
      evaluate the efficacy of pioglitazone compared with placebo to delay the onset of MCI-AD in
      cognitively-normal participants who are at high-risk for developing MCI within 5 years.

      This study has two goals. One of these goals is to see if a new genetic test can determine if
      participants are at risk of developing Mild Cognitive Impairment due to Alzheimer's Disease
      (MCI-AD) within the next five years. The other goal is to evaluate the study drug called
      pioglitazone. Pioglitazone is being tested to delay the onset of MCI-AD. This study will look
      at the effectiveness of pioglitazone in delaying the onset of MCI-AD in cognitively-normal
      people who are at high-risk of developing MCI-AD, as identified by the biomarker in the
      non-Hispanic/Latino Caucasian participants.

      This multi-centre trial will be conducted worldwide. The study will enroll approximately 3500
      subjects. Participants will be assigned to high or low risk groups for developing MCI- AD
      within the next five years, based on the results of the biomarker risk algorithm.
      Participants in the high risk group will be randomly assigned to one of the two treatment
      groups—which will remain unknown to the participant and study doctor during the study (unless
      there is an urgent medical need):

        -  Pioglitazone tablet

        -  Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a tablet that looks like the study drug but has
           no active ingredient.

      Participants in the low risk group will be assigned to placebo. The assignment of each
      participant to the high or low risk group, as well as the participant's treatment assignment,
      will remain undisclosed to the participants and study doctor during the study (unless there
      is an urgent medical need).

      All participants will be asked to take one tablet at the same time each day throughout the
      study.

      The overall time to participate in this study is approximately 5 years. Participants will
      make up to 14 visits to the clinic, and will be contacted by telephone 3 months after each
      treatment visit for a follow-up assessment, and 2 weeks after the final visit.

    <description>The event definition for MCI-AD was the time in days from the randomization date to the date of the first of two consecutive scheduled visits at which a participant was assessed with a diagnosis of MCI due to AD confirmed by adjudication committee. Here, the time to event was reported as the restricted mean survival time. The restricted mean survival time was defined as the area under the curve of the survival function up to the largest event time.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline for Cognitive Decline on Composite Score on the Cognitive Test Battery for Pioglitazone-treated Participants Versus Placebo-treated Participants in the High-risk Stratum</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 48</time_frame>
    <description>Composite scores derived from the test battery. Domains of Episodic Memory [California Verbal Learning Test-2nd Edition (CVLT-II), Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised (BVMT-R)]; Executive Function [Trail Making Test (TMT) (Part B), Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS)-III Digit Span Test-backwards span]; Language [Multilingual Naming Test (MiNT), Semantic Fluency (animals), Lexical/phonemic fluency (F, A, and S in English; D, S, and F in German)]; and Attention [WAIS-III Digit Span Test-forward span, TMT (Part A)] used for composite score. 12 measures were derived from 8 neuropsychological tests. CVLT-II test involved 2 primary measures (short, long delay recall); BVMT-R had 2 measures (copy and recall); Digit Span and Trail both had 2 measures (forward and backward span and Parts A and B). There was 1 total score for each test: CDT, MINT, semantic and lexical fluency. Total score ranged from -1.222 to 1.707 at baseline, a higher composite score indicated better cognition.</description>

    <description>The ADCS ADL-PI is a functional measure that was specifically designed for standardized administration over long duration clinical studies to prevent AD. The ADCS ADL-PI is a 20-item instrument that included 15 ADL questions, which were scored as 1 (with a lot of difficulty), 2 (with some difficulty), or 3 (as well as usually, with no difficulty), plus 5 vision, hearing, and mobility questions, which were scored from 0 (no) to 1 (yes). ADL Total ranged from 0 to 45, and lower scores indicated greater disability.</description>

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available for all interventional studies after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received (or program is completely terminated), an opportunity for the primary publication of the research and final report development has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>

Here, the time to event was reported as the restricted mean survival time. The restricted mean survival time was defined as the area under the curve of the survival function up to the largest event time.</description>

        <title>Time to Diagnosis of MCI Due to AD for Pioglitazone-treated, High-risk, Non-Hispanic/Latino Caucasian Participants Versus Placebo-treated, High-risk, Non-Hispanic/Latino, Caucasian Participants</title>
        <description>The event definition for MCI-AD was the time in days from the randomization date to the date of the first of two consecutive scheduled visits at which a participant was assessed with a diagnosis of MCI due to AD confirmed by adjudication committee. Here, the time to event was reported as the restricted mean survival time. The restricted mean survival time was defined as the area under the curve of the survival function up to the largest event time.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline to the end of study (approximately up to 5 years)</time_frame>
        <population>FAS included all participants who were randomized, received at least 1 dose of study drug, and at least 1 valid postbaseline value for assessment of primary efficacy. A participant who does not have an event of MCI due to AD was censored at the date of the last visit at which MCI due to AD could have been assessed.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline for Cognitive Decline on Composite Score on the Cognitive Test Battery for Pioglitazone-treated Participants Versus Placebo-treated Participants in the High-risk Stratum</title>
        <description>Composite scores derived from the test battery. Domains of Episodic Memory [California Verbal Learning Test-2nd Edition (CVLT-II), Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised (BVMT-R)]; Executive Function [Trail Making Test (TMT) (Part B), Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS)-III Digit Span Test-backwards span]; Language [Multilingual Naming Test (MiNT), Semantic Fluency (animals), Lexical/phonemic fluency (F, A, and S in English; D, S, and F in German)]; and Attention [WAIS-III Digit Span Test-forward span, TMT (Part A)] used for composite score. 12 measures were derived from 8 neuropsychological tests. CVLT-II test involved 2 primary measures (short, long delay recall); BVMT-R had 2 measures (copy and recall); Digit Span and Trail both had 2 measures (forward and backward span and Parts A and B). There was 1 total score for each test: CDT, MINT, semantic and lexical fluency. Total score ranged from -1.222 to 1.707 at baseline, a higher composite score indicated better cognition.</description>
