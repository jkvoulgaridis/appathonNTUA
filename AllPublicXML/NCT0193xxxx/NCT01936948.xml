  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effectiveness of colonoscopy in reducing colorectal cancer mortality relies on the
      detection and removal of neoplastic polyps. Because the risk of prevalent cancer and of
      transition to cancer increases with polyp size, effective and safe resection of large polyps
      is particularly important. Large polyps ≥20mm are removed by so-called endoscopic mucosal
      resection (EMR) using electrocautery snares. Resection of these large polyps is associated
      with a risk of severe complications that may require hospitalization and additional
      interventions. The most common risk is delayed bleeding which is observed in approximately
      2-9% of patients. A recent retrospective study suggests that closure of the large mucosal
      defect after resection may decrease the risk of delayed bleeding. However, significant
      uncertainty remains about the polypectomy techniques to optimizing resection and minimizing
      risk. Important aspects that may affect risk include clipping of the mucosal defect and
      electrocautery setting.

      Aim 1. The primary aim of the study is to compare the rate of delayed bleeding complications
      in patients undergoing endoscopic resection of large polyps between:

        -  A) Closing the mucosal defect after resection (Clip group) and

        -  B) Not closing the mucosal defect after resection (No clip group).

      Aim 2. The secondary aim of the study is to compare the rate of overall complications in
      patients undergoing endoscopic resection of large polyps between two cautery settings:

        -  A) Low power coagulation and

        -  B) Endocut.

    <description>A bleeding event that occurred within 30 days after completion of the colonoscopy with a study polyp resection and is associated with a decrease in hemoglobin by at least 2gm, hemodynamic instability, presentation to the ED, need for hospitalization, repeat colonoscopy, or other interventions.</description>

    <description>Overall complications are defined as an aggregate of all complications that occur at the time of the procedure (immediate complications) or during 30 days of follow-up. They include delayed bleeding complications, perforation, postpolypectomy syndrome, and clinical events that require an ED visit, admission to the hospital, additional testing or an intervention.</description>

    <description>Patients will be randomized to either closing the mucosal defect after polyp removal or not closing the mucosal defect using clips (main intervention and comparison). The resection margins will be approximated using clips. Complete closure is defined as approximated margins with less than 1cm gap between clips. All patients will further be randomized to two different settings of electrocautery (EndoCut or Coagulation) to standardize otherwise variable electrocautery practice, and for explorative analysis.</description>
