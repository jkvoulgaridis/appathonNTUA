    <textblock>
      Prospective, multicenter, continued access registry of the MitraClip® Cardiovascular Valve
      Repair System in the treatment of mitral valve regurgitation. Patients will undergo 30-day,
      6-month, 12-month, 36-month and 60-month clinical follow-up. The study consists of two arms:
      a High Risk group (NCT01940120) and a Non-High Risk group (NCT00209274) . Patients that did
      not meet REALISM High Risk or Non-High Risk eligibility criteria were evaluated for
      consideration for either Emergency Use (EU) or Compassionate Use (CU).

      The EVEREST II REALISM study (REALISM study) is a continued access registry designed for
      continued data collection on the use of Abbott Vascular's MitraClip System (MitraClip®
      Device) under more &quot;real world&quot; conditions. After the completion of enrollment in the pivotal
      EVEREST II Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) NCT00209274 and EVEREST II High Risk Registry
      Study NCT01940120, continued access to the technology was warranted to collect additional
      safety and effectiveness data on the MitraClip® Device. This continued access study was
      approved by FDA on November 21, 2008 (G030064). There are two arms (High Risk and Non-High
      Risk) in the REALISM study. Patients that did not meet REALISM High Risk or Non-High Risk
      eligibility criteria were evaluated for consideration for either Emergency Use (EU) or
      Compassionate Use (CU). Enrollment in the Non-High Risk arm of the study concluded on April
      14, 2011 and enrollment in the High Risk arm concluded on December 19, 2013.

      REALISM is a prospective, multi-center, study of the safety and effectiveness of an
      endovascular approach to the treatment of mitral valve regurgitation using the Evalve
      Cardiovascular Valve Repair System (MitraClip® implant). Patients with moderate-to-severe
      (3+) or severe (4+) mitral regurgitation (MR), as determined by the site from a transthoracic
      echocardiogram (TTE), were considered for enrollment in this study. The TTE and a
      transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) are used to assess eligibility criteria for MR severity,
      valve anatomy and left ventricular parameters.

    <measure>36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) Quality of Life Change From Baseline to 30 Days</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 is a multidimensional, patient-reported survey containing 36 questions on a 0-100 scale measuring physical (Physical Component Score PCS) &amp; mental health status (Mental Component Score MCS) in relation to 8 health concepts:
Physical functioning
Role limitations due to physical or
Emotional health
Bodily pain
General health perceptions
Vitality
Social functioning
General mental health
Responses to each of the SF-36 items are scored and expressed as a score on a 0-100 scale (0% in a domain represents the poorest possible QOL&amp;100% indicates full QOL).Higher scores represent better self-perceived health.
The physical &amp; mental functions were assessed by the Physical Component Summary (PCS) score &amp; Mental Component Summary (MCS) score. Normal PCS and MCS scores vary depending on the demographics of the population studied. The PCS&amp;MCS norms for 65-75 year old are 44 &amp; 52, respectively while the norms for CHF population are 31 &amp; 46, respectively.</description>

A total of 628 patients in the High Risk arm between January 22, 2009 and December 19, 2013 and 271 patients in the Non-High Risk arm were enrolled between January 22, 2009 and April 14, 2011.</recruitment_details>

          <description>Patients that did not meet REALISM High Risk or Non-High Risk eligibility criteria were evaluated for consideration for either Emergency Use (EU) or Compassionate Use (CU). The objective of the Compassionate and Emergency Use Group of the EVEREST II REALISM study is to provide access to the MitraClip Device, in a non-commercial setting, for patients with serious or life-threatening conditions when conventional therapies have failed, are unsuitable, or unavailable. The patients who are enrolled in this arm will undergo percutaneous mitral valve repair using MitraClip® implant.</description>

          <description>Patients that did not meet REALISM High Risk or Non-High Risk eligibility criteria were evaluated for consideration for either Emergency Use (EU) or Compassionate Use (CU). The objective of the Compassionate and Emergency Use Group of the EVEREST II REALISM study is to provide access to the MitraClip Device, in a non-commercial setting, for patients with serious or life-threatening conditions when conventional therapies have failed, are unsuitable, or unavailable. All EU patients had a medical condition that in the opinion of the investigators was likely to result in death within 30 days. The patients who are enrolled in this arm will undergo percutaneous mitral valve repair using MitraClip® implant.</description>

          <title>High Risk</title>
          <description>Includes patients with a predicted procedural mortality risk calculated using the Society For Thoracic Surgeon (STS) surgical risk calculator of ≥12% or, in the judgment of a cardiac surgeon, the patient is considered a high risk surgical candidate due to the presence of pre-defined risk factors. The patients who are enrolled in this arm will undergo percutaneous mitral valve repair using MitraClip® implant.</description>

          <title>Non-high Risk</title>
          <description>Includes patients who are candidate for mitral valve repair or replacement surgery, including cardiopulmonary bypass (i.e. non-high risk).
If a patient was not a candidate for the high risk arm, but met all other eligibility criteria for the non-high risk arm, the patient was enrolled into the non-high risk arm of EVEREST II REALISM.

          <description>Patients that did not meet REALISM High Risk or Non-High Risk eligibility criteria were evaluated for consideration for either Emergency Use (EU) or Compassionate Use (CU). The objective of the Compassionate and Emergency Use Group of the EVEREST II REALISM study is to provide access to the MitraClip Device, in a non-commercial setting, for patients with serious or life-threatening conditions when conventional therapies have failed, are unsuitable, or unavailable. The patients who are enrolled in this arm will undergo percutaneous mitral valve repair using MitraClip® implant.</description>

The objective of the Compassionate and Emergency Use Group of the EVEREST II REALISM study is to provide access to the MitraClip Device, in a non-commercial setting, for patients with serious or life-threatening conditions when conventional therapies have failed, are unsuitable, or unavailable. All EU patients had a medical condition that in the opinion of the investigators was likely to result in death within 30 days.

          <description>Paired NYHA data from baseline to 5 years. Class I: Patients with cardiac disease but without resulting limitations of physical activity.
Class II: Patients with cardiac disease resulting in slight limitation of physical activity. Patients are comfortable at rest. Ordinary physical activity results in fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea, or anginal pain.
Class III: Patients with cardiac disease resulting in marked limitation of physical activity. They are comfortable at rest. Less than ordinary physical activity causes fatigue, palpitation dyspnea, or anginal pain.
Class IV: Patients with cardiac disease resulting in inability to carry on any physical activity without discomfort. Symptoms of cardiac insufficiency or of the anginal syndrome may be present even at rest. If any physical activity is undertaken, discomfort is increased.</description>

        <description>The SF-36 is a multidimensional, patient-reported survey containing 36 questions on a 0-100 scale measuring physical (Physical Component Score PCS) &amp; mental health status (Mental Component Score MCS) in relation to 8 health concepts:
Physical functioning
Role limitations due to physical or
Emotional health
Bodily pain
General health perceptions
Vitality
Social functioning
General mental health
Responses to each of the SF-36 items are scored and expressed as a score on a 0-100 scale (0% in a domain represents the poorest possible QOL&amp;100% indicates full QOL).Higher scores represent better self-perceived health.
The physical &amp; mental functions were assessed by the Physical Component Summary (PCS) score &amp; Mental Component Summary (MCS) score. Normal PCS and MCS scores vary depending on the demographics of the population studied. The PCS&amp;MCS norms for 65-75 year old are 44 &amp; 52, respectively while the norms for CHF population are 31 &amp; 46, respectively.</description>
