  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether individual and/ group based
      neuropsychological rehabilitation focused on psychoeducation and teaching compensatory
      strategies has positive effects on the psychosocial wellbeing and perceived cognitive
      deficits in dyslexic young adults. The hypothesis is that both individual and group based
      neuropsychological rehabilitation show positive effects on the psychosocial wellbeing and
      perceived cognitive deficits. Another purpose of this study is to evaluate weather individual
      and group based neuropsychological rehabilitation have different kind of effects on the
      wellbeing of the participants and weather either one of the rehabilitation formats is more
      effective than the other.

      Background: Untreated dyslexia causes problems for individuals in studies, work and
      employment. High quality research on the best and most cost-effective rehabilitation methods
      is needed.

      Objective: To study whether neuropsychological rehabilitation improves the psychosocial
      wellbeing and perceived cognitive deficits in dyslexic young adults and to evaluate potential
      differences between individual and group based neuropsychological rehabilitation.

      Methods: Altogether 120 young adults diagnosed with dyslexia are randomized either to one of
      the intervention groups (individual neuropsychological rehabilitation / group
      neuropsychological rehabilitation) or to a control group which will receive either one of the
      interventions after a 5 month waiting period. All the study subjects are assessed with a
      short neuropsychological test battery as well as self-rating questionnaires evaluating mood,
      QoL, perceived cognitive deficits, and the impact of the learning disability at baseline,
      after five months (immediately after interventions or control period) and after 10 months.
      After 20 months a shorter follow-up using only self-ratings will be done via mail. Subjects
      in the intervention groups are offered neuropsychological rehabilitation in 12 sessions
      conducted once a week or once in two weeks during five months. Subjects in the control group
      do not receive any intervention for the first five months.

      Results: The effects of interventions on psychosocial wellbeing and perceived cognitive
      deficits are evaluated using appropriate statistical procedures and comparing the differences
      between the interventions groups and the control group.

      The present status: All the interventions are completed, follow-up data is still beeing
      collected

  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Verbal fluency and executive control</measure>
    <time_frame>5 months</time_frame>
    <description>These cognitive skills are measured using verbal fluency with category switching, Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System; D-KEFS. The score is the total number of correct words generated by the participant within the one-minute time-limit. The range for points is from 0 to as many words as can be generated by the rules within one minute. More points equals a better result.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Goal achievement</measure>
    <time_frame>5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Goal achievement is measures using Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS). The attained goals set at the beginning of the intervention and measured on a scale from -2 to +2 at the end of the intervention. The score is based on a discussion with the therapist and the participant. A score below zero means that the set goal has not been reached. A score of 0 means that the goal has been reached and scores above 0 mean that the goal was reached over expectations.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life: QOLIBRI-OS</measure>
    <time_frame>5 months</time_frame>
    <description>The effects of rehabilitation on quality of life are measured using the Quality of Life after Brain Injury Overall Scale (QOLIBRI-OS). The score ranges from 6-30. More points equals a better quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mood</measure>
    <time_frame>5 months</time_frame>
    <description>The effects of rehabilitation on mood are measured using Profile of Mood States (POMS). The Finnish version contains 38 questions and the total score ranges from 0 to 152. Less points means a better situation for mood.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Social and cognitive behavioral strategies</measure>
    <time_frame>5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Strategy and Attribution Questionnaire (SAQ) bref consists of 20 questions using a 7-point-scale (from 1 = &quot;strongly disagree&quot; to 7 = &quot;strongly agree&quot;) to assess social and cognitive behavioral strategies.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Processing speed and attention</measure>
    <time_frame>5 months</time_frame>
    <description>These cognitive skills are measured using Symbol Digit Modalities test. The score ranges from 0 to 110. More points equals a better result.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Verbal learning</measure>
    <time_frame>5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Verbal learning is measured using Word lists subtest (Wechsler Memory Test-III, WMS-III). The total score is between 0 - 48. More points equals a better result.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Reading comprehension</measure>
    <time_frame>5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Reading comprehension is measured using V3, a part of a Finnish Ability Test Battery, &quot;Kykytestist√∂ AVO-9&quot;. The score ranges fron 0 to 20. More points equals a better result.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual fluency and executive control</measure>

The score is the total number of correct drawings produced within a minute added togehter from three different one-minute long sessions with different rules. The range for points is from 0 to as many drawings as can be generated by the rules within the three one-minute sessions. More points equals a better result.</description>
