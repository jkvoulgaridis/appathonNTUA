  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project seeks to elucidate the mechanisms by which antidepressant medications have
      limited efficacy in Late Life Depression (LLD) in order to develop new treatment
      interventions for this prevalent and disabling illness. Investigators hypothesize that the
      presence of executive dysfunction (ED),which is common in depressed adults over 60, impairs
      the ability to form appropriate expectancies of improvement with antidepressant treatment.
      Greater expectancy has been shown to improve antidepressant treatment outcome and is
      hypothesized to be a primary mechanism of placebo effects. Moreover, white matter
      hyperintensities (WMH) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are more prevalent in patients
      with LLD compared to healthy controls. It has been argued that WMH contribute to the
      pathogenesis of LLD with ED and decrease the efficacy of antidepressant medications by
      disrupting connections between prefrontal cortical (PFC) and subcortical structures. Vascular
      lesions to white matter tracts may also compromise the pathway by which expectancy-based
      placebo effects influence depressive symptoms. Expectancies reflect activation in PFC areas
      that may improve depressive symptoms by modulating the activity of subcortical regions
      subserving negative affective systems (i.e., amygdala) as well as those important in reward
      and hedonic capacity (nucleus accumbens and ventral striatum). Thus, LLD patients with ED and
      WMH may sustain a &quot;double-hit&quot; to their ability to experience placebo effects in
      antidepressant treatments: ED diminishes the ability to generate appropriate treatment
      expectancies, while WMH disrupt the physiologic pathways by which expectancies lead to
      improvement in depressive symptoms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To determine whether decreased antidepressant medication response in LLD patients with ED and
      WMH is caused by a loss of expectancy effects, Investigators will evaluate 130 outpatients
      with LLD at baseline to determine their degree of ED (interference score on Stroop Color-Word
      Test), WMH burden (severity score on Fazekas modified Coffey Rating Scale derived from
      anatomical MRI), and white matter tract integrity (using diffusion tensor imaging [DTI]).
      Building on work from the investigators K23 Award, the investigator will manipulate
      participants' expectancy of improvement in an 8-week duration antidepressant trial by
      randomizing patients between open administration of escitalopram (i.e., high expectancy) and
      placebo-controlled administration of escitalopram (i.e., low expectancy). The difference in
      antidepressant response observed between open and placebo-controlled medication treatment is
      a measure of the expectancy contribution to outcome, which is substantial in younger
      depressed adults but investigators hypothesize this will be diminished in LLD patients with
      ED and WMH.

    <description>QIDS-SR is a 16 item scale self-report form that was used to measure depression outcomes. This self-report is valuable in this study, because it is less susceptible to clinician and rater bias. The QIDS-SR has been increasingly used in antidepressant studies due to its equivalent weightings for each symptom item, clearly understandable anchor points, and inclusion of all DSM criteria for depression. The scores range from 0-27 with 27 being worse depressive symptoms.</description>

    <description>CES is an 8 item scale in which subjects rate their impression of the credibility of the treatment and how they estimate their expectation of improvement. The CES is the most widely used measure of expectancy and has demonstrated good psychometric properties in multiple studies. Question 2 ('Better') asks the patient the chances of their depression being completely better at the end of this study, from 1 = very poor to 7 = very good. The higher the number, the higher the expectancy that they will be better.</description>

    <measure>Quick Inventory of Depression Scale (QIDS-SR): Expectancy</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This 16-items assessment is used to rate the 9 criterion symptom domains of a major depressive episode: 4 items are used to rate sleep disturbance (early, middle, and late insomnia plus hypersomnia); 2 items are used to rate psychomotor disturbance (agitation and retardation); 4 items are used to rate appetite/weight disturbance (appetite increase or decrease and weight increase or decrease). Only 1 item is used to rate the remaining 6 domains (depressed mood, decreased interest, decreased energy, worthlessness/guilt, concentration/decision making, and suicidal ideation). Each item is rated 0-3. For symptom domains that require more than 1 item, the highest score of the item relevant for each domain is taken. The total score ranges from 0-27. A lower rating indicates higher expectancy of improvement and lower expectation of depressive symptomatology, and a higher rating indicates lower expectancy of improvement, higher expectation of depression.</description>

    <measure>White Matter Hyperintensity (WMH) Outcome- Total WMH</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the Brain was acquired. We rated the severity of WMH on axial T2 FLAIR images using the Fazekas modified Coffey Rating Scale. Deep WMH are scored as 0 (absent), 1 (punctate foci), 2 (beginning confluence of foci), and 3 (large confluent areas); subcortical gray matter HIs (basal ganglia) are scored as 0 (absent), 1 (punctate), 2 (multipunctate), and 3 (diffuse); periventricular HIs are scored as 0 (absent), 1 (caps), 2 (smooth halo), and 3 (irregular and extending into the deep white matter). Our primary measure of WMH burden will be DWMH score, which has been used to establish the only empirically validated diagnostic criteria for vascular depression, where scores of 0-1 were normal, but 2-3 indicated WHM.</description>

        <title>Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (QIDS-SR)</title>
        <description>QIDS-SR is a 16 item scale self-report form that was used to measure depression outcomes. This self-report is valuable in this study, because it is less susceptible to clinician and rater bias. The QIDS-SR has been increasingly used in antidepressant studies due to its equivalent weightings for each symptom item, clearly understandable anchor points, and inclusion of all DSM criteria for depression. The scores range from 0-27 with 27 being worse depressive symptoms.</description>

          <title>Credibility and Expectancy Scale-Depression</title>
          <description>CES is an 8 item scale in which subjects rate their impression of the credibility of the treatment and how they estimate their expectation of improvement. The CES is the most widely used measure of expectancy and has demonstrated good psychometric properties in multiple studies. CES question 3 ('Depression') asks how the patient's depression will be at the end of the study, compared with now, from 1 = much worse to 7= much better. The higher the number, the higher the expectancy that their depression will be much better.</description>

        <description>This 16-items assessment is used to rate the 9 criterion symptom domains of a major depressive episode: 4 items are used to rate sleep disturbance (early, middle, and late insomnia plus hypersomnia); 2 items are used to rate psychomotor disturbance (agitation and retardation); 4 items are used to rate appetite/weight disturbance (appetite increase or decrease and weight increase or decrease). Only 1 item is used to rate the remaining 6 domains (depressed mood, decreased interest, decreased energy, worthlessness/guilt, concentration/decision making, and suicidal ideation). Each item is rated 0-3. For symptom domains that require more than 1 item, the highest score of the item relevant for each domain is taken. The total score ranges from 0-27. A lower rating indicates higher expectancy of improvement and lower expectation of depressive symptomatology, and a higher rating indicates lower expectancy of improvement, higher expectation of depression.</description>

Deep WMH are scored as 0 (absent), 1 (punctate foci), 2 (beginning confluence of foci), and 3 (large confluent areas); subcortical gray matter HIs (basal ganglia) are scored as 0 (absent), 1 (punctate), 2 (multipunctate), and 3 (diffuse); periventricular HIs are scored as 0 (absent), 1 (caps), 2 (smooth halo), and 3 (irregular and extending into the deep white matter). Our primary measure of WMH burden will be DWMH score, which has been used to establish the only empirically validated diagnostic criteria for vascular depression, where scores of 0-1 were normal, but 2-3 indicated WHM.</description>
