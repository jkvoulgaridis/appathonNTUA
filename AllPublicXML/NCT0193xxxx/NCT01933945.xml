    <textblock>
      This study will collect data of patients who are treated with TACE followed by sorafenib for
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or patients without Sorafenib after TACE. In contrast to a
      prior observational study on sorafenib (GIDEON study), where pre-treatment with TACE was
      documented retrospectively, this study will collect more detailed information about the TACE
      treatment and the status of a patient when treatment with sorafenib is started.

        Female and male patients with a diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) will be
        enrolled in the participating study countries and sites during the enrollment period. All
        treatment decisions prior inclusion of a patient as well as during the observation must be
        made by the investigator based on his regular medical practice. Patients must give written
        informed consent prior to documentation.

        During the course of the study, patients will be assigned to one of the following cohorts
        of special interest:

          1. Patients with early start of sorafenib treatment

          2. Patients without early start of sorafenib treatment.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with histologically/cytologically documented or radiographically diagnosed
             HCC. Radiographic diagnosis needs typical findings of HCC by radiographic method i.e.
             on multi-dimensional dynamic CT, CT hepatic arteriography (CTHA)/CT arterial
             portography (CTAP) or MRI.

          -  Patients with BCLC (Barcelona clinic liver cancer staging) stage B or higher.

          -  Patients in whom a decision to treat with TACE has been made at time of study
             enrollment. Patients that have received one TACE in the past also can be enrolled, if
             the TACE was done at the same site and all required data about such previous TACEs are
             available. TACE includes both conventional TACE with lipidiol (or similar agents) and
             chemotherapeutic agent(s) and TACE with DC Beads excluding TAE without
             chemotherapeutic agent.

          -  Patients with unresectable HCC (incurable with curative treatments including resection
             or ablation or not eligible for resection or local ablation)

          -  Patients must have signed an informed consent form

          -  Patients must have a life expectancy of at least 8 weeks

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have received TACE in the past but the data about TACE required in this
             protocol are not available

          -  Patients who received any systemic anti-cancer therapy prior to the first TACE

          -  Patients who are treated according to a trial protocol for intervention including a
             locoregional therapy or systemic therapy

          -  Hospice patients

          -  All contra-indications according to the local marketing authorization should be
             considered.
