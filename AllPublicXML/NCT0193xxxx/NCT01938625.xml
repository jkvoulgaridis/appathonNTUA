    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate effect of steady-state (when the amount of drug
      administered (in a given time period is equal to the amount of drug eliminated in that same
      period) of simeprevir and daclatasvir on the steady-state pharmacokinetics (what a medication
      does to the body) of cyclosporine (applicable to Part 1 only) and tacrolimus when
      administered as a combinational regimen in post-orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT)
      participants with recurrent hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1b infection and effectiveness
      of a 24-week treatment regimen containing simeprevir, daclatasvir, and ribavirin (RBV) with
      respect to the proportion of HCV genotype 1b infected post-OLT participants achieving
      sustained virologic response 12 weeks after end of treatment.

      This is an open-label (all participants of this study know the identity of the intervention)
      and multicenter (study conducted at multiple sites) study. This study will be conducted in 2
      parts. Both the parts of the study will consist of screening phase (4 weeks), treatment
      period (24 weeks), and a post-treatment follow-up (24 weeks). A total of 30 participants will
      be enrolled in Part 1 and Part 2 of the study. A minimum of 9 participants were planned to
      receive cyclosporine as stable immunosuppressant therapy and a minimum of 9 participants were
      planned to receive tacrolimus as stable immunosuppressant therapy during Part 1. All
      participants will be receiving tacrolimus as stable immunosuppressant therapy during Part 2.
      In Part 1 of the study, participants with Metavir score of F1-F2, will receive a combination
      of study drugs - simeprevir, daclatasvir, and ribavirin for 24 weeks. In Part 2 of the study,
      participants with Metavir score F1-F4 will receive a dosing regimen of study drugs based on
      the data from Part 1 of the study. Safety evaluations will include assessments of adverse
      events, clinical laboratory tests, urinalysis, electrocardiogram, vital signs, and physical
      examination. The total study duration for each participant will be approximately 52 weeks.
