      The purpose of this study is to evaluate clinical outcomes and quality of life measures in
      treated by endovascular aortic repair of juxtarenal, suprarenal and type IV thoracoabdominal
      aortic aneurysms using custom-made Cook Zenith® Fenestrated AAA Endovascular Graft.

      This is a traditional device feasibility study intended to generate preliminary safety and
      efficacy information that may be used to plan an appropriate future study, or to inform
      further product development.

      The study is a prospective, non-randomized, non-blinded, single-arm, single-center study.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate clinical outcomes and quality of life measures in
      treated by endovascular aortic repair of juxtarenal, suprarenal and type IV thoracoabdominal
      aortic aneurysms using custom-made Cook Zenith® Fenestrated AAA Endovascular Graft.

    <description>The study will include patients treated by endovascular aortic repair of juxtarenal, suprarenal and type IV thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms using custom-made Cook Zenith® Fenestrated AAA Endovascular Graft. The graft includes combinations of scallops, holes (fenestrations) or cuffs (side branches) . These small holes or branches are the investigational part of this research study. The arteries to the liver, intestine, and kidneys will be have a stent (small tubular stainless steel structures) to help keep the arteries open and aligned with the fenestrations or branches.

    <description>The graft will be inserted through arteries in the leg (called endovascular repair). Endovascular repair is a procedure that uses catheters that go inside your blood vessel to place a stent graft above and below the aneurysm. This procedure lines the aneurysm with a new lining (stent) so blood does not fill the artery any more.</description>
