  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Two treatment options exist for infant patients with hydrocephalus. Most patients are treated
      with a surgical procedure in which a shunt is inserted into the brain and abdomen. In recent
      years, however, another treatment has developed called Endoscopic Third Ventriculostomy (ETV)
      with Choroid Plexus Cauterization (ETV/CPC).This research study is being done to measure the
      results of these procedures in children less than six months of age who have hydrocephalus as
      the result of a brain infection, called post-infectious hydrocephalus, or PIH. This study
      will evaluate patients in more detail to measure brain growth and development.

      World over, infants with hydrocephalus are mainly treated using a shunt, which is a device
      made of soft plastic tubing that moves extra fluid from the brain to the abdomen. Surgery is
      required to insert a shunt into the brain and the abdomen. In recent years, we have developed
      another treatment called Endoscopic Third Ventriculostomy (ETV) with Choroid Plexus
      Cauterization (ETV/CPC). This research study is being done to measure the results of these
      procedures in children less than six months of age who have hydrocephalus as the result of a
      brain infection, called post-infectious hydrocephalus, or PIH. This is the most common cause
      of hydrocephalus in Ugandan babies. This study will evaluate patients in more detail to
      measure brain growth and development. Children in the study will have special testing to
      measure developmental progress as well as special imaging to evaluate the progress of their
      brain growth.
