  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine safety and characterize pharmacokinetics of
      higher doses of intravenous baclofen in healthy subjects.

      Thirty-six healthy adults received a single dose of PO baclofen (10mg, 15mg or 20mg) and a
      10-minute infusion of IV baclofen (7.5mg, 11.5mg or 15mg respectively) with a minimum 48-hour
      wash out period. Twelve subjects also received a 60-minute infusion of 15mg IV baclofen
      following an additional 48-hour wash out period.

      The pharmacokinetic and tolerability information gained from this study will support the
      development of further studies to assess the use of IV baclofen to prevent or treat baclofen
      withdrawal syndrome.

      This randomized, open-label, dose escalation, crossover study was conducted at a contract
      clinical research facility. Three single doses were evaluated using three cohorts (N=12 per
      cohort). Study doses were as follows: cohort 1 - 7.5mg IV and 10mg PO, cohort 2 - 11.5mg IV
      and 15mg PO, and cohort 3 - 15mg IV and 20mg PO. The IV baclofen doses for this trial were
      based on a 75% bioavailability observed in a previous low dose study.16 The oral formulation
      of the study drug used in this trial was 10mg baclofen tablet (Teva Pharmaceutical Industries
      Ltd.) and is commercially available. The intravenous formulation was 2mg/mL solution
      manufactured by Aptuit LLC. for this study. IV infusions were administered over 10 minutes.
      In addition, cohort 3 received 15mg over a 60-minute infusion. There was a minimum 48-hour
      washout period between doses. Initially, 3 subjects received study drug at a given dose,
      after assessing the safety and tolerance of baclofen the additional 9 subjects received study
      drug.

    <description>Blood Pressure &amp; Pulse: Recorded every 5 minutes immediately prior to, and during the IV infusion, then every 15 minutes for 1 hour, then every hour for 12 hours.
Assessment of sedation / sleepiness: Subjects will be assessed by using the sleepiness scale prior to drug administration then every 30 minutes for four hours after drug administration.
Ataxia and nystagmus: Measured using the following rating scale and definitions of ataxia and nystagmus.
0=none, 1=mild, 2=severe
Ataxia: For those who are ambulatory, this will be assessed by gait. Ratings will be:
mild-unsteady with tandem gait testing, but able to perform without assistance severe-unable to perform gait testing without assistance. For non-ambulatory subjects, ataxia will be assessed by finger to nose and finger pursuit maneuvers.
Nystagmus:
mild-present on extreme gaze; severe-present on midline gaze</description>
