      Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) - methylphenidate treatment
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of the study are to (1) determine the efficacy and dose-response of
      methylphenidate treatment of attention problems after pediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI)
      and (2) provide a better understanding of the relationship of a prior history of attention
      deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), ADHD subtypes after TBI, executive function, and
      attentional control to treatment efficacy. The proposed clinical trial will enroll 50
      children, age 6-17 years, with attention problems &gt;6 months after moderate to severe TBI into
      a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design trial with 3 dose
      conditions (low, medium, and high).

    <measure>Parent Outcome-Vanderbilt ADHD Parent Rating Scales (VADPRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Reported at End of Methylphenidate Arm (Week 4 or 8)</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in symptom ratings were assessed on the Vanderbilt ADHD parent rating scales (VADPRS). A measure of ADHD symptom severity (Total Symptom Score [TSS]) is computed by totaling the scores from items 1-18 (Inattentive +Hyperactive-impulse domains), with a rating of none=0, occasionally=1, often=2, very often=3, provided. Scores for inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive domains were generated by totaling the 9 symptoms in these domains, and a TSS was computed by totaling items across domains.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Parent Outcome-Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Functioning (BRIEF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Reported at End of Methylphenidate Arm (Week 4 or 8)</time_frame>
    <description>The Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Functioning (BRIEF)-Parent was used to assess executive functioning behaviors. The global executive composite (GEC), behavior regulatory index (BRI), and metacognitive index (MI) T-scores were used, with higher scores reflecting poorer executive functioning. T-scores were normalized to 50 with a standard deviation of 10.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neuropsychological Outcome- Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, 4th Edition Processing Speed Index (WISC-IV-PSI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Reported at End of Methylphenidate Arm (Week 4 or 8)</time_frame>
    <description>The Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, 4th Edition Processing Speed Index (WISC-IV-PSI) has been designed for children 6-16:11 years of age and provides a measure of processing speed. For this index scale, the average score is 100 with a standard deviation of 15. Higher scores reflect better processing speed. One participant was administered the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale 4th Edition Processing Speed Index (WAIS-IV-PSI). All scores were included in the combined WISC/WAIS processing speed variable since both measures yield highly correlated standard scores.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Recruitment period for the study was January 2014 through July 2017. Participants were recruited from a tertiary pediatric hospital in the Midwestern United States with a Level 1 trauma designation. 321 participants were screened for eligibility.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Of the 321 assessed for eligibility, 40 participants scheduled a baseline assessment. 163 did not meet inclusion criteria and 118 declined to participate. 26 of the 40 participants were enrolled and randomized. Of those not randomized, 5 dropped before baseline visit and 9 did not show for scheduled baseline visit.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>For the first week, participants received the low-dose Methylphenidate condition (ConcertaÂ® over-encapsulated). Over the subsequent 3 weeks, the dose was titrated based on medication response and side effects to determine the optimal dose used for week 4. At the end of week 4, participants crossed-over and repeated the same procedures for the placebo condition. No wash-out period was used.
The weekly dosages were low, medium, and high based on weight cut-offs. Participants weighing less than 25kg will receive 18mg (low), 27mg (medium), and 36mg (high) dosages and participants weighing above 25kg will receive 18mg (low), 36mg (medium), and 54mg (high) dosages during the 3-week upward titration trial.</description>

        <title>Parent Outcome-Vanderbilt ADHD Parent Rating Scales (VADPRS)</title>
        <description>Changes in symptom ratings were assessed on the Vanderbilt ADHD parent rating scales (VADPRS). A measure of ADHD symptom severity (Total Symptom Score [TSS]) is computed by totaling the scores from items 1-18 (Inattentive +Hyperactive-impulse domains), with a rating of none=0, occasionally=1, often=2, very often=3, provided. Scores for inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive domains were generated by totaling the 9 symptoms in these domains, and a TSS was computed by totaling items across domains.</description>

Participants weighing less than 25kg will receive 18mg (low), 27mg (medium), and 36mg (high) dosages and participants weighing above 25kg will receive 18mg (low), 36mg (medium), and 54mg (high) dosages during the 3-week upward titration trial.</description>

        <description>The Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, 4th Edition Processing Speed Index (WISC-IV-PSI) has been designed for children 6-16:11 years of age and provides a measure of processing speed. For this index scale, the average score is 100 with a standard deviation of 15. Higher scores reflect better processing speed. One participant was administered the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale 4th Edition Processing Speed Index (WAIS-IV-PSI). All scores were included in the combined WISC/WAIS processing speed variable since both measures yield highly correlated standard scores.</description>
