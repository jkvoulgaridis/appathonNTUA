      This study is a regulatory post-marketing surveillance in Japan, and it is a local
      prospective and observational study of patients who have received Regorafenib for
      gastrointestinal stromal tumors progressed after cancer chemotherapy.

      A total of 135 patients are to be enrolled and assessed in 6 months standard observational
      period. At 12 months and 24 months after the first administration of Regorafenib for
      confirmation of efficacy information including treatment duration and survival status of the
      patient.
