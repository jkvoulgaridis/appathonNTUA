        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients of at least 18 years of age at screening (16 years of age for C3G), able to
             provide written informed consent, and able to understand and comply with all scheduled
             procedures and other requirements of the study by the opinion of Principal
             Investigator (PI)

          -  Patients must have a diagnosis of IgAN, LN, Primary MN, or C3G confirmed by renal
             biopsy and required measurements performed prior to study participation

               -  IgAN: Prior biopsy results for C3 and C4d staining should be made available

               -  LN: Diagnostic biopsy showing proliferative focal, diffuse, or membranous lesions
                  (Class III, IV or V, respectively) by renal biopsy. Subject should have either a
                  biopsy in the last 6 months, or evidence of disease activity (nephritic changes
                  on urinalysis or nephrotic changes)

               -  Primary MN: PLA2R positive titer plus nephrotic range proteinuria (defined as
                  uPCR &gt;2350 mg/g)

               -  C3G plus one of the following: Low serum C3 level or historical renal biopsy
                  within the last 3 years

          -  Have proteinuria &gt;750 mg/g (calculated by uPCR on 24 hour urine collection) collected
             during the first screening visit (Visit 3a).

          -  eGFRâ‰¥30mL/min/1.73 m2 calculated by CKD-EPI creatinine equation at screening visit 3a
             and currently not on dialysis

          -  Must have stable or worsening renal disease, on stable and optimized treatment, in the
             opinion of the PI, for at least 2 months prior to the first dose of APL-2 (Visit 4);
             treatments may include, but are not limited to, immunosuppressive agents,
             anti-hypertensives and/or anti-proteinurics.

          -  Willing to receive vaccinations against Neisseria meningitidis at least 2 weeks prior
             to dosing on Day 1 with a booster on Day 56 (for both vaccinations) and Pneumococcal
             and Hib vaccines at least 2 weeks prior to dosing on Day 1.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Absolute neutrophil count &lt;1000 cells/mm3 at screening Visits 3a and 3b

          -  ALT or AST &gt;3.0 x the upper limit of normal at screening Visits 3a and 3b

          -  Previous treatment with APL-2

          -  History of solid organ transplant

          -  Diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B, or hepatitis C
             infection, or positive serology at screening Visits 3a and 3b (previous HBV or HCV
             diagnosis cleared by treatment is allowed)

          -  Renal disease secondary to another condition (e.g. infection, malignancy, monoclonal
             gammopathy, or a medication)

          -  Presence or suspicion of active bacterial or viral infection or severe recurrent
             bacterial infections

          -  Participation in any other investigational drug trial or exposure to other
             investigational agent, device, or procedure within 30 days prior to screening period

          -  Unwillingness to receive or intolerant of SC infusions of study medication or known
             allergy to ingredients in APL-2.
