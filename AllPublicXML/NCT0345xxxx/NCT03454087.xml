  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective single-center randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled
      clinical trial testing the effects of early enteral dextrose as a therapeutic agent in
      critically ill patients with sepsis. Primary outcomes are differences in circulating plasma
      levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 to be tested 24 hours after the start of enteral
      infusion. Secondary outcomes include differences in circulating incretin hormone levels,
      differences in other pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-1β and TNF-α, changes in
      intestinal microbial composition and function after intervention, glycemic control and
      variability as assessed by capillary blood glucose measurements and exogenous insulin dosing
      during the intervention period, and clinical outcomes including intensive care unit (ICU) and
      hospital stay and in-hospital mortality.

      The central objective of this research project is to determine how early caloric support
      impacts inflammatory and metabolic outcomes in the acute phase of sepsis. Preliminary data
      from our mouse models suggest that provision of dextrose via an intravenous route, even at
      low levels early in the course of sepsis, markedly impairs glucose tolerance and decreases
      insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion. In contrast, provision of low-level dextrose by
      the enteral route at identical levels during the early phase of sepsis is associated with
      decreased inflammation, increased secretion of beneficial intestine-derived incretin
      hormones, and significant improvements in glucose metabolism. The goals of this clinical
      study are to translate findings on the beneficial role of early enteral dextrose in a pilot
      interventional trial in critically-ill patients with sepsis. This clinical trial will provide
      further insight into the optimal timing and route of early caloric support in the care of
      septic patients—an area of clinical practice that will benefit from further studies in
      fundamental biology and clear guidelines for physicians.
