  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to research on the relationship between constitutional varus knee and
      patellofemoral pain. The standardized standing whole-lower-extremity radiographs, the knee
      lateral view and skyline view of the participants will be taken. The hip-knee-ankle angle
      will be obtained from the radiographs. According to the hip-knee-ankle angle, the knees will
      be labelled knee varus or knee nonvarus. The knee varus incidences of the two groups will be
      determined and compared.

    <textblock>
      The patellofemoral joint will be assessed in the skyline view and lateral view. The
      hip-knee-ankle angle will be obtained from the standing whole-lower-extremity radiographs.
      According to the hip-knee-ankle angle, the knees will be labelled knee varus or knee
      nonvarus. The knee varus incidences of the two groups will be determined and compared. It is
      hypothesized that constitutional varus knee is a risk factor for patellofemoral pain.
