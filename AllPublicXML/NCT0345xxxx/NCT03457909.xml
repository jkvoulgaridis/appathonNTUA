    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine the safety and feasibility of the new
      technique,detachable string magnetically controlled capsule endoscopy(DS-MCE)for evaluating
      gastric and esophagus diseases.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Esophageal capsule endoscopy(ECE)provides a novel noninvasive approach to visualize the
      esophagus.The main drawback for the use of ECE is its unreliable transit time which often
      renders an inadequate visualization of the esophagus.Thus investigators have developed the
      detachable string magnetically controlled capsule endoscopy(DS-MCE) which can control the
      movement of the capsule through the string.

      This study is a prospective, single-centered, self-controlled pilot study.Outpatients who
      have esophagus symptoms will take conventional endoscopy examination and DS-MCE successively.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Successful Separation of Capsule and String, and Complete Viewing of Esophagus and Stomach</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>evaluate the feasibility of the novel DS-MCE examination. The successful separation of the capsule and string was evaluated by the capsule entering the stomach and and the string being pulled out.Complete viewing of esophagus and stomach was evaluated by completing the procedure from the capsule being swallowed, the esophagus observed retrograde, to the string being pulled out after separating from the capsule.This primary outcome indicated how many participatns completed the DS-MCE examination successfully.</description>

    <description>evaluate the safety of DS-MCE.Record any adverse event during the procedure and after the procedure.Patients will be followed up by telephone to inquire about the symptoms of abdominal distention, abdominal pain,vomiting and other discomfort.

    <measure>Z-line Visualization</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Z-line represents the normal esophagogastric junction where the squamous mucosa of the esophagus and columnar mucosa of the stomach meet.We can devide the Z-line into four quadrants under capsule endoscopy. Observing all the four quadrants is considered to be a complete observation of Z-line. In this study,the number of participants with at least two quadrants of Z-line visualized was used to evaluate the Z-line visulization.</description>

        <description>Z-line represents the normal esophagogastric junction where the squamous mucosa of the esophagus and columnar mucosa of the stomach meet.We can devide the Z-line into four quadrants under capsule endoscopy. Observing all the four quadrants is considered to be a complete observation of Z-line. In this study,the number of participants with at least two quadrants of Z-line visualized was used to evaluate the Z-line visulization.</description>
