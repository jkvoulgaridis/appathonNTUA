      This pilot phase II trial studies how well pembrolizumab in combination with liver-directed
      therapy or Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT) works in treating patients with
      well-differentiated metastatic neuroendocrine tumors and symptomatic and/or progressive
      tumors that have spread to the liver. Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may
      interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Liver-directed therapies such
      as, transarterial embolization (TAE), yttrium-90 microsphere radioembolization (RE), and
      cryoablation may help to shrink tumors that are not being directly targeted. Somatostatin
      receptor positive (SSTR+) well- diferentiated neuroendocrine tumors (WD-NETs) may benefit
      from treatment with peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) using 177Lu DOTATATE. Giving
      pembrolizumab in combination with liver-directed therapy or PRRT may work better in treating
      patients with well-differentiated metastatic neuroendocrine tumors and symptomatic and/or
      progressive tumors that have spread to the liver.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the best observed overall response rate (ORR) in lesion(s) not targeted for
      liver-directed therapy (abscopal effect) to pembrolizumab plus liver-directed therapy
      according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 for patients with
      metastatic well-differentiated [World Heath Organization (WHO) grade 1 or 2] neuroendocrine
      tumors (NET) (WD-NETs).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab in combination with
      liver-directed therapies in this patient population.

      II. To evaluate duration of response (DOR) in patients receiving pembrolizumab in combination
      with liver-directed therapies.

      III. To evaluate progression free survival (PFS) in subjects treated with pembrolizumab in
      combination with liver-directed therapies.

      IV. Best observed radiographic ORR per modified RECIST (mRECIST) in lesions targeted for
      liver-directed therapy.

      V. Duration of response in lesions targeted for liver-directed therapy by mRECIST.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 4 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1.
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 35 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. PRRT using 177Lu-DOTATATE(Lutathera®) will be offered to patients with
      somatostatin receptor positive (SSTR+) tumors with Ki-67 index &gt; 20% (well-differentiated
      grade 3). Patients may have any number of liver and/or extrahepatic lesions with liver
      parenchyma replacement by tumor &lt; 75%. 200±20 millicurie (mCi) of 177Lu-DOTATATE will be
      administered intravenously per treatment on outpatient basis. Patients will receive a total
      of four treatments of 177Lu-DOTATATE, administered every 8±1 weeks

      GROUP II: Patients receive pembrolizumab as in Group I. Patients with any number of liver
      lesions, largest being no larger than 5 cm, who have &lt; 75% liver parenchyma replacement by
      tumors, undergo transarterial embolization (TAE) over 2-3 hours, 3-7 days following the first
      dose of pembrolizumab.

      GROUP III: Patients receive pembrolizumab as in Group I. Patients with any number of liver
      lesions, largest measuring more than 5 cm, who have &lt; 75% liver parenchyma replacement by
      tumors, undergo yttrium-90 microsphere radioembolization (RE) 3-15 days following the first
      dose of pembrolizumab.

      GROUP IV: Patients receive pembrolizumab as in Group I. Patients with up to 6 liver lesions,
      largest being no larger than 4 cm who have &lt; 25% liver parenchyma replacement by tumors,
      undergo CT-guided cryoablation over 2-3 hours, 3-7 days following the first dose of
      pembrolizumab.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3-6
      months thereafter.

    <description>The point estimate and 95% confidence interval of overall response rate will be obtained for each of the three liver-directed therapy groups (cryoablation, transarterial embolization(TAE) , radioembolization (RE)) separately.

Assuming the abscopal overall response rate (RECIST v. 1.1) is 25% for each patient group, with 8 patients in each group, there is 80% of power to detect partial response rate significantly different from 1% at alpha of 0.1 by a directional binomial test.</description>

All treatment related adverse events will be graded using NCI CTCAE v5.0. Adverse events assessed as related to study drug and serious adverse events will be summarized similarly. Adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation will also be summarized. Safety analysis will include a tabulation of all toxicities by grade.
