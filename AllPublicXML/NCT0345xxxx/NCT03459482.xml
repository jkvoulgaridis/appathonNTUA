      This study is designed to evaluate the most applicable endpoints for evaluation of the
      Biomerica InFoods® IBS product.

      The objective of this Endpoint Determination Study is to address key elements regarding a
      proposed larger clinical study design:

        1. Comparing different potential primary outcome measures

        2. Demonstrating that an exclusionary diet as determined by elevated IgG levels using the
           Biomerica InFoods® IBS Test is associated with alleviation of IBS symptoms

        3. Demonstrating the ability to mask the sham diet

        4. Demonstrating the safety of the exclusionary diet

      Subjects' diets will be based on the results of the Biomerica, InFoods® IBS Test.

      Immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels above a certain threshold are considered a positive response
      against a specific food or foods. It is expected that severity of symptoms of IBS will
      decrease when foods that generate a positive immune response in the Biomerica InFoods® IBS
      test are eliminated from the diet of the IBS patient.

      The Endpoint Determination Study format will be a double-blinded randomized controlled
      clinical study enrolling subjects at two trial sites within the United States and designed to
      evaluate the use of IgG antibody guided dietary restrictions, based on the Biomerica InFoods®
      IBS Test, in the management of patients diagnosed with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS).

      The 2 sites will enroll approximately equal numbers of subjects. The target for each site is
      a minimum of 30 subjects in each classification: IBS with diarrhea [IBS-D], IBS with
      constipation [IBS-C] and IBS mixed [IBS-M] for a minimum of 90 patients per site, 180 total
      subjects for this study.

    <description>Group 1 (experimental group): Subjects will be given an elimination diet based upon foods with a positive antibody profile in the Biomerica InFoods® IBS test. The elimination diet will also exclude any and all foods to which the subject has a known IgE allergy and foods the subject already currently eliminates.</description>

    <description>Group 2 (control group): Subjects will be given a &quot;Sham&quot; elimination diet. The sham diet will eliminate the same number of foods but none of the actual foods to which the patient had a positive antibody profile in the Biomerica InFoods® IBS test. The sham diet will also eliminate any and all foods to which the subject has a known IgE allergy and foods the subject already currently eliminates.</description>
