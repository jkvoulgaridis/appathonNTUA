  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to test a new way to help people quit smoking. The PI
      will test acceptability and feasibility of a new device called Pavlok wearable wrist band.
      Participants will be smokers who are highly motivated to quit. Participants will be
      randomized into intervention and control groups.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The participants will be evaluated after 1 week and assessed for their ongoing participation
      and commitment to the study. Those still interested and eligible will be randomized to two
      groups described below and will continue the study for 3 more weeks. There will be follow up
      surveys at various time points while wearing the wristband (1 week, 2 week, 3 weeks) and a
      final survey at T=3 months.

      The intervention group will continue to wear the wristband and the wristband will deliver a
      slight electric stimulus every time it is pressed.

      The placebo group will wear continue to press the button on the wristband but it will not
      give a slight electric stimulus when pressed. Both groups will wear the device for a total of
      4 weeks.

    <description>Participants' acceptability/satisfaction will be assessed using a short customized survey. The survey will include 8 questions with options ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree for five questions and ranging from satisfaction to dissatisfaction for the remainder 3 questions. Each question will be evaluated individually.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Participants satisfaction: short customized survey</measure>
    <time_frame>T=0 to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants' acceptability/satisfaction will be assessed using a short customized survey. The survey will be a Likert scale and will include 2 questions with options ranging from satisfied to dissatisfied (with 1 indicating satisfaction and 5 indicating dissatisfaction). One other question is a likert scale with options ranging from 1-3 with 1 indicating the device was very useful and 3 indicating the device was not at all useful. A higher score indicates a worse outcome (less satisfaction with the device). Each question will be evaluated individually.</description>

    <time_frame>From T=0 to one week</time_frame>
    <description>PI will evaluate the percentage of participants that made a quit attempt as defined by absence of smoking for more than 24 hours in the previous seven days. This will be assessed through the follow up survey given at various intervals.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of participants who had cessation of smoking.</measure>
    <time_frame>T=0 to T= 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>P will evaluate the percentage of participants who had cessation of smoking, as defined by the absence of smoking in the previous 30 days. This will be evaluated by the &quot;Three month Questionnaire&quot;</description>

    <measure>Before and after smoking self-efficacy score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PI will evaluate the self-efficacy of the participant as evaluated by the &quot;Baseline Smoking self-efficacy scale Short form&quot;. There are 9 questions which will assess the confidence of the participant to not smoke.The investigators will use Likert scale for each question which assesses the participants confidence to &quot;not smoke&quot; in various circumstances. The answers range from 1 to 5 with 1 indicating &quot;not at all confident&quot; and 5 indicating &quot;extremely confident&quot;. The overall score for each participant will be calculated by sum of scores from all items. This score for individual subscales will be calculated by sum item scores so that the total score will range from 9 to 45, with a lower score indicating a worse outcome i.e. less confidence to not smoke).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Stage of change</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline until 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will use Likert scale for each question to evaluate the motivation to change. A score of 1 indicates that the participant has no intention to quit smoking and the score of 5 indicates that the participant is highly motivated. Evaluate the initial stage of change of the participant as judged by &quot;Screening Questionnaire, Stage of Change&quot;. There is only 1 question.</description>
