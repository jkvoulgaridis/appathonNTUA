  <brief_summary>

      Determine the safety, feasibility, compliance, and efficacy of a daily home TTNS protocol in
      chronic SCI provided by self or caregiver for 4 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Specific Aim 1, we will monitor for safety, feasibility, and compliance of a home TTNS
      program for bladder management. In Specific Aim 2, the efficacy of home TTNS will be compared
      to baseline Incontinence- Quality of Life questionnaire. A bladder diary will also capture
      important information such as frequency and volume of catheterization, incontinence episodes,
      and other related observations.

    <description>4-week TTNS home-based protocol. Electrodes 2 inch by 2 inch will be placed according to anatomic landmarks, with the negative electrode behind the internal malleolus and the positive electrode 10cm superior to the negative electrode, verified with rhythmic flexion of the toes secondary to stimulation of the flexor digitorum and hallicus brevis. The intensity level will be set to the amperage immediately under the threshold for motor contraction. If there is not contraction seen, maximal tolerable intensity will be used.
In addition, if the patient perceives pain, the intensity will be lowered until comfortable.
Stimulation frequency of 10 Hz and pulse width of 200ms in continuous mode will be used.</description>

Electrodes 2 inch by 2 inch will be placed according to anatomic landmarks, with the negative electrode behind the internal malleolus and the positive electrode 10cm superior to the negative electrode, verified with rhythmic flexion of the toes secondary to stimulation of the flexor digitorum and hallicus brevis. The intensity level will be set to the amperage immediately under the threshold for motor contraction. If there is not contraction seen, maximal tolerable intensity will be used.
In addition, if the patient perceives pain, the intensity will be lowered until comfortable.

4-week TTNS home-based protocol: 4-week TTNS home-based protocol. Electrodes 2 inch by 2 inch will be placed according to anatomic landmarks, with the negative electrode behind the internal malleolus and the positive electrode 10cm superior to the negative electrode, verified with rhythmic flexion of the toes secondary to stimulation of the flexor digitorum and hallicus brevis. The intensity level will be set to the amperage immediately under the threshold for motor contraction. If there is not contraction seen, maximal tolerable intensity will be used.
In addition, if the patient perceives pain, the intensity will be lowered until comfortable.
Stimulation frequency of 10 Hz and pulse width of 200ms in continuous mode will be used.</description>

4-week TTNS home-based protocol: 4-week TTNS home-based protocol. Electrodes 2 inch by 2 inch will be placed according to anatomic landmarks, with the negative electrode behind the internal malleolus and the positive electrode 10cm superior to the negative electrode, verified with rhythmic flexion of the toes secondary to stimulation of the flexor digitorum and hallicus brevis. The intensity level will be set to the amperage immediately under the threshold for motor contraction. If there is not contraction seen, maximal tolerable intensity will be used.
In addition, if the patient perceives pain, the intensity will be lowered until comfortable.
Stimulation frequency of 10 Hz and pulse width of 200ms in continuous mode will be used.</description>

4-week TTNS home-based protocol: 4-week TTNS home-based protocol. Electrodes 2 inch by 2 inch will be placed according to anatomic landmarks, with the negative electrode behind the internal malleolus and the positive electrode 10cm superior to the negative electrode, verified with rhythmic flexion of the toes secondary to stimulation of the flexor digitorum and hallicus brevis. The intensity level will be set to the amperage immediately under the threshold for motor contraction. If there is not contraction seen, maximal tolerable intensity will be used.
In addition, if the patient perceives pain, the intensity will be lowered until comfortable.
Stimulation frequency of 10 Hz and pulse width of 200ms in continuous mode will be used.</description>

            <title>4-week TTNS Home Based Protocol</title>
            <description>Transcutaneous Tibial Nerve Stimulation (TTNS) applied to subjects for 4-week protocol.
4-week TTNS home-based protocol: 4-week TTNS home-based protocol. Electrodes 2 inch by 2 inch will be placed according to anatomic landmarks, with the negative electrode behind the internal malleolus and the positive electrode 10cm superior to the negative electrode, verified with rhythmic flexion of the toes secondary to stimulation of the flexor digitorum and hallicus brevis. The intensity level will be set to the amperage immediately under the threshold for motor contraction. If there is not contraction seen, maximal tolerable intensity will be used.
In addition, if the patient perceives pain, the intensity will be lowered until comfortable.
Stimulation frequency of 10 Hz and pulse width of 200ms in continuous mode will be used.</description>
