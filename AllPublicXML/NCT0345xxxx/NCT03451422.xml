    <intervention_model_description>Phase 1b The phase 1b part of the study is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, multiple ascending dose (MAD) study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, and PD of AMG 592 in participants with SLE. Participants will be treated for a total of 12 weeks after which they will be followed for an additional 6 weeks for safety and additional PK/PD data collection. Five dosing cohorts are planned for the phase 1b part of the study.
Phase 2a The phase 2a part of the study is a 52-week multicenter, double-blind, placebo controlled study in participants with moderate to severe SLE or cutaneous lupus with inadequate response to standard of care therapy. The phase 2a part of the study will commence after a RP2D is identified. Participants will be randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to either AMG 592 or placebo.</intervention_model_description>

             months prior to day 1, belimumab &lt; 3 months prior to day 1, abatacept &lt; 8 weeks prior
             to day 1.

          -  Currently receiving or had treatment with T cell depleting agents (eg, antithymocyte
             globulin, Campath) or recombinant IL-2 (eg, Proleukin).

          -  Participants who have received intra-articular or systemic corticosteroid injections
             within 4 weeks prior to day 1 or topical steroids within 2 weeks prior to day 1.

          -  Phase 1b Participants only: Administration of herbal supplements, vitamins, or
             nutritional supplements within 30 days prior to the first dose of investigational
             product, and continuing use, if applicable, will be reviewed by the Investigator and
             the Amgen Medical Monitor to determine acceptability. Written documentation of this
             review and Amgen acknowledgment is required for participant participation.

        Prior/Concurrent Clinical Study Experience

          -  Currently receiving treatment in another investigational device or drug study, or less
             than 30 days at day 1 since ending treatment on another investigational device or drug
             study(ies). Other investigational procedures while participating in this study are
             excluded.

          -  Participant previously enrolled in this study may not be re-enrolled unless they
             fulfill the following criteria:

               -  Have completed the study previously without any adverse events deemed related to
                  study drug.

               -  Have received the last dose of AMG 592/placebo &gt; 6 months prior to the screening
                  visit.

               -  Must not have tested positive for neutralizing antibodies against AMG 592 at any
                  time.

        Diagnostic Assessments

          -  Presence of laboratory abnormalities at screening including the following:

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt; 1.5x upper
                  limit of normal (ULN)

               -  Serum total bilirubin (TBL) ≥ 1.5 mg/dL (≥ 26 μmol/L)

               -  Hemoglobin &lt; 9.0 g/dL(&lt; 90 g/L)

               -  Platelet count &lt; 100,000/mm3 (100 x 109/L)

               -  White blood cell count &lt; 2,000 cells/mm3 (2.0 x 109/L)

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt; 1,000/mm3 (1.0 x 109/L)

               -  Calculated glomerular filtration rate of ≤ 50 mL/min/1.73 m2 using the
                  Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula

          -  Any other laboratory abnormality, which, in the opinion of the investigator, poses a
             safety risk, will prevent the participant from completing the study, will interfere
             with the interpretation of the study results, or might cause the study to be
             detrimental to the participant.

    <ipd_time_frame>Data sharing requests relating to this study will be considered beginning 18 months after the study has ended and either 1) the product and indication (or other new use) have been granted marketing authorization in both the US and Europe or 2) clinical development for the product and/or indication discontinues and the data will not be submitted to regulatory authorities. There is no end date for eligibility to submit a data sharing request for this study.</ipd_time_frame>
    <ipd_access_criteria>Qualified researchers may submit a request containing the research objectives, the Amgen product(s) and Amgen study/studies in scope, endpoints/outcomes of interest, statistical analysis plan, data requirements, publication plan, and qualifications of the researcher(s). In general, Amgen does not grant external requests for individual patient data for the purpose of re-evaluating safety and efficacy issues already addressed in the product labelling. Requests are reviewed by a committee of internal advisors, and if not approved, may be further arbitrated by a Data Sharing Independent Review Panel. Upon approval, information necessary to address the research question will be provided under the terms of a data sharing agreement. This may include anonymized individual patient data and/or available supporting documents, containing fragments of analysis code where provided in analysis specifications.
