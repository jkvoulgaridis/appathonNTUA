  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Placing a tumor antigen chimeric receptor that has been created in the laboratory into
      patient autologous or donor-derived T cells may make the body build immune response to kill
      cancer cells. Genetically engineered lymphocyte (CART) therapy has showed good safety and
      efficacy in treatment of lymphoma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Researchers want to see
      if this helps people with high risk multiple myeloma after auto-HSCT.To test the safety and
      efficacy of giving targeting CD19 or B-cell maturation antigen T cells in treating patients
      with CD19 or BCMA positive high risk multiple myeloma followed with auto-HSCT.

      Adults ages 18-75 with high risk Multiple Myelomas (not achieved VGPR before stem cell
      mobilization or R-ISS III stage or with extramedullary infiltration or with del(17p),
      t(4;14), t(14;16) or Type IgD or IgE or disease progression during treatment).

      Design:

      Participants may be screened with:

      Medical history Physical exam Blood and urine tests Heart tests Bone marrow sample Multiple
      scans and X-rays Participants will have apheresis. Blood is removed through a needle in an
      arm. T cells are removed. The rest of the blood is returned through a needle in the other
      arm.

      The cells will be changed in a laboratory. Participants will get auto-HSCT. 14 and 20 days
      after auto-HSCT, participants will get the T cells through the IV within 3 days.

      After this, participants will stay in the hospital for at least 9 days and stay nearby for 2
      weeks. Then they will have blood tests and see a doctor.

      Participants will visit the clinic 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after the infusion, then every
      3 months until disease progression. A bone marrow sample will be taken at the 3-month visit.
