    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label, international study to evaluate the dose, safety and
      tolerability, antitumor activity, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics of avelumab in
      pediatric subjects 0 to less than 18 years of age with refractory or relapsed malignant solid
      tumors (including central nervous system tumors) and lymphoma for which no standard therapy
      is available or for which the subject is not eligible for the existing therapy.
