    <textblock>
      This study is in response to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) call to all manufacturers
      with 510(k) clearance for metal-on-metal (MoM) total hip arthroplasty (THA) devices to
      conduct postmarket surveillance studies. MicroPort has various acetabular shells, acetabular
      liners, fixation screws, femoral heads, femoral stems, modular necks, and proximal bodies
      currently cleared for MoM indications. Together these components comprise the Wright Medical
      Technology (WMT) MoM THA System. The primary objective of the study is to determine the
      incidence of adverse local tissue reactions (ALTR) in each THA implanted with the WMT MoM THA
      System overall and to create cross-sectional epochs of ≤ 8 years and &gt; 8 years, since
      implantation.

    <description>Subjects in Group 1 previously implanted prior to the study start date will be identified from Investigator records. Collected data will be evaluated in aggregate and cross-sectioned by year of implantation. Subjects will be cross-sectioned by the time that has elapsed between implantation and the initial visit (e.g. 5 years, 6 years) using contiguous visit windows (number of years + 6 months). Subject data will be grouped in order to create cross-sectional epochs of ≤ 8 years and &gt; 8 years.</description>

        Group 1: Subjects previously implanted with components of the Wright Medical Technology
        (WMT) Metal-on-Metal (MoM) Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA) System

        Inclusion Criteria:

        To be included in Group 1, subjects must meet all of the following criteria:

          2. Has previously undergone primary THA for any of the following:

               1. non-inflammatory degenerative joint disease including osteoarthritis, traumatic
                  arthritis, or avascular necrosis;

               2. inflammatory degenerative joint disease including rheumatoid arthritis;
