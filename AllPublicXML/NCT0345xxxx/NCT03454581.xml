    <textblock>
      Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) is a complex and multifactorial disease. Therapeutic
      modalities, as PBM and MT, expected to relief of symptoms, improve of function and reduce the
      impact of the disease in patient's life. Fifty-one TMD patients were randomly allocated to
      three groups: PBM group (n=18) using 808 nm, 100 milliwatt (mW), 13.3 J âˆ•cm2, 4 J per point),
      MT group (n=16) with 21 minutes sessions of MT of the masticatory muscles and TMJ and
      Combined Therapy group (CT) (n=17) applying the 2 protocol described above. All treatments
      were done three times a week for four consecutive weeks. Evaluations were performed at
      baseline, during the treatment (days 7, 14, 21, and 28) and follow up (day 60 and day 90).
      Visual analogue scale (VAS), Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC/TMD) Axis I and II, Beck
      anxiety inventory (BAI) were used in different moments of evaluation time.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Visual Analogic Scale (VAS) for Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>0,7,14,21,28,60,90 days</time_frame>
    <description>Visual Analogic Score (VAS) is a psychometric scale used to measure subjective characteristics, as pain. Consists of a 100mm horizontal line with descriptors &quot;no pain&quot; at the initial point (score 0) and &quot;worst pain&quot; at the end point (score 100). To avoid clustering of scores, numbers or verbal descriptors at intermediate points are not recommended. Patients were asked to place a handwritten mark at one point along the 100mm line that best represents their pain intensity. The scores are recorded in millimeters and determined by the measurements from the initial point of the scale to the patients' mark, using a ruler. Higher scores indicate high levels of pain intensity. In this study, the scores (mm) of pain were recorded at days 7, 14, 21, 28, 60 and 90 and compared to the baseline score (day 0) to evaluate the response to each treatment.</description>

    <measure>Change on Chronic Pain Grades</measure>
    <time_frame>0,90 days</time_frame>
    <description>RDC/TMD Axis II includes measures from the Graded Chronic Pain Scale (GCPS). Participants rated on scales from 0 = &quot;no pain&quot; to 10 = &quot;pain as bad as could be&quot; their current pain and average and worst facial pain in the past six months. Also, on scales from 0 = &quot;no interference&quot; to 10 = &quot;unable to carry on any activities&quot; the degree of facial pain interference with daily activities in the past six months. The mean of the ratings, multiplied by 10, gives information on characteristic pain intensity (CPI) and daily disability. The GCP is based on CPI, number of disability days in the past six months and daily disability score classified as 0 = no pain, I = low CPI and disability, II = high CPI and low pain-related disability, III = moderate CPI and disability, and IV = severe CPI and disability. In this study, the number of participants, at the end of the study, with Low Incapacity (Grades 0 to I) and Higher Incapacity (Grades II to IV) was compared to the baseline numbers.</description>

    <measure>Changes on Levels of Depression Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>0,90 days</time_frame>
    <description>RDC/TMD Axis II is a validated questionnaire which assess the levels of depression symptoms (LDS). The participants answered 20 questions about how much they have been distressed to several symptoms of depression rating on a scale: 0 =Not at all; 1= A little bit; 2=Moderately; 3=Quite a bit; 4=Extremely. The total number of participants in the end of study, with no depression (scores 0 and 1 on the scale) and with moderate and severe depression (scores 2 to 4 on the scale) was compared to the baseline numbers (day 0).</description>

    <measure>Change on Nonspecific Physical Symptoms With Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 90 days</time_frame>
    <description>RDC/TMD Axis II can be used to provide information on nonspecific physical symptoms with pain. The participants rate the experiences in the past few weeks relative to &quot;how usually feels&quot; about several pain symptoms as follows: 0 =Not at all; 1= A little bit; 2=Moderately; 3=Quite a bit; 4=Extremely. We divided the participants into no symptoms (&quot;Normal&quot; = scores 0 to1 at the scale) and moderate/severe symptoms (scale 2 to 4 at the scale) and compared the total number of participants in each classification (No symptoms and Moderate/severe symptoms) at the end of the study to the baseline numbers.</description>

    <description>RDC/TMD Axis II is also used to provide information on nonspecific physical symptoms without pain. The participants rate the experiences in the past few weeks relative to &quot;how usually feels&quot; about several symptoms nonrelated to pain as follows: 0 =Not at all; 1= A little bit; 2=Moderately; 3=Quite a bit; 4=Extremely. We divided the participants in no symptoms (&quot;Normal&quot; =scores 0 to1 at the scale) and moderate/severe symptoms (scale 2 to 4 at the scale) and compared the total number of participants in each classification at the end of the study to the baseline numbers.</description>

    <measure>Changes on Mandibular Function</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 90 days</time_frame>
    <description>The changes at mandibular functions can be evaluated using the question 19 of RDC/TMD Axis II. Participants answered 0=No (no limitation due to jaw problem) or 1=Yes (the activity is limited by the jaw problem - worse outcome) to a list of activities that the jaw problem can limit from doing. The mean of all the &quot;Yes&quot; answers (score 1) for each group in the end of the study (day 90) was calculated and compared to the baseline means.</description>

    <measure>Changes on Levels of Anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>0,90 days</time_frame>
    <description>Beck anxiety inventory (BAI) is a validated questionnaire with 21 multiple-choice items addressing how much the patient has been bothered by common symptoms of anxiety, at the list in the previous week. Each answer is scored on a scale value of 0 = not at all , 1=Mildly, but it didn't bother me much, 2=Moderately - it wasn't pleasant at times and 3=Severely - it bothered me a lot. We applied the BAI in two moments of the study (baseline and at follow -up= day 90). In each moment the participants were classified using a score calculated by finding the sum of the 21 items. Score of 0-21 = low anxiety, Score of 22-35 = moderate anxiety, Score of 36 and above = high levels of anxiety. We presented the results using only the mean of BAI of participants of each group in that moment. We compared the mean of BAI among the groups (PBM X MT X combined groups- intergroup analysis) in the baseline and follow-up period. In addition, we also analyzed intragroup results comparing the mean of BAI.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Visual Analogic Scale (VAS) for Pain</title>
        <description>Visual Analogic Score (VAS) is a psychometric scale used to measure subjective characteristics, as pain. Consists of a 100mm horizontal line with descriptors &quot;no pain&quot; at the initial point (score 0) and &quot;worst pain&quot; at the end point (score 100). To avoid clustering of scores, numbers or verbal descriptors at intermediate points are not recommended. Patients were asked to place a handwritten mark at one point along the 100mm line that best represents their pain intensity. The scores are recorded in millimeters and determined by the measurements from the initial point of the scale to the patients' mark, using a ruler. Higher scores indicate high levels of pain intensity. In this study, the scores (mm) of pain were recorded at days 7, 14, 21, 28, 60 and 90 and compared to the baseline score (day 0) to evaluate the response to each treatment.</description>

        <title>Change on Chronic Pain Grades</title>
        <description>RDC/TMD Axis II includes measures from the Graded Chronic Pain Scale (GCPS). Participants rated on scales from 0 = &quot;no pain&quot; to 10 = &quot;pain as bad as could be&quot; their current pain and average and worst facial pain in the past six months. Also, on scales from 0 = &quot;no interference&quot; to 10 = &quot;unable to carry on any activities&quot; the degree of facial pain interference with daily activities in the past six months. The mean of the ratings, multiplied by 10, gives information on characteristic pain intensity (CPI) and daily disability. The GCP is based on CPI, number of disability days in the past six months and daily disability score classified as 0 = no pain, I = low CPI and disability, II = high CPI and low pain-related disability, III = moderate CPI and disability, and IV = severe CPI and disability. In this study, the number of participants, at the end of the study, with Low Incapacity (Grades 0 to I) and Higher Incapacity (Grades II to IV) was compared to the baseline numbers.</description>

        <description>RDC/TMD Axis II can be used to provide information on nonspecific physical symptoms with pain. The participants rate the experiences in the past few weeks relative to &quot;how usually feels&quot; about several pain symptoms as follows: 0 =Not at all; 1= A little bit; 2=Moderately; 3=Quite a bit; 4=Extremely. We divided the participants into no symptoms (&quot;Normal&quot; = scores 0 to1 at the scale) and moderate/severe symptoms (scale 2 to 4 at the scale) and compared the total number of participants in each classification (No symptoms and Moderate/severe symptoms) at the end of the study to the baseline numbers.</description>

        <title>Change on Nonspecific Physical Symptoms Without Pain</title>
        <description>RDC/TMD Axis II is also used to provide information on nonspecific physical symptoms without pain. The participants rate the experiences in the past few weeks relative to &quot;how usually feels&quot; about several symptoms nonrelated to pain as follows: 0 =Not at all; 1= A little bit; 2=Moderately; 3=Quite a bit; 4=Extremely. We divided the participants in no symptoms (&quot;Normal&quot; =scores 0 to1 at the scale) and moderate/severe symptoms (scale 2 to 4 at the scale) and compared the total number of participants in each classification at the end of the study to the baseline numbers.</description>

Participants answered 0=No (no limitation due to jaw problem) or 1=Yes (the activity is limited by the jaw problem - worse outcome) to a list of activities that the jaw problem can limit from doing. The mean of all the &quot;Yes&quot; answers (score 1) for each group in the end of the study (day 90) was calculated and compared to the baseline means.</description>

        <title>Changes on Levels of Anxiety</title>
        <description>Beck anxiety inventory (BAI) is a validated questionnaire with 21 multiple-choice items addressing how much the patient has been bothered by common symptoms of anxiety, at the list in the previous week. Each answer is scored on a scale value of 0 = not at all , 1=Mildly, but it didn't bother me much, 2=Moderately - it wasn't pleasant at times and 3=Severely - it bothered me a lot. We applied the BAI in two moments of the study (baseline and at follow -up= day 90). In each moment the participants were classified using a score calculated by finding the sum of the 21 items. Score of 0-21 = low anxiety, Score of 22-35 = moderate anxiety, Score of 36 and above = high levels of anxiety. We presented the results using only the mean of BAI of participants of each group in that moment. We compared the mean of BAI among the groups (PBM X MT X combined groups- intergroup analysis) in the baseline and follow-up period. In addition, we also analyzed intragroup results comparing the mean of BAI.</description>
