  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Orphan livers are organs that have been declined for clinical use by all centers due to their
      marginality. The current standard of care of liver preservation before transplant is cold
      storage. NMP may allow these livers to be evaluated before transplantation. NMP has already
      been used in a clinical setting with promising results. The advantage to utilizing NMP is
      that it would attenuate the incidence and clinical impact of classical preservation injury,
      allow liver function assessment before implantation and thus improve donor pool and outcomes
      for high risk ECD liver transplants performed at our center.

      This will be a single center prospective cohort pilot study. 15 livers that have been
      declined for clinical use by all centers due to their marginality will be preserved with NMP
      in 1-18 hours after cross clamp and cold flush. The liver grafts at NMP will be at
      Physiological temperature and have oxygen and nutrient supply with continuous perfusion. Once
      the liver grafts have been evaluated and determined to be transplantable, the transplantation
      and post-transplant care will follow the standard of care. The follow-up period is 12 months
      after transplantation. The primary end point will be the rate of patient survival and primary
      non function (PNF) within 30 days after transplantation, while the secondary end points will
      be: Early Allograft Dysfunction (EAD), 6 months patient and graft survival, peak liver
      function tests in the first 7 days after transplantation, surgical outcomes (operative time,
      transfusion requirement etc.), rate of post-transplant kidney failure, assessment of
      histological ischemia reperfusion (liver and bile duct), rate of vascular complications, rate
      of biliary complications, hospital and ICU length of stay, rejection rate, infection rate,
      the ability to predict function based on &quot;on-pump&quot; viability markers, and the incidence of
      adverse effect (AE).
