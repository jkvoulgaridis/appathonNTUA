    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, open-label, single-arm intervention study in
      African-American/Black subjects with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).

      There will be a 7-day screening period, a 57-day open-label treatment period, and a safety
      follow-up at day 87 or 30 days after the last administration of the investigational product.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine the impact of adding ivabradine therapy to the
      standard of care (SOC) in African-American/Black subjects with Heart Failure (HF) and reduced
      ejection fraction (HFrEF) on changes in heart rate (HR) from baseline (SOC alone). Changes in
      HR from baseline will be correlated with the changes from baseline in activity level of the
      subjects, as measured by both a standard 6-minute walk distance and an accelerometer device.

      The primary hypothesis is that ivabradine effectively reduces HR between baseline and day 57
      in African-American/Black subjects. Because mean reductions of approximately 5 beat per
      minute (bpm) have been observed in the overall placebo-treated subjects in the SHIFT study as
      well as in the placebo-treated subjects of the subgroup analysis of
      non-African-American/Black subjects enrolled in the SHIFT study, we will test whether the
      mean reduction with ivabradine exceeds 5 bpm, and estimate the degree to which the mean
      reduction with ivabradine exceeds 5 bpm.

    <description>Summary is based on observed data, and no imputation is used for missing values.
Least-square mean is from the repeated measures model which includes scheduled visits and baseline HR measurement as covariates.
The mean change from baseline in heart rate is compared to -5 beats/min which is observed in the placebo group in the Systolic Heart Failure Treatment with the IF Inhibitor Ivabradine Trial (SHIFT) study ( NCT02441218, PMID 20801500).</description>

Dose was adjusted at Day 15 (and at any other clinical visit) between 2.5 - 7.5 mg BID based on heart rate and signs/symptoms of bradycardia.</description>

Class II-Mild symptoms (mild shortness of breath and/or angina) and slight limitation during ordinary activity.
Class III-Marked limitation in activity due to symptoms, even during less-than-ordinary activity, e.g. walking short distances (20—100 meters). Comfortable only at rest.
Class IV-Severe limitations. Experiences symptoms even while at rest. Mostly bedbound patients.

    <certain_agreements>
      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>The Clinical Trial Agreement generally does not restrict an investigator's discussion of trial results after completion. The Agreement permits Amgen a limited period of time to review material discussing trial results (typically up to 45 days and possible extension). Amgen may remove confidential information, but authors have final control and approval of publication content. For multicenter studies, the investigator agrees not to publish any results before the first multi-center publication.</restrictive_agreement>
