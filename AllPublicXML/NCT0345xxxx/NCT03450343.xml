             celiac disease (ie, sprue), prior gastrectomy or upper bowel removal, or any other
             gastrointestinal disorder or defect that would interfere with the absorption,
             distribution, metabolism or excretion of the study drug and/or predispose the subject
             to an increased risk of gastrointestinal toxicity

          7. History of stroke or intracranial hemorrhage within 6 months prior to registration.

             antibody must have negative PCR prior to enrollment.

         11. Seropositive for HIV

         12. Known or suspected hypersensitivity to azacitidine or mannitol

         13. Patients with advanced malignant hepatic tumors

         14. Any condition causing an inability to swallow pills

         15. Receipt of live vaccine within 28 days prior to registration.

         16. Anti-cancer therapy within 21 days prior to registration. Prior radiation therapy
             within 14 days prior to registration.

         17. Any other illness that in the opinion of the investigator, would exclude the patient
