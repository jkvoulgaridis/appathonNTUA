  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To demonstrate that the specificity of the Hummingbird microRNA profile for the diagnosis of
      lung cancer in a cohort of patients who meet current eligibility criteria for lung cancer
      screening in the U.S. is superior to the specificity of LDCT.

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, longitudinal, blinded, observational diagnostic study on 400
      individuals undergoing lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT).

      There will be two patient cohorts: Cohort 1: individuals undergoing their first or subsequent
      annual LDCT screening study; and Cohort 2: individuals referred for a follow-up diagnostic
      chest CT scan due to a lung-RADS category 3 or 4 result on a previous LDCT scan.

      At study enrollment a blood sample will be drawn prior to the LDCT scan. On this blood sample
      a novel lung cancer test relying on microRNA signatures will be evaluated. The results will
      be compared with the CT scan results and follow-up tests including pathology. Histologic
      results and follow-up data will be collected on all patients for a minimum of 12 months
      post-enrollment. During the follow-up period, the results of all diagnostic chest CT scans,
      lung biopsies or lung resections will be captured from the Partners electronic medical record
      and entered into the case report form (CRF).
