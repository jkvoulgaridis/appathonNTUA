  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to explore the safety and the effectiveness of the Tixel device. This
      device performs fractional treatment of the skin by applying thermal (heat) energy to the
      skin. The study shall compare the safety and the effectiveness of the Tixel with the safety
      and the effectiveness of a laser device which is currently cleared for marketing in the US.

             of scarring with therapy); Subjects currently taking long-term oral steroid treatment
             (causing fragility of the skin, risk of hematoma and bullae formation); Subjects
