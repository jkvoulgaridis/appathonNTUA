  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a multinational, multicenter, single-arm, open-label and Phase III Radotinib clinical
      study, chronic phase Ph+ chronic myeloid leukemia patients with failure or intolerance to
      previous TKIs therapy including Imatinib will be recruited. In this phase 3 study, 173
      subjects are expected to be enrolled in a single arm with the administration of Radotinib
      400mg twice daily, which includes 10% of dropout rate.
