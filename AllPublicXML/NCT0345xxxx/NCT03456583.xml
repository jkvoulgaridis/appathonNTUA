    <textblock>
      The Brevera Breast Biopsy System integrates tissue acquisition, real time imaging, and post
      biopsy handling all during the same procedure. This post-market clinical trial will be
      performed to obtain clinical/operational data and feedback on the Brevera Breast Biopsy
      System.

    <description>The Brevera Breast Biopsy System with CorLumina imaging technology is a vacuum-assisted biopsy device, which is used to remove breast tissue in a minimally invasive manner using stereotactic or tomosynthesis imaging. A breast biopsy is a test that removes tissue or sometimes fluid from the suspicious area. The removed cells are examined under a microscope and further tested to check for the presence of breast cancer. A biopsy is a diagnostic procedure that can definitely determine if the suspicious area is cancerous.</description>

          -  Subject has at least one breast imaging finding requiring biopsy for which images are
             available

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who, based on the physician's judgment, may be at increased risk or develop
             complications associated with core removal or biopsy.

          -  Patients receiving anticoagulant therapy or may have bleeding disorders which may put
             the patient at increased risk of procedural complications based upon physicians
             judgment.
