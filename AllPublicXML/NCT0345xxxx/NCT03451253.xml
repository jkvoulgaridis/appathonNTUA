  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will examine the benefit of this amino acid based hydration solution in
      patients with IBD who have undergone a total colectomy and have either ileostomies or
      jpouches. Findings from this study and possible future studies could have broad implications
      for patients with malabsorption resulting from many underlying conditions, including IBD.
