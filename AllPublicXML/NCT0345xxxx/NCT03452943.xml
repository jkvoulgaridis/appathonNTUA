    <measure>Change From Baseline in the TTS of the YGTSS at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>YGTSS rating scale is a semi-structured clinician rating instrument that provides an evaluation of the number, frequency, intensity, complexity, and interference of motor and phonic tics. YGTSS is composed of 11 items: 5 items for motor tic severity, 5 items for vocal tic severity, and 1 item for impairment. Each item for motor tic severity and vocal is rated on a 6-point scale (0 for none to 5 to severe). MTSS is the sum of the 5 items for motor tic severity and VTSS is the sum of the 5 items for vocal tic severity. TTS is the sum of MTSS and VTSS, ranges from 0 (none/absent) to 50 (severe). Higher scores indicate greater severity/worse outcome. Least square (LS) mean and standard error (SE) was calculated using mixed-model repeated-measures (MMRM) with treatment group, week (5 levels: weeks 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12), and the treatment group by week interaction as fixed effects; and baseline TTS, region, and age group at baseline (2 levels: 6 to 11 years, 12 to 16 years) as covariates.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Tourette Syndrome-Clinical Global Impression (TS-CGI) Score at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The TS-CGI scale is a 7-point Likert scale that allows the clinician to use all available information to assess the impact of tics on the participant's quality of life. The TS-CGI is rated as follows: 1 (normal or no tics at all), 2 (borderline), 3 (mild), 4 (moderate), 5 (marked), 6 (severe), and 7 (extreme, incapacitating tics). Lower scores indicate better quality of life. LS mean and SE was calculated using MMRM with treatment group, week (5 levels: weeks 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12), and the treatment group by week interaction as fixed effects; and baseline TTS, region, and age group at baseline (2 levels: 6 to 11 years, 12 to 16 years) as covariates.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Tourette Syndrome-Patient Global Impression of Impact (TS-PGII) Score at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The TS-PGII is a single-item questionnaire that asks the participant to assess the degree of impact due to current tics (How much do your current tics disrupt things in your life?). The TS-PGII uses a 5-point scale, ranging from not at all (1) to very much (5), to assess overall response to therapy.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Child and Adolescent Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome - Quality of Life (C&amp;A-GTS-QOL) Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Subscale Score at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>C&amp;A-GTS-QOL is a 27-item questionnaire that asks participant to assess the extent to which their quality of life is impacted by their symptoms. C&amp;A-GTS-QOL contains 6 subscales (cognitive, coprophenomena, psychological, physical, obsessive-compulsive, and ADL) and uses a 5-point Likert scale ranging from no problem to extreme problem. Following 3 questions from 27-item questionnaire were assessed in ADL C&amp;A-GTS-QOL subscale: Question 2 (Had difficulty with school or sport activities?), 24 (Felt you needed more help or support from other people?), and 26 (Had difficulty going out with other people?). Total score of ADL subscale ranged from 0 (no problem) to 12 (extreme problem). Lower score indicated better quality of life. LS mean and SE was calculated using MMRM with treatment group, week (5 levels: weeks 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12), and treatment group by week interaction as fixed effects; and baseline TTS, region, and age group at baseline (2 levels: 6-11 years, 12-16 years) as covariates.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) to follow-up (Week 14)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that develops or worsens in severity during the conduct of a clinical study and does not necessarily have a causal relationship to the study drug. Relationship of AE to treatment was determined by the Investigator. Serious AEs include death, a life-threatening adverse event, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or an important medical event that jeopardized the participant and required medical intervention to prevent the previously listed serious outcomes. A summary of other non-serious AEs and all serious AEs, regardless of causality is located in Reported AE section.</description>

        <group group_id="P1">
          <title>TEV-50717</title>
          <description>Participants received TEV-50717 as oral tablets at a starting dose of 6 milligrams (mg)/day, with the dose titrated weekly for 7 weeks to an optimal level. The target maximum daily dose was determined by body weight and cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) impairment status at baseline. Maximum total daily dose for participants greater than or equal to (≥) 40 kilograms (kg) was 48 mg/day (24 mg twice daily [BID]), 30 to less than (&lt;) 40 kg was 42 mg/day (21 mg BID), and 20 to &lt;30 kg was 30 mg/day (15 mg BID). For those considered CYP2D6 impaired, maximum daily dose for participants ≥40 kg was 36 mg/day, 30 to &lt;40 kg was 24 mg/day, and 20 to &lt;30 kg was 18 mg/day. Total daily doses of ≥12 mg/day was divided into a BID administration. Depending on the dose, TEV-50717 tablets and/or placebo tablets were taken to maintain the blind. Participants then received TEV-50717 at the optimal level as maintenance therapy daily for 5 weeks.</description>

          <title>Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) Total Tic Score (TTS)</title>
          <description>YGTSS is composed of 11 items: 5 items for motor tic severity, 5 items for vocal tic severity, and 1 item for impairment. Each item for motor tic severity and vocal is rated on a 6-point scale (0 for none to 5 for severe). Motor tic severity score (MTSS) is the sum of 5 items for motor tic severity and vocal tic severity score (VTSS) is the sum of 5 items for vocal tic severity. TTS is the sum of MTSS and VTSS, ranges from 0 (none/absent) to 50 (severe). Higher scores indicate greater severity/worse outcome.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the TTS of the YGTSS at Week 12</title>
        <description>YGTSS rating scale is a semi-structured clinician rating instrument that provides an evaluation of the number, frequency, intensity, complexity, and interference of motor and phonic tics. YGTSS is composed of 11 items: 5 items for motor tic severity, 5 items for vocal tic severity, and 1 item for impairment. Each item for motor tic severity and vocal is rated on a 6-point scale (0 for none to 5 to severe). MTSS is the sum of the 5 items for motor tic severity and VTSS is the sum of the 5 items for vocal tic severity. TTS is the sum of MTSS and VTSS, ranges from 0 (none/absent) to 50 (severe). Higher scores indicate greater severity/worse outcome. Least square (LS) mean and standard error (SE) was calculated using mixed-model repeated-measures (MMRM) with treatment group, week (5 levels: weeks 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12), and the treatment group by week interaction as fixed effects; and baseline TTS, region, and age group at baseline (2 levels: 6 to 11 years, 12 to 16 years) as covariates.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Tourette Syndrome-Clinical Global Impression (TS-CGI) Score at Week 12</title>
        <description>The TS-CGI scale is a 7-point Likert scale that allows the clinician to use all available information to assess the impact of tics on the participant's quality of life. The TS-CGI is rated as follows: 1 (normal or no tics at all), 2 (borderline), 3 (mild), 4 (moderate), 5 (marked), 6 (severe), and 7 (extreme, incapacitating tics). Lower scores indicate better quality of life. LS mean and SE was calculated using MMRM with treatment group, week (5 levels: weeks 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12), and the treatment group by week interaction as fixed effects; and baseline TTS, region, and age group at baseline (2 levels: 6 to 11 years, 12 to 16 years) as covariates.</description>

        <description>C&amp;A-GTS-QOL is a 27-item questionnaire that asks participant to assess the extent to which their quality of life is impacted by their symptoms. C&amp;A-GTS-QOL contains 6 subscales (cognitive, coprophenomena, psychological, physical, obsessive-compulsive, and ADL) and uses a 5-point Likert scale ranging from no problem to extreme problem. Following 3 questions from 27-item questionnaire were assessed in ADL C&amp;A-GTS-QOL subscale: Question 2 (Had difficulty with school or sport activities?), 24 (Felt you needed more help or support from other people?), and 26 (Had difficulty going out with other people?). Total score of ADL subscale ranged from 0 (no problem) to 12 (extreme problem). Lower score indicated better quality of life. LS mean and SE was calculated using MMRM with treatment group, week (5 levels: weeks 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12), and treatment group by week interaction as fixed effects; and baseline TTS, region, and age group at baseline (2 levels: 6-11 years, 12-16 years) as covariates.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events</title>
        <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that develops or worsens in severity during the conduct of a clinical study and does not necessarily have a causal relationship to the study drug. Relationship of AE to treatment was determined by the Investigator. Serious AEs include death, a life-threatening adverse event, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or an important medical event that jeopardized the participant and required medical intervention to prevent the previously listed serious outcomes. A summary of other non-serious AEs and all serious AEs, regardless of causality is located in Reported AE section.</description>

            <description>Participants received TEV-50717 as oral tablets at a starting dose of 6 mg/day, with the dose titrated weekly for 7 weeks to an optimal level. The target maximum daily dose was determined by body weight and CYP2D6 impairment status at baseline. Maximum total daily dose for participants ≥40 kg was 48 mg/day (24 mg BID), 30 to &lt;40 kg was 42 mg/day (21 mg BID), and 20 to &lt;30 kg was 30 mg/day (15 mg BID). For those considered CYP2D6 impaired, maximum daily dose for participants ≥40 kg was 36 mg/day, 30 to &lt;40 kg was 24 mg/day, and 20 to &lt;30 kg was 18 mg/day. Total daily doses of ≥12 mg/day was divided into a BID administration. Depending on the dose, TEV-50717 tablets and/or placebo tablets were taken to maintain the blind. Participants then received TEV-50717 at the optimal level as maintenance therapy daily for 5 weeks.</description>
