    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I study of up to 100 healthy children, ages 6 months to 10 years of age, who
      will receive either Flumist® live, attenuated influenza virus vaccine, quadrivalent (LAIV4)
      or the current Fluzone® inactivated influenza vaccine, quadrivalent (IIV4). The volunteers
      will be enrolled into one of 3 Groups. Volunteers will return each year until 2018-2019 for
      annual flu immunizations and study visits. Questionnaires will be administered annually to
      record demographic characteristics, vaccination history, exposure to animals, day care and
      medically attended illness. There are no exclusions for gender, ethnicity or race.

      Volunteers in the Non-twin Flu/MMRV naive group will also receive the measles, mumps, rubella
      and varicella (MMRV) vaccine at approximately 12-15 months of age (to be administered by the
      volunteers' personal pediatrician, not as a study vaccine). They will then come for a study
      visit to collect blood 60 days later.

      Each twin is counted as a single participant. All reporting numbers reflect the number of
      participants, not the number of twin pairs.

    <description>Monozygotic twins, 2-5 yo (annual return): In 2014-2015, individual twin participants will be given FluMist® a live, attenuated influenza vaccine quadrivalent (LAIV4) intranasally. Vaccine non-naive participants will return annually for flu immunization and for blood samples on Days 0, 7 and 60 post-immunization. Vaccine naive children will receive two immunizations in the first year, 28 days apart then return annually for flu immunization. Blood samples will be obtained on Days 0, 7 and 60 post second-immunization. Beginning in 2015-2016, participants in this arm will receive Fluzone® inactivated influenza vaccine quadrivalent (IIV4) as an intramuscular (IM) injection annually following Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendation against LAIV4.</description>

    <description>Non-twins 6 mo-10 years (annual return): In 2014-2015, participants between 6-23 mo will be given Fluzone® inactivated influenza vaccine quadrivalent (IIV4) IM then switch to FluMist® a live, attenuated influenza vaccine quadrivalent (LAIV4) intranasally starting at age 24 months in annual follow-up. Participants aged 24 mo-8 yo will be given LAIV4 at enrollment and for annual follow-up. However, if LAIV4 is contraindicated, the child will continue with IIV4. Participants 9-10 yo will be given IIV4 annually. Vaccine non-naive participants will return annually for flu immunization and for blood samples on Days 0 and 60 post immunization. Vaccine naive children will get two doses of vaccine the first year then return annually for flu immunization and blood samples on Day 0 and 60 post second immunization. Beginning in 2015-2016, all participants in this arm will receive Fluzone® inactivated influenza vaccine quadrivalent (IIV4) annually following ACIP recommendation against LAIV4.</description>

In Year 1, participants will return for a second flu immunization at least 28 days later and for blood samples on Days 0 and 60 post-second immunization and on Day 60 post MMRV (to be given by primary care physician). In Years 2-5, participants will return annually for Fluzone® IIV4 flu immunization and for blood samples on Days 0 and 60 post-immunization.</description>
