    <textblock>
      The oscillations of ultrasound (US) contrast agent microbubbles under their activation by US
      waves engender a modulation of the permeability of biological barriers amplifying hence the
      extravasation of drugs and/or fluorescent markers through a process known as sonoporation. In
      such a way, the bioavailability of the therapeutic agent is augmented only in the area where
      US waves are focused. The objective now is to translate this therapeutic approach to the
      clinic by performing a feasibility study with the development of a therapy regime optimized
      for hepatic metastases of colorectal cancer.

      In order to demonstrate the clinical feasibility of the therapeutic approach based on
      ultrasound and microbubbles, we will focus on patients with liver metastases of colorectal
      cancer treated with monoclonal antibodies in combination with chemotherapy.

    <textblock>
      Despite the increasing number of active molecules and the availability of news targeted
      therapies for cancer, therapeutic achievements remain modest for a number of tumor types. One
      of the major obstacles is inherent to the absence of specific delivery in the tumor tissue.

      We have demonstrated recently that the oscillations of ultrasound (US) contrast agent
      microbubbles under their activation by US waves engender a modulation of the permeability of
      biological barriers amplifying hence the extravasation of drugs and/or fluorescent markers
      through a process known as sonoporation. In such a way, the bioavailability of the
      therapeutic agent is augmented only in the area where US waves are focused. The objective now
      is to translate this therapeutic approach to the clinic by performing a feasibility study
      with the development of a therapy regime optimized for hepatic metastases of colorectal
      cancer.

      In order to demonstrate the clinical feasibility of the therapeutic approach based on
      ultrasound and microbubbles, we will focus on patients with liver metastases of colorectal
      cancer treated with monoclonal antibodies in combination with chemotherapy.

      The work aims into evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of the proposed approach on a number
      of selected patients. We will follow the usual treatment schemes and we will apply imaging
      protocols to visualize tumor progression.

      This technique of optimization of the intratumoral availability of anticancer drugs and based
      on sonoporation will improve the efficacy and safety of systemic chemotherapy by providing
      increased tumor uptake relative to normal tissue. This technique provides an ideal and easy
      strategy to optimize intratumoral drug delivery.
