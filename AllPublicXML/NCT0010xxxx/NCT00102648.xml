      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of lonafarnib when given together
      with temozolomide and to see how well they work in treating patients with glioblastoma
      multiforme that is has come back or did not respond to previous treatment with temozolomide.
      Lonafarnib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell
      growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by
      stopping them from spreading. Giving lonafarnib together with temozolomide may kill more
      tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose Sarasar (SCH66336, lonafarnib) when combined with
      Temodar (temozolomide) in an alternating week schedule.

      II. To describe the toxicities of the Sarasar and Temodar combination treatment using this
      dosing schedule.

      III. To evaluate response as measured by 6-month progression-free survival and objective
      tumor response.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of lonafarnib.

      Patients receive temozolomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-7 and 15-21 and
      lonafarnib PO twice daily (BID) on days 8-14 and 22-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for
      up to 24 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.

    <description>In the historical dataset, the proportion of patients remaining alive and free from progression at 6 months was 15% (95% confidence interval for ranged from 10% to 19%). We will set p0 to 15% and we will set p1 to 30% (looking for a doubling of the 6-month PFS rate). Based on these design parameters, a two-stage design would require that at least 4 of the initial 19 patients are without progression at 6 months.</description>

             gliosarcoma

          -  Patients must have shown unequivocal evidence for tumor recurrence or progression by
             magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan after radiation therapy; the scan done prior to
             study entry documenting progression will be reviewed by the treating physician to
             document tumor volume changes to provide a gross assessment of growth rate

          -  Patients may have had as many as 2 prior chemotherapy regimens for recurrent or
             progressive tumor; patients must have had prior treatment with Temodar but may not
             have had prior treatment with farnesyl transferase inhibitors (Sarasar or Zarnestra);
             patients in phase 1b expansion are required to have received a minimum of two cycles
             of adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ)

          -  All patients must sign an informed consent indicating that they are aware of the
             investigational nature of this study in keeping with the policies of this hospital

          -  Patients must have shown unequivocal evidence for tumor progression by MRI or computed
             tomography (CT) scan; a scan should be performed within 14 days prior to registration
             and on a steroid dose that has been stable or decreasing for at least 5 days; if the
             steroid dose is increased between the date of imaging and registration a new baseline
             magnetic resonance (MR)/CT is required; the same type of scan, i.e., MRI or CT must be
             used throughout the period of protocol treatment for tumor measurement

          -  Patients (pts) having had recent resection of recurrent or progressive tumor are
             eligible as long as:

               -  Patients must be status post surgical resection at least 2 weeks prior to study
                  enrollment, have recovered from surgery, have adequate early wound healing and a
                  Karnofsky performance status of &gt; or = 60

               -  Residual disease following resection of recurrent tumor is not mandated for
                  eligibility into the study; a CT/MRI should be done within 96 hours (hrs) post-op
                  or at least 4 weeks (wks) post-op (within 14 days of registration); if the
                  steroid dose is increased between the scan date and registration, a new baseline
                  MRI/CT is required on a stable steroid dose for 5 days

          -  Patients must have a Karnofsky performance status of &gt;= 60

          -  Patients must have recovered from the toxic effects of prior therapy: 4 weeks from
             prior cytotoxic therapy and/or at least two weeks from vincristine, 6 weeks from
             nitrosoureas, 3 weeks from procarbazine administration, and 1 week for non-cytotoxic
             agents, e.g., interferon, tamoxifen, thalidomide, cis-retinoic acid, etc.
             (radiosensitizer does not count); any questions related to the definition of
             non-cytotoxic agents should be directed to the study chair
