  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of AMG 531 in the treatment of
      thrombocytopenia in subjects with ITP as measured by the platelet response. This study will
      also evaluate changes in Patient Reported Outcomes and Health Resource Utilization due to
      treatment with AMG 531.

             screening and pre-treatment periods) must be:

          -  * less than 30 x 10^9/L for those subjects not receiving any ITP therapy, with no
             count greater than 35 x 10^9/L,

          -  * less than 50 x 10^9/L for those subjects receiving a constant dose schedule of

          -  IV Ig or anti-D Ig within 2 weeks before the screening visit

          -  Rituximab (for any indication) within 14 weeks before the screening visit or
             anticipated use during the time of the proposed study

          -  Received hematopoietic growth factors, including IL-11 (oprelvekin) within 4 weeks

             thrombopoietin (rHuTPO), AMG 531 or related platelet product

          -  Received any aklylating agents within 8 weeks before the screening visit or
             anticipated use during the time of the proposed study

          -  Less than 4 weeks since receipt of any therapeutic drug or device that is not FDA
             approved for any indication before the screening period
