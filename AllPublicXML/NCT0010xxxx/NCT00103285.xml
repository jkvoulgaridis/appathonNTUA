    <textblock>
      This randomized phase III trial is studying different combination chemotherapy regimens and
      comparing how well they work in treating patients with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic
      leukemia. Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer
      cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one
      drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more cancer cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether the substitution of three intensified phases of post-Induction
      treatment for standard phases will improve the event free survival (EFS) of children with
      SR-average acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).

      II. Determine whether the substitution of intensified Consolidation for standard
      Consolidation will improve the EFS of children with SR-average ALL.

      III. To determine whether the addition of four doses of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy
      (PEG) asparaginase, given once every three weeks during Consolidation and Interim Maintenance
      phases, will improve the EFS for children with SR-low ALL.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Identify potentially modifiable factors associated with impaired health related quality of
      life (HRQOL) at different periods of therapy in the patients who are SR-average enrolled on
      the standard risk ALL study.

      II. Determine the critical time periods when future intervention studies to mitigate adverse
      HRQOL outcomes should occur.

      III. Correlate day 29 minimal residual disease (MRD) with EFS and overall survival (OS) of
      patients treated with these regimens.

      IV. Correlate early marrow response with day 29 MRD status. V. To improve outcome by
      identifying additional high risk patients by Day 29 MRD for treatment with fully augmented
      Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM).

      VI. To examine the relative contributions of genetic factors and early treatment response to
      outcome by comparing the outcome of patients with and without TEL-AML1 fusion or triple
      trisomy and low levels of MRD at end Induction who are treated with identical therapy on the
      standard arms of the SR-low and SR-average trials.

      OUTLINE: This is a 2-part, partially randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to early response to study induction therapy (rapid early response [standard risk
      (SR)-low or SR-average acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)] vs slow early response [SR-high
      ALL]). After completion of induction therapy but before proceeding to part II therapy,
      patients are assigned to 1 of 3 groups based on stratification.

      PART I:

      INDUCTION THERAPY: All patients receive cytarabine intrathecally (IT) on day 1; vincristine
      IV on days 1, 8, 15, and 22; dexamethasone IV or orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28;
      pegaspargase intramuscularly (IM) (may give IV over 1 to 2 hours) on day 4, 5, or 6; and
      methotrexate IT on days 8 and 29 (and days 15 and 22 for patients with CNS3 disease).
      Patients with Down syndrome (DS) receive leucovorin calcium PO at 48 and 60 hours after each
      dose of methotrexate IT. Patients are assessed for response on day 29. Patients with M1 bone
      marrow AND minimal residual disease (MRD) &lt; 0.1% OR MRD &gt;= 0.1% and &lt; 1% proceed to therapy
      in part II. Patients with M2 bone marrow OR M1 bone marrow AND MRD &gt;= 1% proceed to extended
      induction therapy. Patients with M3 bone marrow are removed from the study.

      EXTENDED INDUCTION THERAPY: Patients receive dexamethasone IV or PO BID on days 1-14;
      vincristine IV on days 1 and 8; pegaspargase IM on day 4, 5, or 6; and daunorubicin
      hydrochloride IV over 15 minutes to 2 hours on day 1. Patients with M1 bone marrow and MRD &lt;
      1% after extended induction therapy proceed to therapy in part II. Patients with M2 or M3
      bone marrow after extended induction therapy are removed from the study.

             and intrathecal cytarabine; intrathecal chemotherapy with cytarabine is allowed prior
             to registration for patient convenience; this is usually done at the time of the
             diagnostic bone marrow or venous line placement to avoid a second lumbar puncture;
             (Note: the central nervous system [CNS] status must be determined based on a sample

          -  Patients receiving prior steroid therapy may be eligible for AALL0331 study

             which validated surveys exist

          <description>All patients receive cytarabine intrathecally (IT) on day 1; vincristine IV on days 1, 8, 15, and 22; dexamethasone IV or orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28; pegaspargase intramuscularly (IM) (may give IV over 1 to 2 hours) on day 4, 5, or 6; and methotrexate IT on days 8 and 29 (and days 15 and 22 for patients with CNS3 disease). Patients with Down syndrome (DS) receive leucovorin calcium PO at 48 and 60 hours after each dose of methotrexate IT. Patients are assessed for response on day 29. Patients with M1 bone marrow AND minimal residual disease (MRD) &lt; 0.1% OR MRD &gt;= 0.1% and &lt; 1% proceed to therapy in part II. Patients with M2 bone marrow OR M1 bone marrow AND MRD &gt;= 1% proceed to extended induction therapy. Patients with M3 bone marrow are removed from the study.

          <description>All patients receive cytarabine intrathecally (IT) on day 1; vincristine IV on days 1, 8, 15, and 22; dexamethasone IV or orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28; pegaspargase intramuscularly (IM) (may give IV over 1 to 2 hours) on day 4, 5, or 6; and methotrexate IT on days 8 and 29 (and days 15 and 22 for patients with CNS3 disease). Patients with Down syndrome (DS) receive leucovorin calcium PO at 48 and 60 hours after each dose of methotrexate IT. Patients are assessed for response on day 29. Patients with M1 bone marrow AND minimal residual disease (MRD) &lt; 0.1% OR MRD &gt;= 0.1% and &lt; 1% proceed to therapy in part II. Patients with M2 bone marrow OR M1 bone marrow AND MRD &gt;= 1% proceed to extended induction therapy. Patients with M3 bone marrow are removed from the study.

        <title>Health-related Quality of Life Relative to Physical, Social and Emotional Impairment</title>
        <description>To identify potentially modifiable factors associated with impaired health related quality of life (HRQOL) at different periods of therapy in the patients who are SR-average enrolled on the standard risk ALL study.Standardized scores will be computed for child function using the gender and age-adjusted scores available from normative data from a healthy population of about 10,000 children. The various domains of family functioning will be assessed using well-validated instruments and analyzed as a dichotomous variable (impaired vs. non-impaired family functioning). Multiple regression analysis will be used to test the effect of family functioning (adjusted for therapy given, age at diagnosis, gender, socioeconomic status and other factors) on child function.</description>

          <description>All patients receive cytarabine intrathecally (IT) on day 1; vincristine IV on days 1, 8, 15, and 22; dexamethasone IV or orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28; pegaspargase intramuscularly (IM) (may give IV over 1 to 2 hours) on day 4, 5, or 6; and methotrexate IT on days 8 and 29 (and days 15 and 22 for patients with CNS3 disease). Patients with Down syndrome (DS) receive leucovorin calcium PO at 48 and 60 hours after each dose of methotrexate IT. Patients are assessed for response on day 29. Patients with M1 bone marrow AND minimal residual disease (MRD) &lt; 0.1% OR MRD &gt;= 0.1% and &lt; 1% proceed to therapy in part II. Patients with M2 bone marrow OR M1 bone marrow AND MRD &gt;= 1% proceed to extended induction therapy. Patients with M3 bone marrow are removed from the study.
