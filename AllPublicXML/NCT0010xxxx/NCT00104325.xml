      Background:

      - National Institute on Aging researchers are looking at studies that require large numbers
      of white blood cells for lab use. Standard blood samples do not provide enough white blood
      cells for these studies. Researchers want to use cytapheresis to collect white blood cells
      from volunteer donors. This procedure can collect larger amounts of white blood cells and
      reduce the amount of fluid and other cells that are lost.

      Objectives:

      - To use cytapheresis to collect white blood cells for study.

      Eligibility:

      - Healthy blood donors at least 18 years of age.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened according to the usual blood donation procedures.

        -  Participants will provide white blood cells through cytapheresis. The blood cells will
           be collected in a machine that separates the white blood cells from the rest of the
           blood. The rest of the blood will be returned to the donor.

        -  Participants may have this type of donation every 56 days (six times per year). They
           will be asked to become a repeat donor. A donation schedule may be set up.

        -  Once a year, participants will have blood tests to continue to be eligible as a donor.

      Cytapheresis is an automated method/process of cell removal and collection that involves a
      continuous flow cell separation by centrifugation and the withdrawal of a particular blood
      component. This allows blood components not collected to be continuously

      returned to the donor. Guidance and recommendations for the performance of these procedures
      are provided in detail in the Standards of the American Association of Blood Banks (AABB) and
      in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).

      The study objective is to provide white blood cells obtained by cytapheresis to National
      Institute on Aging (NIA) researchers for other in-vitro research studies.

      The study population consists of healthy males and females 18 years and older. Study subjects
      are anticipated to be non-patient community volunteers. Individuals will not be excluded
      based on gender, race or ethnicity. The number of subjects to be enrolled will

      be 10, 000. This will allow us to try and maintain 200 active participants in this protocol.
      Volunteers are screened initially and annually by a health history questionnaire and
      laboratory testing to screen for bleeding or immune disorders. Participants may undergo a
      cytapheresis procedure every fifty-six days.

      We will collect blood component cells for distribution to NIA research investigators for
      their studies of the immune system. We will be performing cytapheresis for the collection of
      3 7 blood component packs per week. We will need to maintain an active volunteer pool of
      approximately 200 active volunteers.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Normal healthy males and females, age 18 years and older

          -  Adequate venous access in bilateral upper extremities to accommodate at least a #18
             gauge dialysis needle.

          -  Willingness and ability to come to the NIA Apheresis Unit at Harbor Hospital in
             Baltimore for a blood collection procedure approximately every 56 days.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Unable to verify identification of volunteer by state issued ID card, driver s
             license, or military ID. Participants earning greater than $600.00/year areissued a
             1099 form, therefore, positive identification is required.

          -  Unable to provide informed consent

          -  Weight less than 110 pounds as mandated by AABB guidelines.

          -  Chronic Immunosuppressive medications such as Steroids, Cellcept or Sirolimus.
             Steroids given for minor illness ok if taken more than 6 weeks before any cytapherisis
             procedure. Immunosuppressive medications may not be used at the time of the
             cytapheresis procedure as they decrease circulating white blood cells.

          -  Test results are positive for viral infections such as HIV, Hepatitis B or C and RPR.
             Researchers are seeking healthy, pristine cells. Due to the ongoing nature of these
             chronic viral and bacterial infections, the white cell populations in the peripheral
             blood will change. Researchers want to study changing white cell populations as a
             factor of aging only and not those altered by infections.

          -  Ongoing risk factors for HIV or Hepatitis B or C such as: intravenous drug use,
             non-monogamous unprotected intercourse, or chronic use of clotting factor concentrates
             such as prothrombin complexes, Factor XIII or Factor VIIa. These viruses weaken the
             immune system and cause changes in the white blood cells.

          -  Risk factors for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease such as: a relative with the disease,
             received beef insulin or growth hormone from human pituitary glands, or
             residency/travel to high risk countries (complete list of countries located in the
             Cytapheresis Screening manual kept in the NIA apheresis unit). This is a transmittable
             infectious disease with a very long incubation period.

          -  Major medical illnesses such as any type of liquid or solid tumor cancer, diabetes,
             history of deep vein thrombosis, organ or bone marrow transplant, or liver, kidney,
             heart or lung disease.

          -  A medical finding that shows a participant could not safely go through this procedure.
             (such as Parkinson s disease, dementia or any uncontrolled behavior that would place
             the participant s safety at risk)

          -  Major infectious diseases such as Chagas disease, babesiosis, syphilis or malaria

          -  Bleeding conditions such as hemophilia or von Willebrand s disease.

          -  Significant abnormalities are found in the results of blood tests such as elevated
             liver enzymes, abnormal kidney function, positive viral titers, fasting blood glucose
             greater than 120.

          -  On any medication that can alter white blood cell function such as chronic steroid
             use, histamine-2 blockers, antivirals or chemotherapy. (complete list located in the
             Cytapheresis Screening manual stored in the NIA Apheresis unit).

        In addition, eligible participants may not be able to participate in a specific
        cytapheresis procedure but might be eligible at a later date for:

          1. Pregnancy and Nursing Mothers - Females who are pregnant or who have had a pregnancy
             in the last 6 weeks are temporarily deferred. They may resume apheresis participation
             6 weeks after delivery or cessation of lactation and have been cleared by their
             obstetrician or primary care physician.

          2. Medications: Volunteers taking the following medications would be deferred:

               -  Antibiotics, antifungals, antimalarials: Deferred for 2 weeks after course has
                  been completed and volunteer is feeling well.

               -  Temporary steroids (tapers): Deferred for 72 hours after symptoms are resolved
                  and prescription is completed if taken orally, intravenously, or intramuscular.
                  No deferral if taken intranasal or for joint injection.

               -  Hepatitis B immune globulin: Volunteers are deferred 6 months if given after
                  exposure to hepatitis B to insure the volunteer has not been infected. If
                  administered for prophylaxis, no deferral is necessary.

               -  Live Attenuated Virus Vaccinations: Defer for 4 weeks if symptom-free.

               -  Inactivated (Killed Virus) Vaccinations: Defer for 2 weeks if symptom-free.

                  accept immediately if symptom-free.

               -  Smallpox Vaccine: Deferred until the scab has separated from the skin
                  spontaneously or 21 days from date of immunization, whichever is longer, if
                  volunteer had no other symptoms or complications. Visual verification of absence
                  of vaccine scab is required. If scab was otherwise removed (not spontaneously
                  separated), defer for 2 months after vaccination date.

               -  Blood thinners such as Plavix, Ticlid or Lovenox. Deferral for 5 days after last
                  dose to decrease bleeding risk at needle puncture sites. Participants are not
                  deferred for the use of aspirin or aspirin products.

               -  Experimental Medication or Unlicensed (Experimental) Vaccine is usually
                  associated with a research protocol and the effect on blood donation is unknown.
                  Deferral is one year unless otherwise indicated by the Principal Investigator.

          3. Temporary health issues

               -  Infection or fever: Deferred until 2 weeks after antibiotics are completed and
                  volunteer is feeling well.

                  to normal activities by primary care physician or surgeon.

               -  Close contact with someone else s blood, accidental needle-stick, treatment for
                  syphilis or gonorrhea Volunteers are deferred for 6 months to insure they have
                  not been infected. Viral/serology testing will be repeated and verified as
                  negative prior to apheresis procedure.

               -  Factors that are high risk (but are non on-going) for HIV, Hepatitis B or C such
                  as: (Volunteers will be deferred for 6 months after to insure they have not been
                  infected with an infectious disease or virus. Viral testing and annual labs will
                  be repeated and verified as within normal limits prior to apheresis procedure)

                  i. Having sexual contact with anyone who has HIV/AIDS or has had a positive test
                  for the HIV/AIDS virus

                  procedure.

               -  It is less than six weeks since participation in another research study which is
                  felt by the Principal Investigator to be incompatible with this study. (for
                  example: studies that collect blood, investigational drug studies, vaccine
                  trials, etc)

          4. Travel:

               -  Malaria-endemic countries: Volunteers who are residents of such countries will be
                  deferred for 3 years after departure from the country if they remain free from
                  unexplained symptoms suggestive for malaria. Residence is defined as a continuous
                  stay of longer than 5 years in a country or countries having any malaria-endemic
                  area. Donors who are not prior residents of malaria-endemic countries and travel
                  to a malaria-endemic area will be deferred for 12 months after departure from
                  that area. The duration of travel to a malaria-endemic area is defined as more
                  than 24 hours to less than 5 years. Note that a passage greater than 24 hours
                  through a malaria-endemic area while on route to a malaria-free area is
                  considered a sufficient possible exposure to trigger deferral.
