  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if Sarizotan HC1 1 mg b.i.d. (taken twice a day) is
      effective in the treatment of dyskinesia associated with dopaminergic treatment of
      Parkinson's disease (PD).

    <measure>Responder Rate Based on Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Items 32 and 33 at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Responder rate was defined as the percentage of subjects with 25% improvement compared to baseline in the sum of UPDRS scores for items 32 and 33. The UPDRS was an investigator-assessed rating tool to follow the longitudinal course of Parkinson's disease. Items 32 and 33 assessed duration of dyskinesia and disability due to dyskinesia, respectively. Both items were rated on a 0 to 4-point scale, where higher scores indicated higher duration of dyskinesia and more disability due to dyskinesia, respectively. The Items 32 and 33 composite score was sum of the individual item scores and ranged from 0 to 8, where higher score indicated more complications due to dyskinesia.</description>

    <description>The UPDRS was an investigator-assessed rating tool to follow the longitudinal course of Parkinson's disease. Each item from 18 to 31 was rated on a scale ranging from 0 to 4, where higher scores indicated higher complications due to dyskinesia. The total score was the sum of the individual item scores and ranged from 0 to 56, where higher score indicated more complications due to dyskinesia. Change = Week 12 - Baseline.</description>

        <title>Responder Rate Based on Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Items 32 and 33 at Week 12</title>
        <description>Responder rate was defined as the percentage of subjects with 25% improvement compared to baseline in the sum of UPDRS scores for items 32 and 33. The UPDRS was an investigator-assessed rating tool to follow the longitudinal course of Parkinson's disease. Items 32 and 33 assessed duration of dyskinesia and disability due to dyskinesia, respectively. Both items were rated on a 0 to 4-point scale, where higher scores indicated higher duration of dyskinesia and more disability due to dyskinesia, respectively. The Items 32 and 33 composite score was sum of the individual item scores and ranged from 0 to 8, where higher score indicated more complications due to dyskinesia.</description>
