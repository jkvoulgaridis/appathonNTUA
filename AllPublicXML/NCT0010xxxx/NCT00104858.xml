    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well fludarabine phosphate with radiation therapy and
      rituximab followed by donor stem cell infusions work in treating patients with high-risk
      chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) with low side effects.
      Nonmyeloablative stem cell transplants use low doses of chemotherapy (fludarabine phosphate)
      and radiation to suppress the patient's immune system enough to prevent rejection of the
      donor's stem cells. Following infusion of donor stem cells, a mixture of the patient's and
      the donor's stem cells will exist and is called &quot;mixed chimerism&quot;. Donor cells will attack
      the patient's leukemia. This is called the &quot;graft-versus-leukemia&quot; effect. Rituximab will be
      given 3 days before and three times after infusing stem cells to help in controlling CLL
      early after transplant till the &quot;graft-versus-leukemia&quot; takes control. Further, rituximab
      could augment the &quot;graft-versus-leukemia&quot; effect by activating donor immune cells and hence
      improve disease control. Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can also attack the
      body's normal cells. Giving cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil after the transplant may
      stop this from happening.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine whether nonmyeloablative conditioning and allogeneic hematopoietic cell
      transplantation (HCT) improves survival at 18 months for patients with fludarabine
      (fludarabine phosphate)-refractory, fludarabine/cyclophosphamide/rituximab (FCR)-failed, or
      del 17p CLL over that of historical controls (45% at 18 months) given CAMPATH-1H
      (alemtuzumab).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate the overall response rate (complete remission [CR] + partial remission [PR]) by
      standard morphologic, flow cytometric, and molecular techniques.

      II. Assess the rate of relapse/progression.

      III. Define incidences of regimen-related toxicities (RRT) and infections within the first
      100 days and the incidence of transplant-related mortality (TRM) within the first year.

      IV. Estimate incidences of grade II-III and III-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and
      chronic GVHD.

      V. Determine whether the addition of rituximab to the nonmyeloablative conditioning and
      allogeneic HCT improves survival at 18 months over our historical data (57% at 18 months).

      VI. Determine the incidence of serious adverse events with the addition of rituximab in
      comparison to historical data of unrelated nonmyeloablative HCT.

      VII. Evaluate the pharmacokinetics of rituximab.

      VIII. Evaluate B-cell and T-cell immune reconstitution in comparison to historical data of
      unrelated nonmyeloablative HCT.

      IX. Describe donor and host polymorphisms of the FCgammaRIIIa receptor and cluster of
      differentiation (CD)32 and evaluate their impact on disease response and relapse.

      X. Investigate the mechanism of disease resistance in relapsed/nonresponding patients.

      XI. Isolate donor cytotoxic T lymphocytes specific for host minor histocompatibility
      antigens.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive a conditioning regimen comprising fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV)
      on days -4 to -2 and rituximab IV on days -3, 10, 24, and 38.

      Patients undergo single fraction low-dose total-body irradiation (TBI) on day 0. After
      completion of TBI, patients undergo allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)
      on day 0. Patients then receive rituximab IV on days 10, 24, and 38.

      Patients receive an immunosuppressive regimen comprising cyclosporine orally (PO) twice daily
      (BID) on days -3 to 56 followed by a taper to day 180 (related recipients) or on days -3 to
      100 followed by a taper to day 180 (unrelated recipients). Patients also receive
      mycophenolate mofetil PO BID on days 0-27 (related recipients) or three times daily (TID) on
      days 0-40 followed by a taper to day 96 (unrelated recipients).

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 months, 1 year, 18 months,
      2 years, and then annually thereafter.

               -  Failed to meet National Cancer Institute (NCI) Working Group criteria 2 for
                  complete or partial response after 2 cycles of therapy with regimen containing
                  fludarabine (or another nucleoside analog, e.g. cladribine [2-CDA], pentostatin)
                  or with disease relapse within 12 months after completing therapy with a
                  fludarabine (or another nucleoside analog) containing regimen

               -  Failed FCR or pentostatin/cyclophosphamide/rituximab (PCR) combination
                  chemotherapy at any time point

               -  Patients with novo or acquired &quot;17p deletion&quot; cytogenetic abnormality; patients
                  should have received induction treatment but could be transplanted in 1st CR

          -  Patients who have suitable human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched related or unrelated
             donors willing to receive filgrastim (G-CSF), undergo leukapheresis to collect
             peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC), and to donate stem cells

          -  RELATED DONORS: When more than one potential donor exists, priority should be given to
             donors based on HLA identity &gt; cytomegalovirus (CMV) seronegativity &gt; ABO
             compatibility &gt; sex matching

               -  Donor who is HLA phenotypically or genotypically identical at the allele level at
                  HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, and -DQB1

               -  Must consent to G-CSF administration and leukapheresis;

               -  Must have adequate veins for leukapheresis or agree to placement of central
                  venous catheter (femoral, subclavian);

               -  Only G-CSF mobilized PBMC only will be permitted as a hematopoietic stem cell
                  (HSC) source on this protocol

               -  Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC) matching allowed will be Grades
                  1.0 to 2.1; Unrelated donors who are prospectively:

                  high resolution typing

          -  UNRELATED DONORS: Donors are excluded when preexisting immunoreactivity is identified
             that would jeopardize donor hematopoietic cell engraftment; this determination is
             based on the standard practice of the individual institution; recommended procedure
             for patients with 10 of 10 HLA allele level (phenotypic) match is to obtain a panel
             reactive antibody screens to class I and II antigens for all patients before HCT; if
             the PRA shows &gt; 10% activity, then flow cytometric or B and T cell cytotoxic cross
             matches should be obtained; the donor should be excluded if any of the cytotoxic cross
             match assays are positive; for those patients with an HLA Class I allele mismatch,
             flow cytometric or B and T cell cytotoxic cross matches should be obtained regardless
             of the PRA results; a positive anti-donor cytotoxic crossmatch is an absolute donor
             exclusion

          -  UNRELATED DONORS: Patient and donor pairs homozygous at a mismatched allele in the
             graft rejection vector are considered a two-allele mismatch, i.e., the patient is
             A*0101 and the donor is A*0102, and this type of mismatch is not allowed

          -  UNRELATED DONORS: Only G-CSF mobilized PBMC will be permitted as a HSC source on this
             protocol
