      RATIONALE: Sorafenib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, work in different ways
      to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Giving sorafenib together with docetaxel may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying giving sorafenib together with docetaxel to see how
      well it works in treating patients with metastatic androgen-independent prostate cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the proportion of patients achieving a 50% reduction in serum PSA from
           baseline in patients with androgen-independent prostate cancer (AIPC) receiving
           sorafenib tosylate and docetaxel.

      Secondary

        -  To estimate the progression-free survival of patients with AIPC.

        -  To quantify the number and percent of patients who have stable disease at 6 months of
           therapy (failure to progress).

        -  To estimate median time to progression for all patients.

        -  To estimate the objective response rate of patients with AIPC treated with this regimen.

        -  To measure the percentage of patients surviving at 2 years.

        -  To determine the toxicities and estimate toxicity rates for patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  To measure changes in tumor vasculature in response to therapy in selected patients with
           dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) and correlate primary and secondary objectives
           to these measurement changes.

        -  To measure changes in serum HMGB1 in response to therapy and correlate primary and
           secondary objectives with these changes.

        -  To measure changes in serum cathepsin D in response to therapy and correlate primary and
           secondary objectives with these changes.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily on days 2-19 and docetaxel IV
      on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 10 courses. Patients then receive oral
      sorafenib tosylate alone twice daily on days 1-19 with treatment repeating every 21 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo blood collection periodically to measure serum HMGB1 and cathepsin D levels
      before and after therapy.
