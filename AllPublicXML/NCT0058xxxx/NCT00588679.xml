  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the benefits of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
      combined with Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging (MRSI), on an instrument called a 3.0
      Tesla (T) MR scanner.

    <description>Patients taking part in this study will have one MRI and one MRSI scan acquired in succession during a single MR examination. For those patients who have undergone prostate biopsy it is recommended that this should be done at least eight weeks after the prostate biopsy and should take one hour to one hour and ten minutes total to complete.</description>

    <description>All MR examinations will be performed on a 3.0 Tesla whole body GE MR scanner located at the main campus (1275 York Avenue) or the Breast and Imaging Center (BAIC)(located on Second Ave. between 65th and 66th Streets). The MR examination will include MR imaging and spectroscopic imaging employing a combined torso phased array and endorectal coil receiver. The examination will require one hour to one hour and ten minutes.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient must have clinically suspected or biopsy proven prostate cancer. If a patient
             has been diagnosed with prostate cancer an official report of biopsy from MSKCC or
             outside site is required. All outside pathology reports will be confirmed at MSKCC.

          -  For those patients who have undergone prostate biopsy it is recommended that the
             interval between biopsy and protocol MRI/MRSI should be at least 8 weeks.

          -  Patient is a potential surgical candidate for treatment of prostate cancer

          -  Patient is willing to undergo an endorectal MRI/MRSI exam on the 3.0T MR scanner

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who because of general medical or psychiatric condition, or physiologic
             status unrelated to the presence of prostate cancer cannot give valid informed
             consent.

          -  Patients who are unwilling or unable to undergo MRI/MRSI (including patients with
             contra-indications to MRI such as the presence of cardiac pacemakers or non-compatible
             intracranial vascular clips.

          -  Patients who cannot tolerate or have contra-indications to endorectal coil insertion;
             for example, patients who have had a prior abdominoperineal resection of the rectum or
             have Crohn's disease, patients with severe hemorrhoids, patients who have had prior
             radiation to the pelvis to treat a malignancy, or patients who have had minor rectal
             surgery within the previous 8 weeks.

          -  Patients with an allergic reaction to latex.

          -  Patients with a metallic hip implant or any other metallic implant or device in the
             pelvis that might distort local magnetic field and compromise quality of MRI/MRSI.
