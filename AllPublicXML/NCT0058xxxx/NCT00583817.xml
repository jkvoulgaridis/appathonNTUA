      The purpose of this study is to assess the role endovascular therapy to treat aortic disease
      involving the ascending aorta, the aortic arch, and the visceral segment of the aorta (or
      thoracoabdominal aorta)

      This study is a prospective, non-randomized, single-site evaluation of the use of novel
      endovascular technology to treat complex aortic disease.

      In an effort to allow for the evaluation of patients with both complex anatomic condition and
      challenging physiologic situations there are three study subsections as follows:

        1. Ascending Arm Protocol: The intended use of the study is to provide endovascular therapy
           to patients with ascending aortic pathology including aneurysm, pseudoaneurysm, and/or
           aortic dissection who are considered high risk for conventional surgery. This will
           involve disease in the aorta from the sinotubular junction to the innominate artery.

        2. Aortic Arch Arm Protocol: The intended use of the study is to provide endovascular
           therapy to patients with aortic arch pathology including aneurysm, pseudoaneurysm and/or
           aortic dissection who are considered high risk for conventional surgery. This will
           involve disease in aorta from the sinotubular junction to descending thoracic aorta.

        3. Thoracobabdominal Aortic Arm Protocol: The intended use of the study is to provide
           endovascular therapy to patients with thoracoabdominal aortic pathology including aortic
           aneurysms, renal aneurysms, and superior mesenteric artery aneurysms. This will involve
           the aorta from the left carotid artery origin through the iliac artery bifurcation.

      In addition, the purpose of the study is also characterized based on the protocol arm that
      patients are enrolled:

        1. Ascending Arm Protocol: The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, efficacy, and
           intermediate (or long-term) rupture free survival rate of high risk surgical patients
           undergoing endovascular repair of ASCENDING AORTIC pathology including aortic
           dissection, aortic aneurysm, and/or aortic pseudoaneurysm. The objectives of this arm
           are as follows:

             -  To assess the safety, efficacy and intermediate (or long-term) durability of an
                endovascular prosthesis as a means of preventing ascending aortic growth and
                rupture in high risk patients.

             -  To measure the physiologic effects and outcomes of endovascular aneurysm repair.

             -  Establish selection criteria, improve device design, operative technique and
                follow-up procedures for patients undergoing endovascular aneurysm repair.

        2. Arch Arm Protocol: The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, efficacy, and
           intermediate (or long-term) rupture free survival rate of high risk surgical patients
           undergoing endovascular repair of AORTIC ARCH pathology including aortic aneurysm,
           pseudoaneurysm and/or dissection. The objectives of this arm are as follows:

             -  To assess the safety, efficacy and intermediate (or long-term) durability of an
                endovascular prosthesis as a means of preventing aortic arch growth and rupture in
                high risk patients.

             -  To measure the physiologic effects and outcomes of endovascular aneurysm repair.

             -  Establish selection criteria, improve device design, operative technique and
                follow-up procedures for patients undergoing endovascular aneurysm repair.

        3. Thoracoabdominal Arm Protocol: The purpose of this study is to assess the long-term
           safety, durability and rupture free survival of surgical patients undergoing
           endovascular repair of the THORACOABDOMINAL AORTA involving pathologies that include
           thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms, renal artery aneurysms and superior mesenteric artery
           aneurysms.

             -  To assess the long-term safety and durability of an endovascular prosthesis as a
                means of preventing aneurysm growth and rupture in patients having aneurysms
                involving the THORACOABDOMINAL AORTA.

             -  To measure the physiologic effects and outcomes of endovascular aneurysm repair.

             -  Establish selection criteria, improve device design, operative technique and
                follow-up procedures for patients undergoing endovascular aneurysm repair involving
                the THORACOABDOMINAL AORTA.

                            cardiac perfusion.

                              -  Proximal fixation may occur in either native aorta or surgical

                         2. Aortic diameter at the sinotubular junction &gt;20 mm and ≤ 38mm

                    2. Distal Fixation: a length of distal ascending aorta &gt;5mm proximal to the

                       loaded within an 18F-24F sheath.

                    2. Conduits to the iliac vessels or aorta may be used if deemed necessary

        Arch Arm Protocol

          1. General Inclusion Criteria (Must meet ALL of the following):

               -  Life expectancy greater than 2 years

               -  Suitable arterial anatomy

               -  Absence of systemic disease or allergy that precludes an endovascular repair

               -  Capable of giving informed consent and willingness to comply with follow up

               -  Patient is considered high or prohibitive risk for open surgical repair of the
                  ascending aneurysm or dissection

          2. Anatomic Inclusion Criteria

                    1. Aneurysm of the ascending aorta or aortic arch/proximal descending thoracic
                       aorta that is &gt;5.5cm or is considered to be at high risk for rupture or
                       dissection given the morphologic characteristics of the aneurysm (or
                       diverticulum).

                    2. Proximal aortic fixation zone:

                         1. Native aorta or surgical graft (If surgical graft in ascending aorta,
                            the angulation within the graft must be &lt;90 degrees)

                         2. Diameter: 20-42mm

                         3. Proximal neck length ≥10mm

                         4. Ascending aortic length &gt;50mm

                         5. Must occur distal to coronary arteries and any coronary artery bypass
                            grafts that are considered patent and necessary for proper cardiac
                            perfusion

                    3. Distal aortic fixation zone:

                         1. Native aorta or surgical graft

                         2. Diameter: 20-42mm

                         3. Distal neck length ≥10mm

                    4. Supra-aortic trunk (brachiocephalic) vessels

                         1. Although the prosthesis will typically have two branches, modifications
                            to the design will allow for a single branch or three branches. Thus,
                            it is generally planned that at least one extra-anatomic bypass graft
                            will be done in conjunction (or in a staged fashion) with the
                            procedure. The two vessels incorporated into the endograft repair would
                            most commonly be the innominate artery and left carotid artery.
                            However, the innominate artery may be coupled with the left subclavian
                            artery in the setting of a bovine arch whereby the flow to the left
                            carotid would come from a left subclavian to carotid bypass. Similarly,
                            the left carotid and subclavian artery may be branched, or simply one
                            vessel branched should specific anatomic limitations exist. In such a
                            situation, multiple extra-anatomic bypasses may be necessary. Thus the
                            inclusion criteria are defined for each artery, yet any combination of
                            arteries may be used for a repair.

                         2. Diameter of vessel(s) to be incorporated into endograft

                              -  Innominate artery: 8-22 mm.

                              -  Left (or right) common carotid artery: 6-16mm

                              -  Left (or right) subclavian artery: 5-20mm

                              -  Length of sealing zone ≥ 10mm

                              -  Acceptable tortuosity

                    5. In the setting of an aortic dissection the following criteria must exist:

                         1. Access into the true lumen from the groin and at least one supra-aortic
                            trunk vessel

                         2. A sealing zone in the target aorta (or surgical graft) that is proximal
                            to the primary dissection, such that a stent graft would be anticipated
                            to seal off the dissection lumen

                         3. A sealing zone in the target supra-aortic trunk vessels that is distal
                            to the dissection, anticipated to seal off the dissection lumen, or
                            surgically created

                         4. A true lumen size large enough to deploy the device and still gain
                            access into the target branches

                    6. In the setting of a more distal disease, the repair may be coupled with a
                       thoracoabdominal branched device, infrarenal device, and/or internal iliac
                       branch device - typically performed in a staged fashion

                    7. Iliac anatomy must allow for the delivery of the arch branch device which is
                       loaded within an 18F-24F sheath. Conduits to the iliac vessels or aorta may
                       be used if deemed necessary.

        Thoracoabdominal Arm Protocol

          1. General Inclusion Criteria (Must meet ALL of the following):

               -  Life expectancy greater than 2 years

               -  Suitable arterial anatomy

               -  Absence of systemic disease or allergy that precludes an endovascular repair

               -  Capable of giving informed consent and willingness to comply with follow up
                  schedule

          2. Anatomic Inclusion Criteria

               -  Presence of at least one of the following aneurysms is necessary to drive the
                  need for a repair with a fenestrated/branched device:

                    1. A thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm ≥ 4 cm or suggestive of a high risk of
                       rupture as a result of morphology, growth history or symptoms

                    2. A renal artery aneurysm &gt; 20 mm (or twice the diameter of native renal
                       artery)

                    3. An SMA aneurysm &gt;30 mm

               -  Outside of the &quot;Indications for Use&quot; for commercially available fenestrated or
                  branched endografts approved for use for the treatment of these aneurysms.

               -  Proximal neck

                    1. Diameter ≤ 40 mm, ≥20 mm

                    2. Proximal neck length ≥ 10mm.

                    3. The proximal landing zone may be in a prior endograft or a prior surgical
                       graft.

               -  Iliac Artery

                    1. Diameter ≥ 7 mm (anticipated diameter following balloon angioplasty,
                       stenting, dottoring, or conduit) or ≥ 6 mm for patients receiving an
                       Low-Profile device.

                    2. Iliac angulation that will not preclude device delivery or surgical
                       modification of the iliac system

                    3. For a bifurcated or aorto-monoiliac prosthesis, iliac implantation sites
                       require ≤ 20 mm in diameter and ≥ 20 mm in length

               -  For a straight aorto-aortic prosthesis, distal neck (normal aorta between the
                  aneurysm and iliac bifurcation) ≥ 10 mm in length and ≤ 40 mm in diameter

               -  If a hypogastric branch will be used to treat the common iliac aneurysm

                    1. The intended common iliac artery is &gt; 20mm in diameter or the aneurysm has
                       morphology concerning for rupture; and

                    2. The intended distal fixation site within the internal iliac is ≤ 10mm in
                       diameter.

               -  Renal arteries or other visceral vessels arising from the aorta in an orientation
                  that is evident and measurable from cross-sectional imaging (CT or MR)

               -  Visceral branch diameters (for incorporated vessels) between 4 mm - 11 mm at the
                  intended distal sealing site (thus distal to a visceral artery aneurysm in such
                  circumstances).

               -  Greater than 5 mm of proximal visceral branch length to allow for a seal with the
                  mated device, or the ability to exclude an early branch.

               -  In the setting of an aortic dissection the following criteria must exist:

                    1. Access into the true lumen from the groin and at least one supra-aortic
                       trunk vessel

                    2. A sealing zone in the target aorta (or surgical graft) that is proximal to
                       the primary dissection, such that a stentgraft would be anticipated to seal
                       off the dissection lumen

                    3. A sealing zone in the target supra-aortic trunk vessels that is distal to
                       the dissection, anticipated to seal off the dissection lumen, or surgically
                       created

                    4. A true lumen size large enough to deploy the device and still gain access
                       into the target branches

               -  In the setting of a more proximal disease, the repair may be coupled with an
                  arch-branched device, thoracic aortic endograft, or surgical aortic repair -
                  typically performed in a staged fashion

        General Exclusion Criteria

          1. Patient can be treated in accordance with the instructions for use with a commercially
             marketed endovascular prosthesis

          2. Pregnancy

          3. History of anaphylactic reaction to contrast material with an inability to properly
             prophylax the patient appropriately

          4. Known sensitivity or allergy to materials of construction of the device (including the
             materials of the LP device).

          5. Body habitus that would inhibit X-ray visualization of the aorta

          6. Subject had a major surgical or interventional procedure unrelated to the treatment of
             the aneurysm planned &lt;30 days from the endovascular repair

          7. Unstable angina

          8. Unwilling to comply with follow up schedule

          9. Systemic or local infection that may increase the risk of endovascular graft infection

         10. An uncorrectable coagulopathy
