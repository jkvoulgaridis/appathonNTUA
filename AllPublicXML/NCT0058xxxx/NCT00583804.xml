      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of an implanted stimulator and
      sensor for providing hand and arm function for individuals with cervical level spinal cord
      injury.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The design of this study is to determine the efficacy of improving upper extremity function
      in tetraplegic subjects after receiving an implantable device for neuromuscular control.
      Evaluations will be made so as to document changes in performance of manipulative tasks when
      using the stimulation system.

      Subjects who consent to participate in this project will have an implantable stimulator
      surgically placed in the upper extremity for control of the upper extremity. A series of
      tests will be performed before implantation, and repeated at intervals after implantation to
      assess changes in each subject's performance.

      This study is a non-randomized feasibility study with concurrent (neuroprosthesis on and off)
      and longitudinal (pre- and post-implantation/training) self-controls.

      Subjects participating in the study can expect to be actively involved in the study for two
      years after implantation and followed for life thereafter. The screening procedures take up
      to two days, depending on the specific evaluations necessary to determine candidacy.
      Pre-surgical exercise is conducted for at least two weeks. The implantation surgery itself
      lasts one day, with three to seven days of post-surgical hospitalization. Following an
      eight-week exercise program and a twelve-week training program, subjects are discharged from
      the active rehabilitation phase. They are followed quarterly for one year, and then annually
      thereafter.

      The device is referred to as the Implanted Stimulator-Telemeter (IST) -12. The device uses
      functional electrical stimulation (FES) to activate paralyzed muscles.

    <description>Grasp and Release Test (GRT) - The Grasp and Release Test (GRT) [Wuolle, 1994; Smith et al., 1996; Carroll et al., 2000; Taylor et al., 2002; Mulcahey et al., 2004], developed at the Cleveland FES Center, has been utilized by multiple centers to show improvements in hand function after implantation of a neuroprosthesis and tendon transfers [Peckham, 2001]. This pick-and-place test requires the participant to unilaterally acquire, move, and release six objects varying in weight and size. The objects are: 1) a small peg, 2) a wooden cube, 3) a small juice can, 4) a videotape, 5) a paperweight (~1000g) and a simulated fork task (spring-loaded plunger). The number of objects that the participant can successfully manipulate are scored. Success in manipulating each object in the GRT is defined as the ability to pick up and place the object at least once within 30 seconds.</description>

    <measure>Activities of Daily Living Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Three months</time_frame>
    <description>The ADL Abilities Test was developed to measure differences in activity performance with and without a hand neuroprosthesis. Scoring is based on an activity analysis approach. The activities, which are chosen by the participant, are broken down into phases, and each phase is scored for the amount of assistance the participant uses: 1) &quot;Physical Assistance&quot; (PA): assistance from an attendant, 2) &quot;Adaptive Equipment&quot; (AE): any modifications of the activity or its components, 3) &quot;Orthotic Assistance&quot; (OA): an orthotic device that the participant normally wears all day (e.g., a dorsal wrist support), and that can be considered a modification of the hand, 4) &quot;Self Assistance&quot; (SA): use of any part of the body other than the dominant hand, or use of the test equipment in an adapted way to complete the activity (e.g., using two hands to hold a glass, or sliding an object to the end of the table for grasping), and 5) &quot;Independent&quot;.</description>

          <description>Individuals implanted with stimulator/sensor device. These individuals were implanted with the IST-12 device. The IST-12 is an implanted stimulator and sensor device, with twelve implanted stimulating electrodes and two myoelectric signal recording electrodes. The device was implanted in the chest, hand and arm to provide functional grasp and reach.
All participants received the implanted device. During the primary outcome testing, the device was tested with the device &quot;on&quot; and active and compared with the results when the device was turned off. No blinding of either the subject or evaluator was possible because of the obvious response when the stimulator is on (i.e. the hand opens and closes when the stimulator is on; the hand is paralyzed when the stimulator is off).</description>

          <title>Grasp-Release Test - Baseline</title>
          <description>The Grasp-Release tests consists of six standard objects requiring different grasp patterns and forces to pick up and move. The subjects have a fixed period of time to attempt to acquire the object and move it from one location on the test board to a second location. The outcome is measured as the number of objects that they can successfully pick up and move. The minimum score is 0 and the maximum score is 6.</description>

        <description>Grasp and Release Test (GRT) - The Grasp and Release Test (GRT) [Wuolle, 1994; Smith et al., 1996; Carroll et al., 2000; Taylor et al., 2002; Mulcahey et al., 2004], developed at the Cleveland FES Center, has been utilized by multiple centers to show improvements in hand function after implantation of a neuroprosthesis and tendon transfers [Peckham, 2001]. This pick-and-place test requires the participant to unilaterally acquire, move, and release six objects varying in weight and size. The objects are: 1) a small peg, 2) a wooden cube, 3) a small juice can, 4) a videotape, 5) a paperweight (~1000g) and a simulated fork task (spring-loaded plunger). The number of objects that the participant can successfully manipulate are scored. Success in manipulating each object in the GRT is defined as the ability to pick up and place the object at least once within 30 seconds.</description>

        <description>The ADL Abilities Test was developed to measure differences in activity performance with and without a hand neuroprosthesis. Scoring is based on an activity analysis approach. The activities, which are chosen by the participant, are broken down into phases, and each phase is scored for the amount of assistance the participant uses: 1) &quot;Physical Assistance&quot; (PA): assistance from an attendant, 2) &quot;Adaptive Equipment&quot; (AE): any modifications of the activity or its components, 3) &quot;Orthotic Assistance&quot; (OA): an orthotic device that the participant normally wears all day (e.g., a dorsal wrist support), and that can be considered a modification of the hand, 4) &quot;Self Assistance&quot; (SA): use of any part of the body other than the dominant hand, or use of the test equipment in an adapted way to complete the activity (e.g., using two hands to hold a glass, or sliding an object to the end of the table for grasping), and 5) &quot;Independent&quot;.</description>
