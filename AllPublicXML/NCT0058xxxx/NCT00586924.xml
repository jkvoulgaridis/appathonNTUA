    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria: Confirmed diagnosis of HCL, Measurable disease, Participant's must have
        had at least 2 prior systemic therapies. There must have been at least 2 prior courses of
        purine analog, or 1 if the response to this course lasted less than (&lt;) 2 years, or if the
        participant had unacceptable toxicity to purine analog, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
        (ECOG) performance status of 0-2, Participant's with other cancers who meet eligibility
        criteria and have less than 5 years of disease free survival will be considered on a
        case-by-case basis, Life expectancy of greater than 6 months, as assessed by principal
        investigator, Must be able to understand and sign informed consent, Must be at least 18
        years old, Female and male participants must agree to use an approved method of
        contraception during the study.

        Exclusion Criteria: - History of allogeneic bone marrow transplant, Documented and ongoing
        central nervous system involvement with their malignant disease (history of central nervous
        system (CNS) involvement is not an exclusion criteria), Pregnant or breast-feeding females,
        HIV positive serology (due to increased risk of severe infection and unknown interaction of
        CAT-8015 with antiretroviral drugs, Hepatitis B surface antigen positive. - Hepatic
        function: Serum transaminases (either alanine transaminase (ALT) or aspartate transaminase
        (AST)) or bilirubin: greater than or equal to (&gt;=) Grade 2, unless bilirubin is due to
        Gilbert's disease. -Renal function: Serum creatinine clearance less than or equal to (&lt;=)
        60 millilitre per minute (mL/min) as estimated by Cockroft-Gault formula. -Hematologic
        function: The absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt; 1000/ cubic millimetres (cmm), or platelet
        count &lt;50,000/cmm, if these cytopenias are not judged by the investigator to be due to
        underlying disease (i.e. potentially reversible with anti-neoplastic therapy). -Pulmonary
        function: Participant's with &lt; 50% of predicted forced expiratory volume (FEV1) or &lt;50% of
        predicted diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO), corrected for hemoglobin
        concentration and alveolar volume. Uncontrolled pulmonary infection, presence of pulmonary
        edema, Oxygen saturation at rest &lt; 88% measured by pulse oximetry or partial pressure of
        oxygen (PaO2) &lt; 55 millimetre(s) of mercury (mm Hg), Serum albumin &lt; 2 g/dL,
        Radioimmunotherapy within 2 years prior to enrollment in study.

          <description>Participants tested for immunogenicity to moxetumomab pasudotox prior to enrollment, before each cycle and at end of study. The neutralization assay measures the capacity of participant's plasma (antibodies) to inhibit the binding of moxetumomab pasudotox to its target, cluster of differentiation 22 (CD22), coated onto enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plates. Significant level of neutralizing antibody activity defined as the capacity of test plasma to inhibit &gt;50% of the binding of CAT-8015 to CD22 using an ELISA-based method.</description>
