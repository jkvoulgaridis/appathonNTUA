      The study is a prospective open label study to examine the effects of oral and intravenous
      fat load on blood pressure, endothelial function, sympathetic activity, and oxidative stress
      in obese healthy subjects. Subjects will receive either 8-hour of intravenous or oral fat
      loads in either low or high doses or normal saline in random order. Blood samples are drawn
      and vitals are measured before and after the infusions. Endothelial function and plasma
      glucose and lipid levels are measured to study the effects.

    <textblock>
      Insulin resistance has been implicated as the central mechanism in the development of several
      cardiovascular risk factors including hypertension, diabetes, lipid disorders, and
      coagulation disorders. Recent evidence suggests that increased levels of a circulation fat
      (free fatty acids or FFAs) are a leading candidate causing insulin resistance. Our
      preliminary studies in indicate that, in addition to insulin resistance, the infusion of
      Intralipid and heparin to increase FFAs resulted in a significant rise in systolic and
      diastolic blood pressure, impaired endothelial (vascular) function, and increased
      inflammatory markers in obese African Americans with and without diabetes. The effects of FFA
      on insulin action are well established; however, the blood pressure and vascular effects of
      FFAs infusion in obese subjects have not been fully investigated. We hypothesize that
      observed changes in blood pressure are the result of acute endothelial dysfunction, and/or
      increased activation of the autonomic nervous system. No previous studies have attempted to
      determine a dose response effect of increasing FFA on blood pressure. In addition, it is not
      know if increased FFAs by repeated oral fat load results in similar blood pressure than
      intravenous lipid infusion. Accordingly, we propose: 1) a systematic evaluation of the
      effects of increasing FFA levels on blood pressure and endothelial (vascular) function, and
      2) determine the effects of comparable increases in FFA concentration via intravenous
      infusion of Intralipid or by repeated oral fat load on blood pressure, insulin resistance and
      endothelial dysfunction in obese subjects.

      A group of obese normotensive subjects will be admitted to the Grady Clinical Research Center
      or to the Outpatient Research Unit in the Grady Diabetes Clinic on five occasions. In four of
      these admissions, research subjects will receive an 8-hour intravenous infusion, in random
      order, of increasing Intralipid concentration (10 ml, 20 ml, 40 ml per hour) or normal saline
      (40 ml per hour). During the final admission, research subjects will receive an oral liquid
      fat diet every 2 hours for 8-hours. The effect of increased FFAs on blood pressure and
      endothelial (vascular) function via intravenous infusion and via oral fat load therapy will
      be assessed.

    <time_frame>Baseline and at the end of the 8-hours</time_frame>
    <description>To study the effects of high dose oral fat load on systolic blood pressure (SBP) in healthy obese subjects, subject's baseline SBP is compared to SBP after the infusion. Blood Pressure (BP) was measured with a manual cuff in triplicate on admission when patient was in Supine position. The Blood pressure was measured at admission and at end of the fat load. The BP from the admission are compared to BP after the fat load. A normal systolic blood pressure is lower than 120 mmHg; elevated blood pressure if the systolic reading is 120-129 mmHg. A level above 140 mmHg is considered hypertension.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and at the end of the 8-hours</time_frame>
    <description>Endothelium-dependent brachial artery dilatation was assessed as a measurement of endothelial function using established methodology. Briefly, ultrasound images of the brachial artery were obtained at baseline under standardized conditions and 60 s after induction of reactive hyperemia by 5-min cuff occlusion of the forearm. Image landmarks as well as surface markers were utilized to ensure anatomic consistency between serial imaging studies. All images were digitized online, and arterial diameters were measured with customized software by individuals blinded to the clinical and laboratory status of the subjects. Flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) was expressed as the percentage increase in diameter from baseline. It is measured in percentage.</description>

    <measure>Change in Blood Glucose Levels From Baseline to 6-8 Hours After Intervention Among Obese Healthy Subjects</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at the end of the 8-hours</time_frame>
    <description>The blood glucose level is the amount of glucose present in the blood of humans. Many factors affect a person's blood sugar level. The body's homeostatic mechanism of blood sugar regulation (known as glucose homeostasis), when operating normally, restores the blood sugar level to a narrow range of about 4.4 to 6.1 mmol/L (79 to 110 mg/dL) (as measured by a fasting blood glucose test). The study aims to study the effects of these interventions on blood glucose levels among obese healthy subjects.</description>

    <measure>Change in C-peptide Concentration Levels From Baseline to After Specific Intervention Among the Healthy Obese Subjects</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and after 8 hours after admission</time_frame>
    <description>C-peptide is a peptide composed of 31 amino acids. It is released from the pancreatic beta-cells during cleavage of insulin from proinsulin. It is mainly excreted by the kidney, and its half-life is 3-4 times longer than that of insulin. The reference range of C-peptide is 0. 8-3 ng/ml. The C-peptide test is a tool to monitor and treat diabetes. It shows how well your body makes insulin, which moves sugar (or &quot;glucose&quot;) from your blood into your cells.</description>

    <measure>Change in Blood Insulin Levels From Baseline to After Intervention Among the Normal Obese Subjects</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at the end of the 8-hours</time_frame>
    <description>Insulin is an anabolic hormone that promotes glucose uptake, glycogenesis, lipogenesis, and protein synthesis of skeletal muscle and fat tissue through the tyrosine kinase receptor pathway. In addition, insulin is the most important factor in the regulation of plasma glucose homeostasis, as it counteracts glucagon and other catabolic hormones like epinephrine, glucocorticoid, and growth hormone. Normal fasting insulin levels is &lt; 25 milli-International unit/litre</description>

          <description>FMD was assessed as a measurement of endothelial function. Ultrasound images of the brachial artery were obtained at baseline under standardized conditions and 60 s after induction of reactive hyperemia by 5-min cuff occlusion of the forearm. All images were digitized online, and arterial diameters were measured with customized software by individuals blinded to the clinical and laboratory status of the subjects. Flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) was expressed as the percentage increase in diameter from baseline. Itis measured in percentage</description>

        <description>To study the effects of high dose oral fat load on systolic blood pressure (SBP) in healthy obese subjects, subject's baseline SBP is compared to SBP after the infusion. Blood Pressure (BP) was measured with a manual cuff in triplicate on admission when patient was in Supine position. The Blood pressure was measured at admission and at end of the fat load. The BP from the admission are compared to BP after the fat load. A normal systolic blood pressure is lower than 120 mmHg; elevated blood pressure if the systolic reading is 120-129 mmHg. A level above 140 mmHg is considered hypertension.</description>

        <title>Changes in Systolic Blood Pressure From Baseline to After Completing an 8-hour 20% Intralipid @ 40cc/hr Infusion in Obese Normotensive Subjects</title>
        <description>To study the effects of high dose intravenous (IV) fat infusion on systolic blood pressure (SBP) in healthy obese subjects, subject's baseline SBP is compared to SBP after the infusion. Blood Pressure (BP) was measured with a manual cuff in triplicate on admission when patient was in Supine position. The Blood pressure was measured at admission and at every 2 hours till the end of infusion. The BP from the admission are compared to BP after the infusion. A normal systolic blood pressure is lower than 120 mmHg; elevated blood pressure if the systolic reading is 120-129 mmHg. A level above 140 mmHg is considered hypertension.</description>

        <description>Endothelium-dependent brachial artery dilatation was assessed as a measurement of endothelial function using established methodology. Briefly, ultrasound images of the brachial artery were obtained at baseline under standardized conditions and 60 s after induction of reactive hyperemia by 5-min cuff occlusion of the forearm. Image landmarks as well as surface markers were utilized to ensure anatomic consistency between serial imaging studies. All images were digitized online, and arterial diameters were measured with customized software by individuals blinded to the clinical and laboratory status of the subjects. Flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) was expressed as the percentage increase in diameter from baseline. It is measured in percentage.</description>

        <title>Change in Blood Glucose Levels From Baseline to 6-8 Hours After Intervention Among Obese Healthy Subjects</title>
        <description>The blood glucose level is the amount of glucose present in the blood of humans. Many factors affect a person's blood sugar level. The body's homeostatic mechanism of blood sugar regulation (known as glucose homeostasis), when operating normally, restores the blood sugar level to a narrow range of about 4.4 to 6.1 mmol/L (79 to 110 mg/dL) (as measured by a fasting blood glucose test). The study aims to study the effects of these interventions on blood glucose levels among obese healthy subjects.</description>

        <title>Change in C-peptide Concentration Levels From Baseline to After Specific Intervention Among the Healthy Obese Subjects</title>
        <description>C-peptide is a peptide composed of 31 amino acids. It is released from the pancreatic beta-cells during cleavage of insulin from proinsulin. It is mainly excreted by the kidney, and its half-life is 3-4 times longer than that of insulin. The reference range of C-peptide is 0. 8-3 ng/ml. The C-peptide test is a tool to monitor and treat diabetes. It shows how well your body makes insulin, which moves sugar (or &quot;glucose&quot;) from your blood into your cells.</description>
