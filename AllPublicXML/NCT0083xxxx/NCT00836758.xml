    <textblock>
      The study is to compare the performance of a CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure)
      device to a clinical polysomnography (PSG) in identifying breathing events in patients with
      obstructive sleep apnea.

  <detailed_description>

      Purpose: The purpose of this study was to compare the AED algorithm used in a PAP device with
      manually scored events on PSG. The PAP device was modified to produce a square wave voltage
      output identifying when apneas, hypopneas, and snoring events were detected. Recording this
      event signal on the PSG performed with the patient using the PAP device allowed an
      event-by-event comparison between manually scored PSG events and AED events. In addition, the
      AHI, AI, and HI derived from the manually scored PSG were compared with the respective
      measures reported by the PAP device used during the PSG.

      Study Objectives: Compare automatic event detection (AED) of respiratory events using a
      positive airway pressure (PAP) device with manual scoring of polysomnography (PSG) during PAP
      treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).

      Design: Prospective PSGs of patients using a PAP device.

      Setting: Six academic and private sleep disorders centers.

      Interventions: A signal generated by the PAP device identifying the AED of respiratory events
      based on airflow was recorded during PSG.

    <description>Apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) is the combined average number of apneas and hypopneas that occur per hour of sleep. The Apnea index (AI) is the average number of apneas that occur per hour of sleep. The Hypopnea index (HI) is the average number of hypopneas that occur per hour of sleep.
The PSGs were manually scored to determine the apnea-hypopnea index. This value was then compared to the PAP device which utilized the AED algorithm to determine the apnea-hypopnea index.</description>

            <description>The PSGs were manually scored with the aid of computer software by a PSG technologist at a central scoring facility. The technologist was blinded to the event signal during manual scoring (the event signal was not visible in the montages used for scoring). Sleep staging and respiratory events were scored using 2007 American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) guidelines. The scoring of a hypopnea required that the event be associated with a ≥ 4% oxygen desaturation.</description>

            <title>Automatic Event Detection</title>
            <description>The AED algorithm used the following criteria to identify respiratory events. An apnea was detected when there was an 80% or greater reduction in the airflow for 10 sec or longer in comparison with the average airflow over the previous 2 minutes. A hypopnea was detected when there was a device estimated 40% reduction in airflow for ≥ 10 sec but &lt; 60 sec compared with the average airflow over the previous 2 minutes. The hypopnea detection algorithm required the presence of two recovery breaths that nominally were at least 75% to 80% of the baseline airflow. The algorithm also looked for evidence of flow limitation to detect hypopneas. The algorithm monitored the flow signal for changes in peak flow, and the shape of the inspiratory airflow signal that would be associated with flow limited breathing.</description>
