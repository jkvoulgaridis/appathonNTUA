  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of Exendin (9-39) on glucose
      requirements to maintain euglycemia in pediatric patients with congenital hyperinsulinism
      (CHI) who have failed medical therapy. The secondary aims are to determine the therapeutic
      plasma levels, plasma half-life and pharmacokinetics of Exendin (9-39) during a 9-hour
      intravenous infusion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will enroll infants with congenital hyperinsulinism owing to KATP channel
      mutations who are unresponsive to medical therapy and will require a pancreatectomy to
      control hypoglycemia from a single academic medical center in the United States.

      An open-label, two-period, two-treatment crossover study design with a dose-escalation
      component will be implemented. Successive cohorts of patients (up to 5 participants/cohort)
      will each receive a fixed dose of Exendin (9-39) infusion and normal saline vehicle on two
      separate days in random order. The protocol specifies 0.02 mg/kg/hr, via continuous
      intravenous infusion, administered over 9-hours for the first cohort. The volume of saline to
      be infused will be calculated to match the volume of Exendin (9-39). Successive cohorts will
      be given doses that are increased in up to 1/2 log increments. Overall, the investigators
      hypothesize that antagonism of the GLP-1 receptor by Exendin (9-39) will increase fasting
      blood glucose levels, prevent protein-induced hypoglycemia and decrease glucose requirement
      to maintain euglycemia in infants with CHI.

      Aim 1. To examine the effect of Exendin (9-39) on glucose requirements to maintain euglycemia
      in infants with congenital hyperinsulinism unresponsive to medical therapy.

      Aim 2. To determine therapeutic plasma levels, plasma half-life and pharmacokinetics of
      Exendin-(9-39) during an intravenous infusion.

    <description>To assess the effect of Exendin (9-39) on glucose infusion rate, glucose infusion rate (GIR) over the last 2 hours of the treatment period was calculated by adding the total amount of intravenous glucose (mg) received over 2 hours divided by the weight (kg) and by time (120 min) during infusion of Exendin (9-39) and normal saline vehicle.</description>

        <title>Mean Glucose Infusion Rate (GIR)</title>
        <description>To assess the effect of Exendin (9-39) on glucose infusion rate, glucose infusion rate (GIR) over the last 2 hours of the treatment period was calculated by adding the total amount of intravenous glucose (mg) received over 2 hours divided by the weight (kg) and by time (120 min) during infusion of Exendin (9-39) and normal saline vehicle.</description>
        <time_frame>Up to 9 hours after the initiation of infusion</time_frame>
        <population>Subjects served as their own control for comparison between the effects of Exendin (9-39) and the normal saline vehicle. The trial was terminated after 14 participants enrolled in the study. No data is available for any outcome measures.</population>
