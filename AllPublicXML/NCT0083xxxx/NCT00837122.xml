      Background:

        -  Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and associated complications are major contributors to the global
           disease burden. T2D is already a major health threat in populations in developed
           countries and is rapidly taking hold in the developing world.

        -  It is believed that understanding the complex interplay between genetic and lifestyle
           characteristics in the etiology of T2D and related complications will lead to the
           development of better preventive and therapeutic strategies. In Addition, the results of
           this project will facilitate our understanding of causes of diabetes in African
           Americans, other US and world populations

      Objectives:

        -  To conduct a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify susceptibility genetic
           variants for diabetes among the Yoruba people in Ibadan, Nigeria.

        -  To enroll and examine 300 unrelated cases of T2D and 300 ethnicity-matched Yoruba
           controls.

        -  To conduct resequencing of positional candidate gene/loci to identify likely functional
           variants in a subset of the cohort.

        -  To conduct replication studies of the top-100 scoring variants in three independent
           African and European ancestry samples.

        -  To investigate whether diabetes-associated variants discovered in European populations
           increase diabetes risk in West Africans.

      Eligibility:

        -  Patients 25 years of age with confirmed T2D who are newly diagnosed or on treatment of
           Yoruba ethnicity in Ibadan, Nigeria. Control subjects are nondiabetics ethnically
           matched to patients.

      Design:

        -  The study design for both patients and controls consists of the following steps:

        -  Discuss informed consent process and obtain signed informed consent form. Informed
           consent will be administered by trained clinic staff.

        -  Assign study ID (barcode)

        -  Administer questionnaires

        -  Obtain spot urine sample

        -  Measure blood pressure

        -  Obtain anthropometric measurements including body composition

        -  Perform finger prick for blood glucose level

        -  Obtain venous blood samples

        -  Perform eye examination

        -  On the following day, perform confirmatory blood glucose for the small subset of
           participants requiring confirmation of previous test result DNA extraction of stored
           samples will be done at either the National Institutes of Health or the laboratory in
           Nigeria.

        -  GWAS will be conducted using publicly available software packages.

      This research protocol is designed to study the genetic basis of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) and
      related conditions in Africa. This project, the Africa America Diabetes Mellitus (AADM)
      Study, has been continuously funded for over a decade by multiple institutes at NIH including
      an R01 grant from the NIDDK to Dr. Rotimi when he was a Professor at Howard University. As a
      result, the AADM study has a well-established international infrastructure with long-standing
      collaborators. While previous phases of this study have included related individuals, we are
      currently only enrolling unrelated T2D cases and controls in order to facilitate genome-wide
      association studies (GWAS) or similar types of genetic analyses for which unrelated datasets
      are optimal. In total, we anticipate enrolling 10,000 cases and controls from 5 centers in
      West Africa (Enugu, Ibadan and Lagos in Nigeria; Accra and Kumasi in Ghana). By sampling from
      these regions, we will be enrolling individuals representing primarily 4 major ethnic groups
      (the Yoruba, Ibo, Akan, and Ga), as well as a low number of individuals from a variety of
      other ethnic groups. To date, we have enrolled 6,486 individuals. These data will be used for
      a variety of genetic analyses, including association studies based on genome-wide array data,
      exome chip array and candidate gene/loci datasets, linkage disequilibrium (LD) mapping, and
      functional studies in different ethnically-defined populations. At each site, efforts will be
      made to enroll ethnically balanced cases and controls with the goal of facilitating the
      conduct of GWAS and candidate gene/loci studies in a broad range of populations. To further
      understand the complex metabolic background of T2D and its consequences, this data will also
      be explored with respect to a variety of T2D-related traits, including obesity, hypertension,
      serum lipids, inflammation, nephropathy, and neuropathy. Additionally, these samples will be
      used to study genetic variation in the context of how participants of different ancestry
      respond to drugs and other environmental factors and how this variation may have shaped
      population history. Overall, these studies aim to further our understanding of the genetic
      basis of T2D in African individuals. Given past activities, it is also anticipated that this
      resource will form the basis of multiple collaborations between Dr. Rotimi s lab, several NIH
      intramural researchers and non-NIH scientists. It is hoped that, over time, additional
      populations from Africa and beyond may be added to this study to expand the focus on
      individuals from varying ancestral backgrounds; each subsequent population will use the same
      procedures as in the ongoing work among Africans.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Cases - Men and women with confirmed type 2 diabetes mellitus that are either on treatment
        for diabetes or newly diagnosed with blood sugar reading on more than one occasion
        exceeding or equal to 126 mg/dl. These persons must be above the age of 25 years. In this
        regard, all newly diagnosed participants will be required to visit the clinic on the
        following day to perform a fasting blood glucose test to confirm previous results.

        Controls Men and women with fasting plasma glucose (FPG) less than 100 mg/dl (5.6 mmol/l).
        Controls must be above age 25 years and should be ethnically matched to the cases. Enrolled
        cases and controls have to be unrelated. Therefore, only one person may be enrolled from
        each family unless they are husband and wife.

        Attempts will be made to enroll an equal number of men and women. To ensure that ethnic
        distribution is maintained in each study, we are proposing to enroll ethnically-matched
        participants relevant to each study.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        People who do not meet the above criteria (e.g., younger than 24, without the blood sugar
        requirements, etc). No more than one non-spouse member of each family. No prisoners,
        pregnant women or fetuses will be included in this study.
