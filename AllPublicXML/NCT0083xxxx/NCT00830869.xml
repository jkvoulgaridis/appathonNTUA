  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, phase 1, dose escalation study of IXAZOMIB. The primary
      purpose of this study is to determine the safety profile, establish the maximum tolerated
      dose, and inform the phase 2 dose of IXAZOMIB administered intravenously in participants with
      nonhematologic malignancies.

             arrhythmias, congestive heart failure (CHF), angina, or myocardial infarction within
             the past 6 months.

         11. QTc &gt;470 milliseconds (msec) on a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) obtained during the

             study treatment.

         15. For participants in the TPEC and participants in the MTD disease expansion cohorts who
             gave informed consent to undergo tumor biopsy, ongoing anticoagulant therapy (example,
             aspirin, clopidogrel [Plavix ®], warfarin, or heparin) that cannot be held to permit
             tumor biopsy .

        <title>Number of Participants With Best Overall Response</title>
        <description>Best overall response for a participant is best observed post-baseline disease response as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.0 criteria. Complete Response (CR): disappearance of all target lesions, non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. Partial Response (PR): at least 30% decrease in sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of longest diameter. Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease, taking as reference the baseline smallest sum of longest diameter; persistence of 1 or more non-target lesion(s) or maintenance of tumor marker level above normal limits. Progressive disease: at least 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline smallest sum of longest diameter or appearance of 1 or more new lesions or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.</description>
