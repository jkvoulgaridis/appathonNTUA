  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to examine if a nasal cannula can be used to keep the throat open
      during sleep, thereby treating sleep apnea.

      People with sleep apnea and people who snore without sleep apnea may take part in this study.
      Sleep apnea is a disorder caused by pauses in breathing due to repetitive closure of the
      throat. The most common form of treatment for sleep apnea is continuous positive airway
      pressure (CPAP) therapy. While CPAP therapy remains the simplest and most effective treatment
      for snoring and sleep apnea, patients have to wear a nasal mask throughout the night. For
      this reason, patients often have difficulty sticking to therapy.

      Participants enrolled in this study will spend 3-nights in a sleep laboratory. In all nights,
      the investigators will monitor your sleep and your breathing throughout the night. The
      investigators will apply several electrodes (sensors) to your scalp and face to monitor your
      sleep and breathing, and other sensors to your chest, abdomen, cheek, and a finger to monitor
      your breathing and oxygen level.

    <intervention_name>Trans Nasal Insufflation (TNI) [nasal canula]</intervention_name>
    <description>Trans Nasal Insufflation, or TNI, uses air at flow rates delivered through a small nasal canula to reduce the severity and frequency of sleep apnea events.
By using TNI we hope to increase the amount of air that the patient can breathe during periods of obstructive sleep disordered breathing.</description>
