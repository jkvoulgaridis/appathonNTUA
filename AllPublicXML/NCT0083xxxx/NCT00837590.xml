      Aims:

        1. Does inflammation contribute importantly to concurrent defects in vascular and metabolic
           dysfunction in human pre-diabetic obesity?

        2. Are there benefits of anti-inflammatory treatment strategies in pre-diabetic obesity in
           the context of existing treatment with metformin?

        3. Are there benefits of anti-inflammatory treatment strategies in pre-diabetic obesity in
           the context of existing treatment with lisinopril?

      We set out to pursue the following Aims:

        1. Does inflammation contribute importantly to concurrent defects in vascular and metabolic
           dysfunction in human pre-diabetic obesity? Pilot studies were performed exploring the
           acute actions of salsalate on vascular function, the chronic actions of salasate in
           obese individuals, and actions of chronic salsalate to prevent vascular dysfunction
           induced by fatty acids in lean individuals.

        2. Are there benefits of anti-inflammatory treatment strategies in pre-diabetic obesity in
           the context of existing treatment with metformin? No studies were performed

        3. Are there benefits of anti-inflammatory treatment strategies in pre-diabetic obesity in
           the context of existing treatment with lisinopril? No studies were performed

      The intent of the current project is to efficiently and at low cost generate preliminary data
      along each of these lines of questioning, studying the minimum number of subjects required to
      assess the viability of the question using the current measurement approaches.
