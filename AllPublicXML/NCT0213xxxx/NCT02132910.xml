    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to learn about the effect of integrative therapies on chronic or
      recurrent low back pain.

      The intervention called RESTORE (Restorative Exercises for Strength Training and Operational
      Resilience) is based on a series of gentle stretching and strengthening exercises
      incorporating breath-work and mindfulness. The study is designed to discover the impact of
      RESTORE on pain levels, physical function, and behavioral health.

    <description>Participants will choose a pain score using the Defense and Veteran's Pain Rating Scale 2.0
Rate the severity of your CURRENT pain:
0 - No Pain
- Hardly notice pain
- Notice pain, does not interfere with activities
- Sometimes distracts me
- Distracts me, can do usual activities
- Interrupts some activities
- Hard to ignore, avoid usual activities
- Focus of attention, prevents doing daily activities
- Awful, hard to do anything
- Can't bear pain, unable to do anything
- As bad as it could be, nothing else matters
Higher values represent worse outcomes</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Midtreatment, Posttreatment, 3 month follow up, 6 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire is reliable at measuring level of disability and is sensitive to change over time for groups of patients with lower back pain.
Scale: 0-24 (24 total statements)
-Greater levels of disability are reflected by higher numbers on a 24-point scale See link for complete statements: https://www.worksafe.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/76851/roland-morris-low-back-pain-and-disability-questionnaire-rmq1.pdf</description>

    <measure>Physical Functioning</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Midtreatment, Posttreatment, 3 month follow up, 6 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Physical functioning was assessed using the 4-item Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)-29 Physical Functioning subscale (0-100) Total scores are transformed to standardized t scores (mean=50; SD=10). Higher scores indicate higher physical functioning.</description>
  </other_outcome>

    <measure>Symptom Burden</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Midtreatment, Posttreatment, 3 month follow up, 6 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Symptom burden was assessed using the PROMIS-29 Sleep Disturbance, Pain Interference, Anxiety, Depression, and Fatigue subscales (0-100) Subscales are averaged into a composite score.The Composite scale ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating higher symptom burden.</description>
