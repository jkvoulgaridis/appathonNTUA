      This application concerns a proposed randomised controlled trial evaluating the use of
      Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) in people with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) in secondary
      care.

      MS is an inherently stressful condition, and stress is thought to exacerbate MS. Mental
      health problems are common in MS, can impair quality of life, and lead to higher rates of
      suicide.

      Prior research has shown that cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) can help mitigate stress
      and diminish disease activity in MS, but effects are short-lived and there is thus a need to
      explore whether other psychological approaches might be more beneficial in this regard.

      MBSR is another psychological stress reduction technique that is thought to operate
      differently to CBT, via cultivating a state of &quot;meta-cognitive awareness&quot; and has shown to be
      helpful when used in other long term conditions, such as chronic pain and anxiety, whilst
      Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT - a derivative of MBSR) is effective in treating
      recurrent depression. All of these conditions are common in MS. However, mindfulness based
      interventions have not been well studied in MS.

      The investigators propose to carry out a feasibility study to assess how acceptable and
      accessible MBSR is as a stress reduction technique in people with MS. The investigators would
      seek up to 50 participants who would then be randomly assigned to receive MBSR or their usual
      care. The investigators would seek measurements of health and wellbeing before, immediately
      following, and 3 months following the MBSR intervention. This would include basic demographic
      information (age, gender, ethnicity), measures of mental health, and physical health, as well
      as qualitative semi-structured interviews with selected participants. After this we would
      offer MBSR to the control group.
