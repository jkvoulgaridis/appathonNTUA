  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to use the USS Virginia Closed-Loop system for overnight insulin
      delivery in adults with Type 1 Diabetes (T1DM) in an outpatient setting to evaluate the
      system's ability to significantly improve blood glucose levels. This protocol will test the
      feasibility of &quot;bedside&quot; closed-loop control - an approach comprised of standard
      sensor-augmented pump therapy during the day using off-the-shelf devices and overnight
      closed-loop control using experimental devices in an outpatient setting. The rationale for
      this study is as follows: we anticipate that closed-loop control may ultimately be adopted by
      patients with T1DM in a selective manner. Patient may choose to start using these systems for
      overnight control only, e.g. to alleviate the well documented fear of hypoglycemia while
      asleep. To test this paradigm of &quot;bedside&quot; closed-loop control, subjects will be studied with
      continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)-augmented usual pump therapy during the day followed by
      overnight use of USS Virginia Closed Loop Control.

      The subject will participate in both the Experimental and the Control Admissions. The order
      of the two admissions will be randomized. During the Control Admission at home, the subject
      will use the study insulin pump along with a continuous glucose monitor receiver. During the
      Experimental Admission, the subject will be the research house/hotel where the subject will
      be in control of the DiAs. Participation in this study will require 5 study visits over 11-14
      weeks.

During CLC: The subject will be admitted to the research house/hotel and will be discharged after 5 nights. The DiAs (CLC controller) will be initiated by 11:00 PM and will be discontinued before breakfast.
During SAP: The subject will wear the continuous glucose monitor with the study insulin pump for a full 7 day period (approximately 7 consecutive 24 hour periods). The subject will follow their usual regimen.

The subject will be trained on DiAs and on how to respond to the system's alerts. The DiAs will be initiated by 11:00 PM and will be discontinued before breakfast. The staff will be monitoring the subject remotely. The subject will need to remain within a 30 miles of the research house/hotel during the day and return by 6:00 PM.
A limited number of UVA and UPadova subjects will be asked to wear the DiAs at home for 5 days at the conclusion of research house admission.
DiAs: DiAs is the central component of our system. It is a standard cell phone running on an Android operating system. The cell phone has been changed to prevent from (1) using it as a phone or browser, (2) changing the volume (3) accidentally shutting it off. The cell phone runs an algorithm and is connected to work with the insulin pump and continuous glucose monitor to help keep the blood sugar in a desired range and</description>

The subject will follow their usual regimen. The subject will be asked to use the bolus calculator function on your insulin pump and enter the carbohydrate information that you eat during the week.
