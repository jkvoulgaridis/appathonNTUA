  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well guadecitabine works in treating patients with
      myelodysplastic syndromes that are at higher risk for becoming acute myeloid leukemia.
      Guadecitabine may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for
      cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the complete response (CR) rate with SGI-110 (guadecitabine) in patients with
      higher risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Overall response rate, survival, transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML),
      transfusion independence.

      II. Safety and toxicity.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive guadecitabine subcutaneously (SC) on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 4-8
      weeks for up to 24 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients with stable disease after 3 courses are taken off therapy after 6 courses. Patients
      may continue to receive treatment after 24 courses if the investigator determines it is in
      the patient's best interest.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, and then every 2
      months.
