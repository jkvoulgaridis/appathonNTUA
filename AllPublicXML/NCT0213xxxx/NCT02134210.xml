    <textblock>
      This is a two part study comparing CHS-0214 to Enbrel in patients with chronic plaque PsO who
      have not yet received any biologic therapy for any indication (other than insulin or
      hormones).

      Pt. 1 is a 12-week randomized, double-blind, active-control, parallel-group, multi-center
      global study. The primary end point is 75% improvement from baseline according to the
      Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI-75). Comparing CHS-0214 to Enbrel for efficacy and
      safety at a dosage of 50mg subcutaneous (Sc) twice weekly.

      Pt. 2 is a 40-week randomized, double-blind, active-control, parallel-group, multi-center
      global study where CHS-0214 and Enbrel dosage is reduced to 50mg Sc weekly for maintenance.

    <measure>Proportion of Subjects Achieving PASI-75(75% Improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index) From Baseline at Week 12</measure>

    <description>The Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) is well established in the medical literature and is internationally the most widely used instrument to assess the severity of Psoriasis.

    <measure>Change in PSGA (Physician's Static Global Assessment) of Disease Activity on a Scale of 0 to 5</measure>
    <time_frame>4, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48</time_frame>
    <description>Change in PSGA (Physician's Static Global Assessment) of disease activity on a scale of 0 to 5 from baseline to Weeks 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48.
Minimum Value: 0 Maximum Value: 5
The PSGA of PsO (Psoriasis) was assessed on a scale of 0 to 5, with 0 indicating no PsO (clear of disease),1 (almost clear), and 2 or higher scores indicating more severe disease. Subjects with a clear (0) or almost clear (1) evaluation were considered PSGA responders.</description>

    <description>The proportion of subjects with a change in a PSGA (Physician's Static Global Assessment) score = 0 to 1, demonstrating clear or almost clear skin at Weeks 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48;

    <measure>Change in Subject's Global Assessment (SGA) of PsO</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48</time_frame>
    <description>Change in Subject's Global Assessment (SGA) of PsO from baseline to Weeks 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48. The SGA of PsO was assessed using VAS (visual analog scale in the unit of millimeters) , ranging from 0 (good) to 100 (severe). The SGA was assessed at randomization (Week 0/Day 0) and Weeks 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48, as well as at the Follow-up Visit, if applicable. The change in SGA is the value at baseline minus sum of values at weeks 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48. Since the change in SGA is measured from baseline, a negative value indicates a decrease in overall SGA and better overall assessment of PsO.</description>

    <measure>Change in DLQI (Dermatology Life Quality Index)</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 12, 24, and 48</time_frame>
    <description>Change in DLQI (Dermatology Life Quality Index) from baseline to Weeks 12, 24, and 48
The DLQI is a 10-question validated questionnaire that was performed at screening, randomization (Week 0/Day 0), and Weeks 12, 24, and 48. It was calculated by summing the score of each question resulting in a maximum of 30 and a minimum of 0. The higher the score, the more quality of life was impaired.</description>

    <measure>Change in EuroQol 5-Dimension Health Status Questionnaire (EQ-5D)</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 12, 24, and 48</time_frame>
    <description>Change in EuroQol 5-Dimension Health Status Questionnaire (EQ-5D) from baseline to Weeks 12, 24, and 48
The EQ-5D was performed at randomization (Week 0/Day 0), and Weeks 12, 24, and 48. The EQ-5D is a generic (non-disease specific), preference-based health-related quality of life measure based on 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Rated level can be coded as a number 1, 2, or 3, which indicates having no problems for 1, having some problems for 2, and having extreme problems for 3. As a result, a person's health status can be defined by a 5-digit number, ranging from 11111 (having no problems in all dimensions) to 33333 (having extreme problems in all dimensions).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 12, 24, and 48</time_frame>
    <description>HAQ-DI - Scales for each question range from 0-3 (0=without any difficulty; 1=with some difficulty; 2=with much difficulty; 3=Unable to do). The &quot;total&quot; for each category is determined by the highest score (greatest difficulty) for that category. The score for the disability index is the mean of the eight category scores. If more than 2 of the categories or 25% are missing, the scale won't be scored. If fewer than 2 or the categories are missing, the sum of the categories was divided by the number of answered categories.</description>

Highly sensitive C-reactive protein For subjects with PsA, change in hs-CRP from baseline to Weeks 12, 24, and 48 was assessed.</description>

        <title>Change in Subject's Global Assessment (SGA) of PsO</title>
        <description>Change in Subject's Global Assessment (SGA) of PsO from baseline to Weeks 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48. The SGA of PsO was assessed using VAS (visual analog scale in the unit of millimeters) , ranging from 0 (good) to 100 (severe). The SGA was assessed at randomization (Week 0/Day 0) and Weeks 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48, as well as at the Follow-up Visit, if applicable. The change in SGA is the value at baseline minus sum of values at weeks 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48. Since the change in SGA is measured from baseline, a negative value indicates a decrease in overall SGA and better overall assessment of PsO.</description>

        <description>Change in DLQI (Dermatology Life Quality Index) from baseline to Weeks 12, 24, and 48
The DLQI is a 10-question validated questionnaire that was performed at screening, randomization (Week 0/Day 0), and Weeks 12, 24, and 48. It was calculated by summing the score of each question resulting in a maximum of 30 and a minimum of 0. The higher the score, the more quality of life was impaired.</description>

        <description>Change in EuroQol 5-Dimension Health Status Questionnaire (EQ-5D) from baseline to Weeks 12, 24, and 48
The EQ-5D was performed at randomization (Week 0/Day 0), and Weeks 12, 24, and 48. The EQ-5D is a generic (non-disease specific), preference-based health-related quality of life measure based on 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Rated level can be coded as a number 1, 2, or 3, which indicates having no problems for 1, having some problems for 2, and having extreme problems for 3. As a result, a person's health status can be defined by a 5-digit number, ranging from 11111 (having no problems in all dimensions) to 33333 (having extreme problems in all dimensions).</description>

        <description>HAQ-DI - Scales for each question range from 0-3 (0=without any difficulty; 1=with some difficulty; 2=with much difficulty; 3=Unable to do). The &quot;total&quot; for each category is determined by the highest score (greatest difficulty) for that category. The score for the disability index is the mean of the eight category scores. If more than 2 of the categories or 25% are missing, the scale won't be scored. If fewer than 2 or the categories are missing, the sum of the categories was divided by the number of answered categories.</description>
