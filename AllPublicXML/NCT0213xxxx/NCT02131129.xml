      This study proposes to examine the application of rTMS for the treatment of cognitive
      dysfunction in FEP. This is an important population for study because if effective, rTMS may
      represent a preventative treatment for the development of social and vocational impairment
      that is associated with cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia. This study will also seek to
      refine the understanding of the brain circuitry that mediates the potential pro-cognitive
      effects of rTMS through the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at baseline
      and following the course of rTMS administration.

      Schizophrenia is a chronic and disabling illness that typically begins in the late teen and
      early adult years.1 This illness is associated with significant impairments in areas such as
      independent living, social functioning, and vocational functioning.2 Indeed, only 10% of
      people with schizophrenia are employed, translating into annual lost wages of nearly 15
      billion dollars.3,4 Schizophrenia also represents an important societal burden as this
      illness has been estimated to cost over 40 billion dollars each year in the United States
      alone.5

      Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a novel treatment for neuropsychiatric
      illness. A non-invasive intervention, rTMS utilizes the application of a repetitively pulsed
      magnetic field over the scalp to induce an electric field within a discrete area of the
      cerebral cortex. This electric field results in altered ion flow across the neuronal cellular
      membrane and ultimately changes in neuronal polarization. The end result is altered neuronal
      activity in the area of the cerebral cortex where the rTMS is applied.12 rTMS is a safe and
      well-tolerated intervention that received FDA approval for treatment refractory major
      depressive disorder in 2008 and has since become commonly used in clinical practice.13

      This study proposes to examine the application of rTMS for the treatment of cognitive
      dysfunction in FEP. This is an important population for study because if effective, rTMS may
      represent a preventative treatment for the development of social and vocational impairment
      that is associated with cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia. This study will also seek to

    <description>rTMS effectiveness in improving cognitive performance as measured by the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS) composite score. The BACS is a battery specifically designed to measure treatment-related changes in cognition, and has alternate forms, thus minimizing practice effects. The battery includes brief assessments of executive functions, verbal fluency, attention, verbal memory, working memory and motor speed, and generates a composite score that is calculated by summing t-scores derived by comparisons with a normative sample of 404 healthy controls. The six brief assessments' t-scores, are summed, and averaged to provide a composite t-score. The composite score min and max are between -43 and 100. A higher score indicating better cognitive performance. The composite score is reported as a change score relative to baseline for both.</description>

    <description>rTMS effectiveness in improving cognitive performance was assessed by the Trail Making Test-Part B change score and performance on the Trail Making Test-Part B. The Trail Making Test-Part B is a measure of visual attention and task switching. The task requires a subject to 'connect-the-dots' of 25 consecutive targets on a sheet of paper. In Part B version the subject alternates between numbers and letters (1, A, 2, B, etc.) The goal of the test is for the subject is to finish part B as quickly as possible, the time taken to complete the test is used as the primary performance metric.</description>

    <description>rTMS effectiveness in improving cognitive performance as measured by the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS) composite score. The BACS is a battery specifically designed to measure treatment-related changes in cognition by utilizing 6 tasks, and has alternate forms, thus minimizing practice effects. Each task generates a raw score (with a higher score indicating better performance): verbal memory 0-75; digit sequencing 0-28; token motor task 0-100; semantic&amp;letter fluency 0-148; symbol coding 0-110; and tower of London 0-22. The raw scores are used to generate a composite score that is calculated by summing t-scores derived by comparisons with a normative sample of 404 healthy controls. The six brief assessments' t-scores, are summed, and averaged to provide a composite t-score. The composite score min and max are between -43 and 100.

    <description>rTMS effectiveness in general symptomatology assessed by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). The PANSS is a semi-structured interview, containing 30 items that assess symptoms of psychotic disorders including positive, negative, and general psychopathology symptoms. Positive symptoms are rated on 7 items, negative symptoms are rated on 7 items, and general psychopathology on 16 items. Scores for each item range from 1=absent to 7=extreme. Positive, negative, and general psychopathology symptoms can each respectively render total scores. Positive total scores ranging from 7-49, negative total scores ranging from 7-49, and general psychopathology scores ranging from 16-112. When all items are summed together a total score is generated. Total scores for all items range from 30-210, a lower score reflecting fewer symptoms.</description>

    <description>rTMS effectiveness in reducing negative symptoms as measured by the negative symptom assessment scale (NSA-16). The NSA-16 is used to help clinicians rate behaviors (not psychopathology) commonly associated with negative symptoms of schizophrenia. The scale rates subjects on 16 &quot;anchors,&quot; is a semi-structured, clinical interview, and each item is rated from 1 to 6. The total score is the sum of the 16 specific items and ranges from 16 to 96; a higher score indicates greater severity of illness. In addition, there is a global rating that represents the overall assessment of a subject's negative symptoms. The rating should not be an average of any particular behavior, but a gestalt of everything observed in the interview.</description>

The BACS is a battery specifically designed to measure treatment-related changes in cognition, and has alternate forms, thus minimizing practice effects. The battery includes brief assessments of executive functions, verbal fluency, attention, verbal memory, working memory and motor speed, and generates a composite score that is calculated by summing t-scores derived by comparisons with a normative sample of 404 healthy controls. The six brief assessments' t-scores, are summed, and averaged to provide a composite t-score. The composite score min and max are between -43 and 100. A higher score indicating better cognitive performance. The composite score is reported as a change score relative to baseline for both.</description>

The Trail Making Test-Part B is a measure of visual attention and task switching. The task requires a subject to 'connect-the-dots' of 25 consecutive targets on a sheet of paper. In Part B version the subject alternates between numbers and letters (1, A, 2, B, etc.) The goal of the test is for the subject is to finish part B as quickly as possible, the time taken to complete the test is used as the primary performance metric.</description>

        <description>rTMS effectiveness in improving cognitive performance as measured by the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS) composite score. The BACS is a battery specifically designed to measure treatment-related changes in cognition by utilizing 6 tasks, and has alternate forms, thus minimizing practice effects. Each task generates a raw score (with a higher score indicating better performance): verbal memory 0-75; digit sequencing 0-28; token motor task 0-100; semantic&amp;letter fluency 0-148; symbol coding 0-110; and tower of London 0-22. The raw scores are used to generate a composite score that is calculated by summing t-scores derived by comparisons with a normative sample of 404 healthy controls. The six brief assessments' t-scores, are summed, and averaged to provide a composite t-score. The composite score min and max are between -43 and 100. A higher score indicating better cognitive performance.</description>

          <description>rTMS effectiveness in improving cognitive performance as measured by the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS) composite score. The BACS is a battery specifically designed to measure treatment-related changes in cognition by utilizing 6 tasks, and has alternate forms, thus minimizing practice effects. Each task generates a raw score (with a higher score indicating better performance): verbal memory 0-75; digit sequencing 0-28; token motor task 0-100; semantic&amp;letter fluency 0-148; symbol coding 0-110; and tower of London 0-22. The raw scores are used to generate a composite score that is calculated by summing t-scores derived by comparisons with a normative sample of 404 healthy controls. The six brief assessments' t-scores, are summed, and averaged to provide a composite t-score. The composite score min and max are between -43 and 100. A higher score indicating better cognitive performance.</description>

        <description>rTMS effectiveness in general symptomatology assessed by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). The PANSS is a semi-structured interview, containing 30 items that assess symptoms of psychotic disorders including positive, negative, and general psychopathology symptoms. Positive symptoms are rated on 7 items, negative symptoms are rated on 7 items, and general psychopathology on 16 items. Scores for each item range from 1=absent to 7=extreme. Positive, negative, and general psychopathology symptoms can each respectively render total scores. Positive total scores ranging from 7-49, negative total scores ranging from 7-49, and general psychopathology scores ranging from 16-112. When all items are summed together a total score is generated. Total scores for all items range from 30-210, a lower score reflecting fewer symptoms.</description>

        <description>rTMS effectiveness in reducing negative symptoms as measured by the negative symptom assessment scale (NSA-16). The NSA-16 is used to help clinicians rate behaviors (not psychopathology) commonly associated with negative symptoms of schizophrenia. The scale rates subjects on 16 &quot;anchors,&quot; is a semi-structured, clinical interview, and each item is rated from 1 to 6. The total score is the sum of the 16 specific items and ranges from 16 to 96; a higher score indicates greater severity of illness. In addition, there is a global rating that represents the overall assessment of a subject's negative symptoms. The rating should not be an average of any particular behavior, but a gestalt of everything observed in the interview.</description>
