  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 5-part dose-finding and preliminary efficacy study of pembrolizumab (Pembro) +
      dabrafenib (D) + trametinib (T) for participants with advanced melanoma and solid tumors.

      Parts 1 and 2 are open-label to find and confirm the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/maximum
      administered dose (MAD) for Pembro+D+T. The primary hypothesis (Parts 1 and 2) is that
      Pembro+D+T is sufficiently well-tolerated to permit clinical investigation.

      Part 3 is a double-blind study of Pembro+D+T versus placebo+D+T. The primary study hypothesis
      (Part 3 only) is that the Pembro+D+T improves progression-free survival (PFS) compared with
      placebo+D+T.

      Part 4 is nonrandomized and open-label and is designed to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability and identify the MTD or MAD of Pembro+T in participants who have v-raf murine
      sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 [BRAF] mutation-negative (without V600 E or K) melanoma or
      solid tumors [irrespective of BRAF status]. The primary hypothesis (Part 4) is that Pembro+T
      is sufficiently well-tolerated to permit clinical investigation.

      Part 5 will confirm the dose(s) identified in Part 4 in participants BRAF wild type [without
      V600E or K] melanoma or solid tumors [irrespective of BRAF status] and will further evaluate
      the safety and preliminary efficacy (Objective Response Rate [ORR]) of Pembro+T in
      participants who have BRAF wild type [without V600E or K] melanoma only. The primary
      hypotheses (Part 5) are that Pembro+T is sufficiently well-tolerated at the MTD/MAD to permit
      further clinical investigation and is effective in attaining objective responses based upon
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 by Investigator review in
      participants who have melanoma without BRAF V600 E or K mutations. With Amendment 5
      (21-Mar-2019), the Part 5 expansion cohort will not be pursued following the completion of
      Part 5 dose confirmation.

      Parts 1 and 2 of the study will also explore the MTD/MAD for open-label Pembro+T (for BRAF
      mutation-negative participants) concurrently with the Pembro+D+T arm; Pembro+D (for BRAF
      mutation-positive participants).
