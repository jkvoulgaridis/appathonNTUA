  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether DEB is more effective than common PTA
      balloon using under in long-term vessel patency and inhibiting restenosis in the
      infrapopliteal artery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PTA is an established alternative to open surgical bypass for the treatment of infrainginual
      disease of critical limb ischemia.

      DEBs are designed to promote arterial patency by reducing neointimal proliferation.
