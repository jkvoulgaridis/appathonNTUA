  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the combination of low frequency repetitive
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and motor-imagery-based brain computer interface
      (BCI) training is effective for enhancing motor recovery after stroke.

      The PI's hypothesis is that, in comparison with traditional physical therapy alone, subjects
      receiving supplementary rTMS and BCI training will show greater functional improvements in
      hand motor ability over time as well as recovery of normal motor connectivity patterns.

      The goal of the present study is to develop and evaluate a brain based approach to improve
      motor recovery after stroke, by combining rTMS and BCI training. Treatments will consist of
      low frequency rTMS applied to the contralesional hemisphere, followed by BCI training to
      encourage activity within the lesioned hemisphere. The primary objective of this study is to
      test the main hypothesis above in a stroke patient population. Subjects will also undergo a
      period of BCI only treatments after completion of the combined rTMS and BCI portion.

    <measure>Changes in Cortical Excitability and Cortical Activation Patterns as Measured by MRI and Functional MRI</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Post-Test 1 (3 weeks), Post-Test 2 (6 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The MRI and functional MRI will evaluate the extent to which cortical areas are recruited both during rest and during movement related tasks. This is quantified by a laterality index, calculated as the ratio of activations of ipsi- and contra-lesional precentral gyri during a paretic hand tracking task. A LI of -1 corresponds to entirely contralesional activation, while a value of +1 corresponds to entirely ipsilesional activation.</description>

    <measure>Changes in Paretic Hand Motor Function as Measured by the Finger Tracking Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Post-Test 1 (3 weeks), Post-Test 2 (6 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The finger tracking test evaluates the subject's ability to track an oscillating wave with either their paretic or non-paretic finger. Subjects wore custom electro-goniometer braces on each hand, each of which included a potentiometer signaling extension and flexion of the index finger metacarpophalangeal joint. Subjects were presented with target stimuli with a random sinusoidal waveform and were instructed to move the corresponding index finger to match the target trace as the cursor moved across the screen with constant velocity. Performance was quantified by an accuracy index, calculated using the ratio of the error to the standard deviation of the target, normalized to the range of motion for each subject.</description>

    <measure>Changes in Inter-hemispheric Inhibition</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Post-Test 1 (3 weeks), Post-Test 2 (6 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Inter-hemispheric Inhibition was evaluated using paired-pulse TMS both for the stroke hemisphere to non-stroke hemisphere direction as well as for the non-stroke hemisphere to the stroke hemisphere direction. IHI was measured by applying TMS to identified left and right motor hotspots at 1 mV threshold intensity, or 130% of the RMT if 1 mV threshold could not be identified, with single unilateral pulses and paired bilateral pulses. IHI was quantified by comparing the paired-pulse peak-to-peak motor evoked potential amplitudes to the corresponding single pulse MEP amplitudes for each direction of stimulation (ipsi- to contra-lesional and contra- to ipsi-lesional).</description>

          <title>Changes in Cortical Excitability and Cortical Activation Patterns as Measured by MRI and Functional MRI</title>
          <description>The MRI and functional MRI will evaluate the extent to which cortical areas are recruited both during rest and during movement related tasks. This is quantified by a laterality index, calculated as the ratio of activations of ipsi- and contra-lesional precentral gyri during a paretic hand tracking task. A LI of -1 corresponds to entirely contralesional activation, while a value of +1 corresponds to entirely ipsilesional activation.</description>
          <population>The laterality index was not calculated for one subject in post-test 2 as no activation overlapped with the ipsilesional or contralesional precentral gyrus.</population>

        <title>Changes in Paretic Hand Motor Function as Measured by the Finger Tracking Test</title>
        <description>The finger tracking test evaluates the subject's ability to track an oscillating wave with either their paretic or non-paretic finger. Subjects wore custom electro-goniometer braces on each hand, each of which included a potentiometer signaling extension and flexion of the index finger metacarpophalangeal joint. Subjects were presented with target stimuli with a random sinusoidal waveform and were instructed to move the corresponding index finger to match the target trace as the cursor moved across the screen with constant velocity. Performance was quantified by an accuracy index, calculated using the ratio of the error to the standard deviation of the target, normalized to the range of motion for each subject.</description>

        <description>Inter-hemispheric Inhibition was evaluated using paired-pulse TMS both for the stroke hemisphere to non-stroke hemisphere direction as well as for the non-stroke hemisphere to the stroke hemisphere direction. IHI was measured by applying TMS to identified left and right motor hotspots at 1 mV threshold intensity, or 130% of the RMT if 1 mV threshold could not be identified, with single unilateral pulses and paired bilateral pulses. IHI was quantified by comparing the paired-pulse peak-to-peak motor evoked potential amplitudes to the corresponding single pulse MEP amplitudes for each direction of stimulation (ipsi- to contra-lesional and contra- to ipsi-lesional).</description>

rTMS: Low frequency rTMS (either real or sham) will be applied to the contralesional hemisphere at a rate of 1Hz for 10 minutes.
