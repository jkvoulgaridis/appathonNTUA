  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      efficacy and safety study of ataluren in patients with nonsense mutation cystic fibrosis
      (nmCF) not receiving chronic inhaled aminoglycosides.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is to enroll 208 subjects (184 fully evaluable) with nonsense-mutation-mediated CF
      who are at least 6 years of age and have an forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) &gt;=
      40% and &lt;= 90% of predicted. Subjects will be stratified based on age, inhaled antibiotic
      use, and baseline FEV1, and will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive oral ataluren
      administered 3 times per day (TID) at respective morning, midday, and evening doses of 10-,
      10-, and 20-mg/kg or placebo. Based on the results of a previously conducted study, patients
      treated with chronic inhaled aminoglycosides (including TOBI) will not be eligible for
      participation. Spirometry measurement at the screening visit will establish patient
      eligibility for inclusion based on lung function. FEV1 stability will be assessed during the
      approximately 4-week screening period, at the conclusion of which patients will be required
      to demonstrate a relative change in %-predicted FEV1 of less than 15% when compared to the
      screening value. Assessments will be performed every 8 weeks, depending upon the outcome
      measure.

    <measure>Absolute Change From Baseline in Percent-predicted Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (ppFEV1) at Week 48</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>The FEV1 is the volume of air forcibly exhaled in one second and is measured using forced expiratory air spirometry. Change in ppFEV1 at Week 48 was defined as the average between the change from baseline at Week 40 and that at Week 48. Baseline for ppFEV1 was defined as an average of ppFEV1 at Screening (Weeks -4 to -1) and Baseline (Day 1) visits.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>48-week Rate of Pulmonary Exacerbations</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>Pulmonary exacerbations were assessed using expanded Fuchs criteria. The expanded Fuchs exacerbation is defined as the presence of at least 4 of 12 Fuchs' signs and symptoms requiring treatment with any form of antibiotic treatment (inhaled, oral, or intravenous). Fuchs' signs and symptoms included increased cough; change in sputum volume, color, or consistency; new or increased hemoptysis; increased dyspnea during moderate or mild exertion, or at rest; sinus pain or tenderness; change in sinus discharge; malaise, fatigue, or lethargy; anorexia or weight loss; temperature above 38 degrees Celsius; change in findings on chest examination; relative 10% decrease in ppFEV1, and chest radiography results consistent with pulmonary infection. The 48-week rate was calculated as: 48-week rate = total number of events /treatment duration by week*48.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire - Revised (CFQ-R) Respiratory Domain at Week 48</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) and Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>The teen/adult CFQ-R was used for this study. It was developed specifically for participants with cystic fibrosis. It is a disease-specific instrument designed to measure impact on overall health, daily life, perceived well-being, and symptoms. The respiratory domain assessed respiratory symptoms like coughing, congestion, wheezing etc. Scaling of each item is done via 4-point Likert scales. Scores for each item are summed up to generate a domain score. Scores ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better health and lower scores indicating worse health.</description>

    <time_frame>From study drug administration to 4-week post treatment follow-up visit (approximately 52 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. A TEAE is defined as an AE that occurs or worsens in the period extending from first dose of study drug to 4 weeks after last dose of study drug. An SAE is an untoward medical occurrence or effect associated with the use of a study drug at any dose, regardless of whether it is considered to be related to the study drug, which results in one of the following: death; inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; life threatening adverse event; persistent or significant disability or incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions; any other medically important event; or a pregnancy resulting in spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly.</description>

        <title>48-week Rate of Pulmonary Exacerbations</title>
        <description>Pulmonary exacerbations were assessed using expanded Fuchs criteria. The expanded Fuchs exacerbation is defined as the presence of at least 4 of 12 Fuchs' signs and symptoms requiring treatment with any form of antibiotic treatment (inhaled, oral, or intravenous). Fuchs' signs and symptoms included increased cough; change in sputum volume, color, or consistency; new or increased hemoptysis; increased dyspnea during moderate or mild exertion, or at rest; sinus pain or tenderness; change in sinus discharge; malaise, fatigue, or lethargy; anorexia or weight loss; temperature above 38 degrees Celsius; change in findings on chest examination; relative 10% decrease in ppFEV1, and chest radiography results consistent with pulmonary infection. The 48-week rate was calculated as: 48-week rate = total number of events /treatment duration by week*48.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire - Revised (CFQ-R) Respiratory Domain at Week 48</title>
        <description>The teen/adult CFQ-R was used for this study. It was developed specifically for participants with cystic fibrosis. It is a disease-specific instrument designed to measure impact on overall health, daily life, perceived well-being, and symptoms. The respiratory domain assessed respiratory symptoms like coughing, congestion, wheezing etc. Scaling of each item is done via 4-point Likert scales. Scores for each item are summed up to generate a domain score. Scores ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better health and lower scores indicating worse health.</description>

The respiratory domain assessed respiratory symptoms like coughing, congestion, wheezing etc. Scaling of each item is done via 4-point Likert scales. Scores for each item are summed up to generate a domain score. Scores ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better health and lower scores indicating worse health.</description>
          <population>The ITT population included all randomized participants who had FEV1 data available at Baseline and at least one post-baseline visit.</population>

        <title>Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Treatment Emergent Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</title>
        <description>An adverse event (AE) is any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. A TEAE is defined as an AE that occurs or worsens in the period extending from first dose of study drug to 4 weeks after last dose of study drug. An SAE is an untoward medical occurrence or effect associated with the use of a study drug at any dose, regardless of whether it is considered to be related to the study drug, which results in one of the following: death; inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; life threatening adverse event; persistent or significant disability or incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions; any other medically important event; or a pregnancy resulting in spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly.</description>
