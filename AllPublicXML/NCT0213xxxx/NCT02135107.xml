    <textblock>
      This is randomized, multicenter, parallel-group, double-blind trial that investigates the
      efficacy and safety of rabeprazole 10mg twice daily over a period of 52 weeks. The 8-week
      Treatment Period (unblinded) was followed by a 52-week Maintenance Period (blinded).
      Participants with cure (modified Los Angeles Classification Grade N or Grade M) at the final
      endoscopy of the Treatment Period were entered into the Maintenance Period. Participants
      without cure were discontinued from the study. The participants in the Treatment Period were
      randomized to take Arm C or Arm D at a ratio of 1:1. The non-recurrence rate as
      endoscopically confirmed at 52 weeks shall be the primary end point, and this shall be
      examined through a randomized, multicenter, parallel-group, double-blind trial that
      investigates the efficacy and safety of rabeprazole 10mg twice daily over a period of 52
      weeks.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Heartburn (Daytime / Nighttime) During the Maintenance Therapy Period</measure>
    <time_frame>From Week 4 up to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>A comparison of the rabeprazole 10 mg once daily group and the rabeprazole 10 mg twice daily group was performed for participants who did not exhibit daytime or nighttime heartburn at Week 0 of the Maintenance Therapy Period. Heartburn is a burning sensation in the stomach or lower chest; it is worsened by bending or pressure on the abdomen. Heartburn frequency was rated from 0-day (no) to 7-day (always) and severity was graded on a 3-point scale (mild, moderate, severe). Heartburn was evaluated in the daytime (from wake-up time to time for bed) and nighttime (from time for bed to wake-up time).</description>

    <measure>Frequency of Heartburn (Daytime / Nighttime) During the Maintenance Therapy Period</measure>
    <time_frame>From Week 4 up to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>A comparison of rabeprazole 10 mg once daily group and the rabeprazole 10 mg twice daily group shall be performed for participants who did not exhibit daytime or nighttime heartburn at 0 weeks of the maintenance therapy period. Daytime and nighttime heartburn, and nighttime sleep disorders shall likewise be compared. For the participants who had recurrence, values at the final evaluation were imputed using a last observation carried forward (LOCF) method.</description>

    <measure>Severity of Heartburn (Daytime / Nighttime) During the Maintenance Therapy Period</measure>
    <time_frame>From Week 4 up to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>A comparison of the rabeprazole (10 mg once daily group) and the rabeprazole (10 mg twice daily group) was performed for participants who did not exhibit daytime or nighttime heartburn at Week 0 of the Maintenance Therapy Period. The presence or absence of heartburn was assessed by the investigators during medical interviews. The heartburn incidence during each of the 7-day periods immediately before visiting the hospital was assessed on a scale of five stages based on the number of days with symptoms: 0 (no symptoms), 1 to 2 (occasional symptoms), 3 to 4 (sometimes had symptoms), 5 to 6 (often had symptoms), and 7 (always had symptoms). The incidence was tabulated by an analysis classifying the states into two groups: &quot;no symptom group&quot; (0 days with symptoms) and &quot;with symptoms group&quot; (1 day or more with symptoms). The severity of heartburn was as below: Mild (feel heartburn but tolerable), Moderate (feel heartburn and hard), and Severe (feel heartburn and terrible).</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Sleep Disorders During the Maintenance Therapy Period</measure>
    <time_frame>From Week 4 up to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep disorders were defined as the condition of lack of dead sleep and arousal during sleep arising from heartburn or acid reflux. Sleep disorders during each of the 7-day periods immediately before visiting the hospital were assessed. Evaluation of sleep disorders arising from heartburn or acid reflux included recording if sleep-inducing drugs were being taken before enrollment; their type, method of use, and dosage. It was requested that no changes in sleep-inducing drug be made after enrollment. Sleep disorders were rated from 0-day (no) to 7-day (always). The incidence of sleep disorder was tabulated by an analysis classifying the stages into two groups: &quot;No&quot; (0 days with sleep disorder) and &quot;Yes&quot; (1 or more days with sleep disorder). Heartburn was evaluated prior to 7 days of each visit.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>From date of first dose up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug, up to approximately 1 year 3 months (Treatment Period; 8 weeks, Maintenance Therapy Period; 52 weeks, and Follow-up Period; 30 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Safety was assessed by monitoring and recording all adverse events (AEs) and SAEs, regular monitoring of hematology, clinical chemistry, urine values, and regular measurement of vital signs. All AEs were graded on a 3-point scale; 1) mild was defined as discomfort that did not interfere with normal daily activities, 2) moderate was defined as discomfort that interfered with normal activities, and 3) severe was defined as discomfort that interfered with the ability to work or normal daily activities were impossible. SAEs were medical events that led to death, were life-threatening, required hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization, caused persistent disability, or resulted in a congenital abnormality. TEAEs were AEs with an onset date on or after the first dose of study drug and up to 30 days after receiving the last dose of study drug. Treatment-related AEs were medical events that were considered by the investigator to be possibly or probably related to rabeprazole.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Heartburn (Daytime / Nighttime) During the Maintenance Therapy Period</title>
        <description>A comparison of the rabeprazole 10 mg once daily group and the rabeprazole 10 mg twice daily group was performed for participants who did not exhibit daytime or nighttime heartburn at Week 0 of the Maintenance Therapy Period. Heartburn is a burning sensation in the stomach or lower chest; it is worsened by bending or pressure on the abdomen. Heartburn frequency was rated from 0-day (no) to 7-day (always) and severity was graded on a 3-point scale (mild, moderate, severe). Heartburn was evaluated in the daytime (from wake-up time to time for bed) and nighttime (from time for bed to wake-up time).</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants With Heartburn (Daytime / Nighttime) During the Maintenance Therapy Period</title>
          <description>A comparison of the rabeprazole 10 mg once daily group and the rabeprazole 10 mg twice daily group was performed for participants who did not exhibit daytime or nighttime heartburn at Week 0 of the Maintenance Therapy Period. Heartburn is a burning sensation in the stomach or lower chest; it is worsened by bending or pressure on the abdomen. Heartburn frequency was rated from 0-day (no) to 7-day (always) and severity was graded on a 3-point scale (mild, moderate, severe). Heartburn was evaluated in the daytime (from wake-up time to time for bed) and nighttime (from time for bed to wake-up time).</description>

The presence or absence of heartburn was assessed by the investigators during medical interviews. The heartburn incidence during each of the 7-day periods immediately before visiting the hospital was assessed on a scale of five stages based on the number of days with symptoms: 0 (no symptoms), 1 to 2 (occasional symptoms), 3 to 4 (sometimes had symptoms), 5 to 6 (often had symptoms), and 7 (always had symptoms). The incidence was tabulated by an analysis classifying the states into two groups: &quot;no symptom group&quot; (0 days with symptoms) and &quot;with symptoms group&quot; (1 day or more with symptoms). The severity of heartburn was as below: Mild (feel heartburn but tolerable), Moderate (feel heartburn and hard), and Severe (feel heartburn and terrible).</description>

        <description>Sleep disorders were defined as the condition of lack of dead sleep and arousal during sleep arising from heartburn or acid reflux. Sleep disorders during each of the 7-day periods immediately before visiting the hospital were assessed. Evaluation of sleep disorders arising from heartburn or acid reflux included recording if sleep-inducing drugs were being taken before enrollment; their type, method of use, and dosage. It was requested that no changes in sleep-inducing drug be made after enrollment. Sleep disorders were rated from 0-day (no) to 7-day (always). The incidence of sleep disorder was tabulated by an analysis classifying the stages into two groups: &quot;No&quot; (0 days with sleep disorder) and &quot;Yes&quot; (1 or more days with sleep disorder).

        <title>Frequency of Sleep Disorders During the Maintenance Therapy Period</title>
        <description>Sleep disorders were defined as the condition of lack of dead sleep and arousal during sleep arising from heartburn or acid reflux. Evaluation of sleep disorders arising from heartburn or acid reflux included recording if sleep-inducing drugs were being taken before enrollment; their type, method of use, and dosage. It was requested that no changes in sleep-inducing drug be made after enrollment. Sleep disorders were rated from 0-day (no) to 7-day (always). Heartburn was evaluated prior to 7 days of each visit.</description>

        <description>Safety was assessed by monitoring and recording all adverse events (AEs) and SAEs, regular monitoring of hematology, clinical chemistry, urine values, and regular measurement of vital signs. All AEs were graded on a 3-point scale; 1) mild was defined as discomfort that did not interfere with normal daily activities, 2) moderate was defined as discomfort that interfered with normal activities, and 3) severe was defined as discomfort that interfered with the ability to work or normal daily activities were impossible. SAEs were medical events that led to death, were life-threatening, required hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization, caused persistent disability, or resulted in a congenital abnormality. TEAEs were AEs with an onset date on or after the first dose of study drug and up to 30 days after receiving the last dose of study drug. Treatment-related AEs were medical events that were considered by the investigator to be possibly or probably related to rabeprazole.</description>
