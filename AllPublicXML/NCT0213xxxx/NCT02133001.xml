    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of intranasal esketamine 84 milligram
      (mg) compared with intranasal placebo along with standard care treatment, in reducing the
      symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD) (an affective disorder manifested by either a
      dysphoric mood or loss of interest or pleasure in usual activities, the mood disturbance is
      prominent and relatively persistent), including the risk for suicide as assessed by the
      Investigator, in participants who will be assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide.

      This is a randomized (study medication assigned to participants by chance), double-blind
      (neither physician nor participant knows assigned study treatment), placebo-controlled
      (participants are randomly assigned to a test treatment or to an identical-appearing
      treatment that does not contain the test drug), and multicenter (when more than one hospital
      or medical school team works on a medical research study), study of esketamine in
      participants with major depressive disorder (MDD) in participants who will be assessed to be
      at imminent risk for suicide, as measured by the change from Baseline on the
      Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score at 4 hours postdose on Day 1.
      The duration of study will be approximately 81 days per participant. The study consists of 3
      parts: Screening (that is, with in 1 day before study commences on Day 1) and double-blind
      Treatment (from Day 1-25) and Follow-up (from Day 26 up to Day 81). All the eligible
      participants will be provided standard care treatment and will be randomly assigned to either
      esketmaine or placebo treatment. Esketamine/placebo will be administered by intranasal route
      (delivery of medications through the nasal mucosa) two times per week for 4 weeks. Efficacy
      of the participants will be primarily evaluated through MADRS. Participants' safety will be
      monitored throughout the study.

    <description>The MADRS consists of 10 items that cover all of the core depressive symptoms (apparent sadness, reported sadness, inner tension, sleep, appetite, concentration, lassitude, interest level, pessimistic thoughts, and suicidal thoughts). Each item is scored from 0 (item is not present or is normal) to 6 (severe or continuous presence of the symptom). A total score (0 to 60) is calculated by adding the scores of all 10 items. For each item as well as the total score, a higher score represents a more severe condition. The last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach was used for missing visit data in the ITT LOCF efficacy analyses.</description>

    <description>BSS is 21-item self-reported instrument to detect and measure severity of suicidal ideation. BSS measures broad spectrum of attitudes and behaviors associated with risk of suicide. Items in scale assess respondent's suicidal plans, deterrents to suicide, level of openness to revealing suicidal thoughts. First 19 items of scale measure gradations of severity of suicidal wishes,attitude, plans.Statements reflect increasing gradations of this severity,are scored from 0 to 2. Final two items ask about number of suicide attempts, seriousness of intention to die associated with last attempt,they are not used in calculating BSS total score. Total BSS score represents severity of suicide ideation, calculated by summing ratings of first 19 items;total score ranges from 0 to 38, with higher score representing greater suicide ideation.

        <title>Change From Baseline to Day 1: 4-Hour Post-dose in Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) Total Score (Double-blind Phase)</title>
        <description>The MADRS consists of 10 items that cover all of the core depressive symptoms (apparent sadness, reported sadness, inner tension, sleep, appetite, concentration, lassitude, interest level, pessimistic thoughts, and suicidal thoughts). Each item is scored from 0 (item is not present or is normal) to 6 (severe or continuous presence of the symptom). A total score (0 to 60) is calculated by adding the scores of all 10 items. For each item as well as the total score, a higher score represents a more severe condition. The last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach was used for missing visit data in the ITT LOCF efficacy analyses.</description>

        <description>Percentage of participants with response (greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 50% improvement from baseline in MADRS total score) during the follow up was assessed. The MADRS consists of 10 items that cover all of the core depressive symptoms (apparent sadness, reported sadness, inner tension, sleep, appetite, concentration, lassitude, interest level, pessimistic thoughts, and suicidal thoughts). Each item is scored from 0 (item is not present or is normal) to 6 (severe or continuous presence of the symptom). A total score (0 to 60) is calculated by adding the scores of all 10 items. For each item as well as the total score, a higher score represents a more severe condition.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Follow-up Phase-Endpoint (Day 81) in Suicide Ideation and Behavior Assessment Tool (SIBAT)-Clinical Global Judgment of Suicide Risk Score (Follow-up Phase)</title>
        <description>SIBAT CGJ-SR: Module 8 operates like numerous other CGI severity scales used in other psychiatric studies. Changes in CGJ-SR designed to categorize clinically meaningful changes in clinician rated suicide risk from 'not at all suicidal' to 'participant is at imminent risk of suicide and immediate need for strong intervention (hospitalization with 24 hour 1:1 observation).' Patient scores for clinician-rated suicide risk: 0 (not suicidal); 1(occasional suicidal ideas, no intervention required);2(some clear suicidal ideas present),3(suicidal risk requires scheduled outpatient follow-up,no immediate intervention),4(suicidal risk requires immediate intervention, no hospitalization). 5( suicidal risk requires immediate hospitalization, no suicide precautions),6 (suicide risk requires hospitalization with suicide precautions). LOCF approach used for missing visit data in ITT LOCF efficacy analyses. Last post baseline observation was carried forward as &quot;End Point&quot; for follow up phase.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline to Follow-up Phase-Endpoint (Day 81) in Suicide Ideation and Behavior Assessment Tool Patient-Reported Global Assessment of Suicide Risk (Module 6) Score (Follow-up Phase)</title>
          <description>SIBAT was specifically developed to measure rapid change in suicidality, based on concerns that existing scales such as BSS are not designed to discriminate differences associated with rapid change. Patient-rated section includes following modules: Module 1 (M-1)(demographic information,suicide history), M-2(current suicidal thinking),M-3 (protective factors), M-4 (suicide behavior),M-5(suicide risk),M-6(suicide-implicit association test).Patient-reported global assessment of suicide risk summarizes patient's judgment of suicide risk (Module 6). Scores: 0(None), 1(Very weak), 2(Weak), 3(Moderately weak), 4(Mild), 5(Moderate), 6 (Moderately strong), 7(Strong), 8(Extremely strong), 9(Extremely strong,constant). Negative change in score indicates improvement. LOCF approach used for missing visit data in ITT LOCF efficacy analyses, last post baseline observation was carried forward as the &quot;End Point&quot; follow up phase.</description>

        <description>BSS is 21-item self-reported instrument to detect and measure severity of suicidal ideation. BSS measures broad spectrum of attitudes and behaviors associated with risk of suicide. Items in scale assess respondent's suicidal plans, deterrents to suicide, level of openness to revealing suicidal thoughts. First 19 items of scale measure gradations of severity of suicidal wishes,attitude, plans.Statements reflect increasing gradations of this severity,are scored from 0 to 2. Final two items ask about number of suicide attempts, seriousness of intention to die associated with last attempt,they are not used in calculating BSS total score. Total BSS score represents severity of suicide ideation, calculated by summing ratings of first 19 items;total score ranges from 0 to 38, with higher score representing greater suicide ideation.

        <title>Change From Baseline to Day 1: 4-Hours Postdose in Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS) Total Score (Double-blind Phase)</title>
        <description>BHS is paper-based self-reported measure to assess one's level of negative expectations or pessimism regarding future. Consists of 20 true-false items that examine the respondent's attitude over past week by either endorsing a pessimistic statement or denying an optimistic statement; 9 are keyed false and 11 are keyed true. Items fall within 3 domains: feelings about future; loss of motivation; future expectations. each response is assigned a score of 0 or 1. Total BHS score is sum of item responses, with range from 0 to 20, with a higher score representing higher level of hopelessness. Total scores that range from 0 to 3 are (normal range), scores 4 to 8 (mild hopelessness, scores 9 to 14 (moderate hopelessness), scores &lt;14 (severe hopelessness). Negative change in score indicates improvement. The LOCF approach was used for missing visit data in the ITT LOCF efficacy analyses.</description>
