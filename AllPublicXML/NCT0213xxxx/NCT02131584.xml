  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well ruxolitinib phosphate works in reducing fatigue in
      patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Ruxolitinib phosphate may stop the growth of
      cancer cells by blocking a protein called Janus kinase (JAK) that is needed for cell growth
      and may also help control fatigue, decrease the size of lymph nodes and/or lower the number
      of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells in the blood.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the reduction in fatigue as measured by the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) of
      patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who do not require anti-neoplastic therapy
      according to the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (IWCLL) 2008
      recommendations.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the reduction in other symptoms using the M. D. Anderson Symptom Inventory
      (MDASI) and to assess disease burden and response by the IWCLL 2008 response criteria.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive ruxolitinib phosphate orally (PO) twice daily (BID) (approximately 12 hours
      apart) for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

             10^9/L at the screening visit

          -  Subjects must have discontinued all drugs used to treat CLL no later than day -30

          -  Subjects with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1
