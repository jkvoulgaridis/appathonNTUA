  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to compare the development of new geographic atrophy in
      patients with wet Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) when treated with either ranibizumab
      or aflibercept over 24 months. Geographic atrophy is an advanced form of AMD that can result
      in the progressive and irreversible loss of visual function over time.

    <textblock>
      In each arm, patients underwent three monthly loading doses (at Baseline, Week 4, and Week
      8). From Week 8, after the patient had received their third injection of study treatment, the
      visit intervals were determined by the patient's disease activity. If any of the
      protocol-specified signs of disease activity were present in the study eye, the subsequent
      injection visit interval was kept at 4 weeks. If none of the signs were present, the
      subsequent injection interval was extended by 2-week increments up until a maximum of
      12-weekly intervals was reached. If there were any signs of disease activity in the study
      eye, the treatment interval was reduced as specified in the protocol. The planned individual
      duration of study participation was 24 months.

    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 24</time_frame>
    <description>Multimodal images of the eye were obtained by trained study site personnel and forwarded to an independent Central Reading Center, where the area of GA was measured. Area was treated as zero if GA was reported as absent (Overall determination of GA presence). Mean change from baseline in GA area was reported in square root-transformed data (mm). One eye (study eye) contributed to the analysis.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 12, Month 24</time_frame>
    <description>Multimodal images of the eye were obtained by trained study site personnel and forwarded to an independent Central Reading Center. A patient was considered to have developed new GA if they did not have any GA at the start of the study period and were subsequently diagnosed with GA during the study period (diagnosis of GA change from &quot;No&quot; to &quot;Yes).&quot; The analysis of new GA development was restricted to only those subjects without GA reported at baseline.

    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 12, Month 24</time_frame>
    <description>Retinal nerve fibre thickness was assessed using Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and measured in micrometers. A negative change in value (i.e. thinner nerve fibre) indicates nerve damage. One eye (study eye) contributed to the analysis.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Patients With Ocular Inflammation at Baseline and 7 Days Post-injection Following 3rd Mandated Intravitreal Injection - Anterior Chamber Cells</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 9</time_frame>
    <description>Anterior cell grade was assessed by the Investigator during slit lamp examination and graded on a 5-point scale: Grade 0=0 cells; Grade 1=1 to 10 cells; Grade 2=11 to 20 cells; Grade 3=21 to 50 cells; Grade 4=&gt;50 cells. The presence of blood cells (red and white) in the anterior chamber of the eye (the fluid-filled space inside the eye between the iris and the cornea's innermost surface) is a sign of intraocular inflammation. A score of 0 indicates an absence of inflammation. One eye (study eye) contributed to the analysis.</description>

    <description>Anterior chamber flare was assessed by the investigator during slit lamp examination and graded on a 5-point scale, with 0 = none; 1 = mild (trace to clearly noticeable, visible); 2 = moderate; 3 = marked; and 4 = severe. The presence of flare (increased protein levels) in the anterior chamber of the eye (the fluid-filled space inside the eye between the iris and the cornea's innermost surface) is a sign of intraocular inflammation. A score of 0 indicates an absence of inflammation. Proportion of patients is reported as a percentage. One eye (study eye) contributed to the analysis.</description>

        <description>Anterior cell grade was assessed by the Investigator during slit lamp examination and graded on a 5-point scale: Grade 0=0 cells; Grade 1=1 to 10 cells; Grade 2=11 to 20 cells; Grade 3=21 to 50 cells; Grade 4=&gt;50 cells. The presence of blood cells (red and white) in the anterior chamber of the eye (the fluid-filled space inside the eye between the iris and the cornea's innermost surface) is a sign of intraocular inflammation. A score of 0 indicates an absence of inflammation. One eye (study eye) contributed to the analysis.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Patients With Ocular Inflammation at Baseline and 7 Days Post-injection Following 3rd Mandated Intravitreal Injection - Anterior Chamber Flare</title>
        <description>Anterior chamber flare was assessed by the investigator during slit lamp examination and graded on a 5-point scale, with 0 = none; 1 = mild (trace to clearly noticeable, visible); 2 = moderate; 3 = marked; and 4 = severe. The presence of flare (increased protein levels) in the anterior chamber of the eye (the fluid-filled space inside the eye between the iris and the cornea's innermost surface) is a sign of intraocular inflammation. A score of 0 indicates an absence of inflammation. Proportion of patients is reported as a percentage. One eye (study eye) contributed to the analysis.</description>
