  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, multicenter, open-label, two-arm study in treatment-naive participants
      with operable, locally advanced, or inflammatory, centrally-assessed HER2-positive early
      breast cancer (EBC) whose primary tumors were greater than or equal to (&gt;/=) 2 centimeters
      (cm). The study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of trastuzumab emtansine +
      pertuzumab (experimental arm; T-DM1 + P) versus chemotherapy, trastuzumab + pertuzumab
      (control arm; TCH + P). The study comprised a neoadjuvant treatment period, followed by
      surgery, and an adjuvant treatment period.

      Treatment can be stopped due to disease recurrence, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of
      consent, or study termination.

    <time_frame>Pre-surgery (within 6 weeks after neoadjuvant therapy; up to approximately 6 months)</time_frame>

        <title>Time to Clinically Meaningful Deterioration in GHS/QoL Score</title>
        <description>Participants rated their quality of life (global health status) on EORTC QLQ C-30, with total scores ranging from 0 (worst) to 100 (best); where higher score indicates better quality of life. Time to deterioration was defined as the time from baseline to first 10-point (or greater) decrease as measured by GHS/QoL. All valid GHS/QoL questionnaires of the neoadjuvant phase including surgery were used. Participants without deterioration were censored at the time of completing the last GHS/QoL plus 1 day. Median time to deterioration was estimated with Kaplan-Meier method. The 95% confidence interval (CI) for the median was computed using the method of Brookmeyer and Crowley.</description>
