  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure the effectiveness of a wearable therapeutic
      ultrasound device for relief of pain associated with the trapezius muscle of the upper back
      over a 4-week period. The trapezius muscle is a wide, flat, superficial muscle that covers
      most of the upper back and the posterior of the neck.The hypothesis is that the ultrasound
      device will lower the reported daily pain level of subjects suffering from trapezius muscle
      pain in their upper back.

      Subjects who participate in the study will self-administer the ultrasound device daily if
      pain is rated 3.0 or higher on the numeric rating scale (0-10). Subjects will be required to
      visit the clinical site at enrollment and weeks 2 and 4 for a total of 3 visits. Subjects
      will report their daily pain levels in a diary. Subject will also report pain levels at 30
      min, 2 hours, and 4 hours (treatment completion) after start of each treatment.

      The wearable ultrasound device, SamÂ®, has been cleared by the FDA for pain relief, relief of
      joint contracture, relief of muscle spasm, and increased circulation.

      The study will have approximately 33 subjects randomly assigned into a user group (active
      ultrasound device) of 25 participants or a control group (inactive ultrasound device) of 8
      participants with an equal number of males and females in each group. The research
      coordinator will be blinded to the assignment of devices to each group.

      The daily pain scores reported by patients who receive active devices will be compared to
      those who receive placebo devices.

      Background:

      Approximately 50 to 80 million people in the United States suffer from some form of chronic
      pain. Back pain is the most common neurological disorder in the United States after headaches
      and costs consumers nearly $50 billion annually. Pharmaceuticals currently dominate the
      treatment options despite a myriad of public health problems including cost, untoward side
      effects, and addiction to widely available opioid analgesics. Non-pharmaceutical treatments,
      such as the one under test, provide a safer and potentially lower cost alternative to
      traditional analgesic use.

    <measure>Pain on the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1, Week 2, Week 3, Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Patients applied the ultrasound device when trapezius muscle pain exceeds a score of 3 or higher by numeric rating scale (NRS). NRS range was 0-10 with 0 being no pain and 10 the worst pain possible. Device maybe be worn safely for 4 h per day for 7 days a week. Participants recorded NRS score daily (pre-treatment) and on days when the device was applied participants recorded pain 30 minutes into treatment, 2 hours into treatment and post-treatment (after 4 hours). The post-treatment score is used to find the week average and standard deviation.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 1 through Week 1, Week 2, Week 3, and Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The Day 1 pre-treatment score was used to find the change in pain each week, rated on the numeric rating scale (NRS). NRS was rated from 0-10 with 0 being in no pain and 10 the worst pain possible. Weekly averaged post-treatment scores were subtracted from Day 1 pre-treatment score.</description>

    <measure>Pain on the Numeric Rating Scale Assessed Before, During, and After Treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 through Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Participants recorded pain rated on the numeric rating scale (NRS) at 4 time points: before treatment, 30 minutes into treatment, 2 hours into treatment, and directly after treatment. NRS range was from 0-10 with 0 being no pain and 10 the worst pain possible. The average time point scores across the study is used to assess pain during treatment.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 1 through Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The numeric rating scale (NRS) was used to assess pain before treatment, 30 minutes into treatment, 2 hours into treatment, and post-treatment. NRS range was from 0-10 with 0 being in no pain and 10 the worst pain possible. Change in pain was calculated by subtracting intra-treatment and post-treatment average scores from pre-treatment average score.</description>

    <measure>Comparison of Pain Level Using Global Rating of Change (GROC) Scale.</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1, Week 2, Week 3, Week 4, Overall</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were asked to report how their body feels overall compared to the day before, on days when the ultrasound device (or placebo) were applied. The score was reported after the 4-hour treatment completion and rated on a 15-point global rating of change scale, with -7 being &quot;a very great deal worse&quot; than the day before, 0 being &quot;no change&quot; from the day before, and +7 being &quot;a very great deal better&quot; than the day before. The weekly average GROC and average GROC for the entire study (Overall) were assessed.</description>

        <title>Pain on the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS)</title>
        <description>Patients applied the ultrasound device when trapezius muscle pain exceeds a score of 3 or higher by numeric rating scale (NRS). NRS range was 0-10 with 0 being no pain and 10 the worst pain possible. Device maybe be worn safely for 4 h per day for 7 days a week. Participants recorded NRS score daily (pre-treatment) and on days when the device was applied participants recorded pain 30 minutes into treatment, 2 hours into treatment and post-treatment (after 4 hours). The post-treatment score is used to find the week average and standard deviation.</description>

        <title>Change in Pain Rated on Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) From Pre-treatment to 30 Minutes Into Treatment, 2 Hours Into Treatment, and Post-treatment (4 Hours Into Treatment)</title>
        <description>The numeric rating scale (NRS) was used to assess pain before treatment, 30 minutes into treatment, 2 hours into treatment, and post-treatment. NRS range was from 0-10 with 0 being in no pain and 10 the worst pain possible. Change in pain was calculated by subtracting intra-treatment and post-treatment average scores from pre-treatment average score.</description>

        <description>Participants were asked to report how their body feels overall compared to the day before, on days when the ultrasound device (or placebo) were applied. The score was reported after the 4-hour treatment completion and rated on a 15-point global rating of change scale, with -7 being &quot;a very great deal worse&quot; than the day before, 0 being &quot;no change&quot; from the day before, and +7 being &quot;a very great deal better&quot; than the day before. The weekly average GROC and average GROC for the entire study (Overall) were assessed.</description>
