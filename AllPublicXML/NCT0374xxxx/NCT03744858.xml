      Enrollment criteria and clinical data collection: following the principles of medical ethics,
      the development of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Selecting 200 cases of chronic venous
      disease (CVD) according to the Comprehensive Classification System for Chronic Venous
      Disorders (CEAP) divided into 6 Clinical stages (C1-C6) (Group A). Selecting 200 healthy
      participants without CVD (C0) as controls (Group B). Blood samples will be collected from
      both groups. Markers of pyroptosis (NETs, Caspase-1 and Cytokines) will be evaluated between
      the two groups and between the subgroups, according to clinical stage, in group A.

      Pyroptosis is a pro-inflammatory form of regulated cell death and is dependent on networks of
      extracellular fibers (NET,s), on the enzymatic activity of inflammatory proteases that belong
      to the family of cysteine-dependent aspartate-specific proteases (caspase), and cytokines.
      The role of inflammation has been previously demonstrated in chronic venous disease (CVD),
      which is a condition that affects up to 80% of adult population in western countries.

      According to the Comprehensive Classification System for Chronic Venous Disorders (CEAP)
      divided into 6 Clinical stages:

      C0: no visible or palpable signs of venous disease. C1: telangiectasies or reticular veins.
      C2: varicose veins. C3: edema. C4a: pigmentation and eczema. C4b: lipodermatosclerosis and
      atrophie blanche. C5: healed venous ulcer. C6: active venous ulcer.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the role of pyroptosis in the onset and progression of
      CVD.

      The Investigators will select 200 participants with chronic venous disease (CVD) according to
      Clinical stage of CEAP (C1-C6 patients) [Group A] . The investigators will also select 200
      healthy participants without CVD (C0) as controls [Group B].

      Peripheral vein blood samples will be collected from both groups. Markers of pyroptosis
      (NETs, Caspase-1 and Cytokines) will be evaluated between the two groups and between the
      subgroups of group A, according to clinical stage.
