  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adolescents and young adults with eating disorders undergoing refeeding on an inpatient unit
      often experience abdominal pain and anxiety either as a result of their medical condition or
      as an expected side effect of nutritional rehabilitation. The purpose of this study is to
      assess if VR (Virtual Reality) mindfulness therapy is more or as effective as the standard of
      care (supportive care such as aromatherapy, heat packs, distraction, and nausea bands) for
      treating and/or preventing anxiety and pain in patients with eating disorders during the
      re-nourishment process. The anticipated primary outcome will be reduction of abdominal pain
      and anxiety with utilization of this intervention.

      In this study, investigators hope to 1) assess acceptance of VR mindfulness among inpatient
      adolescents and young adults with eating disorders 2) assess effects of VR mindfulness on
      perceived abdominal pain and 3) determine the impact of VR mindfulness on anxiety scores.

      This study is designed to test the feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness of VR
      mindfulness in patients as they undergo various medical and nutritional therapies to treat
      their conditions.

    <description>Participating patients will be provided with a VR headset (pre-programmed with mindfulness content) after lunch for 15 minutes with supervision while on strict bedrest. The headset will be collected following the intervention. Patients are currently provided with a post-meal survey following all meals as part of the standard of care, and will complete the survey following the lunchtime intervention.</description>
