  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine whether transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can be used to
      improve outcomes from exposure therapy for social anxiety disorder, and facilitate extinction
      of fear responding toward individuals outside one's own ethnic group (i.e., ethnic out-group
      members).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although exposure therapy is among the most powerful treatment techniques for social anxiety,
      many individuals do not achieve full remission. Furthermore, some research suggests that fear
      responding toward ethnic out-group members may be more resistant to extinction. Enhancing
      activation of the mPFC during exposure therapy may improve overall response to treatment, and
      also facilitate extinction of fear toward ethic out-groups. Researchers have found that
      greater mPFC activation during exposure therapy is associated with better outcomes, and that
      transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can be used enhance learning and cognition
      with no known serious adverse effects. This study will therefore examine whether
      active/anodal (versus sham) tDCS targeting the mPFC (a) enhances overall reductions in social
      anxiety symptoms, and (b) facilitates extinction of fear responding toward ethnic/racial
      out-groups for both Latino and Caucasian/non-Latino participants. Participants will receive
      either active/anodal tDCS or sham tDCS during a brief exposure therapy intervention involving
      public speaking in a Virtual Reality (VR) environment. The public speaking audience in the VR
      environment will alternate between audiences that are either matched or unmatched to the
      participant's ethnicity (in a randomly assigned order). Participants' fear reactivity will be
      assessed with behavioral, physiological, and subjective measures at baseline, post-treatment,
      and follow-up.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Behavioral approach test</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline to one-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will provide a speech to (a) an audience primarily matched to their ethnicity, and (b) an audience primarily un-matched to their ethnicity. The speech will be for up to 5 minutes in duration. During each BAT, we will assess fear response behaviorally (length of the speech, up to 5 min in duration), physiologically (heart rate and electrodermal activity), and subjectively (self reported levels of anticipated and peak fear).</description>

    <measure>Public Speaking Anxiety Scale (PSAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline to one-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete the PSAS, a 17-item questionnaire that assesses self-reported behavioral, cognitive, and physiological manifestations of public speaking anxiety. The items are sum scored, and totals range from 17 to 85, with higher scores indicating higher levels of public speaking anxiety.</description>

    <measure>Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline to one-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete the LSAS, a 24 item questionnaire that assesses self-reported fear and avoidance of social situations. Items will be sum scored for one overall total score (range 0 - 144), the fear subscale (range 0 to 72), and the avoidance subscale (range 0 to 72). Higher scores indicate greater severity on both subscales and the overall scale.</description>

    <measure>Brief Fear of Negative Evaluation Scale-II (BFNE)</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline to one-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete the BFNE-II, a 12-item questionnaire that assesses the extent to which one has concerns about negative evaluation in social settings. A sum score is calculated for the scale, with total scores ranging from 12 to 60, and higher scores indicating higher levels of fear of negative evaluation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self Statements During Public Speaking Scale (SSPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline to one-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete the SSPS, a 10-item questionnaire that asses both positive and negative self statements associated with public speaking. The items within each of the two subscales are summed, with total scores ranging from 0 to 25 for each subscale, and higher scores indicating higher levels of agreement with positive or negative self statements, respectively.</description>
