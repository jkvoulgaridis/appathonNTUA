  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates physical properties of a innovative leg compression stocking compared to
      a standard compression stocking of the same compression strength in patients with chronic
      venous insufficiency clinical stadium C3 and above, according to the CEAP classification for
      chronic venous insufficiency.

      The physical properties can be measured through a series of measurements. The hypothesis is
      that the innovative compression stocking, although changed in design to be more easily
      donned, will perform as good as the standard compression stocking.

      In each participant the examinations will be conducted with both stockings. A computer
      generated list will allocate each participant to either one of the stockings, with which the
      examinations will be conducted first.

    <description>The SSI is a substraction of the Interface Pressures measured with a pressure probe on the leg of the study participant in standing and in supine position while wearing a compression stocking. The point cB1 is a thereby a standard measuring point at the distal insertion of the gastrocnemius muscle of the leg.</description>
