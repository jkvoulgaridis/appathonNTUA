  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      News techniques of intubation by indirect laryngoscopy have arrived in operating rooms but
      they are still too restricted to situations (difficult intubation criteria ..). It wanted to
      focus on indirect laryngoscopy by Airtraq. This technique allows better exposure during
      intubation while limiting mouth opening and cervical hyper extension, but also dental trauma
      and lip wounds. It also reduces the duration of laryngoscopy and therefore at the same time
      the apnea time. After a review of the literature, it has been proven that its use reduces
      haemodynamic changes during intubation. But these studies have been realized only in very
      particular patients (obese, heart failure) and with induction protocols that are not used
      routinely in our operating theaters.

      Reasons why it decided to carry out this study, on the one hand to find these results and
      especially to be able to extend them to the whole population.
