    <textblock>
      This study aims to improve communication between medical teams, patients, and families in the
      pediatric cardiac intensive care unit. The researchers hypothesize that both improving
      interprofessional teamwork when preparing for family meeting and preparing families for these
      meetings will improve team and family satisfaction with communication. The study will involve
      bringing together a group of medical professionals and parents of patients to collaboratively
      design an intervention. In addition, the researchers will study feasibility and acceptability
      of the intervention and whether it impacts family and team outcomes.

      Context:

      A large proportion of children with advanced heart disease (AHD) die in the pediatric cardiac
      intensive care unit (CICU), where parents describe obtaining a realistic understanding that
      their child had a life-limiting disease only 2 days prior to death. Delayed or inadequate
      communication within teams or with families may contribute to this lack of understanding (as
      shown in children with other serious illnesses), while interactions with pediatric palliative
      care specialists (PPCS) have been shown to improve communication and understanding of
      prognosis. The limited number of PPCS, however, means that all clinicians in the CICU must
      have the skills to support parental decision-making, including giving bad news and eliciting
      parental goals for their child.

      Objectives:

        1. To develop a communication skills training (CST) program for interprofessional teams in
           the pediatric CICU via a co-design process.

        2. To evaluate CICU clinicians' perceived feasibility and acceptability of the CST.

        3. To evaluate CST impact on communication skills and team function in actual family
           meetings.

        4. To describe and evaluate parents' communication challenges in the CICU and their
           satisfaction with communication.

      Study Design:

      Prospective cohort study with pre and post assessments around an intervention.

      Setting/Participants:

      Clinicians at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and parents of children
      previously hospitalized in the ICU will be invited to participate in the co-design portion of
      the study to develop the team and family based intervention. A separate group of volunteer
      attending intensivists, cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, front line clinicians, bedside
      nurses, and social workers from the pediatric CICU at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia
      (CHOP) will undergo the intervention and participate in observed family meetings before and
      after the intervention. Other clinicians who are participating in an observed family meeting
      will also be enrolled. Parents or legal guardians and their children in the CICU who have
      been there for at least 7 days and are expected to stay at least another 7 days will also be
      consented and enrolled.

      Study Interventions and Measures:

      Intervention:

      The intervention includes both an interprofessional team training that will include practice
      in communication skills of giving bad news and building team collaboration and a family
      oriented intervention to prepare them for family meetings.

      Measures:

      The Co-design process to develop the intervention will have focus groups to evaluate the
      interventions' content and perceived feasibility.

      The impact of the intervention on CICU clinicians' perceived usefulness and satisfaction with
      the training will be measured with post-intervention and one month follow-up surveys.

      For the actual family meetings, assessment of the impact of the intervention on communication
      and team function in actual family meetings pre and post-intervention will be done by coding
      audio recordings with validated tools and qualitative coding of content. Collaboration will
      be measured using the amount of time different members of different disciplines speak, and
      team member perception and satisfaction with collaboration will be measured using a validated
      tool.

      Parents' experiences in family meetings and perspectives on communication with the clinical
      team will be measured with a pre-intervention survey measuring parental mood, affect, and
      satisfaction with communication or with semi-structured interview.

    <measure>Changes in parental satisfaction with communication in the CICU</measure>
    <time_frame>4 years</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in parental satisfaction with communication in the CICU will be evaluated with the Pediatric Family Satisfaction with Care in the Intensive Care Unit (PFS-ICU 24) survey, which has been validated for use with parents/caregivers of critically ill children. The pFS-ICU 24 survey has 24 Likert-scale questions divided in two domains; satisfaction with care (14 questions) and satisfaction with medical decision-making (10 questions). Scores range from 0-100, with 0 representing the lowest satisfaction and 100 representing the highest satisfaction.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in parental perspectives about communication satisfaction in the CICU</measure>
    <time_frame>4 years</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in parental perspectives about and satisfaction with communication in the CICU will be evaluated using the Communication Assessment Tool-Team (CAT-T), a validated patient survey focused on the quality of communication received from a medical team. The tool consists of 15 items on a 5-point response scale (1 = &quot;poor,&quot; to 5 = &quot;excellent&quot;). Scores for the 5 assessed quality areas are calculated as percentage scores.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in staff retention</measure>
    <time_frame>4 years</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in staff retention will be evaluated by tracking staff retention over time via staff leaving positions within unit. Human Resources and/or unit records will be used for this purpose.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in clinician burnout</measure>
    <time_frame>4 years</time_frame>
    <description>Changes will be evaluated with the Maslach Burnout Inventory, a self-report validated measure of the three areas of burnout: emotional exhaustion (EE), depersonalization (DP), and personal accomplishment (PA). 22 items are divided into three subscales. Answers, related to how frequently respondents experience specified feelings, range from 0=never to 6=every day. Scores for each subscale are considered separately. The 8-item PA scale measures feelings of competence and successful achievement in one's work with people. Lower scores on the PA scale correspond to greater experienced burnout. The 5-item DP scale measures an unfeeling and impersonal response toward recipients of one's service, care, treatment, or instruction. Higher scores on the DP scale correspond to greater degrees of experienced burnout. The 9-item EE scale measures feelings of being emotionally overextended and exhausted at one's work. Higher scores on the EE scale correspond to greater experienced burnout.</description>
