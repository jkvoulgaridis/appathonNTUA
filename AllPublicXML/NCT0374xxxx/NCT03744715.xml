  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label extension study (Extension Study) designed to allow patients to
      continue to receive poziotinib treatment after they have completed the duration of treatment
      and all protocol-specified assessments and procedures in a previous Spectrum-sponsored
      poziotinib study (Original Study). Patients will proceed to the study with a maximum hiatus
      of 20 days following the End-of-Treatment (EOT) visit in the Original Study.

      This extension protocol is intended to provide clinical benefit of poziotinib to patients who
      are responding to treatment. The additional treatment is optional and voluntary.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who wish to participate in the extension study must provide written Informed
      Consent. Treatment will begin after completion of the End of Study (EOS) or EOT visit of the
      Original Study. The assessments obtained at the EOS visit will serve as Baseline data for the
      extension study. If a patient in the Original Study was to undergo an EOT visit and an EOS
      visit with no treatment administered between these two assessments, the patient, if consented
      to this Extension Study must enroll right after (with a maximum hiatus of 20 days) the EOT
      Visit of the Original Study so that the treatment will continue without a break.

      Patients will continue to receive poziotinib treatment at the dose and regimen they were
      receiving at the end of the Original Study.

      Patients may receive treatment until disease progression or as long as the patient is
      deriving clinical benefit, as judged by the investigator (case-by-case decision with approval
      of Spectrum), death, withdrawal of consent, unacceptable toxicity, lost to follow-up, or
      poziotinib receives commercial approval in their country of residence or development is
      terminated by the Sponsor, whichever occurs first. There will be an EOS Visit 35 (Â±5) days
      after the last dose of poziotinib.

             Spectrum-sponsored Study.

          -  Patient did not meet any treatment discontinuation criteria other than completing
             maximum treatment time of the original Spectrum-sponsored Study.

          -  Investigator opinion indicates that extended therapy with poziotinib is clinically
             appropriate for the patient and the patient is suitable for this Study.

             protocol.

          -  Patient must provide written Informed Consent, must be able to adhere to dosing and
             visit schedules, and meet protocol-defined study requirements.

          -  Patient is willing to practice 2 forms of contraception, one of which must be a
