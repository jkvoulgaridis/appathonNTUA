    <textblock>
      In this prospective study, breast capsule biopsy was performed in patients undergoing 2-stage
      expander-implant breast reconstruction to determine its use. Prospective clinical trial was
      designed for 10 consecutive patients as a pilot study and approved by IRB of Samsung Medical
      Center. From November 2013 to May 2015, full-thickness capsule biopsy specimen was obtained
      from acellular dermal matrix (ADM) capsule and from native subpectoral capsule (internal
      control) during expander-implant exchange. Biopsy specimens were scored for fibrosis and
      inflammatory reactions.

      This is completed study and its specific title, study objective, method, and results will be
      available online after scientific journal submission.
