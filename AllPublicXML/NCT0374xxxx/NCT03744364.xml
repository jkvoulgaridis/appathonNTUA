      Purpose:

      To compare the efficacy and safety of low-dose protocol of vaginal misoprostol and vaginal
      dinoprostone insert for induction of labor in women with post-term pregnancies.

      Methods:

      The investigators designed a prospective, randomized, open-labeled, blinded for the end-point
      evaluators trial including women of at least 41 weeks of gestational age with uncomplicated
      singleton pregnancies and Bishop score lower than 6. Participants were randomized into
      dinoprostone or misoprostol groups in a 1:1 ratio. Baseline maternal data and perinatal
      outcomes were recorded for statistical analysis. Successful vaginal delivery within 24 hours
      was the primary outcome variable.
