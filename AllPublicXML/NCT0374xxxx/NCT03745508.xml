  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Body composition analysis is frequently used in both clinical and research settings for
      evaluation of nutritional status and follow-up. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is one
      method that has been extensively used to measure body composition. To ensure the reliability
      of BIA results, several recommendations are proposed in the literature. One of them is to
      avoid coffee and caffeine prior the test. This instruction is primarily based on the
      potential diuretic effects of caffeine however few studies evaluated the impact of coffee on
      fluid balance. Research participants usually have several commitments, especially those
      enrolled in clinical trials. Simplified and evidence-based instructions can avoid unnecessary
      restrictions and lead to better participant compliance.

      Body composition analysis is frequently used in both clinical and research settings for
      evaluation of nutritional status and follow-up. Using only anthropometric measures is
      outdated considering the increasing transition towards an individualized treatment and the
      recent advances in body composition assessment.

      Methods to evaluate body composition in humans are chosen mostly based on compartment of
      interest, study population and feasibility. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is one
      method that has been extensively used to measure body composition. This method uses an
      impedance that can penetrates both intra- and extracellular fluids to estimate total body
      water, fat-free mass and body fat.

      To ensure the reliability of BIA results, several recommendations are proposed in the
      literature. One of them is to avoid coffee and caffeine prior the test. This instruction is
      primarily based on the potential diuretic effects of caffeine, which mechanisms are not
      completely understood. However, few studies evaluated the impact of coffee or caffeine
      (supplement) on fluid balance.

      Coffee is a highly consumed beverage worldwide. Coffee is one of the most consumed beverage
      among adults in Canada, and most of the caffeine consumed by adults comes from this beverage.
      In addition, coffee bioactive compounds such as methylxanthines can influence BIA results due
      its diuretic effect. Research participants usually have several commitments, especially those
      enrolled in clinical trials. Simplified and evidence-based instructions can avoid unnecessary
      restrictions and lead to better participant compliance. To the best of our knowledge the
      current study is the first to explore the effect of coffee with two different amounts of
      caffeine on BIA-derived body composition parameters.
