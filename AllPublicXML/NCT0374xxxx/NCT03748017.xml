  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PRO Health Study is a single-center, prospective, double-blind, randomized,
      placebo-controlled trial of streptococcus-containing supplementation in healthy adults.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Upon enrollment, healthy adults will enter a 1-week lead-in period which serves as an
      opportunity to collect baseline saliva samples and complete daily logs. Subjects that meet
      eligibility criteria on Day 7 will be randomized into 1 of 2 groups, receiving either a
      placebo-control or a streptococcus-containing probiotic supplement. Supplementation will
      begin on Day 8 and will continue for a total of 14 consecutive days. Participants will be
      observed for an additional 2 weeks following cessation of supplementation. The total duration
      of the study will be approximately 5 weeks. Saliva samples will be collected on 7 occasions
      and participants will be asked to complete questionnaires and daily diet and health logs
      throughout the course of the study.
