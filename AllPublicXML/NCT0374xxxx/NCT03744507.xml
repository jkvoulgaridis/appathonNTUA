      The purpose of this study is to characterize the longitudinal bone mineral density (BMD) in
      premenopausal women with uterine fibroids or endometriosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective observational study to characterize longitudinal BMD of premenopausal
      women with uterine fibroids or endometriosis over the 52-week observational period.

      Approximately 660 participants will be recruited into two cohorts: (1) premenopausal women
      with uterine fibroids confirmed by an ultrasound (approximately 260 participants), and (2)
      premenopausal women with endometriosis diagnosed or confirmed by surgical or direct
      visualization, or histopathology within 10 years of the Screening visit (approximately 400
      participants).

      Since age is a strong risk factor for BMD change over time, participants in this
      observational study will be matched by age category (18 to 24, 25 to 34, 35 to 44, and ≥45
      years old), with participants enrolled in the interventional studies of relugolix.

      During the Screening/Baseline period, the participant should be assessed for eligibility, and
      baseline dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan will be obtained. Bone densitometry
      (lumbar spine [L1-L4], total hip, and femoral neck) will be obtained and submitted for
      central reading at Baseline, Week 24, and Week 52.

      Information related to health care utilization for uterine fibroids or endometriosis and
      concomitant medications will be collected at every visit and during the phone calls at Week
      12 and Week 36.

      Collection of adverse events in this study will be limited to protocol-specified
      procedure-related adverse events. Reports of pregnancy will also be collected.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Is a premenopausal female 18 to 50 years old

          2. By the participant's report, had two consecutive regular menstrual cycles immediately
             prior to enrollment in the study. Participants with hormonal intrauterine devices or
             on other hormonal contraception methods that disrupt cyclic bleeding are not required
             to have two consecutive regular menstrual cycles.

          3. Has one of the following conditions:

               1. Diagnosis of uterine fibroids that is confirmed by an ultrasound within 5 years
                  prior to screening.

               2. Diagnosis of endometriosis confirmed by surgical or direct visualization and/or
                  histopathologic confirmation.

          4. Has not and is not expected to undergo a surgical procedure with bilateral
             oophorectomy within the 12 months following enrollment.

             Exclusion Criteria:

          5. Has a weight that exceeds the weight limit of the dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry
             scanner

          6. Has a baseline BMD z-score &lt; -2.0 at spine, total hip, or femoral neck

          7. Has a history of or currently has osteoporosis, or other metabolic bone disease

          8. Use within the past 3 months prior to Screening or anticipated use of systemic
             glucocorticoids
