  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An increase in overdose deaths has been attributed to widespread access to fentanyl and
      carfentanyl. The study is designed to determine if buprenorphine can change the respiratory
      depression response to intravenous (IV) fentanyl.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be performed in 2 parts. Part A is a 3-period study; the first 2 periods have
      a single-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design, where subjects will be randomized in a
      1:1 ratio to 2 treatment sequences determined by the order in which they receive
      buprenorphine or matching placebo. Period 3 is an open-label design where the same subjects
      will receive buprenorphine only. This period is optional, and will include approximately 6
      subjects.

      Part B is an open-label study in opioid tolerant patients. All will receive placebo plus
      fentanyl in Period 1 to permit dose escalation to full respiratory effects of fentanyl before
      assessing the interaction with buprenorphine. Subjects will receive buprenorphine plus
      fentanyl during Period 2 to assess the interaction with buprenorphine.

      To study ventilation, the dynamic end-tidal forcing technique will be used. This technique
      enables the Investigator to force end-tidal partial pressure of carbon dioxide and end-tidal
      partial pressure of oxygen to follow a specific pattern in time. Subjects with a
      procedure-related adverse event (AE) will be treated according to established ventilatory
      support and opioid reversal protocols.

    <intervention_model_description>Part A is a 3 period study in approximately 18 healthy subjects. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 2 treatment sequences determined by the order in which they receive buprenorphine or placebo (periods 1 and 2). An optional open-label Period 3 may be conducted in which subjects will receive buprenorphine only.
Part B is an open label study of approximately 8 opioid tolerant patients. All will undergo a washout of their own opioids which will be replaced with oral oxycodone and continue at stable doses from at least 48 hours prior to Period 1 to the end of Period 2. All will receive placebo plus fentanyl during Period 1 and buprenorphine plus fentanyl during Period 2.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Changes in peak ventilatory depression will be measured.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 hours (during study drug infusion)</time_frame>
    <description>Peak ventilatory depression (change in minute ventilation) will be calculated based on a 1-minute average of the ventilation data of each individual subject/patient. For buprenorphine or placebo, absolute changes and percentage changes are calculated from the baseline value. For fentanyl, absolute changes and percentage changes for each bolus are calculated from the baseline value and from the pre-fentanyl baseline value immediately before the first fentanyl bolus</description>

    <description>Apnoea is defined as a 20-second pause in respiration. If apnoea is observed at any fentanyl dose, the subject will be classified as &quot;experienced apnoea&quot; for that dose and any higher dose planned will be withheld</description>

    <description>Baseline ventilation will be stabilized and subjects will receive ondansetron (to minimize any nausea from opioids), and buprenorphine infusion for 6 hours. Buprenorphine will be initiated at doses expected to achieve target concentrations resulting in 25-50% suppression of baseline minute ventilation, and per 3 subjects will be determined based on safety and pharmacodynamics results. Subjects will receive fentanyl boluses at 4 defined time points during the infusion. Subjects will be monitored for at least 3 hours following the infusion prior to transfer to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU).</description>
