  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traditional suture closure of the columellar scar in rhinoplasty is achieved with permanent
      skin sutures. These sutures create less inflammation and are thought to lead to improved
      final scar outcomes. However, permanent sutures require removal which creates pain and
      inconvenience for the patient. Some surgeons use fast absorbing sutures that do not require
      removal. The difference in final scar outcome based on suture material used has not been well
      studied. This study will examine the final scar outcomes of rhinoplasty incisions sutured
      with traditional permanent suture compared to fast absorbing suture. If scar outcomes are
      similar between these groups as judged by the patients and blinded observers, rhinoplasty
      surgeons may be able to preferentially utilize absorbable sutures for incision closure and
      avoid the pain and inconvenience for the patient during suture removal
