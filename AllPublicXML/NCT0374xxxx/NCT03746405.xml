  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a highly debilitating disease with response rates to
      pharmacological treatment rarely exceeding 60%. Preliminary attempts have been made to use
      repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) as a non-pharmacological treatment
      alternative, but thus far rTMS approaches have demonstrated only modest efficacy. A major
      factor contributing to these limited effects stems from the depth penetration of TMS, which
      is not sufficient to directly modulate deep subcortical structures, such as the amygdala,
      that are affected in PTSD. Moreover, while rTMS effects have been shown to be
      state-dependent, (i.e. vary substantially according to the neural state during stimulation),
      this important factor is rarely considered during the clinical application of rTMS. The
      current study addresses both of these limitations to improve the therapeutic efficacy of rTMS
      for PTSD. Here we will develop a protocol to test if connectivity-based rTMS is able to
      modulate amygdala activity through the functional connections with medial prefrontal cortex,
      taking advantage of state-dependency to enhance rTMS effects by actively engaging the
      amygdala through a fear perception task. BOLD activation in the amygdala and its connectivity
      with the frontal cortex will constitute the primary outcomes to test rTMS efficacy. Heart
      rate variability and skin galvanic responses, acquired during the presentation of fearful
      faces, will be used as continuous moderators of task engagement during rTMS. If successful,
      this study will pave the way for a large-scale study to investigate whether state-dependent,
      connectivity-based rTMS of the amygdala can improve rTMS efficacy as a clinical treatment for
      PTSD.
