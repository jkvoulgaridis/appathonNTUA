  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess whether an intervention including mindfulness, dietary education, and
      smoking cessation can help African-American women of childbearing age (age 18-44) with
      hypertension or high blood pressure to lower their blood pressure. The investigators propose
      to screen women of childbearing age for hypertension, and to invite women to participate in
      an intervention to reduce their blood pressure. The investigators will track their perceived
      stress and their blood pressure levels over the next 6 months. Half of the women who
      participate will be given a blood pressure cuff and taught to measure their own blood
      pressure. More frequent tracking of blood pressure will be done in these women.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic and pregnancy-associated hypertension increase risk for poor birth outcomes,
      including higher rates of low birthweight and preterm birth. Mindfulness interventions,
      dietary education, and smoking cessation education have all been effectively employed to
      reduce hypertension, but have infrequently targeted women of childbearing age in community
      settings. This study will screen African-American women of childbearing age for hypertension,
      and invite women with hypertension to participate in a seven-session intervention to reduce
      blood pressure. The investigators will track their perceived stress and their blood pressure
      levels over the next 6 months. Half of the women who participate will be given a blood
      pressure cuff and taught to measure their own blood pressure. More frequent tracking of blood
      pressure will be done in these women.

    <intervention_model_description>Two groups will both participate in the 7-part educational series to reduce high blood pressure. One of the two groups will also be given a blood pressure cuff and will be trained to check their own blood pressure.

    <description>Score on Perceived Stress Scale. The Perceived Stress Scale (Cohen, S, 1994) is the most widely used psychological instrument for measuring the perception of stress. It is a 10-question survey asking to what degree certain stressors have been a problem in the past month. Responses are recorded on a 5-point Likert scale from 0 (never) to 4 (very often). The 6 negatively-stated items are scored as is, while the four positively stated items' scores are reversed. The total score may therefore range from 0 to 40. Higher scores indicate higher levels of stress (i.e. a worse outcome). There are no subscales.</description>
