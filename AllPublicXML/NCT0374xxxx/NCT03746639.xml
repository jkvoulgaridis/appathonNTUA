  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates whether therapeutic ultrasound (TUS) treatment applied to lumbar region
      with chronic low back pain affect renal function.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain is a common problem and there are many treatments for chronic low back pain,
      including TUS. Investigators routinely observed increased blood creatinine and urea levels in
      some of patients who received TUS.

      Half of patients will receive TUS treatment for low back pain while the other half will not
      receive. The patients will be evaluated at baseline and the end of the treatment . The serum
      creatinine, serum cystatin C, 24-hour urine creatinine, creatinine clearance, 24-hour urine
      microalbumin and microprotein, urine volume, and GFR will be measured at each evaluation.

    <measure>Concentration of serum creatinine</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>To measure the serum creatinine levels, 5 mL of venous blood will be collected in a tube containing a gel separator and clot activator in the morning after a 12-hour fast. Serum creatinine will be measured in an autoanalyser.</description>

    <measure>Value of 24-hour urine creatinine</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>After the first urine sample of the first day was discarded, 24-hour urine samples will be collected, including the first of the next day. The 24-hour urine samples will be analysed on the day of collection, and will be analysed using colorimetric method in an autoanalyser.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Value of creatinine clearance</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Creatinine clearance will be calculated with the following formula:
Urine creatinine (mg/dL) × urine volume (mL)/serum creatinine (mg/dL) × 1440.</description>

    <measure>glomerular filtration rate</measure>

    <description>Glomerular filtration rate will be as calculated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula. (GFR (mL/min/1.73 m²) = 175 × (Scr)-1.154 × (Age)-0.203 × (0.742 if female) × (1.212 if African American)</description>

    <measure>Concentration of serum cystatin C</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>To measure the cystatin-C levels, 5 mL of venous blood will be collected in a tube containing a gel separator and clot activator in the morning after a 12-hour fast. Serum cystatin C will be determined using a sandwich enzyme immunoassay kit.</description>

    <description>The physiotherapy modalities will be applied for five sessions a week for 3 weeks.
The all patients will be treated with superficial heating (the moist heat pack will be applied to the patient's lower back for 20 minutes) , transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation(frequency of 100 Hz, pulse duration of 100 μs, sensory-level amplitude was applied for 25 minutes) , exercise therapy (consisting of flexion, extension, stretching, mobilisation, and postural exercises performed for approximately 25 minutes ) .
In addition to these therapies, continuous therapeutic ultrasound treatment will be applied to patients in first group for 10 minutes; frequency of 1 megahertz, intensity of 1.5 W/cm2, effective irradiation area of the transducer head 5 cm2 .</description>
