  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pericoronitis is a painful inflammatory condition which is well known for its negative impact
      on quality of life of those affected. The aim of this study was to test two hypotheses: (1)
      that topical application of Benzydamine is as effective as oral Diclofenac or Flurbiprofen in
      improving pain and quality of life of patients with pericoronitis and (2) that there would be
      no difference between the effects of the two oral NSAIDs on pain and quality of life of
      patients with pericoronitis

    <description>For the pre- treatment period, the Oral Health-Related Quality of Life scores change was evaluated in the 1st day after the clinical examination and before the treatment with the help of the 5-point Likert-type scale where each item was scored from 1 (no trouble) to 5 (lots of trouble).</description>

    <description>For the post - treatment period, the Oral Health-Related Quality of Life scores change was evaluated with the help of the 5-point Likert-type scale where each item was scored from 1 (no trouble) to 5 (lots of trouble). Evaluated periods were 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 days</description>

    <description>For the pre-treatment period, the pain scores change was evaluated in the 1st day after the clinical examination and before the treatment with the help of the visual analog scale (VAS) ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (most severe pain).</description>

    <description>Before and after the treatment period, the Oral Health Impact Profile scores change was evaluated in the 1st day after the clinical examination and before the treatment (baseline), and after 7 days with the help of the 5-point scale where each item was scored from &quot;never&quot; = 0, &quot;hardly ever&quot; = 1, &quot;occasionally&quot; = 2, &quot;fairly often&quot; = 3, &quot;very often = 4&quot;</description>
