  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, single-arm, phase IB treatment study to determine the safety of
      administering anti-PD1 monoclonal antibodies with AV-MEL-1 and to get some suggestion of
      efficacy, in patients with measurable metastatic melanoma. These will be patients who have
      either never received treatment for metastatic melanoma or were previously treated with
      enzymatic inhibitors of the BRAF/MEK pathway because of BRAF600E/K mutations, and are about
      to initiate anti-PD1 monotherapy. The intent is to treat 14 to 20 patients with the
      combination of anti-PD-1 and AV-MEL-1.

      The sequence is as follows:

        1. Patients will provide consent for collection of blood and tumor, performance of
           leukapheresis, and intended plan to treat with a standard anti-PD-1 regimen, and to
           treat with their patient-specific AV-MEL-1 once it has been manufactured.

        2. Prior to starting anti-PD-1 therapy, surgically resected tumor tissue will be sent to
           AIVITA Biomedical where it will be processed to establish a short-term cell line of
           autologous tumor cells. Approximately 1 cm3 of surgically excised tumor is preferred.
           Whenever possible the tissue should be obtained from a lesion no greater than 2 cm in
           longest diameter. Part of the sample should be assessed by pathologists to confirm
           melanoma and to test for PDL-1 expression.

        3. Prior to starting anti-PD-1 therapy, patients will undergo leukapheresis to obtain
           peripheral blood mononuclear cells that will be converted into dendritic cells (DC).

        4. Patients will initiate anti-PD-1 therapy monotherapy (e.g. pembrolizumab or nivolumab)
           using standard doses and schedules of administration.

        5. When the vaccine is ready, which will take approximately 8 weeks from the date of tumor
           resection, and the patient has had the opportunity to have received about two months of
           anti-PD-1 monotherapy, it is expected per standard of care that the patient will undergo
           radiographic assessment to classify disease status and response (if there was measurable
           disease at baseline) to the anti-PD-1 therapy.

        6. Starting week 10, AV-MEL-1 will be given concurrently with continuation of the anti-PD-1
           therapy. AV-MEL-1 injections will be given weekly for 3 weeks, (weeks 10-12, then
           monthly at weeks 16, 20, 24, 28, and 32). Blood will be collected from patients prior to
           each injection for immune monitoring tests.

        7. If anti-PD-1 therapy is discontinued during vaccine treatment, the remaining vaccine
           doses may still be administered at the discretion of the patient's managing physician.
