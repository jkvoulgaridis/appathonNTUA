      The aim of this study is to describe the impact of : Geriatric intervention contribution on
      quality of life of elderly patients receiving systemic treatments for metastatic neoplasia

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Elderly cancer incidence increases exponentially with advancing age. However, elderly
      patients are largely underrepresented in cancer treatment trials. The geriatric population
      presents particular physical, mental, psychological or social specificities that may
      condition the prognosis especially for patients with metastatic neoplasia. Recently, the
      measurement of quality of life (QoL) in aging population is being recognized as an important
      part of clinical decision. It is therefore essential to set up prospective studies to
      evaluate the impact of oncogeriatric practices on the quality of life of elderly patients
      with metastatic neoplasia. The main objective of this prospective study is to describe the
      contribution of geriatric intervention on quality of life for for elderly (&gt; 75 years) with
      metastatic solid cancer receiving systemic treatment during the first 6 months of their
      therapeutic management.
