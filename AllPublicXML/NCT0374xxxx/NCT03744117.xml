  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Telemedicine is an innovative approach that has successfully facilitated palliative care
      consultations (PCC) in rural settings but not yet in dialysis. In this study, the
      investigators will deliver telemedicine-facilitated PCC to rural dialysis units leveraging an
      existing telehealth network.
