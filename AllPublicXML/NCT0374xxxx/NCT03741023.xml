      The purpose of the proposed study is to test these hypotheses through the following aims:

        1. To determine if early plasmin activation following severe injury correlates with SIRS,
           TIC and complications throughout convalescence in both trauma and surgical patients.

        2. To determine if early plasmin activation following severe injury correlates with
           plasminogen consumption and poor plasmin activity later in convalescence.

      Significance: Severe injury is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide, affecting
      approximately 2.8 million individuals and accounting for over 200,000 deaths annually across
      the United States. Large cohort studies have demonstrated that approximately 64% of
      trauma-related deaths are due to complications including thrombosis, bleeding, infection, and
      organ dysfunction, and each complication corresponds with an 8% increase in risk of
      mortality. While advances in critical care medicine have significantly improved the initial
      survival from traumatic injuries, the proportion of morbidity and mortality from
      complications experienced during traumatic convalescence has correspondingly skyrocketed.
      Early in convalescence, these patients are at risk of developing life-threatening
      complications instigated by trauma induced coagulopathy (TIC) and systemic inflammatory
      response syndrome (SIRS). Specifically, approximately 40% of patients with severe injuries
      develop TIC and approximately 70% develop SIRS. While these conditions individually increase
      the risk of secondary sequelae, in concurrence, they dramatically increase the risk of
      bleeding, thrombosis, infection, and multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). Later in
      convalescence, patients experiencing severe injury are at risk of suffering complications
      from pathologic tissue homeostasis and repair. For example, depending on the injury, 25-65%
      of severely injured patients' rehabilitation and quality of life are limited by poor bone
      health, including the development of osteoporosis, impaired bone healing, and/or the
      development of heterotopic ossification. Together, early and late complications of
      convalescence reportedly account for over $671 billion in healthcare expenditure and
      disability losses yearly. Thus, there is an unmet need for improved therapeutic and
      diagnostic measures for these patients to prevent or treat complications of early and late
      convalescence.

      The Acute Phase Response (APR): Following injury, the APR resolves the four principle
      problems provoked by disruption of tissue: bleeding, pathogen invasion, tissue hypoxia, and
      tissue dysfunction. After an isolated injury, e.g., femur fracture, the APR follows a
      predictable and quantifiable time-course with minimal risk of complications (Figure 1A). The
      survival phase contains the injury and prevents infection through hemostasis (fibrin
      deposition) and acute inflammation. The later repair phase effectively removes damaged
      tissue, regenerates new tissue, and restores function. Severe trauma derails the
      survival-APR, provoking complications in both in early and late convalescence (Figure 1B). In
      order to prevent exsanguination, severe trauma must provoke an adequate survival-APR in
      proportion to the severity of the injury. However, unrestrained and prolonged activation of
      coagulation and survival-inflammation lead to the development of TIC and SIRS and
      significantly increasing the risk of bleeding, thrombosis, and MODS. Additionally, if a
      patient persists within the survival-APR for an extended period of time, the prolonged
      activation of cellular inflammation promotes disorders of tissue homeostasis, e.g.,
      osteoporosis, and delays the transition to the repair-APR, stalling or preventing healing
      tissue and crippling recovery in these patients. Therefore, APR complications are
      mechanistically linked, that is, dysfunction of the survival-APR contributes to dysfunction
      of the repair-APR. Although there are many reports suggesting potential molecular
      determinants of a dysfunctional APR, the primary molecular targets driving this phenomenon
      are unknown.

      Severe Trauma-Provoked Changes in Plasmin Activity: Plasmin is converted from its zymogen,
      plasminogen, by its activators: tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and urokinase plasminogen
      activator (uPA). While plasmin is a multifunctional protease, its canonical role is the
      degradation of fibrin (fibrinolysis). While fibrinolysis occurs during the repair-APR
      following an isolated injury, a severe injury provokes early hyperactivation of plasmin
      (Figure 2). Fibrinolysis was first observed by anatomist Giovanni Morgagni and surgeon John
      Hunter in the late 1700s during autopsies of individuals that suffered traumatic injuries.
      Both Morgagni and Hunter noted that blood from these individuals strangely did not clot. It
      was later determined that blood clots formed following traumatic injury or invasive surgery
      spontaneously dissolved, leading to the discovery of plasmin.

      The immediate and most-recognized clinical consequence of this inappropriate
      hyperfibrinolysis is bleeding, as the degradation of fibrin opposes effective hemostasis. The
      clinical significance of injury- induced hyperfibrinolysis was propelled by improvements in
      critical care medicine that permitted not only survival of previously fatal traumatic
      injuries, but also invasive, elective surgical procedures through the use of antifibrinolytic
      therapeutics. Specifically, recent clinical studies in &gt;40,000 trauma patients have
      demonstrated that prevention of plasmin activation by antifibrinolytics (e.g., aminocaproic
      acid (Amicar), tranexamic acid (TXA)) significantly reduced blood loss and increased survival
      when administered early after injury. Thus, it has been established that inappropriate, early
      plasmin activation (hyperfibrinolysis) is a significant cause of bleeding and mortality
      following severe injury.

      Pathologic Fibrinolysis - Hemorrhage is the Tip of the Iceberg: Both hyperfibrinolysis and
      hypofibrinolysis occur following trauma and have been associated with complications
      throughout convalescence indicating that plasmin's biologic role following injury is more
      complex than previously understood. Indeed, since the initial investigations of plasmin's
      role in bleeding, our knowledge of the biological role of plasmin has greatly expanded beyond
      its role in hemostasis. Currently, it is recognized that plasmin is activated during
      virtually all tissue repair, where it degrades intra- and extravascular fibrin. In addition
      to fibrinolysis, plasmin also acts through non-canonical pathways to promote tissue repair
      including programming and migration of macrophages and progenitor cells, growth factor
      activation, and promotion of angiogenesis. Additionally, plasmin stimulates an acute
      inflammatory response, promoting tissue regeneration. Thus, plasmin is essential for tissue
      maintenance and repair. Specifically, our lab has extended this premise by determining that
      plasmin is essential for proper bone homeostasis, as well as bone and muscle repair. Thus,
      following trauma, the biological role of plasmin is not limited to intravascular activity and
      bleeding. Instead, it plays well defined, albeit less understood, roles in pro- and
      anti-inflammatory responses, tissue homeostasis, and repair of virtually all tissues. While
      these studies would suggest that plasmin plays beneficial role in recovery following trauma,
      judicious prevention of early plasmin activation is clearly beneficial in preventing life
      threatening hemorrhage.

      The purpose of the proposed study is to test these hypotheses through the following aims:

        1. To determine if early plasmin activation following severe injury correlates with SIRS,
           TIC and complications throughout convalescence in both trauma and surgical patients.

        2. To determine if early plasmin activation following severe injury correlates with
           plasminogen consumption and poor plasmin activity later in convalescence.

    <description>During Hospitalization:
Patients routinely have blood drawn at time of admission and every 12 hours following admission up until 2 weeks post-admission or until discharge. Remnants of the blood draw will be stored in the Vanderbilt Lab core and retrieved for further analysis by key research personnel. Patients will have an additional 5.2ml of blood drawn (2 blue-top tubes) per time point during their normal course of care for this study, for a total of 72.8 mL of blood drawn per week. In addition to the routine blood draws, a finger stick may also be obtained the same day. Approximately 3 drops of blood (100μL maximum) will be removed by the finger stick.
Follow-Up Visits During routine care visits, we would like to obtain blood via one finger stick. A maximum of one blood draw via finger stick would be collected per month by research personnel, for up to two years.</description>
