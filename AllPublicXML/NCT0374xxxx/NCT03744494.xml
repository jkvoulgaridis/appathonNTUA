  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The therapeutic efficacy of three types of orchidectomy was ascertained as well as the QoL
      and scrotal cosmetic satisfaction of patients in the three surgical arms. Two of these
      surgeries produced a pseudotesticle (BSCO, BESO) while one (BSO) did not.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with prostate cancer (PCa) were grouped into three surgical arms: BSO (bilateral
      simple orchidectomy), BSCO (bilateral subcapsular orchidectomy) and BESO (bilateral
      epididymal-sparing orchidectomy). Preoperatively, baseline serum testosterone, PSA, Quality
      of life (QoL) and pre-operative testicular volumes were obtained. Timed interval sampling for
      serum testosterone and PSA variation was done post-operatively. By three months post-op, the
      cosmetic appeal of the scrotal appearance, post-operative pseudotesticular volumes and QoL
      were also assessed.

      The therapeutic efficacy of the surgeries was determined by the rates of decline of serum
      testosterone and PSA, as well as the nadirs achieved. The variations in the pre-and
      post-operative QoL was analysed.

    <description>Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite- 26 questionnaires were also used to assess various aspects of the QoL pre-and post-operatively.
EPIC 26 scores are ranked from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating better function and less bother. Urinary incontinence, Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms, Bowel function/bother, Sexual function/bother, Hormone and vitality were assessed.</description>

    <description>Life Satisfaction -8 questionnaire was used to complement the EPIC-26 in the QoLassessment pre-and post-operatively.
Lisat-8 is ranked from 1 to 6, with 5 and 6 denoting satisfaction (5: Satisfying; 6: Satisfying) while scores of 4 and below connote varied degrees of dissatisfaction (1: very dissatisfying; 2: Dissatisfying; 3: Rather dissatisfying; 4: Rather satisfying)
EPIC 26 scores are ranked from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating better function and less bother. Urinary incontinence, Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms, Bowel function/bother, Sexual function/bother, Hormone and vitality were assessed.</description>

    <measure>Serum PSA levels</measure>
    <time_frame>Three months (timed interval sampling)</time_frame>
    <description>The serum PSA levels in ng/ml were measured pre-operatively, at removal of the testes, hourly for the first three hours, at seven days and three months post-operatively. Percentage PSA declines, PSA nadirs (ng/ml) and time to the attainment of PSA nadirs (hours) were determined from the data obtained.</description>

    <description>The serum testosterone levels in nmol/l were measured pre-operatively, at removal of the testes, hourly for the first three hours, at seven days and three months post-operatively. The attainment of surgical castrate levels of 20nmol/l or medical castrate levels of 20 nmol/l or medical castrate levels of 50nmol/l was assessed for as well as the testosterone nadirs achieved (nmol/l) and time to the attainment of testosterone nadirs (hours).</description>
