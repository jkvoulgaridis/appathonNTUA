      This study is a first in human Phase 1 study that involves patients with a type of cancer
      called HER2 (Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2) positive cancer.

      This study asks patients to volunteer to take part in a research study investigating the
      safety and efficacy of using special immune cells called HER2 chimeric antigen
      receptor-modified Adenovirus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (HER2 specific CAR T cells), in
      combination with intra-tumor injection of CAdVEC, an oncolytic adenovirus that is designed to
      help the immune system including HER2 specific CAR T cell react to the tumor.

      The study is looking at combining these two treatments together, because we think that the
      combination of treatments will work better than each treatment alone. We also hope to learn
      the best dose level of the treatments and whether or not it is safe to use them together.

      In this study, CAdVEC will be injected into participants tumor at one tumor site which is
      most easiest to reach. Once it infects the cancer cells, activation of the immune response
      will occur so it can attack and kill cancer cells. (This approach may have limited effects on
      the other tumor sites that have not received the oncolytic virus injection, so, patients will
      also receive specific T cells following the intratumor CAdVEC injection.) These T cells are
      special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill cells infected with viruses and tumor
      cells.

      Investigators want to see if these cells can survive in the blood and affect the tumor. Both
      CAdVEC and HER2-specific autologous CAR T are investigational products. They are not approved
      by the FDA.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment with CAdVEC:

      On the first day of treatment, participants will receive an intratumor injection of CAdVEC.

      A blood sample will be obtained from participants on Day 1 of treatment before participants
      receive CAdVEC intra-tumor injection. Depending on the location of the tumor, different
      techniques can be used for intra-tumor injection. The most common route of injection is
      ultrasound-guided percutaneous (needle puncture in the skin) injection, but endoscopic (using
      a lighted, flexible instrument called an endoscope) ultrasound-guidance will be used for some
      patients as appropriate. Prior to percutaneous injection, participants may receive an
      anti-anxiety medicine to calm them down, to relieve muscle spasms, and provide sedation. If
      the participants tumor is injected during an endoscopic procedure, the procedure may be done
      under sedation.

      Treatment with HER2- specific autologous T Cells:

      Earlier the participant gave blood for us to make Adenovirus-specific HER2 targeting
      cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (HER2- specific autologous T Cells). These cells are grown in the lab
      and frozen for participants. Invesitgators made the cells by combining dendritic cells (DCs)
      or monocytes with the T cells in the presence of produced mixtures of adenoviral proteins.
      Investigators then put a new gene in to those T cells to make them specifically attract to
      and kill HER2 positive tumors. As the T cells grow, they are cultured by adding adenoviral
      proteins for stimulation and expansion. Investigators call those T cells: adenovirus-specific
      HER2- targeting T cells (HER2- specific autologous T Cells).

      This study looks at different doses of HER2- specific autologous T Cells. The decision about
      the dose participants receive is determined when enrolled on the study.

      Six dose levels will be evaluated. Cohorts of size 3 will be enrolled at each dose level
      until 9 evaluable patients have been studied at a single dose. Each patient will receive an
      intratumoral injection of CAdVEC alone or combined with an injection of HER2.CAR T cells.

      CAdVEC intratumoral injection will be given as a single injection to a single appropriate
      tumor site by direct, endoscopic, or image-guided injection on Day 1. The injection site will
      be chosen based on a combination of criteria, including accessibility and safety of injection
      site; tumor size; and anticipated tumor viability (e.g. avoid necrotic or cystic injection
      sites). HER2.CAR T cells will be given intravenously on day 4 after CAdVEC injection, with a
      6 day window (until day 10).

      Before receiving the T cell infusion, participants may be given Benadryl (diphenhydramine)
      and Tylenol (acetaminophen). Tylenol and Benadryl are given to prevent a possible allergic
      reaction to the T cell administration.

      Standard medical tests before treatment:

      Before being treated, participants will receive a series of standard medical tests and
      procedures as well as research blood draws.

      Standard Medical tests during and after treatment:

      During treatment, participants will receive standard medical tests and procedures as well as
      research blood draws.

      Study specific evaluations:

      Investigators will follow participants closely after treatment for any side effects for at
      least 2 years after the last infusion.

      To learn more about the way the T cells are working in the body, an extra blood sample will
      be taken before the CAdVEC injection, before the HER2-AdVST infusion, and at week 1, 2, 4 and
      6 and 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after HER2- AdVST infusion. Investigators will use this blood to
      see how long the T cells last and to look at the immune response to the cancer. Investigators
      may also ask to get a tumor tissue biopsy at week 12 if necessary.

    <description>The intratumoral administration of CAdVEC will create a pro-inflammatory tumor microenvironment and will promote the recruitment and expansion of adoptively transferred HER2 specific CAR T cells via CAR (tumor antigen). We expect HER2 CAR T cells expanded at primary tumor sites will re-circulate and target metastasized tumors. The combination we propose to test has the potential to overcome each of the established individual limitations of oncolytic viruses and of CAR T-cells. Testing each element separately would not be beneficial or informative, since the combination therapy is anticipated to have unique profiles of both therapeutic benefit and potential toxicities.</description>
