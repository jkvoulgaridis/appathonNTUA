  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pregnant women at a higher risk for early-onset pree-clampsia (PE) should be offered
      preventive daily treatment with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) started before 16 weeks of
      gestation. To select patients at higher risk for early-onset PE, multiparametric assessment
      combining maternal history, biochemical factors and biophysical factors should be used during
      the first trimester of pregnancy. Multiparametric risk assessments have a detection rate for
      early-onset PE around 80% at a false positive rate of 10%. Owing to the low prevalence of
      early-onset PE, more than 90% of patients considered at high risk, at the first-trimester
      screening, will not eventually develop PE. Thus, ASA treatment would be innecessary and could
      be safely discontinued in these patients.

      The sFlt-1 to PlGF ratio has a high negative predictive value for PE during the second and
      third trimester of pregnancy. Thus, it could be used to detect false-positive patients from
      the first-trimester screening.

      This is a multicentric, randomized, open, parallel, controlled, phase III trial, where 798
      patients under treatment with ASA for being at high risk for preeclampsia from the
      first-trimester screening, will be candidates to participate. Patients with a sFlt-1/PlGF
      &lt;38, from 24 to 27+6 weeks of gestation will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio and allocated to
      either continue ASA until 36 weeks or to stop ASA treatment.

      The main objective of the study is to demonstrate that in patients considered to be at high
      risk for PE (from the first-trimester screening) and with sFlt-1/PlGF ratio &lt;38, between 24+0
      and 27+6 weeks, the incidence of PE, after cessation of the treatment with ASA, will not be
      superior to that of the control group.
