    <textblock>
      Supraspinatus tendonitis is a common clinical problem that causes functional and labor
      disabilities. It is the most frequent cause of shoulder pain. Manual therapy is a common
      intervention used by physical therapist for management of supraspinatus tendonitis. Joint
      mobilization, stretching and strengthening exercises are commonly used techniques for
      management of this condition. In this study KT will be added to conventional manual therapy
      and its efficacy will be investigated.

      The study design will be Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT) that will be used to compare the
      effects of KT added to manual therapy for management of supraspinatus tendonitis. 38 patients
      will be participate in this study who will be assigned randomly (biased coin method) to
      experimental and control groups (19+19). The data collection will be carried out at Railway
      Hospital Rawalpindi. Patients with shoulder pain at rest and positive for special tests
      (Neer's, Empty Can, Drop Arm, Hawkin's Kennedy) will be included in this study. There is no
      restriction on gender and age group will be between 25 and 60 years. Patients with cervical
      post op, referred pain, open wounds, allergic to KT and with signs of radiculopathy will be
      excluded from this study. Pre and post treatment evaluation will be done using Visual Analog
      Scale (VAS), Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) and goniometry. Data will be
      collected on 1st day, 4th day and 7th day for both groups. After data collection is
      completed, SPSS will be used to analyze the collected data

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Shoulder pain is a very common musculoskeletal disorder affecting a large portion of
      population . Prevalence ranges from 6% to 26% and it is estimated that 33% of population will
      have one episode of shoulder pain in lifetime. Rotator cuff tendonitis is considered as most
      common pathology of shoulder . Supraspinatus is one of the four muscles that can cause
      rotator cuff tendonitis. It is a common clinical disorder that causes functional and labor
      disorders. It is also the most frequent cause of shoulder pain.

      The origin of supraspinatus is fossa of scapula and its insertion is at superior facet on
      greater tuberosity of humerus. The nerve supply is at C4, C5 and C6. The main function of
      supraspinatus is abduction of shoulder.

      Indications: Supraspinatus tendonitis present following conditions

        1. Pain and inflammation

        2. Decreased ROM

        3. Decreased strength

        4. Decreased functional activity Injury Mechanisms: Supraspinatus tendonitis is caused by
           extrinsic as well as intrinsic factors. Extrinsic factors include increased subacromial
           activity, trauma, overhead activity, soft tissue imbalance, eccentric muscle overload
           and glenohumeral laxity. Intrinsic factorare acromial morphology, aging,
           acromioclavicular arthrosis and coracoacromial ligament hypertrophy.

      Kinesiotaping (KT) is widely used in clinical settings for rehabilitation of shoulder
      disorders . It is designed to facilitate the body's natural healing process while providing
      support and stability to muscles and joints without restricting the body's range of motion.
      The functioning of kinesio tap is based on following:

        1. Lifting effects of epidermis layers and papillary dermis, caused by micro-convolutions
           formed on the taped skin .

        2. Due to wrinkles generated by the KT, vascular networks in deep vessels under the skin
           are increased, reducing swelling and inflammation in injured tissues .

        3. KT contributes to pain relief by producing increased stimulation of cutaneous
           mechanoreceptors, and provides muscle activation.

      Akbaba et. al. investigated the effects of kinesio tape in management of rotator cuff tear
      and found that application of KT is effective in improving pain and function but the
      improvement was not clinically significant . Desjardins et. al. studied the efficacy of KT
      for rotator cuff tendonitis and found that KT significantly improved pain free range of
      motion. However, it couldn't be concluded with sufficient evidence that tendonitis was
      reduced significantly.

    <description>The Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) is a self-administered questionnaire that consists of two dimensions, one for pain and the other for functional activities. The pain dimension consists of five questions regarding the severity of an individual's pain. Functional activities are assessed with eight questions designed to measure the degree of difficulty an individual has with various activities of daily living that require upper-extremity use. The SPADI takes 5 to 10 minutes for a patient to complete and is the only reliable and valid region-specific measure for the shoulder.</description>
