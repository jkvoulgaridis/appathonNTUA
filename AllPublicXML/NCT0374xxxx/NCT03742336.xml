  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, randomized, 2 way crossover, single dose, open label study of the effect
      of PF 04965842 on dabigatran PK in healthy participants. Participants will be randomized to 1
      of 2 treatment sequences as described below. A total of 20 healthy male and/or female
      participants will be enrolled in the study so that 10 participants will be enrolled in each
      treatment sequence. Each treatment sequence will consist of 2 periods that are each 3 days in
      duration. The total duration of participation from the Screening Visit to Day 7 will be a
      maximum of 35 days and from the Screening Visit to Follow-up Contact/Visit will be a maximum
      of 70 days.

             requirements and restrictions listed in the informed consent document (ICD) and in
             this protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Participants are excluded from the study if any of the following criteria apply:

        Medical Conditions:

          1. Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic (including alcoholic liver
             disease, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), autoimmune hepatitis, and hereditary
             liver diseases), psychiatric, neurological, or allergic disease (including drug
             allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic, seasonal allergies at the time of
             dosing).

          2. Evidence or history of clinically significant dermatological condition (eg, atopic
             dermatitis or psoriasis) or visible rash present during physical examination.

          3. Participants, who according to the product label for dabigatran, would be at increased
             risk if dosed with dabigatran.

          4. Risks of bleeding including prior personal or familiar history of abnormal bleeding,
             hereditary or acquired coagulation or platelet disorder or abnormal coagulation test
             (prothrombin time [PT]/international normalized ratio [INR] or partial thromboplastin
             time [PTT]/activated partial thromboplastin time [aPTT] greater than upper limit of
             normal [ULN]) result at screening.

          5. Surgery planned within 4 weeks after the end of the study.

          6. Self reported history or risk factors for QT prolongation or torsades de pointes (eg,
             organic heart disease, congestive heart failure, hypokalemia, hypomagnesaemia,
             congenital long QT syndrome, myocardial ischemia or infarction), congenital deafness,
             family history of sudden death, and family history of long QT syndrome.

          7. Any condition possibly affecting drug absorption (eg, gastrectomy).

          8. History of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus, or hepatitis C virus
             infection; positive testing for HIV, hepatitis B surface antigen (HepBsAg), hepatitis
             B core antibody (HepBcAb), or hepatitis C antibody (HCVAb).

             As an exception, a positive HepBsAb as a result of participant vaccination is
             permissible.

          9. Other acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition including recent (within the
             past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior or laboratory abnormality that may
             increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product
             administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the
             judgment of the investigator, would make the participant inappropriate for entry into
             this study.

             Prior/Concomitant Therapy:

         10. Use of prescription or nonprescription drugs and dietary and herbal supplements within
             7 days or 5 half lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of
             investigational product.

             Prior/Concurrent Clinical Study Experience:

         11. Previous administration with an investigational drug within 30 days (or as determined
             by the local requirement) or 5 half lives preceding the first dose of investigational
             product used in this study (whichever is longer).

             Diagnostic Assessments:

         12. A positive urine drug test.

         13. Screening supine systolic blood pressure (BP) &lt;90 mm Hg or &gt;=140 mm Hg following at
             least 5 minutes of supine rest; OR Screening supine diastolic BP &lt;50 mm Hg or &gt;=90 mm
             Hg following at least 5 minutes of supine rest.

             If a participant meets any of these criteria, the BP should be repeated 2 more times
             and the average of the 3 BP values should be used to determine the participant's
             eligibility.

         14. Screening supine 12 lead ECG demonstrating:

               -  QTcF &gt;450 msec; OR

               -  QRS interval &gt;120 msec. If QTcF exceeds 450 msec, or QRS exceeds 120 msec, the
                  ECG should be repeated 2 more times and the average of the 3 QTcF or QRS values
                  should be used to determine the participant's eligibility.

         15. Participants with ANY of the following abnormalities in clinical laboratory tests at
             screening, as assessed by the study specific laboratory and confirmed by a single
             repeat test, if deemed necessary:

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT)
                  or alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT)
                  level &gt;=1.5 × ULN;

               -  Total bilirubin level &gt; ULN; participants with a history of Gilbert's syndrome
                  may have direct bilirubin measured and would be eligible for this study provided
                  the direct bilirubin level is &lt;=ULN;

               -  PT/INR or PTT/aPTT &gt; ULN;

               -  Estimated creatinine clearance &lt;90 mL/min.
