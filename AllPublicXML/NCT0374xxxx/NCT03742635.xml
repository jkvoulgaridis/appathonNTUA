  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will implement a study to evaluate the hypothesis that applying General
      Movements Assessments (GMA) in a telemedicine setting with real-time scoring is feasible and
      comparable to scoring video recordings.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that using telemedicine to conduct the GMA will improve early
      identification of risk for cerebral palsy and facilitate earlier referral and access to
      neurodevelopmental intervention. Preterm birth results from complex interactions of
      biological and socioeconomic risk factors, all of which continue to influence
      neurodevelopmental trajectories beyond the prenatal and neonatal period. Unfortunately many
      of the socioeconomic factors that contribute to increased risk of prematurity are also
      associated with decreased likelihood to attend appointments at high risk infant follow-up
      (HRIF) clinics. Early intervention has been shown to be most beneficial to infants with
      highest social risk. Additionally, mothers living in more rural communities tend to have
      higher social risk. They are often younger, more likely to be a single parent, and have lower
      income. Helping make follow-up more accessible and convenient for families through
      telemedicine and at an earlier age using the GMA has the potential to improve early
      identification, minimize loss to follow-up and ensure prompt referral to optimize outcomes
      for the most vulnerable babies in this already high-risk population.

    <description>Prechtl's Assessment of General Movements (GMA) is a tool used in early infancy to identify infants at high risk of cerebral palsy and neurodevelopmental impairment. General movements are complex motor patterns that involve the entire body, moving fluidly in different directions through the arms, legs, and trunk with variable speed, amplitude, force and intensity. During fetal development, spontaneously generated motor patterns, including general movements, can already be observed. The GMA is a functional assessment of the maturing nervous system that takes advantage of the fact that typically developing infants will have a progression in their general movements. This pattern is characterized by a writhing pattern in the early weeks post-term, followed by the emergence of fidgety movements at 3-5 months of age.</description>
