      This is a Phase I/Ib study testing the safety and preliminary efficacy of olaparib and
      vorinostat when used together in participants with relapsed/refractory and or metastatic
      breast cancer. Cancer cells grow in an uncontrolled manner and this causes damage to their
      DNA (genetic makeup). Cancer cells that cannot repair this damage will not survive and die.
      Unfortunately, cancer cells contain certain proteins whose job is to repair DNA damage. Poly
      (adenosine 5' diphosphoribose) polymerase (PARP) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) are two such
      proteins. Olaparib stops PARP from working, and vorinostat stops histone deacetylase from
      working. The use of olaparib and vorinostat together may better block the ability of cancer
      cells to repair their DNA damage. This may lead to even better killing of cancer cells.

      The study will be done in two parts. In part one of the study, different dose levels of
      olaparib and vorinostat will be tested in several study participants. This part of the study
      will allow us to see the doses of olaparib and vorinostat that can be used safely together in
      participants with relapsed/refractory and/or metastatic breast cancer. Up to 4 different dose
      levels will be studied. In part two of the study, the dose level of olaparib and vorinostat
      found to be the safest in the first part of the study will be tested. This part of the study
      will allow us to see how well relapsed/refractory and/or metastatic breast cancer responds to
      treatment with olaparib and vorinostat. Participants who received the dose level of olaparib
      and vorinostat found to be the safest in the first part of the study will also take part in
      part two of the study.

    <description>Phase I: Olaparib and vorinostat will be orally administered for 4 28-day cycles. Dose levels (DLs) are as follows: DL -1, 100 mg twice daily (b.i.d.) olaparib and 300 mg for 5 consecutive days per week vorinostat; DL 0 (starting dose), 200 mg twice daily (b.i.d.) olaparib and 300 mg once daily (q.d.) vorinostat; DL 1, 300 mg b.i.d. olaparib and 300 mg q.d. vorinostat; and DL 2, 300 mg b.i.d. olaparib and 400 mg q.d. vorinostat.
Phase Ib: Olaparib and vorinostat will be administered at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) determined in the Phase I portion of the study for 4 28-day cycles. Participants who derive clinical benefit (complete response, partial response, or stable disease) after 4 cycles will continue to receive study treatment until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.</description>
