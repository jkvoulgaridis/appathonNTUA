  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Xarelto in renally
      impaired patients with NVAF under routine practice conditions. The information collected in
      the XARENAL study will help to understand how renally impared patients with NVAF are treated
      in the real-world setting and what the outcome for the patients is under those conditions.
