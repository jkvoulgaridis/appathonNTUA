  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, open-label, multi-site, single-dose Phase 1/2 study in subjects with
      severe sickle cell disease (SCD). The study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      autologous CRISPR-Cas9 Modified CD34+ Human Hematopoietic Stem and Progenitor Cells (hHSPCs)
      using CTX001.

    <time_frame>3 months up to 2 years after CTX001 infusion</time_frame>
    <description>The NRS is a 1-dimensional measure of reporting intensity of pain. The score of NRS ranges from 0 to 10 points, with higher values indicating a higher level of pain.</description>

    <time_frame>3 months up to 2 years after CTX001 infusion</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L Questionnaire consists of the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (VAS). The EQ-5D comprises 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression, and 5 levels: no problems to extreme problems. The subject marks the most appropriate statement in each dimension, resulting in a 1-digit number for that dimension. The digits can be combined in a 5-digit number describing the subject's health state. The EQ VAS records the subject's self-rated health on a 100-point VAS, endpoints labelled &quot;the best health you can imagine&quot; and &quot;the worst health you can imagine&quot;</description>

    <measure>Change in PRO over time assessed using functional assessment of cancer therapy-bone marrow transplant (FACT-BMT) questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months up to 2 years after CTX001 infusion</time_frame>
    <description>The FACT-BMT Questionnaire includes physical, social, family, emotional, and functional well-being, and treatment specific concerns of bone marrow transplantation. Each statement has a 5-point Likert-type response scale ranging from 0=not at all to 4=very much. The subject marks one number per line as it applies to the past 7 days. Questionnaires are then scored; the higher the score, the better the quality of life.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in PRO over time assessed using adult sickle cell quality of life measurement system (ASCQ-Me)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months up to 2 years after CTX001 infusion</time_frame>
    <description>ASCQ-Me comprises measures to assess physical, mental and social health along with information on severity of disease. It includes the following domains: emotional impact, pain impact, pain episodes, sleep impact, social functioning impact, stiffness impact and SCD medical history checklist. ASCQ-Me domains are scored using T-score metric with mean of 50 for reference population and SD of 10. Higher scores indicate healthier status.</description>
