    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Icotinib as
      neoadjuvant in EGFR-mutant Stage ⅢA-N2 Non-small Cell Lung Cancer which can be potentially
      radical treated by surgery.

      Patients with EGFR-mutant Stage ⅢA-N2 Non-small Cell Lung Cancer which can be potentially
      radical treated by surgery are arranged to receive Icotinib with a dose of 125 mg three times
      per day orally for 8 weeks as neoadjuvant therapy; then patients with clinical benefits
      receive surgical resection of the tumor. If there is curative effect of Icotinib according to
      the RECIST or pathological report, the patients will continue receive Icotinib for two years
      as adjuvant therapy after surgery or till progressive disease or unaccepted toxicity. The
      primary objective of this study is evaluate the efficacy and safety of Icotinib neoadjuvant
      therapy.
