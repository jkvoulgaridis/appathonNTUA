    <description>Open-label, single-center study, up to 20 adults (&gt;18) male and female with, intractable epilepsy, on stable doses of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), will participate in a 4-week observation period during which no change in the drugs is permitted. The patients will then begin 10-week treatment by taking their medications according to a semi-random schedule that is pre-set for them by the physician using the same drugs the patient is taking and only changing the dose and times of taking them each day while keeping the drugs within their therapeutic window. Between 6:00-22:00 During the study, patients will fill a seizure diary daily.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients in whom seizures are not controlled by their anti-seizure medication

          2. Must have at least 2 seizures per month

          3. History of any of the following seizure types: tonic, clonic, tonic-clonic in the form
             of partial seizures, partial seizures secondarily generalized or primary generalized,
             complex partial seizures and drop attacks (tonic/atonic)

          4. At least four clinically countable seizures within 4 weeks of study entry [tonic,
             clonic, tonic-clonic in the form of partial seizures, partial seizures secondarily
             generalized or primary generalized and/or complex partial seizures and drop attacks
             (tonic/atonic)]

          5. The subject to a stable regimen of 1-4 concomitant antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) for a
             minimum of 4 weeks prior to enrollment

          6. History of treatment with at least two AEDs, including one trial of a combination of
             at least two concomitant drugs, without successful seizure control

          7. Subjects with vagal nerve stimulation system must be in stable settings for a minimum
             of 6 months prior to enrollment

          8. RNS deep brain stimulation or the ketogenic diet can be considered equivalent to a
             drug trial and must be on a stable ratio for a minimum of 3 months prior to enrollment

          9. Completed seizure diary for four weeks (Â±3 days) prior to initiation of the dose
             titration period (visit 2). The subject will be considered a screen failure if seizure
             diary was not appropriately completed

         10. Anti-epileptic drugs at stable doses for a minimum of 4 weeks prior to enrollment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Neurodegenerative or deteriorated neurological disease

          2. Psychosis or past psychotic event and/or anxiety disorder

          3. Current or history of drug abuse/addiction

          4. Abnormal creatinine

          5. Any chronic ophthalmology disease

          6. The subject is currently using or has used cannabis-based or synthetic cannabinoid
             within three months of study entry

          7. Renal, hepatic [ALT/AST &gt;2x upper limit of normal (ULN), bilirubin &gt;2x ULN],
             pancreatic dysfunctions or laboratory test abnormalities, at the investigator's
             discretion

          8. The subject is pregnant, lactating, or planning a pregnancy during the course of the
             study or within 3 months of study completion

          9. The subject is currently enrolled in or has not yet completed a period of at least 60
             days since ending another investigational device or drug trial(s)

         10. Unable to comply with study visits/requirements

         11. Diagnosis of Dravet Syndrome, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, or any other congenital or
             childhood syndrome will be excluded completely from this trial

         12. Female subjects who are pregnant will be excluded from the study. If a female subject
             is able to become pregnant, she will be given a serum pregnancy test before entry into
             the study. Female subjects will be informed not to become pregnant while on trial.
             Female subjects must tell the investigator and consult an obstetrician or
             maternal-fetal specialist if they become pregnant during the study
