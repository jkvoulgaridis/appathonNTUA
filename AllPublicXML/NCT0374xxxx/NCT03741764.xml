  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dupuytren's disease is a progressive fibroproliferative condition of the hand which
      progresses in 20% of patients into a serious condition. In Flanders, Dupuytren's disease was
      found to be present in 32% of the population over 50 years.

      In severe flexion contracture finger deformity due to Dupuytren's disease, functional loss of
      the finger (often the fourth or fifth digit) is significant.

      Surgery remains the most efficient treatment for the correction of flexion deformities.
      Minimal invasive surgery with the creation of firebreaks for the fibrous strands causing this
      disease, withholds fast recovery. However, recurrence after surgery is not rare with numbers
      varying from 30 to 70% depending on fibrosis diathesis score of Abe, severity of the
      deformation and follow-up period.

      Numerous surgical techniques have been used for Dupuytren disease, ranging from minimally
      invasive surgery to subtotal preaxial amputation with skin grafting.3 In this study a
      well-known technique faciectomie will be performed. During this surgery a device will be
      inserted called VIVOSORB® VIVOSORB® is a flexible bioresorbable polymer film which is
      designed to separate opposing tissues throughout the critical healing process. It is very
      flexible facilitating the surgeon to optimally position the sheet during surgery. It is made
      of 100% synthetic bioresorbable material and can be used in a variety of soft tissue surgery
      applications. VIVOSORB® provides a barrier function enabling the tissue to regenerate without
      interconnective attachment.

      In the past cellulose, a biologic inert implant, was used for augmenting the effect of the
      surgical firebreaks . Cellulose has been proven to improve outcome. Nowadays, cellulose is
      not available for use during faciectomie surgery, since medical production has been ceased.
      VIVOSORB® can be a valid alternative.

      -  Trial objectives The objective of this study is to establish if this device is a viable
           option for treating finger deformity caused by Dupuytren's disease. The main goal is to
           evaluate the efficacy and performance of this flexible bioresorbable polymer film
           (VIVOSORB®) Expected outcome is significant correction of the finger extension lack with
           preserved active finger flexion, without amputation risk or neurovascular damage due to
           more invasive surgery.

        -  Primary endpoints The device will be considered efficient if the pre-operative lack of
           finger extension (TPED) compared to the extension at two years post-operative improves
           by 46°.

        -  Secondary endpoints

      Patient scores will be evaluated:

        -  Dash score

        -  EQ-5D-3L

        -  VAS pain &amp; satisfaction Amputation is a final endpoint for this study. Secondary a
           comparison will be made between the population of this study and the population of a
           previous study in this center³ . In concrete terms this means that the improvement in
           finger extension will be compared between the VIVOSORB® group, the control³ and the
           cellulose group³.
