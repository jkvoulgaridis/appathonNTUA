  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Numerous instrumentation techniques have been suggested for the nonsurgical retreatment of
      teeth with primary failure of endodontic therapy in laboratory studies. However, there is
      limited clinical evidence about those different techniques. The objective of this study is to
      compare the prevalence and intensity of postoperative pain, as well as the success rate after
      endodontic retreatment with hand or engine-driven reciprocating instrumentation. A randomized
      clinical trial will be performed, considering two comparison groups: hand preparation with
      stainless steel instruments or engine-driven reciprocating preparation with the Reciproc NiTi
      System (VDW, Munich, Germany), to verify which technique would lead to lower postoperative
      pain levels and higher endodontic success rates. Secondary outcomes related to technique
      efficiency will be also registered, evaluating the capacity of filling material removal and
      the time spent on the clinical procedures. Eighty individuals who need endodontic retreatment
      in single-rooted teeth will be selected (n=40/group). Endodontic reintervention will be
      carried out in two visits. Periapical radiographs taken after root filling removal protocols
      will be transferred to an image analysis software. Then, the percentage of remaining filling
      material in relation to the total area of the root canal will be evaluated. The clinical time
      spent with the removal procedure protocol will be registered, in minutes, by a digital
      stopwatch. After each visit, postoperative pain will be assessed using a numerical rating
      scale. The record of pain and analgesic drug intake will be performed in 12, 24, 48 hours and
      7 days after the clinical procedures. Success rates will be evaluated after 3, 6, 12 and 24
      months, through clinical and radiographic examination, considering the Periapical Index, a
      5-point score system. Data of both groups (percentage of remaining debris, operating time,
      postoperative pain, clinical and radiographic success) will be analyzed for normality by the
      Shapiro-Wilk test. Assuming normal distribution, the data will be compared by t test.
      Pearson's correlation coefficient will be applied to detect possible correlations between the
      evaluated outcomes. Differences will be considered significant at P=0.05.

    <description>A crown-down technique will be performed until reaching the provisory WL. The root canals will be initially deobstructed with size #3 and #2 Gates-Glidden burs (Dentsply-Maillefer) at the coronal and middle root thirds. Then, hand stainless steel K-files (Dentsply-Maillefer) with decreasing sizes will be used (#40, #35, #30, #25). The WL will be determined by an electronic apex locator (Novapex; Forum Technologies, Rishon Le-Zion, Israel). A radiograph will be taken to confirm the WL, which should be 1 mm short of the root apex. Apical patency will be reached and maintained with a size #15 K-file (Dentsply-Maillefer). The root canals will be reinstrumented and a size #50 K-file will be standardized as the master apical instrument. A step-back procedure in 1-mm increments followed until merging with the crown-down rotary enlargement (size #70) will be achieved.</description>

    <description>Reciproc R25 file will be used for gutta-percha removal, until reaching the WL. The instrument will be introduced into the canal applying slight movements of 3-mm amplitude. Apical patency will be maintained with a size #15 K-file. The root canals will be reinstrumented using the Reciproc R50 file. For both groups, after the root canal filling removal and reinstrumentation protocol, a new radiograph will be taken, without any intracanal instrument, for posterior analysis of the percentage of remaining filling material in the root canal. If the radiograph demonstrates the persistence of filling material, the technique will be repeated with the last instrument used in the chemomechanical preparation (hand or reciprocating file), also using H-files with circumferential movements against the dentinal walls in order to remove these residual material, followed by abundant irrigation with NaOCl.</description>
