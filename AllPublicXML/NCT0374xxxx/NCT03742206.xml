      Aim: To compare the effects of parasacral transcutaneous electrical stimulation with
      transcutaneous posterior tibial nerve stimulation on the symptoms of Overactive Bladder in
      women.

      Study's hypothesis: The use of the parasacral transcutaneous electrical stimulation technique
      presents better results regarding the remission of overactive bladder symptoms in relation to
      transcutaneous posterior tibial nerve stimulation.

      Search location: The data will collected at the Ambulatory of Urogynecology and Obstetrics of
      Porto Alegre Clinical Hospital (HCPA), where the activities of Pelvic Physiotherapy are
      performed

      Main outcome: to measure changes in urinary urgency and quality of life.

      Secondary outcome: to measure changes in the severity of urinary incontinence and the symptom
      bother.

    <description>Application of the King's Health Questionnaire (KHQ). KHQ is an instrument for measuring quality of life in people diagnosed with urinary incontinence, consisting of 30 objective questions distributed in 9 domains. In each question, values are assigned according to the intensity of the patient's complaint (0 = not applicable, 1 = no; 2 = a little / sometimes, 3 = more or less / several times, 4 = a lot / always). The final score is calculated individually for each domain and ranges from 0 to 100, the highest score being related to a poorer quality of life.</description>

    <description>Application of the Incontinence Severity Index. It is a brief instrument, consisting of two questions regarding the frequency and amount of urinary loss. The final score obtained by multiplying the frequency scores by the amount of urinary loss allows the incontinence urinary to be classified as mild (final score 1-2), moderate (final score 3-6 ), severe (final score 8-9) and very severe (final score 12).</description>

    <description>Application of the Symptom Bother Scale. It instrument asks how bothered the patient is by the 4 hallmark symptoms of overactive bladder: urinary frequency, urgency, nocturia, and urge incontinence. Patients respond on a 6-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 5 (a very great deal), with a maximum possible score of 40, calculated by adding all responses.</description>
