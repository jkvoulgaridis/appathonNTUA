  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is the most common type of stroke, which has high rate of
      morbidity, mortality and disability. A large number of studies have confirmed that the
      thrombolytic therapy can effectively open blood vessels and improve the functional prognosis
      of acute ischemic stroke. Therefore, all guidelines recommend intravenous thrombolysis as the
      first treatment of ischemic stroke patients within 4.5 hours of onset. However, about 1/3
      patients receiving thrombolysis will have good prognosis, while a large number of patients
      will still be disabled and even dead. How to improve the neurological prognosis of
      thrombolytic patients has been a hot topic in the world.

      Recent studies have found that the combined application of argatroban and rt-PA in the
      treatment of AIS might improve the clinical prognosis and not significantly increase
      bleeding. Some studies have reported that the combined application of argatroban and rt-PA
      could improve the blood vessel opening rate, and prevent re-occlusion after opening.

      Based on the discussion, the present study is designed to explore the efficacy and safety of
      argatroban plus rt-PA in the treatment of AIS.
