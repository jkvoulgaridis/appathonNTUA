  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers already did studies in low-dose Aspirin for the prevention of heart and blood
      vessels disease and for the prevention of cancer of the colorectum. In this study, they want
      to learn whether an effect for the prevention of oesophagus cancer and stomach cancer goes
      along with the use of low-dose ASA on patients taking this medicine for the prevention of
      heart and blood vessels disease compared to non-use. To find this out electronic medical
      records stored in primary care database in the UK, The Health Improvement Network (THIN),
      will be used.

    <ipd_description>Availability of this study's data will be determined according to Bayer's commitment to the EFPIA/PhRMA &quot;Principles for responsible clinical trial data sharing&quot;. This pertains to scope, timepoint and process of data access. As such, Bayer commits to sharing upon request from qualified researchers patient-level clinical trial data, study-level clinical trial data, and protocols from clinical trials in patients for medicines and indications approved in the US and EU as necessary for conducting legitimate research. This applies to data on new medicines and indications that have been approved by the EU and US regulatory agencies on or after January 01, 2014. Interested researchers can use www.clinicalstudydatarequest.com to request access to anonymized patient-level data and supporting documents from clinical studies to conduct research.
