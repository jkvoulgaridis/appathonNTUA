  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study involves Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) followed by prostatectomy
      (removal of the prostate). SBRT is a relatively new radiation technique in which a few doses
      of radiation are delivered to small, well-defined tumors. It has been used effectively in
      other cancers like lung and liver. The radiation will be given for only 5 days.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects, good and/or bad, of different doses of
      SBRT given before prostatectomy.

    <description>Quality of Life will be assessed using 2 questionnaires: International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM). The IPSS is an eight question questionnaire of symptoms ranging from 0 &quot;not at all&quot; to 5 &quot;always&quot;. The SHIM is a five question questionnaire ranging from 1 &quot;almost never or never&quot; to 5 &quot;almost always or always&quot; to determine erectile dysfunction.</description>

        -  Histologically proven prostate adenocarcinoma.

          -  Clinical stage ≤T3a based on digital rectal exam (DRE) and ≤T3a based on MRI (within 3
             months); N0-Nx; M0-Mx, or Gleason score 4 + 4. No more than 1 lymph node &gt;1 cm.

          -  PSA ≤ 50 ng/ml, obtained within 3 months

          -  Prostate volume: ≤60 cc.

          -  No previous radiotherapy to the prostate or lower pelvis.

          -  Lymph node risk of &lt;35% using https://www.mskcc.org/nomograms/prostate/pre_op.

          -  No prior radical prostatectomy or cryotherapy of the prostate (prior transurethral
             resection or laser ablation are permitted).

          -  No implanted hardware or other material that would prohibit appropriate treatment
             planning or treatment delivery, in the investigator's opinion.

             therapy.

          -  Participant must be able to have gold fiducial markers placed in the prostate. Note:
             patients can be enrolled after fiducial markers have been placed, as long as the
