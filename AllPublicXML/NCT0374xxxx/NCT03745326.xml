  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      A new cancer therapy takes white blood cells from a person, grows them in a lab, genetically
      changes them, then gives them back to the person. Researchers think this may help attack
      tumors in people with certain cancers. It is called gene transfer using anti-KRAS G12D mTCR
      cells.

      Objective:

      To see if anti-KRAS G12D mTCR cells are safe and cause tumors to shrink.

      Eligibility:

      Adults ages 18-70 who have cancer with a molecule on the tumors that can be recognized by the
      study cells

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, scans, photography, and
      heart, lung, and lab tests.

      An intravenous (IV) catheter will be placed in a large vein in the chest.

      Participants will have leukapheresis. Blood will be removed through a needle in an arm. A
      machine will divide the blood and collect white blood cells. The rest of the blood will be
      returned to the participant through a needle in the other arm.

      A few weeks later, participants will have a hospital stay. They will:

        -  Get 2 chemotherapy medicines by IV over 5 days.

        -  Get the changed cells through the catheter. Get up to 9 doses of a medicine to help the
           cells. They may get a shot to stimulate blood cells.

        -  Recover in the hospital for up to 3 weeks. They will provide blood samples.

      Participants will take an antibiotic for at least 6 months.

      Participants will have several follow-up visits over 2 years. They will repeat most of the
      screening tests and may have leukapheresis.

      Participants blood will be collected for several years.

      Background:

        -  We generated an HLA-A11:01-restricted murine T-cell receptor (mTCR) that specifically
           recognizes the G12D-mutated variant of KRAS (and other RAS family genes) expressed by
           many human cancers and constructed a single retroviral vector that contains alpha and
           beta chains that confer recognition of this antigen when transduced into PBL.

        -  In co-cultures with HLA-A11:01+ target cells expressing this mutated oncogene, mTCR
           transduced T-cells lyse target cells and secrete IFN-y with high specificity.

      Objectives:

      -Primary objectives:

        -  Phase I: Determine the safety of administering PBL transduced with anti-KRAS G12D mTCR
           in concert with preparative lymphodepletion and high-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2;
           aldesleukin).

        -  Phase II: Determine if anti-KRAS G12D mTCR-transduced PBL can mediate the regression of
           tumors harboring the RAS G12D mutation.

      Eligibility:

        -  Patients must be/have:

             -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years and less than or eqaul to 70 years

             -  HLA-A*11:01 positive

             -  Metastatic or unresectable RAS G12D-expressing cancer which has progressed after
                standard therapy (if available).

        -  Patients may not have:

             -  Allergies or hypersensitivities to high-dose aldesleukin, cyclophosphamide, or
                fludarabine.

      Design:

        -  This is a phase I/II, single center study of PBL transduced with anti-KRAS G12D mTCR in
           HLA-A*11:01 positive patients with advanced solid tumors expressing G12D mutated RAS.

        -  PBMC obtained by leukapheresis will be cultured in the presence of anti-CD3 (OKT3) and
           aldesleukin in order to stimulate T-cell growth.

        -  Transduction is initiated by exposure of these cells to retroviral vector supernatant
           containing replication-incompetent virus encoding the anti-KRAS G12D mTCR.

        -  All patients will receive a non-myeloablative, lymphodepleting preparative regimen of
           cyclophosphamide and fludarabine.

        -  On Day 0, patients will receive PBL transduced with the anti-KRAS G12D mTCR and will
           then begin high-dose aldesleukin.

        -  A complete evaluation of lesions will be conducted approximately 6 weeks (plus-minus 2
           weeks) after treatment.

        -  The study will be conducted using a phase I/II Simon minimax design, with two separate
           cohorts for the Phase II component: Cohort 2a, patients with RAS G12D pancreatic cancer,
           and Cohort 2b, patients with RAS G12D non-pancreatic cancer.

        -  A total of up to 70 patients may be required; approximately 24 patients in the Phase I
           portion of the study and 46 (21, plus an allowance of up to 2 non-evaluable per Phase II
           cohort) patients in the Phase II portion of the study.

             resected tissue. Patients shown to have tumors expressing G12D mutated NRAS and HRAS
             will also be eligible as these oncogenes share complete amino acid homology with G12D
             mutated KRAS for their first 80 N-terminal amino acids, completely encompassing the
             target epitope.

             Disease).

          5. Concurrent opportunistic infections (The experimental treatment being evaluated in
             this protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who have decreased
             immunecompetence may be less responsive to the experimental treatment and more
