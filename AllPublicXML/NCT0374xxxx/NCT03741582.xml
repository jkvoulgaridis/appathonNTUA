  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cable cars are means of transportation with urban mobility benefits for vulnerable
      populations living in areas with geographic barriers. Despite their popularity, there is no
      evidence of cable cars' potential health effects. TransMicable, located in &quot;Ciudad Bolivar&quot;,
      Bogota, Colombia will open in late-2018 presenting an unprecedented opportunity to assess the
      health impacts and accessibility improvements. The investigators aim is to assess the effect
      of theTransMiCable implementation on social determinants of health (social capital,
      employment, crime, transport, microenvironment pollution, built environment), healthy
      behaviors (leisure and transport physical activity) and health outcomes (health-related
      quality of life, respiratory diseases and homicides).

      The investigators are conducting a controlled quasi-experimental pre-post study with six
      elements: 1) The co-construction of a conceptual framework using a causal loop diagram with
      stakeholders of multiple sectors. 2) A (non-intervention - intervention) quantitative study
      of social capital, community participation, travel time, costs, demand, modal choice,
      physical activity and health-related quality of life using repeated in-person questionnaire,
      anthropometric measurements and physical activity using accelerometers. 3) A transport
      trajectory study in a subsample of the population of the quantitative study using a mobile
      application to track journeys. 4) A subsample of environment evaluations 5) Our Voice in the
      Neighborhood qualitative study to address the potential change in perceptions of the
      neighborhood using Citizen Science &quot;by the people&quot; involving the community and local public
      and private stakeholders and 6) A Secondary-data analysis of Crime and Respiratory diseases
      using time trends from official surveillance systems for homicides and acute respiratory
      diseases.

      The investigators' main hypothesis are 1) There is an increase in the Social Capital and
      Quality of life indicators in the TransMicable target area after the implementation when
      compared to other neighborhoods without TransMiCable. 2) There is a significant decrease in
      travel time and cost for trips to downtown Bogota and an increase in the total number of
      trips for residents of &quot;Ciudad Bolivar&quot; neighborhoods with TransMiCable, after the
      implementation of TransMiCable when compared to other neighborhoods without TransMiCable in
      the locality of &quot;San Cristobal&quot;. 3) There is a significant shift in modal choice for the
      resident of &quot;Ciudad Bolivar&quot; from informal transport service to the TransMiCable system with
      a positive association in terms of proximity to TransMiCable stations. 4) Most TransMiCable
      users are former informal bus transit and formal bus feeder users. While most users will
      access TransMiCable by walking, some living further from stations will take informal
      transport services to access to TransMiCable. 5) There is a reduction in the microenvironment
      pollution around the target area of TransMiCable when compared to the control area. 6) There
      is a change in the perception of the neighborhood for residents of the target area of
      TransMiCable when compared to the control area. 7) There is a significant decrease in the
      prevalence of homicides and acute respiratory diseases in the area of the TransMiCable
      implementation in comparison to the control area without TransMiCable. The results of this
      study will allow us to understand baseline dynamics, while, in the long-term, allowing us to
      assess the changes in travel and health behaviors.

    <measure>Basic activity monitoring</measure>
    <time_frame>The activity monitoring started in February 2018, and is estimated to end in November 2018.</time_frame>
    <description>An Actigraph activity monitor is given to every participant of the study for wearing it over seven days. The reception of the monitors by the participants was prioritized in the intervention group over the control, due to the limited amount of monitors. Participants are asked to wear an ActiGraph &quot;GT3X&quot; or &quot;GT3X+&quot; accelerometer at the waist, and positioned in line with the right mid-axillary line, for at least seven consecutive days (plus an initial familiarization day and the morning of the final day) during all waking hours. Accelerometers are initialized to collect data at 60-second epochs. Participants who successfully complete the use of the monitor are included on a raffle for an special prize at the end of every measurement. In every follow-up participants will be asked to repeat the activity monitoring along with the questionnaire.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Trajectory measurement</measure>
    <time_frame>The trajectory measurements started on February 2018 and ended on July 3 of 2018 due to the shut down of the mobile application.</time_frame>
    <description>We recorded the trajectories of a subset of participants using a global positioning system (GPS) mobile application. For the first measurement, the mobile phone application Moves was installed in participants' Smart-phones to automatically record an activity diary. The application remains installed for at least seven consecutive days (plus an initial familiarization day and the morning of the final day). Data produced by the mobile application include geo-location of places visited, departures and arrival times for each place, transportation modes used classified as walking, cycling, running, and motorized transport, and depending on the Smart-phone, routes employed to access to each destination with geo-located checkpoints. Since Moves servers shut down on july 31, for the follow-up measurements will use another GPS trajectory mobile application.</description>

    <description>Quality of life and wellbeing measured with the World Health Organization Quality Of Life instrument (WHOQOL-bref instrument). The instrument produces a quality of life profile with a 26-item questionnaire divided in four domains: domains: physical health, psychological, social relationships and environment. It is possible to derive a score for each one of them, which denotes the individual perception of the quality of life in each component. The score goes from 0 and increases positively until 5 for each question being 5 the best outcome possible. The mean score of each domain is used for calculating the average score, and then multiplied by 4 for making the scores comparable with WHOQOL-100 (long version of the questionnaire).</description>

    <description>TransMiCable will have one service line 3.43 km-long with four stations (&quot;El Tunal&quot; , &quot;Juan Pablo II&quot; , &quot;Manitas&quot; , and &quot;Paraiso&quot;, see highlighted stops in Figure 2). &quot;El Tunal&quot; is the station that connects to the city's bus rapid transit system. The planned capacity of TransMiCable is 3,600 persons per hour in 163 cabins or gondolas. Each cabin fits ten passengers, with space for wheelchairs and bicycles and will be equipped with free Wi-Fi. The expected travel time reductions from each station to portal &quot;El Tunal&quot;, through the shortest pathway, are: 26 minutes saved from &quot;Juan Pablo II&quot; station—from 32 to 6 minutes; 31 minutes saved from &quot;Manitas&quot; station—from 38 to 7 minutes and 49 minutes saved from &quot;Paraiso&quot; station—from 62 to 13 minutes 22. In conjunction with TransMiCable, urban projects will be implemented including the construction of parks, outdoor gyms, sport courts, community centers for children and older adults, a market, an administrative, and a tourism offices.</description>

        Every participant of the study is an adult that lives on one of the 225 blocks selected
        from each buffer with probability proportional to the size of the catchment areas'
        population. For selecting the participant, 4 or 5 households were systematically selected
        on each block. The families of each household were selected with a random numbers chart, as
        well as the participant listing every adult by age.
