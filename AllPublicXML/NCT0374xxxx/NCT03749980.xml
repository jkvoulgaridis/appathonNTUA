  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MyVHL is a multi-patient database which helps researchers identify patterns across VHL
      patients. MyVHL provides you -and researchers -with more complete information about VHL, like
      how your lifestyle, medications, and other factors impact the disease and quality of life.
      These insights help you better understand the condition and help researchers know where to
      focus their efforts.

      Due to its rarity, there is less understanding of VHL and the factors that may have an
      impact. The data individuals provide in MyVHL helps researchers identify and uncover factors
      that may increase risk, inhibit or slow tumor growth, or lead to an effective cure.

    <ipd_description>When participant information is stored, the investigators are careful to protect any patient identifying information from discovery by others. Strict security safeguards are in place to reduce the chance of misuse or unplanned release of information.
Researchers will only use participant information in a de-identified manner. De-identified means that the researchers will use participant information without knowing their identity. In some cases, they may use some identifying information about the participant for research purposes, subject to an approval process through the VHL Alliance MyVHL Research Committee. At times, the researchers will use participant information with a code, instead of their name; the code would allow results of the research to be linked back to the participant.</ipd_description>
