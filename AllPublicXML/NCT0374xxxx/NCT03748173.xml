  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Delivery of aerosolized Infasurf to bronchiolitis patients with who are not on assisted
      ventilation can provide sufficient delivery of Infasurf to small airways to improve
      ventilation and thereby shorten the duration of the respiratory illness.

    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial will compare &quot;usual care&quot; to aerosolized Infasurf. The study
      objective is to determine

        1. Do bronchiolitis patients tolerate aerosolized Infasurf?

        2. Does aerosolized Infasurf induce an improvement in respiration?

        3. If it does how large a dose is required to observe a positive effect?

        4. Is the positive effect transient, if so what is the range of duration of the effect?

        5. Does retreatment also result and a positive response?

        6. Does aerosolized Infasurf result in more rapid sustained improvement? is superior to.

    <description>Subjects randomized to the aerosol surfactant evaluation will occur at the end of 60 minutes, with the aerosol continued if the bronchiolitis score is &gt; 4 or there has been less than a 2-point improvement in the bronchiolitis score. Similar evaluation will be performed, if necessary, at 30-minute intervals (maximum 2 hours) with stoppage of the aerosol for an improved bronchiolitis score (≤ 4 or 2-point improvement) at any of the time points. The aerosol would be stopped at any time for significant sustained deterioration in clinical status or any serious adverse event felt related to the treatment. Retreatment can be given at &gt; 4 but &lt; 24 hours if the initial response was positive and there has been subsequent deterioration.</description>

    <description>Infants randomized to aerosol treatment will receive Infasurf® aerosol at a rate of 12 ml/hour (the maximal rate using the Solaris CAG). The initial treatment will be for 60 minutes, with reevaluation every 30 minutes thereafter, with a maximum dose of 6 mL/Kg body weight or 2 hours of aerosolization. Treatment will be stopped after 60 minutes (and subsequently at 30-minute intervals) if a 2 point reduction in bronchiolitis score or a score ≤ 4 is achieved. Treatment will also be stopped at any time should there be evidence of other-than-transient deterioration in oxygenation or clinical status or for any serious adverse effect deemed by the infant's clinician to be possibly related to the drug administration.</description>
