  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2-part, 4-panel study of MK-5475 in participants with Group 1 pulmonary arterial
      hypertension (PAH). Part 1 is a double-blind, randomized, single-ascending dose assessment of
      the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of inhaled MK-5475. Part 2 of this study
      is an open-label study and will assess the safety, tolerability, PK and pharmacodynamics of
      inhaled MK-5475 at dose determined by results of Part 1 and Period 1 of Part 2 of the study.
      There is no formal hypothesis to be tested.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Part 1, one panel (Panel A) of up to 8 participants will dose in up to 3 dosing periods.
      In each dosing period, 6 participants will receive MK-5475 and 2 will receive placebo (PBO).
      Two (2) different participants will receive placebo in each of the dosing periods. There will
      be a minimum washout of 7 days between dosing periods. Review of available safety data up to
      24 hours post dose of at least the first 4 participants must occur prior to escalating to the
      next dose level. A break to review pharmacokinetic (PK) data from Periods 1 and 2 will occur
      after completion of Period 2 (Functional Respiratory Imaging: FRI period). Review of safety
      will occur after completion of Period 3 (Right Heart Catheterization: RHC period) in all
      participants from Panel A, prior to initiation of Part 2. An optional break to review rolling
      PK data from Panel A Period 3 will be dependent upon exposures observed in Periods 1 and 2.
      Participants from Part 1 may continue into Part 2. Three additional panels of participants
      (Panels B, C and D) will be enrolled into Part 2. Participants in Panel B (N=4), C (N= up to
      8), and D (N= up to 7) will participate in up to 3 dosing periods. Period 1 of Panel B will
      be an open label assessment of safety/tolerability and PK. A review of available safety data
      up to 24 hours post dose and a rolling PK assessment will occur following completion of Panel
      B, Period 1, prior to going to the FRI period. Panel C, Period 1 will be an open label
      assessment of MK-5475. Panel C may begin once PK and safety data are reviewed from Panel B,
      Period 1. A rolling PK and safety data review of the first 4 participants of Panel C will
      occur prior to moving to the FRI period. The remaining participants in Panel C may enter
      Period 1 while this review is in progress. Following a review of individual safety along with
      a review of PK from first four participants in Panel C, the remaining participants will
      proceed to Period 2. Panel D, Period 1 will be an open label safety/ tolerability and PK
      assessment of MK-5475. Following a review of individual safety of Period 1, participants will
      then proceed to Periods 2 and 3.
