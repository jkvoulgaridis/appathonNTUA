    <textblock>
      Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study to evaluate
      the efficacy and safety of anamorelin HCl. Approximately 316 patients with advanced NSCLC
      with cachexia will be randomized 1:1 to anamorelin HCl 100 mg or placebo, taken orally once
      daily (QD) for a total of 24 weeks. Patients will be instructed to take the study drug at
      least 1 hour before their first meal of the day

    <description>CCR is a composite measure including both a ≥ 5% body weight gain from baseline and increase ≥ 2 points (meaning a clinically relevant improvement) in the 5-item Anorexia Symptom Scale score from baseline) in patients who survive until Day 64.</description>

    <measure>FAACT total score</measure>
    <time_frame>from baseline to week 9</time_frame>
    <description>Change in FAACT total score from baseline to week 9. FAACT total score (Functional Assessment of Anorexia Cachexia Treatment total score) is the sum of the scores FACT-G (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General) and FAACT A/CS domain (Functional Assessment Anorexia Cachexia Therapy Anorexia Cachexia Subscale domain). The FACT-G is the sum of the Physical Well-Being (ranging from 0 to 28), the Social/Family Well-Being (ranging from 0 to 28), the Emotional Well-Being (ranging from 0 to 24) and the Functional Well-Being (ranging from 0 to 28). The FAACT A/CS domain ranges from 0 to 48. The FAACT total score ranges from 0 to 156, higher score indicates better condition.</description>
