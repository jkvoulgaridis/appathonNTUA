    <textblock>
      In follow-up of the previous SynBioSe Study the present study is a randomized controlled
      trial to assess the potential of the new therapeutic approach in lupus nephritis patients.
      The hypothesis is that by starting therapy with belimumab (anti-BAFF), migration of tissue
      residing B-cells is obtained before treatment with rituximab (anti-CD20) and aims to assess
      the possible better reduction and seroconversion of pathogenic autoantibodies compared to the
      control group.

      Rationale:

      The SynBioSe-1 study is the first study to comprehensively describe the clinical and
      immunological effects of combining rituximab (RTX) and belimumab (BLM) in patients with
      systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In the pioneering SynBioSe-1 study it has been shown that
      combining rituximab and belimumab was safe and well-tolerated with important clinical
      responses. Immunologically, we unexpectedly observed that long-term B-cell depletion was not
      achieved due to migration of mature B-cells triggered by depletion of BAFF serum levels. The
      latter observation was in contrast to the study's null-hypothesis that combination therapy
      would lead to long-term B-cell depletion. The contrary was demonstrated, namely the relative
      early recirculation of mature B-cells. As such, the immunological lessons from the SynBioSe-1
      study in conjunction with data from several large cohorts of belimumab treated SLE patients,
      have led to the postulation that starting treatment with belimumab (depleting BAFF from the
      circulation as well as tissues) followed by rituximab would result in an improved B-cell
      targeting strategy, notably on tissue-resident autoreactive B-cells. Therefore, the present
      SynBioSe-2 study is designed to further investigate the potential improvement of combination
      B-cell targeting by starting treatment with belimumab followed by rituximab.

      Objectives:

      The primary objective is to assess whether a combination treatment of belimumab with
      rituximab will lead to the improvement of pivotal, SLE-specific autoimmune phenomena compared
      SLE patients treated with conventional immunosuppression.

      Study design:

      A single-center, randomized, phase 2 proof-of-concept study

      Study population:

      SLE patients with a severe flare with major organ involvement or persistent high disease
      activity despite conventional treatment

      Intervention:

      In addition to standard therapy, SLE patients will receive self-administered, subcutaneous
      injections of belimumab every week for the entire study period and 2 infusions of rituximab
      1000 mg on day 28 (week 4) and day 42 (week 6).

      Main study parameters:

      The primary endpoint is the reduction of disease relevant autoantibodies, in particular
      anti-dsDNA autoantibody production at 28 weeks. Secondary endpoints are non-biased
      immunological effects of the treatment summarized as follows: regression of immune
      complex-mediated excessive neutrophil extracellular traps (NET) formation at 28 weeks;
      sustained, long-term B-cell depletion during 2 years; sustained reduction of relevant
      anti-nuclear autoantibodies, including seroconversion during 2 years; and sustained
      regression of immune complex-mediated excessive neutrophil extracellular traps formation
      during 2 years. Additionally, the study will perform safety and toxicity monitoring according
      to World Health Organization (WHO) toxicity criteria and evaluate the clinical response, the
      reduction of concomitant immunosuppression and the number of moderate and severe flares
      during study follow-up.

      Study duration: 28 weeks, followed by an extended follow-up study up to 100 weeks.

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation and potential
      benefits:

      The study will include SLE patients with a severe flare necessitating remission induction
      treatment with intensive immunosuppression. The use of belimumab followed by rituximab can
      ameliorate disease activity even more than conventional treatment in the short-term and
      contribute to the successful tapering of concomitant immunosuppressive treatment. The latter
      will possibly lead to the reduction of infectious complication as compared to conventional
      treatment. The risks are predominantly related to the side effect profile of rituximab and
      belimumab and infectious complications of long-term B-cell depletion.
