  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Part 1, subjects will be administered thiamine, thiamine with metformin, and thiamine with
      trimethoprim. Part 2 will expand on Part 1 and subjects will be administered thiamine and
      thiamine with trimethoprim. The goal is to determine whether taking a drug and a vitamin
      together affects the body's ability to absorb, distribute, and eliminate thiamine (Vitamin
      B1).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thiamine is an essential vitamin meaning humans must consume thiamine from their diet in
      order to stay healthy. Low thiamine levels can lead to adverse events. Thiamine is absorbed
      in the intestine by a transporter protein. This is made by the SLC19A3 gene. The SLC19A3 gene
      provides instructions for making the thiamine transporter protein, which moves thiamine into
      cells. Certain drugs, like metformin and trimethoprim, have been shown to interrupt function
      of the SLC19A3 gene.

      Metformin is a first-line therapy for patients with Type 2 diabetes and is associated with
      improvements in diabetic complications. Trimethoprim is an anti-bacterial drug that is often
      prescribed to treat infections such as urinary tract infections. At different phases of this
      study, participants will be administered thiamine, thiamine with metformin, and/or thiamine
      with trimethoprim to determine whether taking a drug and a vitamin together affects the
      body's ability to absorb, distribute, and eliminate thiamine. The levels of thiamine in the
      participants' blood and urine will be measured before and after taking thiamine or thiamine
      in combination with metformin and/or trimethoprim.
