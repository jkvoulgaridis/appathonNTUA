  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn what happens when people are given a free, 4-week,
      sample of varenicline, a smoking cessation medication. Investigators will look at quit
      attempts, changes in smoking, and attitude towards varenicline, in both smokers who want to
      quit and those who do not.

      Smoking use causes a number of deaths and diseases, including heart disease and cancer. All
      smokers are advised to quit. Varenicline (sometimes called Chantix), is a prescription
      medication approved by the US FDA. Many studies show that use of varenicline can help smokers
      quit smoking.

      Varenicline is a prescription medication, which usually means that people have to see a
      doctor to get it. This study examines a different way to deliver varenicline, delivered
      directly to participants for a few weeks, and without need to see a doctor. This method is
      called &quot;varenicline sampling.&quot;

      The study is sponsored by the Hollings Cancer Center at the Medical University of South
      Carolina. The study is being done at the Medical University of South Carolina, but study
      recruitment is based state-wide, throughout South Carolina.

One group will receive a mailed sample of varenicline, and the other will not. Participants have 50/50 chance of being in either group.
