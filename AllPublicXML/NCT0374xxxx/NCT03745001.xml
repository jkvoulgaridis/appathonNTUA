  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will assess the safety and tolerability, pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic profiles,
      and food effect of single ascending doses and multiple ascending doses (7 consecutive days)
      after daily oral administration in healthy male and female subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 1, single center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will be
      conducted in 2 parts: the single ascending dosing (SAD) will constitute Part 1 and the
      multiple ascending dosing (MAD) will constitute Part 2. In Part 1 (ie, SAD) of the study, up
      to 64 eligible subjects will be randomized with an allocation ratio of 3:1 to receive EHP-101
      Liquid or matching placebo within one of up to 8 sequential cohorts; Sentinel subjects (1
      receiving EHP-101 Liquid and 1 receiving placebo) will be dosed prior to dosing the remaining
      6 subjects to allow for observation of adverse reactions before exposing the Investigational
      Product (IP) to a greater number of subjects, in the SAD cohorts. In Part 2 of the study, up
      to 40 eligible subjects will be randomized with an allocation ratio of 4:1 to receive EHP 101
      Liquid or matching placebo within one of up to 4 cohorts. Dose-escalations, initiation of a
      single-dose food effect cross-over investigation and the start of the MAD part of the study
      will be coordinated by a Safety Review Committee (SRC) following review of available safety
      data.
