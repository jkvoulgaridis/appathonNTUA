    <textblock>
      This protocol has been designed for a collection of urine samples from volunteers who will be
      given high dose biotin supplements over a period of 5 days, in order to provide a research
      sample bank to examine for biotin excretion rates

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a sample collection study from a minimum of 10 volunteers who will be required to
      take a Biotin supplement daily for a period of 5 days.

      Each volunteer will be asked to read the volunteer information sheet and if they wish to
      participate in the study, the study admission form will be completed and the volunteer will
      be asked to sign a consent form.

      After informed consent each volunteer will be assigned a unique volunteer number for the
      duration of the trial to provide anonymity. The volunteer will be provided with a daily
      diary, urine collection material and a full set of volunteer instructions.

      The daily diary will collect the following information;

        -  Date

        -  Whether or not supplement was taken and time taken

        -  sample collection times during the day

      Volunteers will be requested to:

      Day 1: Collect a urine sample from every void during the day. Days 2-6: Take biotin
      supplements with their evening meal and collect a urine sample from every void during the day
      Day 7: Collect a urine sample from every void during the day

      All samples will be stored in the SPD Bio-bank until required for analysis.
