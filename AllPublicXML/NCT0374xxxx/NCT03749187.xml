      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of BGB-290 and temozolomide in
      treating adolescents and young adults with IDH1/2-mutant grade I-IV glioma that is newly
      diagnosed or has come back. BGB-290 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of
      the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving BGB-290 and temozolomide may
      work better in treating adolescents and young adults with IDH1/2-mutant grade I-IV glioma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the safety and tolerability of the combination of Poly (ADP-Ribose) polymerase
      (PARP) inhibitor BGB-290 (BGB-290) and temozolomide (TMZ) in adolescent and young adult (AYA)
      subjects with IDH1/2-mutant glioma, including the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and
      characterization of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) in both, newly diagnosed and recurrent
      treatment arms.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the preliminary efficacy of BGB-290 and temozolomide in terms of progression free
      survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in Arm A and B stratified by tumor diagnosis,
      calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method with a goal of improving the historical high grade
      glioma progression free survival of 10% and overall survival of 20% at 2 years.

      II. Assess the mutational landscape studies via whole-exome sequencing (WES). III. Assessment
      of gene expression patterns using ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing (RNAseq).

      IV. Assess the methylation profiling with Infinium methylation assays. V. Assess the
      oncometabolite profiling via liquid chromatography (LC)/mass spectrometry (MS)-MS.

      VI. Assess the intratumoral drug level assessments via LC/MS-MS.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts. After the
      MTD is established, additional patients will be enrolled into the efficacy component of the
      trial.

      Arm A: Newly diagnosed IDH1/2-mutant high-grade glioma patients receive PARP inhibitor
      BGB-290 orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28 and temozolomide PO daily on days 1-21.
      Courses repeat every 28 days for up to 24 months in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Arm B: Recurrent IDH1/2-mutant low-grade or high-grade glioma patients receive PARP inhibitor
      BGB-290 orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28 and temozolomide PO daily on days 1-21.
      Courses repeat every 28 days for up to 24 months in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      COHORT B0: Recurrent IDH1/2-mutant low-grade or high-grade glioma patients receive PARP
      inhibitor BGB-290 PO for 7 days pre-surgery at the MTD determined in the Phase I portion.
      After recovery from surgery (14-28 days), the patient will proceed to the efficacy component
      of the trial.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 5 years.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Arm A Only: Subjects must have histologically confirmed World Health Organization
             (WHO) grade III-IV newly diagnosed IDH1/2-mutant glioma.

          -  Arm B Only: WHO grades I-IV recurrent IDH1/2 mutant glioma. Subjects in Arm B must
             have magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirming progressive disease; re-biopsy is
             encouraged, but not required at the time of recurrence for confirmation.

          -  Patients with a primary spinal tumor, secondary glioma, or multifocal disease in the
             brain, but without evidence of diffuse leptomeningeal spread, are eligible. In cases
             where there are questions about multifocality versus diffuse leptomeningeal spread,
             the study chair or co-chair must be contacted to make a final decision on eligibility.

          -  Subjects must have IDH1 or IDH2 mutation associated with neomorphic activity of the
             encoded proteins.

          -  Subjects must be willing to provide archival formalin-fixed embedded (FFPE) and frozen
             tissue specimens for biomarker studies if available.

          -  Subjects in Arm A must have been treated with maximal safe resection of primary tumor
             followed by adjuvant radiation therapy (RT). Treatment with TMZ during radiation is
             allowed but not required.

          -  Subjects in Arm B must have been treated with maximal safe resection of tumor.

               -  Lower grade glioma (LGG) subjects who progressed after initial surgery alone are
                  eligible. Any number of prior therapies are allowed.

               -  High grade glioma (HGG) subjects enrolled on Arm B must have been treated with a
                  minimum of maximal safe resection of primary tumor followed by adjuvant RT prior
                  to recurrence. Any number of prior therapies are allowed.

          -  Subjects must have fully recovered from the acute toxic effects of all prior
             chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or radiotherapy prior to entering this study.

          -  Myelosuppressive chemotherapy: subjects must have received their last dose of known
             myelosuppressive anticancer chemotherapy at least three weeks prior to study
             registration or at least six weeks if nitrosourea.

          -  Biologic agent: subjects must have recovered from any toxicity related to biologic
             agents and received their last dose &gt;= 7 days prior to study registration.

               -  For agents that have known adverse events occurring beyond 7 days after
                  administration, this period must be extended beyond the time during which adverse
                  events are known to occur. The duration of this interval should be discussed with
                  the study chair.

               -  For biologic agents that have a prolonged half-life, the appropriate interval
                  since last treatment should be discussed with the study chair prior to
                  registration.

          -  Monoclonal antibody treatment: at least three half-lives must have elapsed prior to
             registration, and subjects on bevacizumab must have received their last dose &gt;= 32
             days prior to study registration.

          -  Subjects in Arm A should begin therapy with TMZ and BGB-290 after completion of
             radiation therapy and when all other eligibility criteria are met.

          -  For subjects in Arm B, patients must not have received radiation therapy within 4
             weeks prior to the initiation of study treatment. Post-RT, the diagnosis of true
             progression versus ?pseudo-progression? can be challenging when imaging modalities are
             exclusively used, and thus an additional resection is encouraged if clinically
             indicated.

          -  Peripheral absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1000/mm^3.

          -  Platelet count &gt;= 100,000/mm^3 (transfusion independent, defined as not receiving
             platelet transfusions for at least 7 days prior to enrollment).

          -  Hemoglobin &gt;= 9 g/dL.

          -  Serum creatinine =&lt; 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) or estimated creatinine
             clearance &gt;= 50 mL/min (calculated using the institutional standard method).

          -  Total serum bilirubin (sum of conjugated + unconjugated) =&lt; 1.5 x upper limit of
             normal (ULN).

          -  Aspartate and alanine aminotransferase (AST and ALT) =&lt; 3 x ULN.

          -  Serum albumin &gt;= 2 g/dL.

          -  Subjects who have neurological deficits should have deficits that are stable for a
             minimum of 1 week prior to registration.

          -  Corticosteroids: Subjects who are receiving dexamethasone must be on a stable or
             decreasing dose for at least 1 week prior to registration.

          -  The effects of BGB-290 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and
             because alkylating agents (such as TMZ) are known to be teratogenic, women of
             child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or
             barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of
             study participation and 4 months after completion of BGB-290 or TMZ administration.
             Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.

          -  Subjects must be able to swallow capsules.

          -  Subjects must have the ability to undergo serial MRI scans (computerized tomography
             [CT] cannot substitute for MRI).

          -  A legal parent/guardian or patient must be able to understand, and willing to sign, a
             written informed consent and assent document, as appropriate.

             years of age. Subjects who are unable to walk because of paralysis, but who are up in
             a wheelchair, will be considered ambulatory for the purpose of assessing the
             performance score.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who are receiving any other investigational agents and/or subjects previously
             treated with small molecule inhibitors of mutant IDH1 or IDH2 proteins at any time may

                  allowed.

               -  Use of thrombolytic to establish patency of indwelling venous catheters is
                  allowed.

               -  Prophylactic anticoagulation for venous access devices is allowed as long as
                  institutional normalized ratio (INR) is =&lt; 1.5 and partial thromboplastin time
                  (aPTT) =&lt; 1.5 x institutional ULN.

               -  Use of low-molecular weight heparin is allowed.

          -  Subjects with known disseminated leptomeningeal disease.

             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must not be pregnant or breast-feeding.
             Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine
             pregnancy test within 7 days of first dose.

          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive subjects on combination antiretroviral
             therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with
             BGB-290 and TMZ. In addition, these subjects are at increased risk of lethal
             infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy.

          -  Subjects with inability to return for follow-up visits or obtain follow-up studies
             required to assess toxicity to therapy.
