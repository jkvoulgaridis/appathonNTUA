  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to determine the safety and tolerability of
      89Zr-DFO-REGN3504.

      The secondary objectives of the study are:

      Study Part A only:

        -  To establish adequate mass dose and activity dose of 89Zr˗DFO˗REGN3504 and optimal
           post-infusion imaging time, as assessed by imaging and blood draw after tracer infusion

      Study Part B only:

        -  To establish test/re-test reliability of positron emission tomography (PET) measures as
           assessed on 2 separate tracer infusions at adequate mass dose and optimal imaging time
           point as determined in Part A

        -  To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of 89Zr˗DFO˗REGN3504 based on tracer
           plasma activity concentration

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants with at least 1 radiologically measurable (by RECIST 1.1) lesion (Note:
             Lesions 10 mm in diameter or larger at the high end PD-L1 expression are expected to
             be detectable by 89Zr-DFO-REGN3504 PET imaging).

          -  Availability of an archival, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissue sample
             from a primary/metastatic/recurrent site, which has not been previously irradiated,
             with presence of any PD-L1 expression by IHC in tumor or immune cells

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of ≤2 (Oken, 1982) and
             anticipated life expectancy of at least 3 months

          -  Adequate organ and bone marrow function

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants receiving therapy with a monoclonal antibody against PD-L1 (eg.
             durvalumab, atezolizumab, avelumab) or have received treatment with anti-PD-L1 within
             135 days prior to the 89Zr˗DFO˗REGN3504 infusion date

          -  For Part B only, participants in whom anti-PD-1 therapy was initiated 1 month or less,

             residual signs or symptoms related to the CNS treatment) for at least 2 weeks prior to
             enrollment. Participants with brain metastases must be off doses of corticosteroid
             therapy that are considered by the investigator to be immunosuppressive

          -  Known history of human immunodeficiency virus or known acquired immunodeficiency
             syndrome indicating uncontrolled active infection. Participants on highly active

             permitted

          -  Receipt of an investigational compound or device within 30 days of screening or within
             5 half-lives of the investigational compound or therapy being studied (whichever is
             greater)

          -  Major surgery or significant traumatic injury within 4 weeks prior to first dose of
             89Zr˗DFO˗REGN3504

          -  Known psychiatric or substance abuse disorder, including current use of any illicit
             drugs, that would interfere with the participant's participation in, or compliance
             with the requirements of, the study

          -  Sexually active men and women of childbearing potential who are unwilling to practice
             highly effective contraception prior to the initial dose/start of the first treatment,
             during the study, and for at least 6 months after the last dose.
