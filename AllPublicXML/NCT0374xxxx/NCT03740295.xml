  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on the fact that the fundamental pathogenic mechanism of the Multiple Sclerosis (MS)
      disease is neuroinflammation, related in turn to cellular oxidation and mitochondrial
      alterations, this project aims to assess the impact of a nutritional intervention on the
      evolution of MS patients in their different slopes. To this end, the administration of
      medium-chain triglycerides, whose metabolism produces the increase of ketone bodies in the
      blood, will be carried out; and another of the antioxidant polyphenol epigallocatechin
      gallate. This procedure will be applied over 6 months, based on a isocaloric Mediterranean
      diet, with a population for the study of 80 patients with different variants of the disease.
      The assessment of the intervention will be carried out every two months, at motor-functional,
      anthropometric, cognitive and emotional, inflammatory, and oxidation levels.

    <measure>Lipid peroxidation Malondialdehyde (MDA)</measure>
    <time_frame>0-4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Malondialdehyde (MDA) will be used as perioxidation marker. It is based on the reaction of thiobarbituric with malondialdehyde, product of the splitting of hydroperoxides, thus forming a color that can be measured directly. Its analysis is used for its good practicability and simplicity, but it lacks sensitivity, so it is recommended, to increase it, to use fluorometric or chromatographic procedures.</description>

A patient is shown or read aloud a statement (e.g. `I feel jittery') and is required to indicate to what degree, from a choice of four frequencies, the statement relates to them. Range score for each subtest is 20-80, the higher score indicating greater anxiety. A cut point of 39-40 has been suggested to detect clinically significant symptoms for the State Anxiety.</description>

    <measure>Exercise tolerance</measure>
    <time_frame>0-4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Two-minute walk test (2MWT) is a short version of an exercise tolerance test and reports the distance in meters during a 2-minute walk. The objective of the test is to walk as far as possible for 2 minutes. Participants, remembering the objective, walked at a comfortable speed between 2 cones that were 20m apart. If they had to turn, they moved the unaffected side. They were permitted to slow down, stop, and rest as necessary during the 2-minute walk. The time was started when participants started walking and proceeded until 2 minutes elapsed, even if they slowed down or stopped walking. The instructions were, &quot;Go. Keep walking until I say 'stop' or until you are too tired, and stop when I say 'stop.'&quot;</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Gait speed</measure>
    <time_frame>0-4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The 10-meter walk test is a simple, effective and widely used tool to evaluate gait speed. The 6MWT evaluates endurance by measuring the maximum distance an individual can walk within 6 min, and determines the walking capacity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical function and symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>0-4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Disabilities of the arm, shoulder and hand (DASH) 30 items, self-report rating scale will be used to measure physical functions and symptoms' in people with disorders of the upper limb. Items are scored from 1 (no difficulty) to 5 (unable). A total 'disability/symptom' score is generated by summing items, and averaging to produce a mean item score between 1 and 5. This value is then transformed to a score out of 100 by subtracting one and multiplying by 25. A higher score indicates greater disability.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neurological impairment</measure>
    <time_frame>0-4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Kurtzke's Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) is the most widely used measure which attempts to capture the full extent of MS symptoms in a standardised way. It was selected for this study because of its universal currency. Both the EDSS and Functional Systems were recorded. The EDSS provides a total score on scale that ramges from 0 to 10. The higher degrees means more disability.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Manual dexterity</measure>
    <time_frame>0-4 months</time_frame>
    <description>It was measured with the Nine Hole Peg Test (NHPT). The time needed to place and remove 9 pegs was recorded and averaged over 2 trials. Manual dexterity speed was calculated as pegs per second and used in the analyses. Participants who were not able to place any peg within a time limit of 300 seconds received a score of 0 pegs per second.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hand Grip Strength</measure>
    <time_frame>0-4 months</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Muscle Strength Assessment Dynamometer (NEDDFM/IBV )</measure>
    <time_frame>0-4 months</time_frame>
    <description>This allows the determination of the degree of muscular weakness of the large muscular groups of lower and upper limb in the different planes of movement.
The system assists the evaluator, providing, in real time, the force exerted by a certain muscle group, the maximum effort reached during the exercise and the corresponding deficiency according to the scales of RD 1971/1999 or the AMA disability assessment tables. The results of the assessment can be displayed on the screen and printed on a report card.</description>
