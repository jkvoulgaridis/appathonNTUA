      Single blind randomized controlled study in which 80 patients coming for hystroscopy due to
      multiple indication as infertility, AUB and missed IUD were assigned for our study. Both
      Sample size and randomization were done by a computer program. Patients were classified into
      2 groups, group 1 study group was subjected to intracervical injection of 5 mi of mepivacaine
      hydrochloride at position 3 and 9 of the vaginal portion of the cervix, and at least 5
      minutes post injection before procedure done. The control group received NSAI injection 15
      minutes before procedure and 5 ml of saline was injected in each side of cervix at 3 9
      positions. Hystroscopy was done if an abnormality is detected an intervention was done. A
      descriptive scale of pain was done into mild, moderate or severe (that lead to interruption
      of the procedures).

      Procedures:

      All patients were subjected to:

        1. History taking

        2. Verbal consent to participate in our study

        3. Patient put in lithotomy position

        4. Casco speculum was applied exposing the cervix

        5. Betadine sterilization of the cervix then properly washed with saline as heavy metals of
           disinfectant may cause irritation with injection

        6. Multiple toothed volselum was used just to fix cervix

        7. 3 cartridges of mepivacaine hydrochloride was filled in 10 mi syringe

        8. Do aspiration to exclude and avoid intravascular injection then infilterate slowly
           intracervical at both 3 and 9 positions

        9. Instruments are removed and at least 5 minutes later procedure started.

       10. Hystroscopy (rigid , 2.9 mm sheath) was introduced gently throw vaginoscopy exploring
           vagina , cervix and uterine cavity

       11. Patient was monitored for pain all through the procedure by descriptive scale, mild,
           moderate and severe. ( moderate who needed to take rest then continue , severe that
           necessitated interruption of the procedure

       12. All patients were monitored for signs of vaso vagal attack as sings (low blood pressure
           and bradycardia) before and if needed during. Occurrence of symptoms as pallor , sweet
           and fainting

       13. All patients were monitored post procedure for persistence of colicky pain
