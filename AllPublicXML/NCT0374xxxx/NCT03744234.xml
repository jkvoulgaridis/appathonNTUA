      This is a double-blinded study where the injecting physicians and the patients will not know
      which arm they are randomized to. Each participant will be followed up for 6 months following
      the injection, and will have in office visits at the injection and approximately 2 weeks post
      injection. They will be called at month 1, 3, and 6 post injection to assess for any adverse
      events and number of physical therapy hours or changes in medication. At time of injection, 2
      weeks post, and 1, 3 and 6 months after they will be asked to answer some questionnaires on
      pain and function.

    <textblock>
      Sacroiliac joint (SIJ) pain is a common and significant source of chronic low back pain. It
      has been broadly defined as pain located in the area of the SIJ that can be elicited by
      various pain provocation tests and relieved after infiltration of the joint with local
      anesthetic.

      Essentially, a patients own blood is collected and spun at varying speeds until it separates
      into 3 layers, one of which is the platelet-rich plasma. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP)
      injections are commonly used in various conditions including chronic tendinopathy, soft
      tissue injuries, and ligamentous injuries. More recently, there has been a greater interest
      in examining the efficacy of PRP as a treatment for musculoskeletal conditions affecting
      joints, such as osteoarthritis (OA). To the investigators' knowledge, there are currently no
      reported studies evaluating the efficacy of PRP for SIJ pain. Given the previously discussed
      application and evidence behind the use of PRP in the knee and hip joints, the investigators
      propose that PRP can also provide a similar solution for treating SIJ pain.

    <measure>Change in Visual Analogue Pain (VAS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The visual analogue scale or visual analog scale (VAS) is a psychometric response scale which can be used in questionnaires. It is a measurement instrument for subjective characteristics or attitudes that cannot be directly measured. When responding to a VAS item, respondents specify their level of agreement to a statement by indicating a position along a continuous line between two end-points.Using a ruler, the score is determined by measuring the distance (mm) on the 10-cm line between the &quot;no pain&quot; anchor and the patient's mark, providing a range of scores from 0-100. A higher score indicates greater pain intensity.</description>

    <measure>Change in Score on the Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Oswestry Disability Index (also known as the Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire) allows researchers and disability evaluators to measure a patient's permanent functional disability. For each section the total possible score is 5 (0= no pain to 5=worst pain) and there are 10 sections of questions. An aggregate score (percentage) is then calculated, with 0% indicating no disability to 100%, indicating crippled or bed-bound.</description>
