  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Feasibility study to test the feasibility and acceptability of a designed personalized
      modular Intervention consisting of three modules, including Cancer and Living Meaningfully
      (CALM) Therapy, Dignity Therapy (DT), and a mindfulness-based Intervention

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patient with a life-limiting serious illness commonly experience substantial emotional and
      spiritual distress, death anxieties, depressive symptoms and loss of dignity and purpose in
      life. Fostering dignity and meaning and relieving psychological distress have been identified
      as a core objective for end-of-life care. However, individual's needs for dignity and
      psychological support at the end of life may vary. Therefore, a personalized approach is
      needed. On the basis of theoretical frameworks and existing dignity- fostering and meaning-
      based interventions, as well as an one-day workshop with international experts in the field
      of palliative care, a personalized modular intervention, consisting of three modules,
      including CALM Therapy, Dignity Therapy, and a mindfulness-based Intervention, was developed.
