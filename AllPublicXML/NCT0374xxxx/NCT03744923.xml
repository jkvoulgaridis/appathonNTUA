  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe perioperative pain experienced after surgical procedures performed by flank incision
      is mainly related to incision of many muscles. Postoperative pain affects patient comfort,
      satisfaction, prolongs the duration of hospital stay and increases post-procedure
      complications. This study is designed to compare the success rate of Unilateral Ultrasound
      Guided Transmuscular Quadratus Lumborum Block with Unilateral posterior Ultrasound Guided
      TransversusAbdominus Plane block in providing perioperative analgesia in Patients undergoing
      Flank Incision surgeries in the Urosurgery Theater at KasrAlainy University Hospitals.

      Patients aged from 20-60 years old, scheduled for flank surgery procedure will be included in
      the study. Patients will be randomly allocated using concealed closed envelope method into
      one of three groups:

      Group A (n=16): will receive USG TransmuscularQLB after induction of general anesthesia.

      Group B (n=16): will receive unilateral USG posterior TAP Block after induction of General
      anesthesia.

      Group C (n=16): (control group) will not receive any blocks.general anesthesia will be
      induced using propofol 2-3 mg/kg over 20-30 seconds, fentanyl 2 µg/kg, and atracurium 0.5
      mg/kg to facilitate endotracheal intubation. Anesthesia will be maintained using isoflurane
      1.5 %, atracurium at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg every 20 minutes. For all patients, fluid management
      will be strict according to body weight and blood loss will be adequately estimated and
      replaced. In the three groups, the observing anesthetist will be advised to give fentanyl
      increment doses (0.5 µg/kg) when mean blood pressure, heart rate or both increased by more
      than 20% from the baseline, lacrimation or sweating (signs of inadequate analgesia).

      Postoperatively, all patients will receive IV paracetamol 1gm every 8 hours. As a rescue
      analgesic, meperidine (0.5 mg/kg) will be used when VAS score &gt; 4. The following data will be
      recorded1- Duration of the surgery 2- Time required to perform the blocks in minutes 3-
      Intraoperative mean blood pressure and heart rate will be recorded in all groups immediately
      after induction, at the surgical incision and every 15 minutes till the end of the procedure.

      4- Total amount of intraoperative fentanyl consumption will be recorded 5- Immediate
      postoperative blood pressure and heart rate will be recorded 6- Visual Analogue scale (VAS)
      for pain will be applied postoperatively at rest and during movement. Pain will be assessed
      with a 10-cm ruler ranging from no pain (0) to severe pain (10). Evaluation will be performed
      immediately postoperative, at 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 6hours and 12 hours
      postoperatively.

      7- The time of the first analgesic request (rescue analgesia) in the postoperative period
      will be recorded (defined as the time between the end of surgery and the request of the first
      dose of postoperative analgesics). As a rescue analgesic, meperidine (0.5 mg/kg) will be used
      when VAS score &gt; 4.

      8- Postoperative nausea and vomiting

    <description>Ultrasound device will be used; The probe is placed in the mid-axillary line cranially to the iliac crest to identify the three muscles of the anterior abdominal wall Then, scan dorsally keeping the transverse orientation until observing that the transverse abdominus muscle becomes aponeurotic, and this aponeurosis is followed until the QL muscle is clearly visualized with its attachment to the lateral edge of the transverse process of the L2 vertebral body and visualize the thoracolumbar fascia The needle (20G spinal needle) is inserted in-plane from posterior to anterior and the tip of the needle is advanced towards then through the QL muscle, penetrating the ventral proper fascia of the QL muscle. The target site for injection is the plane between quadratus lumborum and psoas major. This will be followed by injection of Bupivacaine 0.5 % (0.25ml/kg) and lidocaine 2% (0.15ml/kg) mixed together.</description>

    <description>under ultrasonographic guidance,the probe will be positioned transversely midway between the iliac crest and the costal margin at level of mid axillary line.
Once the external oblique muscle (EOM), internal oblique muscle (IOM) and transversus abdominis muscle (TAM) are visualized at the level of the mid-axillary line between the 12th rib and the iliac crest, the puncture area and the ultrasound probe were prepared in a sterile manner. After identification of the neuro-facial plane between IOM and TAM, the block was performed with the 20G spinal needle. The needle will be directed to approach the TAP with &quot;in-plane&quot; USG-guided technique. Once the tip of the needle placed in the space between the IOM and TAM, Inject a 1 ml test dose of lidocaine 2% for hydro visualization of needle-tip position and confirming its correct positioning. This will be followed by injection of Bupivacaine 0.5 % (0.25ml/kg) and lidocaine 2% (0.15ml/kg) mixed together.</description>
