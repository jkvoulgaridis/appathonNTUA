  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A comparison of two anesthetic techniques for total knee replacements: (1) Peri-Articular
      Injection (PAI), local infiltration between the popliteal artery and capsule of the knee
      block (IPACK) and single-shot adductor canal block (ACB) vs. (2) PAI, IPACK and continuous
      adductor canal block catheter (ACC).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be randomized to one of two groups: one group will receive a PAI, IPACK and
      single-shot adductor canal block; one group will receive PAI, IPACK and continuous adductor
      canal block catheter.

    <description>At the end of the case or in the PACU, a pseudo sham catheter will be affixed mid-thigh to the skin using dermabond, steri-strips, and a chg tegaderm dressing. The catheter will be connected to the disposable pump filled with sterile saline (400 cc) and the flow rate will be set to 0. The pump will be enclosed in a carrier bag provided by the company. To ensure blinding, the carrier bag will be taped to prevent the patient from accessing it.</description>
