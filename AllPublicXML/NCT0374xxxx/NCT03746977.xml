  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study aimed to determine the effect of different interventions on lean body mass
      maintenance under weight loss conditions in overweight and obese premenopausal women. Three
      study groups were implemented: (1) Protein supplementation (only) group (2) Protein
      supplementation and walking intervention (3) Protein supplementation, walking and
      WB-EMS-application. All protocols were applied for 16 week of intervention.

      A energy deficit of 500 kcal/d was intended however while group (1) focus consistently on
      energy restriction (500 kcal/d), in group (2) and (3) a combined physical activity (i.e.
      walking with a volume representing 250 kcal/d) and energy restriction (250 kcal/d) protocol
      was applied. Total protein uptake including protein supplementation was calculated to average
      around 1.2 g/kg body mass per day in groups (1) and 1.5 g/kg body mass/d in group (2) and
      (3). WB-EMS was applied 1.5x 20 min/week (i.e. each Tuesday and every second Thursday).

      Primary study endpoint was LBM as determined by Dual Energy x-Ray Absorptiometry.
