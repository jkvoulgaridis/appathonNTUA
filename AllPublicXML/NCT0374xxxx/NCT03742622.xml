  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to compare the effect of an exercise alone versus. An
      exercise followed by the ingestion of an energy replacement snack on the following energy
      intake, food reward and appetite feelings in adolescents with obesity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study will compare the nutritional response to the realisation of an acute
      exercise with and without an energy replacement snack on the following energy intake in
      adolescents with obesity. 18 adolescents with obesity will be asked to randomly complete
      three experimental sessions: i) one control session (rest); ii) one session with an acute
      exercise realized during the morning; iii) one session with the same exercise followed by a
      snack covering the exercise-induced energy expenditure. Their ad libitum energy intake will
      be assessed at the following meal as well as at dinner time. Appetite feelings will be
      assessed at regular intervals and their food reward in response to the lunch will also be
      assessed.

    <time_frame>at lunch (at day 1)</time_frame>
    <description>food intake will be measured ad libitum during a lunch buffet. The adolescents will be offered an ad libitum buffet-type meal composed based on their food intake preferences. Their intake will be weighted using an electronic food scale by a member of the investigation team and then analysed using Bilnuts software</description>

    <time_frame>at day 1</time_frame>
    <description>hunger area under the curve will be assessed using visual analogue scale through a the day (Leeds Food Preference Questionnaire; LFPQ) Briefly, the LFPQ provides measures of the wanting and liking for an array of food images, varying in both fat content and taste</description>

    <description>The participants will be asked to complete a validated computer-based procedure to measure food reward (Leeds Food Preference Questionnaire; LFPQ) (Finlayson, King et al. 2008).Briefly, the LFPQ provides measures of the wanting and liking for an array of food images, varying in both fat content and taste</description>
