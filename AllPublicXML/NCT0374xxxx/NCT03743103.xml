  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Because of its pharmacokinetic characteristics, such as short half-life and its safety
      profile, esmolol hydrochloride is a beta blocker suitable for venous use in the form of
      continuous infusion. Strategies that improve the blood pressure control of patients with
      hemorrhagic stroke during the first hours of hospitalization are determinant in controlling
      the hematoma expansion and determining factor in its prognosis. This study was designed with
      the objective of evaluating the beneficial effects of combining esmolol hydrochloride with
      sodium nitroprusside for the blood pressure control of participants with hemorrhagic stroke.
