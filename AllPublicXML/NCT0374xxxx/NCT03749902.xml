  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the trial is to assess the following: In women who have undergone
      cervical preparation with oral misoprostol as part of labour induction for hypertensive
      disease in India, is augmentation using oral misoprostol superior to the standard protocol of
      intravenous oxytocin?
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Every year approximately 30 000 women die from hypertensive disease in pregnancy. Magnesium
      sulphate and anti-hypertensives reduce morbidity, but delivery is the only cure. Low dose
      oral misoprostol, a prostaglandin E1 analogue, is a highly effective method for labour
      induction. Usually, once active labour has commenced, the misoprostol is replaced with an
      intravenous oxytocin infusion. However, some studies have shown that oral misoprostol can be
      continued into active labour. In the Cochrane review on labour induction, those whose
      augmentation was continued with misoprostol (M/M protocol) had 42% less CSs than those who
      changed to oxytocin (M/Ox protocol; 15% vs 26%). This misoprostol-only protocol would be
      simpler and probably more acceptable to women. However, these two protocols have never been
      directly compared. We propose a pragmatic, open-label, randomised trial to compare an M/M
      labour induction protocol with the standard M/Ox protocol.

    <description>Oxytocin infusion will be given through an electronic infusion pump. One unit of oxytocin will be injected in 500 mL of Ringer's lactate, started at a rate of 2 mU/min, and increased every 30 min by 2 mU/min until there are three to four contractions every 10 min. The rate will be titrated to maintain that contraction frequency. The maximum dose will be 20mU/min as oxytocin summary product characteristics.
The oxytocin group will not receive misoprostol after the membranes have ruptured.</description>

    <description>An initial dose of misoprostol 25mcg will be given orally after randomisation (this must be a minimum of 2 hours after the previous misoprostol dose).
The next dose of oral misoprostol will be omitted if moderate or strong contractions are occurring at 3 in 10 minutes or more (i.e. 9 or more in the preceding 30 minutes)
If contractions subsequently reduce to less than 3 in 10 (under 9 in 30 minutes), or become irregular or mild, then the oral misoprostol 25mcg can be restarted
In the event of inadequate progress, clinicians will be advised to give further misoprostol if there are any concerns about contractions strength or frequency.</description>
