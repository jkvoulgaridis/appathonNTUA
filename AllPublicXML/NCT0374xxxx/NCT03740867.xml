      Pulmonary rehabilitation program with aerobic and strengthening trainings for 3 months will
      be applied to the candidates for lung transplantation. The program will be designed to be 2
      days supervised weekly and 3 day home program. After completion of the program, patients will
      be divided into two groups according to their cognitive status (Group 1: those with poor
      cognition; Group 2: those with good cognition). The PR gains of the groups will be compared.

      The fact that cognition is not always included in the assessment routine makes it difficult
      to clarify which patient group or severity of illness is more affected by this issue. The
      effect of exercise on cognitive functions is a remarkable issue in recent years. It can also
      be predicted that cognitive function may be effective on program adaptation in patients who
      are given home program without supervision. The aim of the investigator's study was to
      investigate the effect of cognitive status to pulmonary rehabilitation gains in lung
      transplant candidates.

      Lung transplantation candidates who refered from Lung Transplantation surgery team will
      receive the Pulmonary Rehabilitation program for 3-months (2 days at hospital, 3 days at
      home). Exercise program includes aerobic (walking band, bicycle, arm ergometer) and
      strengthening (with free weights) components. Patient will evaluate at the beginning and end
      of the program. Demographic information, diagnosis distributions, educational status of
      patients will be recorded. Exercise capacities are determined by 6 min walk test. The medical
      research council dyspnea scale is used in determining the dispense levels. Montreal Cognitive
      Function Assessment (MOCA) is used to determine cognitive functions. Cognitive functions and
      exercise capacities of the patients before and after the program will be evaluated.

    <measure>Change from Baseline the 6 minutes walk distance at 3 months.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The test was conducted in a 30-m corridor in line with American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines. Patients were told that they should walk as fast as they can walk in 6 minutes time.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test score at 3 months.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>It was designed to detect mild cognitive impairment.Thirty items assessing multiple cognitive domains are contained in the MoCA: short-term memory (5 points); visuospatial abilities via clock drawing (3 points), and a cube copy task (1 point); executive functioning via an adaptation of Trail Making Test Part B (1 point), phonemic fluency (1 point), and verbal abstraction (2 points); attention, concentration, and working memory via target detection (1 point), serial subtraction (3 points), digits forward (1 point), and digits backward (1 point); language via confrontation naming with low-familiarity animals (3 points), and repetition of complex sentences (2 points); and orientation to time and place (6 points). The MoCA is scored by obtaining an item total and the authors recommend a clinical cutoff score of 23.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline the modified Medical Council Dyspnea score at 3 months.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The scale will rate the sensation of dyspnea as the person perceives it.The severity of dyspnea is rated on a scale of 0 to 4.&quot;0 point&quot; means no dyspnea perception and &quot;4point&quot; means severe dyspnea perception.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline the Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1) at 3 months.</measure>
