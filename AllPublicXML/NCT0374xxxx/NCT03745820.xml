  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of BIIB104 in participants
      with CIAS, using the Working Memory Domain of the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB).

      The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of BIIB104
      in participants with CIAS, and to evaluate the efficacy of BIIB104 in participants with CIAS
      on measures of cognition, functioning, and psychiatric symptomology.

    <measure>Change from Baseline in MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) Working Memory Domain Score to Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The MCCB is a cognitive battery that assesses 7 domains recommended by the MATRICS initiative (i.e., Working Memory, Verbal Learning, Speed of Processing, Attention/Vigilance, Visual Learning, Social Cognition, and Reasoning and Problem Solving). Scores for the individual tests will be calculated according to the developer's recommended scoring algorithms.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 14</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, places the participant at immediate risk of death, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or is a medically important event.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in University of California, San Diego Performance Based Skills Assessment-Brief International Version (UPSA-Bi) Assessment to Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The UPSA-Bi, international version, an abbreviated version of the UPSA-Validation of Intermediate Measures, is a measure of functional capacity and assesses skills used in community tasks. This assessment measures 2 general skills that were previously identified as essential to functioning in the community: financial skills and communication skills.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Schizophrenia Cognition Rating Scale (SCoRS) assessment to Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The SCoRS is an interview-based assessment of cognition that involves interviews with participants and informants. The SCoRS includes 20 items designed to specifically assess aspects of cognitive functioning found in each of the seven MCCB cognitive domains including the following: Memory: 4 items, Learning: 2 items, Attention: 3 items, Working Memory: 2 items, Problem Solving: 3 items, Processing/Motor speed: 2 items, Social cognition: 3 items, Language: 1 item. Score ranges from 1 to 10 with a higher score indicating a greater degree of impairment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in MCCB Composite and Individual Domain Scores (Excluding Working Memory Domain) to Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The MCCB is a cognitive battery that assesses 7 domains recommended by the MATRICS initiative (i.e., Working Memory, Verbal Learning, Speed of Processing, Attention/Vigilance, Visual Learning, Social Cognition, and Reasoning and Problem Solving). Scores for the individual tests will be calculated according to the developer's recommended scoring algorithms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Total Score and Subscale Scores to Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The PANSS includes 3 scales and 30 items: 7 items that make up the Positive Scale (e.g., delusions, conceptual disorganization, hallucinatory behavior); 7 items that make up the Negative Scale (e.g., blunted affect, emotional withdrawal, poor rapport, passive/apathetic social withdrawal); and 16 items that make up the General Psychopathology Scale (e.g., somatic concern, anxiety, guilt feelings, mannerisms and posturing, motor retardation, uncooperativeness, disorientation, poor impulse control, preoccupation). The positive and negative subscale each consist of 7 items rated from 1(absent) - 7(extreme) with a minimum score = 7, maximum score = 49. The general subscale consists of 16 items with a minimum score = 16, maximum score = 112. A Total PANSS score (positive+ negative + general scores) has a minimum of 30 and maximum of 210. Higher scores represent more severity in symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) to Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S consists of a single 7-point rating score of illness severity. Raters select one response based on the following question: &quot;Considering your total clinical experience with this particular population, how mentally ill is your participant at this time?&quot; Scores are as follows: 1, Normal, not ill at all; 2, Borderline mentally ill; 3, Mildly ill; 4, Moderately ill; 5, Markedly ill; 6, Severely ill; or 7, Among the most severely ill subjects.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-I consists of a single 7-point rating score total improvement, regardless of whether or not the change is due entirely to drug treatment. Raters select one response based on the following question: &quot;Compared to your participant's condition at the beginning of treatment, how much has your participant changed?&quot; Scores are as follows: 1, Very much improved; 2, Much improved; 3, Minimally improved; 4, No change; 5, Minimally worse; 6, Much worse; or 7, Very much worse. For the CGI-I scale, the participant's condition at the Baseline/Day 1 Visit will be the criterion for judging improvement at subsequent visits.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 14</time_frame>
    <description>The SARA is a clinical scale that is based on a semiquantitative assessment of cerebellar ataxia on an impairment level and will complement the brief neurological examination. The SARA scale is an eight-item clinical rating scale (gait, stance, sitting, speech, finger-chase test, nose-finger test, fast alternating movements, and heel-shin test) with a total score range of 0-40, where 0 is the best neurological status and 40 the worst.</description>

    <measure>Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 14</time_frame>
    <description>The C-SSRS is an interview-based rating scale to systematically assess suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior. Suicidal ideation is classified on a 5-item scale: 1 (wish to be dead), 2 (nonspecific active suicidal thoughts), 3 (active suicidal ideation with any methods [not plan] without intent to act), 4 (active suicidal ideation with some intent to act, without specific plan), and 5 (active suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent). Suicidal behavior is classified on a 5-item scale: 0 (no suicidal behavior), 1 (preparatory acts or behavior), 2 (aborted attempt), 3 (interrupted attempt), and 4 (actual attempt).</description>
