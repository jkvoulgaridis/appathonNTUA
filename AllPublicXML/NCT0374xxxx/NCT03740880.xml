  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators want to verify if advanced maternal age patients with a low Anti-Müllerian
      hormone (AMH) level may benefit from an early trigger time (compared to a late trigger).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During assisted reproduction, patients are stimulated in order to achieve a multifollicular
      development. The final step in this stimulation process is &quot;the trigger&quot; that will induce the
      final maturation of the oocytes. This timing is historically put once at least one follicle
      of 16-17 mm is obtained.

      When looking at poor ovarian responder (POR) patients (characterized by a low AMH), the
      investigators observe shorter menstrual cycles and thus it is thought that the oocyte
      selected for ovulation, will also mature faster. This observation may indicate that POR
      patients potentially do not benefit from a trigger performed once a leading follicle of 17 mm
      is present, but rather from an earlier trigger.

      The main objective is to analyse if an early trigger (leading follicle of 14 mm) results in
      the same maturation rate in POR patient as compared to a late trigger (17 mm). As the embryos
      will be cultured in a time lapse imaging system, annotations on the developmental kinetics
      can be made and the differences in fertilization rate and embryo development can be analysed
      as secondary outcome parameter. On top of this, patients will undergo a genetic testing of
      their embryos and this genetic analysis , together with the mtDNA copy number will also be
      compared between patients with early or late trigger. Euploid blastocysts will be transferred
      in subsequent frozen embryo transfer (FET) cycles and give an indication on the clinical
      outcome between IVF and ICSI.

    <description>A mature oocyte is defined as an oocyte that has extruded his first polar body and this mature oocyte is ready to be fertilized by the participants sperm.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Maturation rate</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The maturation rate is defined as the number of mature oocytes obtained per cumulus complex retrieved for the participants.A mature oocyte is defined as an oocyte that has extruded his first polar body and this mature oocyte is ready to be fertilized by the participants sperm.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fertilization rate</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Fertilization is calculated on all mature oocytes or on all complexes obtained after oocyte retrieval. The fertilization rate is assessed by the presence of a male and a female pronucleus 16-20 hours post fertilization. If the oocyte is fertilized, the outcome is positive, if the oocyte is not fertilized, the outcome is negative.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Embryo development up to day 3</measure>
    <time_frame>3 days</time_frame>
    <description>For all normally fertilized oocytes the further development will be assessed as the embryos are cultured in a time lapse system. This system takes pictures of the embryos every 20 minutes which shows the development of the embryo like a movie: every time that a cell divides, the hour at which it divides will be registered in the time lapse system. For each cell division, specific time frames have been described that link the embryo to develop into a blastocyst or that increases the chance of implantation. The embryo will be evaluated on day 3 and will receive an embryo score that is based on the number of cells, the appearance of the cells, fragmentation and embryo dysmorphisms. These will divide the embryo quality into 4 categories with category 1 being the highest quality and category 4 being the lowest quality. The more fragmentation and the higher the degree of dysmorphisms, the more the quality will shift to category 4</description>

    <measure>Blastulation rate</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>A blastocyst is an embryo in which a cavity is visible on day 5 of the embryo development. If the cavity is present the outcome is positive, if the cavity is absent, the outcome is negative The complete process in which the development of one embryo is followed from the day of injection up until day 7 is called the preimplantation development</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Embryo development up to day 5</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>On day 5 of development, a score is given to every embryo. This is based on the presence or absence of a cavity, the number of cells and how tight the cells are packed. The more cells, the higher the grade, if less cells are present, the grade is lower. Based on these parameters, a final grade is calculated (3 grades) with grade 1 being the highest score.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Morphokinetic development</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>As embryos are cultured in a time lapse imaging system, pictures will be taken every 20 minutes to follow the development. Each time that the embryos divides, the timing will be registered in the database. Like this, every division made by every embryo is recorded: the time the embryo needs to go from 1 cell to 2 cells, from 2 cells to 3 cells and so on.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ploidy state: euploid or aneuploid</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>Trophectoderm biopsy performed between day 5-7 of preimplantation development. These cells will be genetically tested to see if the correct number of chromosomes are present. Euploid embryos can be used for the patient, aneuploid embryos cannot be used for the patient.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mitoscore value: ranges from 10-1500</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>The trophectoderm biopsy sample is used to calculate a value indicating the mitochondrial DNA present in the biopt. Lower values are known to be linked to higher implantation rates of the corresponding blastocyst. Higher values have been correlated to aneuploidy.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pregnancy outcome</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Pregnancy outcomes from the frozen embryo transfers: blood samples will be taken and the level of beta-hCG will be measured to define a pregnancy or no pregnancy. A pregnancy is defined as the best oucome. In case a pregnancy is obtained, the patient will come for an ultrasound scan between week 7-12 to checke the presence of a gestational sac and the presence of a fetal heart beat. The presence of a fetal heart beat is defined as a positive outcome, the absence is defined as a negative outcome.</description>

    <measure>Controlled ovarian stimulation: days of stimulation</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>In order to stimulate multiple follicular development, patients will be stimulated with fixed doses of hormones. Once the follicular development is optimal (based on the number of follicles and the corresponding hormonal values) the patient can be triggered for final oocyte maturation. The total number of days needed during this stimulation will be registered.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Controlled ovarian stimulation: hormonal profile</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>During the stimulation, the hormonal profile of every patient will be measured (estrogens, luteinizing hormone, progesterone): these blood values will be compared to the number of follicles that are measured in the participants and the combination of the three blood values should correspond to the sizes and numbers of follicles measured in the participants.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Controlled ovarian stimulation: measurement of follicles</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>During the stimulation, the follicles present in the participants will grow steadily and the size of the follicles will be measured on a regular basis to ensure a good development (in combination with the hormonal profile). These follicles will be measured by vaginal echography.</description>
