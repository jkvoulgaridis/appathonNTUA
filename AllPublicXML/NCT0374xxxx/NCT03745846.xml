      A large number of basic research and animal experiments have confirmed that black raspberry
      and its active ingredients are used for chemo-prevention of tumors. In recent years, it has
      been reported that black raspberry extract can effectively inhibit the proliferation of human
      oral cancer cells and colorectal cancer cells and promote its apoptosis. At the same time,
      studies have found that chemically modified lactoglobulin exhibits highly potent antiviral
      activity against human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, including HPV6, HPV16 and HPV18, and
      can be used as an effective and safe antiviral drug for treatment and Prevent HPV infection.
      This study attempts to apply black raspberry and lactoglobulin to remove HPV virus and
      prevent cervical cancer, in order to make breakthroughs in the prevention and control of
      cervical cancer.
