  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label study to assess the PK of a single 200 mg oral dose of
      CC-90001 in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment, and in matched
      healthy control subjects with normal hepatic function.

      Degrees of hepatic impairment will be determined during screening by the subject's score
      according to Child-Pugh Classification Criteria.

      Subjects will be enrolled in Groups 1 through 5 as follows:

        -  Group 1: Approximately 6 to 8 male or female subjects with mild hepatic impairment (with
           a Child-Pugh score of ≥ 5 to ≤ 6) will be enrolled in Group 1.

        -  Group 2: Approximately 6 to 8 male or female subjects with moderate hepatic impairment
           (with a Child-Pugh score of ≥ 7 to ≤ 9) will be enrolled in Group 2.

        -  Group 3: Approximately 6 to 8 healthy male or female subjects with normal hepatic
           function will be enrolled in Group 3. Subjects in Group 3 will be matched to subjects in
           Group 2 with respect to sex, age (± 10 years), and weight (± 10% body mass index [BMI]).
           Group 3 will also serve as the control group for Group 1.

        -  Group 4: Approximately 6 to 8 male or female subjects with severe hepatic impairment
           (with a Child-Pugh score of ≥ 10 to ≤ 13) will be enrolled in Group 4.

        -  Group 5: Approximately 6 to 8 healthy male or female subjects with normal hepatic
           function will be enrolled in Group 5. Subjects in Group 5 will be matched to subjects in
           Group 4 with respect to sex, age (± 10 years), and weight (± 10% BMI).

      This study employs a staged design as follows:

        -  Subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment and matching healthy subjects with
           normal hepatic function (Groups 1 through 3) will be enrolled concomitantly.

        -  At least 4 subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment must demonstrate
           satisfactory safety and tolerability for up to 4 days after dosing before subjects with
           severe hepatic impairment may be dosed.

        -  Two subjects with severe hepatic impairment must demonstrate satisfactory safety and
           tolerability for up to 4 days after dosing before the remaining subjects with severe
           hepatic impairment may be dosed.

             documented) or agree to use a barrier method of birth control (condoms not made out of
             natural [animal] membrane [latex condoms were recommended]) during sexual contact with
             a pregnant female or female of FCBP while participating in the study, during dose
             interruptions, and for at least 28 days after the dose of investigational product,
             even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy.

          8. Subject has clinical laboratory safety test results that are within normal limits or
             acceptable to the Investigator.

             blood pressure ≥ 90 and ≤ 160 mm Hg, supine diastolic blood pressure ≥ 50 and ≤ 100 mm
             Hg, and pulse rate ≥ 40 and ≤ 100 beats per minute at Screening.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The presence of any of the following will exclude a subject from enrollment:

          1. Subject has any significant and relevant medical condition, laboratory abnormality, or
             psychiatric illness that would prevent the subject from participating in the study at
             the Investigator's discretion.

          2. Subject has any condition that places the subject at an unacceptable risk if he or she
             were to participate in the study.

          3. Subject has any condition that confounds the ability to interpret data from the study.

          4. Subject is pregnant or breastfeeding.

          5. Subject was exposed to an investigational drug (new chemical entity) within 30 days
             preceding the first dose administration, or 5 half-lives of that investigational drug,
             if known (whichever was longer).

          6. Subject has used moderate or strong CYP3A4/5 inducers and/or inhibitors (including St.

             • Chronic or resolved Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C are acceptable only if sequelae are
             limited to hepatic involvement and its consequent comorbidities. (ie, vasculitis,
             clinically significant globulinemia, etc. are unacceptable).

         13. Subject smokes more than 10 cigarettes per day, or the equivalent in other tobacco
             products (self-reported).
