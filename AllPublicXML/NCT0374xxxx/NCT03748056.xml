  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether individual-level targeted price incentives for
      healthier foods can improve the diet quality of grocery purchases made by adults in
      comparison to a &quot;one size fits all&quot; approach. To test this, the investigators plan to
      implement a 8-month randomized controlled cross-over trial. The intervention group will
      receive a small discount for using their loyalty card and weekly coupons for healthier foods
      (e.g. fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean meats and seafood, low-fat dairy) that are
      selected based on the individual's past purchase history, dietary preferences, their baseline
      diet quality, and their estimated likelihood of using the coupon. Individualized coupons will
      be automatically sent to customers' loyalty cards each week, and separate emails with
      appropriate nutrition education and information about the coupons will be sent to
      participants weekly. The control group will receive a small discount for using their loyalty
      cards during the first phase of the study (3-months), occasional untargeted coupons, and
      weekly emails with untargeted nutrition education. Following phase1, there will be a 2-month
      washout period, and then the intervention and control groups will cross over for the
      remaining 3-months of the study. The investigators will collect purchase data from all
      participants as well as food frequency questionnaires and other self-reported behavioral and
      health questions at baseline, after phase 1 completion, and after phase 2 completion. The
      investigators hypothesize that participants in the intervention group will meaningfully
      improve the overall quality of their food purchases (measured using the Grocery Purchase
      Quality Index-2016) as well as their overall diet quality (measured using the Healthy Eating
      Index 2010.

    <measure>Self-reported food neophobia as an effect modifier on the primary and secondary outcomes</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 9-months</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will examine whether food neophobia modifies the effect of the intervention on the primary and secondary outcomes. Food neophobia was measured via 8 self-reported questions with a 5-point Likert scale ranging from completely disagree to completely agree. Responses will be summed, and higher scores reflect greater variety-seeking in eating experiences (i.e. less neophobia). We will test for an interaction between this continuous measure and the intervention on specified primary and secondary outcomes</description>

    <measure>Self-reported food literacy as an effect modifier on the primary and secondary outcomes</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will examine whether food literacy modifies the effect of the intervention on the primary and secondary outcomes. Food literacy was measured using a 12-item questionnaire, with 4- and 5-point Likert type scales, with higher scores indicating greater food literacy.</description>

    <measure>Coupon proneness as an effect modifier on the primary and secondary outcomes</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 9-months</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will examine whether coupon proneness modifies the effect of the intervention on the primary and secondary outcomes. Coupon proneness was measured via a 22-item self-reported questionnaire with 7-point Likert scales. Higher scores indicate greater likelihood of using coupons.</description>

    <measure>Nutritional self-efficacy as a modifier on the primary and secondary outcomes</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will examine whether nutritional self-efficacy modifies the effect of the intervention on the primary and secondary outcomes. Nutrition self-efficacy was measured via self-report using a 5-item scale with Likert responses (range 0-3) with higher scores indicating greater self-efficacy in nutritional domains.</description>
