  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Placement of implants into extraction sockets targets the maintenance of peri implant hard
      and soft tissue structures and the support of a natural and esthetic contour. The main
      advantages of immediate implant insertion in comparison with delayed implant placement
      protocols are as follows: a reduced treatment time, less number of sessions, and, thus, the
      less invasive procedure. This study examines the clinical performance (survival rate,
      marginal bone levels and Pink Esthetic Score [PES]) of OsseoSpeed™ implants placed into
      extraction sockets with immediate provisionalization in the anterior maxilla after a
      follow‐up of at least 12 months.

      The removal of teeth results inevitably in both horizontal and vertical changes of hard and
      soft tissue dimensions.

      Clinical research has shown that the loss of volume in the extraction sockets is high: the
      biggest bone volumetric changes take place during the first 12 months from the dental
      extraction, with a reduction of bone volume of 50%, of which 2/3 (30%) are within the first 3
      months.

      Nowadays to get success in postextraction implantology means managing the early and
      irreversible alveolar bone dimensional changes following tooth extraction, in order to
      minimize the negative effects on the aesthetics final.
