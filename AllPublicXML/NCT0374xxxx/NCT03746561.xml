  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MRI is a common tool for radiographic diagnosis of spinal stenosis, but it is expensive and
      requires long scanning time. CT is also a useful tool to diagnose spinal stenosis, yet
      interpretation can be time-consuming with high inter-reader variability even among the most
      specialized radiologists. In this study, the investigators aim to develop a deep-learning
      algorithm to automatically detect and classify lumbar spinal stenosis.

      MRI is a common tool for radiographic diagnosis of spinal stenosis, but it is expensive and

      interpretation can be time-consuming with high inter-reader variability even among the most

      algorithm to automatically detect and classify lumbar spinal stenosis. It would be a
      time-saving workflow if the software can assist the radiologists to detect and locate the
      suspected lesion.

        Spinal stenosis is a narrowing of the spaces within the spine, which can put pressure on
        the nerves that travel through the spine. Spinal stenosis occurs most often in the back,
        the neck, and sometimes the thoracic spine.

        Some people with spinal stenosis may not have symptoms. Others may experience pain,
        tingling, numbness and muscle weakness. Symptoms can worsen over time.
