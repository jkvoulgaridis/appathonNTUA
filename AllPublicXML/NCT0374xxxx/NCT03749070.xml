  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is one of the most prevalent chronic liver diseases
      in Brazil and its treatment is still limited. Thus, this project aims to conduct a
      double-blind, controlled, randomized clinical trial to evaluate the effect of silymarin on
      laboratory markers and clinical evolution of adult patients with NAFLD treated at Edgard
      Santos Hospital, as well as identify the dietary pattern of these individuals.

    <textblock>
      Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is one of the most prevalent chronic liver diseases
      in Brazil. It has a significantly increasing incidence today and is considered an important
      global health problem. It affects approximately 20 to 30% of the adult population and
      increases according to the severity of the risk factors. The diagnosis of this disease
      usually occurs in 10 to 20% of the non-obese individuals, 50% in the overweight and 80 to 90%
      in the obese, being twice as present in individuals with Metabolic Syndrome. Pharmacological
      treatment options for NAFLD are still limited and Silybum marianum, one of the most
      sought-after herbal remedies in patients with liver disease, is commonly used by patients
      because of the claim of the hepatoprotective effect of silymarin. Studies have demonstrated
      the therapeutic potential of silymarin in patients with NAFLD, but clinical trials with more
      judicious methodological designs is still needed to prove these effects. Thus, this project
      aims to evaluate the effect of silymarin on laboratory markers and clinical evolution of
      adult patients with DHGNA seen at the Clinic of Nutrition and Hepatology of Edgard Santos
      Hospital, as well as to identify the dietary pattern of these individuals. It is also
      intended to develop and validate a Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) for this patient
      population. A randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial lasting 12 weeks will be
      performed.

    <description>Patients will also receive similarly 2 capsules per day, but without the bioactive principle tested (silymarin). Therefore, the capsules in the control group will contain only 700 mg of maltodextrin, a neutral food component derived from starch, in addition to the excipient and the same amount of vitamin E and phosphatidylcholine to balance the two groups.</description>

    <description>It is a randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial to be performed at outpatient level. The intervention will last 12 weeks and the invited participants will be patients attended at the outpatient clinic of the Edgard Santos Hospital, which will be randomized into two groups: control and intervention. Data on laboratory and clinical markers, imaging, nutritional and dietary assessment, and physical activity level will be collected at the beginning and end of the trial for comparison purposes.</description>
