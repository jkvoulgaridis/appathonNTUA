  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is testing the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK--the amount of study
      drug in the blood), pharmacodynamics (PD), how the study drug affects the body) and
      immunogenicity (how the study drug affects the immune system) of single and multiple doses
      and dose levels of an investigational drug called ALPN-101.

    <textblock>
      AIS-A01 is a phase 1, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded study in healthy
      volunteers. It will be conducted at a single center and will enroll approximately 104
      participants. The study will have 2 parts:

        -  In Part A, participants will receive a single dose of study drug or placebo. Multiple
           dose levels of ALPN-101 will be evaluated.

        -  In Part B, participants will receive 4 doses of ALPN-101 or placebo--1 dose each week
           for 4 weeks. Multiple dose levels of ALPN-101 will be evaluated.

      In each Part, safety assessments will be performed throughout the dosing and follow-up
      periods, and multiple PK and PD samples will be collected.
