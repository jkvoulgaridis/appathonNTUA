  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study evaluates the combined effect of optimized pharmacological treatment, spinal cord
      stimulation and physiotherapy on pain relief, health-related quality of life and physical
      function in patients with neuropathic pain. All patients will receive optimized
      pharmacological treatment before start of spinal cord stimulation treatment. Half of the
      participants will be randomized to physiotherapy before start of spinal cord stimulation
      treatment while the other half will start physiotherapy after spinal cord stimulation
      treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have indicated that almost half of the patients with moderate-severe pain
      receive inadequate pain relief. Neuropathic pain is a common pain condition, affecting 1.5-8%
      of the population. Conventional pharmacological treatment reduces pain but is often
      insufficient. Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is associated with improved pain relief and
      health-related quality of life compared to conventional medical management. Despite SCS
      treatment, only half of the patients report &gt;50% pain relief. Other studies have indicated
      that active, specific physiotherapy led by professionals reduces pain in chronic pain
      conditions. The aim of the study is to access the combined effect of optimized
      pharmacological treatment, SCS and physiotherapy on pain relief, health-related quality of
      life and physical function in patients with neuropathic pain. Furthermore, the study
      evaluates when it is most effective to start the physiotherapy.

    <measure>Health Related Quality of Life (HRQL) assessed with EQ-5D</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months after implantation</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed with EQ-5D-5L. The questionnaire comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state.
The EQ VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale, where the endpoints are labelled 'The best health you can imagine' and 'The worst health you can imagine'. The VAS can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome that reflect the patient's own judgement.</description>

    <measure>Sleep quality according to Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months after implantation</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The PSQI consists of 19 self-rated questions which assess a wide variety of factors relating to sleep quality, including estimates of sleep duration and latency and of the frequency and severity of specific sleep related problems. The 19 items are grouped into seven component scores, each weighted equally on a 0-3 scale. The seven component score are then summed to yield a global PSQI score which has a range of 0-21; higher scores indicate worse sleep quality.</description>

    <description>Assessed with self-efficacy for arthritis (A-SES-S). A-SES is a self-efficacy questionnaire that contains 20 questions and measure a paitent's self-efficacy in three categories: capacity to handle pain, function and other symptoms. A total score between 10 and 100 is calculated, were a high total score indicates a high self-efficacy. The three categories can also be calculated separately and divided in number of questions also resulting of a score between 10 and 100. In the study we will analyze the categories &quot;capacity to handle pain&quot; and &quot;other symptoms&quot;.</description>
