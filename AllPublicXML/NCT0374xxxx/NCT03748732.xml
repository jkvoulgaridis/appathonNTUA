      Purpose: To describe an extensive scleral excision technique to treat or prevent uveal
      effusion in nanophthalmic eyes.

      Design: Prospective interventional case series.

      Methods:

        -  Setting: Institutional.

        -  Patient Population: Consecutive patients with nanophthalmos were operated on by one
           surgeon.

        -  Intervention Procedure: A single, 90% thickness scleral window extending from
           immediately behind the extraocular muscle insertions to the vortex veins was performed
           for 3 and 1/4 quadrants as a circumferential strip.

        -  Main Outcome Measure: Resolution or prevention of uveal effusion.

      Surgical Technique All surgeries were performed under general anesthesia by one surgeon
      (AMM). Because the majority of the patients were young with narrow palpebral fissures and
      very deep set globes in small orbits, special surgical techniques were required. Lateral
      canthotomy was performed on all patients except for the first. Limbal 360o conjunctival
      peritomy was followed by securing of each rectus muscles with a modified muscle hook and 2-0
      silk suture. Scleral dissection was performed from immediately behind to the muscle
      insertions posterior to the vortex veins. A 90% depth scleral window was excised over 3 and Â¼
      quadrants, excluding 3/4 of the superior temporal quadrant to avoid damaging the superior
      oblique muscle.
