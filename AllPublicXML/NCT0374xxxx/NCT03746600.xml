  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While advances in medication have led to greatly improved outcomes for people living with
      HIV/AIDS, less than one-third of all people living with the disease are adherent enough to
      their medication to achieve viral suppression. Alcohol consumption has been shown to have a
      significant effect on HIV medication adherence, so the proposed research will aim to reduce
      alcohol use among people living with HIV/AIDS through a technology-driven intervention. This
      eight-session intervention will be delivered using a combination of videoconferencing, smart
      phones, and Bluetooth-enabled breathalyzers for monitoring of alcohol consumption, with an
      overall goal of reducing alcohol use, mitigating adherence issues, and achieving optimal
      prevention and treatment responses for people living with HIV/AIDS.

    <description>The TRAC intervention for people living with HIV/AIDS focuses on increasing motivation and building skills for avoiding triggers and managing situations that encourage alcohol consumption. It requires eight 30-minute sessions with a counselor using videoconferencing and mobile phones. In addition to receiving the eight sessions of intervention content, participants will complete smart phone-based self-monitoring of medication adherence and alcohol consumption, which will be discussed during intervention sessions.</description>
