  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies have shown that tumors from the same patient may respond very differently to the same
      therapeutic agents. This study aims to investigate the genetic basis of tumors that respond
      abnormally well or poorly to therapeutic agents in an effort to understand the fundamental
      genetic basis of this response. The present protocol seeks to retrospectively perform Exome,
      next-generation (DNA) sequencing and/or other molecular techniques on tumor samples to
      identify the genetic basis of a patient's exceptional response to chemotherapy.

        Patients enrolled who displayed exceptional response as well as those who were expected to
        respond favourably but displayed a poor outcome (e.g. drastic tumour growth or death) to
        their prescribed medication or treatment from a clinical trial.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient must have either an exceptionally good or poor response to treatment, as
             indicated by their treating physician.

               1. The exact definition of this is adaptable to the disease but a suggested
                  guideline is a Complete Response, Partial Response or progression free interval
                  of at least 6 months

               2. Exceptionally poor response includes patients who were expected to respond
                  favourably to a treatment but instead responded poorly (e.g dramatic tumor growth
                  or death)

          2. The patient must have sufficient archival tumor available for sequencing.

          3. Deceased patients will also be considered for analysis (up to 30 patients per year) if
             they meet at least one of the following requirements:

             a)) Patients who have archival tissue stored within the UHN Laboratory Medicine
             Program who have had a consent waiver granted by the REB to access the tissue.

             b) Patients who have archival tissue banked for further research within the UHN
             Biospecimen Sciences Program

             Exclusion Criteria:

               -  None
