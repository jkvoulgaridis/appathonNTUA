      This is an open label, randomized, prospective study of the impact on healthcare utilization
      of a surface Electromyography (sEMG) based seizure monitoring and alerting system for
      Veterans with seizures with upper extremity motor involvement, who have had a recent
      non-diagnostic EMU stay.

    <intervention_model_description>Participating physicians will recruit patients meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Upon completion of screening and enrollment procedures study participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups using a randomized call-in system: treatment or standard of care.
Demographics will be obtained for both groups during this initial clinic visit. The treatment group will be prescribed the Brain Sentinel® SPEAC System for use in the home environment. Study Participants in the standard of care group will be given standard care.</intervention_model_description>
