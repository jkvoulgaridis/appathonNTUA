  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, observational multi-center registry to be conducted at up to 25 French
      interventional cardiology centers. Patients will be eligible once they have received at least
      one BioFreedomTM DCS as per standard clinical practice and will be followed for up to 2 years
      post PCI for data collection.

      The purpose of the registry is to explore the safety and effectiveness of the BioFreedomTM
      DCS in standard clinical practice in France and to serve as part of Post Market Surveillance.

      Prospective, observational multi-center registry to be conducted at up to 25 French
      interventional cardiology centers. Patients will be eligible once they have received at least
      one BioFreedomTM DCS as per standard clinical practice and will be followed for up to 2 years
      post PCI for data collection.

      The registry will be purely observational and will not interfere with physician's decisions
      relating to stent selection or indication for treatment.

      The purpose of the registry is to explore the safety and effectiveness of the BioFreedomTM
      DCS in standard clinical practice in France and to serve as part of Post Market Surveillance.
