  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project involves a social media campaign to increase parent's knowledge and acceptance
      of the HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccine. The current vaccine protects against nine types of
      HPV, including seven that are known to cause cancer. The Centers for Disease Control and
      Prevention (CDC) estimates that the current HPV vaccine could prevent 90% of cancer cases
      caused by HPV, including cases of cervical cancer, oropharyngeal (mouth and throat) cancer,
      anal cancer, and others. About 150 and 104 cases of HPV-associated cancers are diagnosed each
      year in New Hampshire and Vermont, respectivelyâ€”many of which could be prevented through
      vaccination. Currently, only 49.8% of New Hampshire adolescents and 44.3% of Vermont
      adolescents were not up-to-date for HPV vaccination as of 2016. This social media campaign is
      testing a set of campaign messages with parents locally and nationally to see which messages
      are most effective in improving their knowledge and acceptance of the vaccine. A study survey
      link will monitor the number of people reached and will measure parental intention to get
      their children vaccinated against HPV.
