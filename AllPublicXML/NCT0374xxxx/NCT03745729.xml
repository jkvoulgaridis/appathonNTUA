  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pathogenesis of coronary heart disease is closely related to inflammation. IL-1 beta is
      an effective target for anti-inflammatory treatment of coronary heart disease. Allopurinol is
      a drug used for treating hyperuricemia and gout for many years. Recently, allopurinol has
      been proved to inhibit the production of NLRP3 in monocytes and reduce the level of IL-1beta,
      resulting in the decrease of TNF-alpha, IL-6 and CRP. Thus, in this study, the investigators
      aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety of allopurinol sustained-release capsules on
      improving the stability of coronary plaque in patients with acute coronary syndrome treated
      by conventional standardized therapy by the single-center, prospective, randomized,
      double-blind and controlled methods, which would provide new strategies for the treatment of
      coronary heart disease.
