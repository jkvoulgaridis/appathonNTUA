  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several imaging technologies have been developed in order to enable the endoscopists to
      differentiate neoplastic from non-neoplastic lesions. The real-time prediction of polyps
      histology is clinically relevant as diminutive polyps represent the majority of polyps
      detected during colonoscopy and have a very low risk of harboring advanced histology or
      invasive carcinoma. Thus, an optical diagnosis would allow diminutive polyps to be resected
      and discarded without pathological assessment or left in place without resection, with an
      enormous cost-saving potential. Recently, the American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy
      (ASGE) has set the Preservation and Incorporation of Valuable endoscopic Innovation (PIVI)
      which defined accuracy threshold to be met, in order to consider a new technology ready to be
      incorporate into clinical practice. Blue Light Imaging (BLI) is a new chromoendoscopy
      technology integrated in the latest generation ELUXEOTM 7000 endoscopy platform (Fujifilm Co,
      Tokyo, Japan), based on the direct (i.e. not filtered) emission of blue light with short
      wavelength (410nm), that enhances visibility of both microvascular and superficial mucosal
      pattern. In a recent randomized trial BLI was superior to high-definition white light (HDWL)
      in the real time characterization of subcentimetric and diminutive colonic polyps.
      Nevertheless, in this study the paucity of diminutive rectosigmoid polyps analyzed does not
      allow to draw definite conclusions as the meeting of PIVI thresholds are concerned.
      Similarly, the low numbers of patients evaluated limited the per-patient analysis. Therefore
      further studies adequately powered to this clinically end-point were advocated. Additionally,
      when the study was performed a BLI dedicated classification for optical diagnosis of colonic
      polyps was not available, whereas recently a specific classification (the BLI Adenoma
      Serrated International Classification-BASIC) has been developed and a specific training set
      has been settled.

      In the present study the investigators prospectively evaluate whether the use of BLI-assisted
      optical characterization of diminutive polyps using BASIC classification by specifically
      trained endoscopists may met PIVI thresholds and particularly if it allow the endoscopists to
      achieve &gt; 90% correct assignment of post-polypectomy surveillance intervals when combined
      with the histopathology assessment of polyps &gt;5 mm in size.

    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Surveillance interval will be advised for each patient, basing on high-confidence predictions of &lt;5mm polyp histology. Such information will be merged with the histopathology assessment of both polyps &gt;5 mm in size and &lt;5 mm lesions diagnosed with a low confidence. Patients with either only &lt;5 mm lesions diagnosed with a low confidence or only &gt;6 mm lesions will not be included. Endoscopy-directed surveillance strategy will be subsequently matched with histology-directed one for each patient and accordance rate will be calculated.
The post-polypectomy surveillance interval will be calculated in the frame of USMSTF guidelines.</description>

    <description>All rectosigmoid &lt;5 mm polyps, regardless of the presence of larger polyps, will be characterized by BLI-assisted optical diagnosis by using BASIC criteria (neoplastic vs. non neoplastic) and will be included in polyp-level assessment.
The polyp characterization will be always performed and recorded without zoom magnification. In patients in which colonoscopy will be performed with endoscopes equipped with zoom magnification, the zoom will be eventually systematically applied and the characterization with zoom will be also recorded. The post-polypectomy surveillance intervals based on BLI will be calculated by using histology estimation performed without zoom for all patients. Only polyps characterized with high confidence will be included in the analysis; the high-confidence characterization rate will be calculated.</description>
