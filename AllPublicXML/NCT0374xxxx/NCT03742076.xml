  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to determine the effect of gum arabic on gut bacteria and GI function.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To compare the effect of placebo, low-dose prebiotic, or high-dose prebiotic on gut
      microbiota composition and function, GI transit and permeability, and assess development of
      symptoms or a change in pre-existing symptoms present, in patients with recent history of
      clinically diagnosed diverticulitis which has been successfully treated.

    <measure>Colonic Transit time</measure>
    <time_frame>Change is being assessed between baseline and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The scintigraphic method is used to measure colonic transit. An isotope is adsorbed on activated charcoal particles and delivered to the colon in a delayed release capsule. Anterior and posterior gamma images are taken hourly. The geometric center (GC) is the weighted average of counts in the different colonic regions. The scale ranges from 1 to 5; a high GC implies faster colonic transit, a GC of 1 implies all isotope is in the ascending colon, and a GC of 5 implies all isotope is in the stool. Units: units on a scale</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Intestinal Permeability</measure>
    <time_frame>Change is being assessed between baseline and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To determine intestinal permeability, urine will be collected for 24 hours after drinking a sugar solution. The 0- to 2-hour urine most closely reflects small intestinal permeability and the 8- to 24-hour urine reflects colonic permeability. HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry will be used for detection of the sugars.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Recent diagnosis of diverticulitis (within 24 months) and at least 4 weeks post
             antibiotic use

          2. Age 18-80

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior history of gastrointestinal surgeries (except appendectomy and cholecystectomy)

          2. Known diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's or ulcerative colitis),
             microscopic colitis, celiac disease, or other inflammatory condition other than
             diverticulitis

          3. Use of tobacco products within the past 6 months (since nicotine may affect intestinal
             permeability)

          4. Use of NSAIDs or aspirin within the week prior to Visit 2 and Visit 5 (permeability
             and transit testing visit since NSAIDs affect intestinal permeability)

          5. Use of osmotic laxatives one week prior to Visit 2 and for the duration of the study

          6. Use of oral corticosteroids within the previous 6 weeks and for the duration of the
             study

          7. Ingestion of artificial sweeteners such as Splenda™ (sucralose), Nutrasweet™
             (aspartame), sorbitol, xylitol, lactulose, or mannitol 2 days before and during the
             permeability testing days, e.g. foods to be avoided are sugarless gums or mints and
             diet beverages

          8. Antibiotic use within 4 weeks of completion of the initial stool kit and/or Visit 2
             testing appointment and for the remainder of the study (they can complete the stool
             kit and Visit 2 after a 4-week washout period)

          9. Bowel preparation for colonoscopy less than one week prior to the completion of the
             first stool kit and Visit 2 and during the remainder of the study

         10. Pregnancy or plan to become pregnant within the study timeframe

         11. Vulnerable adults

         12. Egg allergy or resistant to ingesting eggs

         13. Diagnosis of diabetes

         14. Any other disease(s), condition(s) or habit(s) that would interfere with completion of
             study, or in the judgment of the investigator would potentially interfere with
             compliance to this study or would adversely affect study outcomes
