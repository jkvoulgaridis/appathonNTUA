      To use a randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness of four goal-setting
      strategies within a gamification intervention to increase physical activity among adults at
      elevated risk for ASCVD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is the leading cause of mortality in the
      United States. While increased physical activity can reduce this risk, less than half of
      adults in the United States meet the minimum recommendation guidelines for physical activity.
      Gamification, or the application of game design elements to non-game settings, has
      demonstrated promise in increasing physical activity when designed using insights from
      behavioral economics. However, the best way to design goal-setting within these interventions
      has not been well-examined. In this randomized controlled trial, the investigators will
      evaluate the effectiveness of four different goal-setting strategies within a gamification
      intervention to increase physical activity among adults with elevated risk for ASCVD. The
      trial will include a 2-week run-in period to estimate a baseline, followed by an 8-week
      introductory phase, an 8-week maintenance phase, and then after the intervention is completed
      an 8-week follow-up period.

    <description>Participants are asked to choose a step goal between 1000-3000 steps greater than their baseline (choice). They will be asked to increase their step goal by even increments of 12.5% each week for the 8 weeks of the ramp-up period (gradual). After the 8-week ramp-up period, they will be asked to maintain the step goal for the study. They may change their goal within the range at anytime.
