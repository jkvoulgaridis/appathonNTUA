  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective single arm phase II study, and the purpose of this study is to evaluate
      the efficiency of R2 regimen (rituximab &amp; lenalidomide) combined with intravitreal
      methotrexate and followed by lenalidomide maintenance in newly-diagnosed primary intraocular
      lymphoma. Progression free survival (PFS) of the cohort is the primary endpoint.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All the patients will be treated with R2 regimen （Rituximab 375mg/m2 IV d1, lenalidomide 25mg
      d1-21, 28 days per cycle) as induction regimen, meanwhile intravitreal methotrexate was given
      at a dose of 400ug for 16 doses.

      The response will be evaluated every 3 cycles. After 3 Cycles, patients who achieved complete
      remission (CR) or partial remission (PR) will receive 3 more cycles of R2 regimen. The
      patients with stable disease (SD) or progressed disease (PD) will withdraw from the trial and
      receive salvage regimens. After total 6 induction cycles, the investigators evaluate the
      efficiency again, the patients with CR or PR will go to lenalidomide maintenance for 2 years
      or until progression of the disease (PD), unacceptable toxicity, or patient/investigator
      discretion. And the patients with SD or PD will receive salvage regimen.

      During following-up, surveillance ophthalmologic examination and brain magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) scans can be performed every 3 months up to the first 2 years, followed by
      doctor visit every 6 months up to 5 years or the disease relapses.
