    <textblock>
      &quot;This is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled multi-centre study to investigate
      safety and tolerability and to provide pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics information of
      orally inhaled multiple doses (80 mg, 160 mg or 320 mg) of the nebulised neutrophil elastase
      inhibitor POL6014 in patients with Cystic Fibrosis. The controlled inhalation will occur via
      the eFlow® nebuliser system (manufacturer: PARI Pharma GmbH, Germany)&quot;.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient has given written informed consent to participation in the trial prior to
             their enrolment and any trial-related procedure.

          2. Male patients or female patients of non-childbearing potential, aged 18 to 55 years,
             inclusive. Women of non-childbearing potential are defined as those who have no
             uterus, or ligation of the fallopian tubes, or permanent cessation of ovarian function
             due to ovarian failure or surgical removal of the ovaries. Documentation of surgical
             procedure is required for patients who have had a hysterectomy or tubal ligation.

          3. Men must agree to practice contraception from start of study medication up to 90 days
             after the last dose of the study medication.

          4. Patient with a diagnosis of CF documented by a compatible clinical or radiographic
             presentation and laboratory criteria, more specifically, sweat or genetic testing
             (i.e., presence of the most common genetic defect ΔF 508 or any other mutation that
             can produce CF).

          5. Patient should confirm to produce frequently spontaneous sputum with a frequency of
             over 3 expectorates per day. Patient should be capable of producing a spontaneous
             sputum sample at screening (within a time range of approx. 3h during the screening
             visit).

          6. Except for CF and CF-related diseases, no other significant disease as assessed by a
             screening examination including medical history, physical examination, vital signs,
             ECG assessment, pulmonary function testing (PFT), and clinical laboratory results.
             Deviations of clinical laboratory results can be accepted if they are in accordance
             with the diagnosis of CF and CF-related diseases, supposed they do not indicate a
             clinical state that is expected to constitute a significant additional risk.

          7. Patient must have an FEV1 ≥ 40% of predicted value at screening.

          8. Body mass index (BMI) between 16.5 and 30 (both inclusive).

          9. Non-smoker or ex-smoker who has stopped smoking for at least one (1) year prior to the
             Screening Visit.

         10. Patient should be willing to refrain from caffeine- or theophylline-containing
             products within 24 h prior to a clinic visit for a full PK profile.

         11. Ability to inhale in an appropriate manner (Patients will be trained to inhale from
             the eFlow® nebuliser device with a commercially available saline solution at the
             Screening Visit once informed consent has been obtained).

         12. For patients with routine courses of inhaled antibiotics, patients should agree to
             start routine course of inhaled antibiotic cycle on the same day or not earlier than 3
             days before IMP administration.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient with unstable lung disease, as defined by a change in treatment regimen during
             the preceding two (2) weeks, or a significant new finding on chest radiography (such
             as, but not limited to, pneumothorax, lobar/segmental collapse or consolidation), or
             in the opinion of the investigator, patient with a decline in pulmonary status within
             the last 12 months not considered a part of the usual, chronic progression of CF lung
             disease. Routine cyclic antibiotic treatment regimens including &quot;off/on&quot; cycles are
             not considered to be changes to treatment regimens.

          2. Patient has had an exacerbation of respiratory symptoms within the past four (4) weeks
             before screening/randomization that required initiation of a new or altered
             respiratory therapy, and, in the opinion of the investigator, the patient has not
             returned to a stable level of health

          3. Patient with a history of lung transplantation.

          4. Patient with a history of clinically significant renal, hepatic,
             gastrointestinal,cardiovascular and particularly respiratory disease (excluding CF and
             CF-related disease).

          5. Patient with active gastrointestinal ulcer, history of intracranial bleedings,
             injuries and other bleedings.

          6. Patient, as per assessment of the investigator, with severe hepatic impairment (e.g.
             laboratory values (ALT, AST &gt; 3 x ULN and total bilirubin &gt; 1.5 x ULN) or
             Child-Pugh-Class C could be indicative of such condition).

          7. ECG abnormalities of clinical relevance (e.g., QTc according to Bazett's formula ≥440
             ms, PR &gt;200 ms, or QRS ≥120 ms).

          8. Patient with a resting heart rate in supine position &lt;50 bpm, systolic blood pressure
             &lt;100 mmHg or &gt;140 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure &lt;60 mmHg or &gt;90 mmHg.

          9. Proneness to orthostatic dysregulation, fainting, or blackouts.

         10. Diagnosis of a tricuspid insufficiency in combination with a mean pulmonary arterial
             pressure (mPAP) &gt; 25 mmHg, measured by Doppler echography, or, if no tricuspid
             insufficiency is detectable, any echocardiographic or clinical signs of severe
             pulmonary heart disease (cor pulmonale) or depending congestive heart failure.

         11. History or presence of any malignancy.

         12. Positive results in any of the following virology tests: human immunodeficiency virus
             (HIV) antibodies and antigen, Anti-hepatitis B-core antibody, hepatitis B surface
             antigen (HbsAg) and anti-hepatitis C virus antibody.

         13. Known local or systemic hypersensitivity to any aerosol, medication or food that led
             to admission to an emergency room.

         14. Participation in another clinical study with any investigational medicinal product
             (IMP) or device, before randomisation, within an interval of 5 half-lives (minimum 4
             weeks) from the last use of that investigational drug.

         15. Blood or plasma donation of more than 500 mL during the previous month before
             randomisation, as declared by the patient.

         16. Mental condition rendering the patient incapable to understand the nature, scope, and
             possible consequences of the study.

         17. Not willing to comply with all clinical study procedures.
