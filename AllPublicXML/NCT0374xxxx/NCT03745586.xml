  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Two recent RCTs showed the ability of tocilizumab to induce and maintain remission of giant
      cell arteritis. Both studies used the dosing schemes for Rheumatoid Arthritis (i.e. 8mg/kg
      bodyweight i.v. in 4-weekly intervals and 162mg weekly s.c., respectively). In both trials
      glucocorticoids (GC) were initially administrated at medium to high doses with subsequent
      rapid reduction and discontinuation over 24 weeks. In case of relapse, GC doses were
      re-increased.

      The results of both studies suggest that GC could be reduced more rapidly. This would further
      reduce GC-induced adverse effects.

      Thus, the investigators propose to perform an open label single arm study to assess the
      efficacy of ultra-short co-medication with GC, using Simon's minimax two-stage design.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with newly onset Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA) with diagnosis of GCA within 4
             weeks before screening visit, satisfying ACR criteria and a CRP &gt; 25 mg/L AND biopsy
             proven GCA (according to ACR criteria) OR a large vessel vasculitis assessed by MR
             Angiography (MRA) or PET/CT (PET).

          2. Previous treatment with GC for a maximum of 10 days since diagnosis of GCA at a
             maximal dose of 60 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent.

          3. Patient's written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Rheumatic diseases (except for CPPD/chondrocalcinosis) other than GCA or polymyalgia
             rheumatica (i.e., RA, autoimmune connectivitides, other systemic vasculitides, a.o.)

          2. Chronic use of systemic CS with inability, in the opinion of the investigator, to
             withdraw CS treatment at day 4 according to protocol

          3. Evidence of significant and/or uncontrolled concomitant disease such as, but not
             limited to, cardiovascular disease, nervous system, pulmonary, renal, hepatic,
             endocrine (in particular diabetes mellitus) or gastrointestinal disorders (including
             previous complicated diverticulitis) which, in the investigator's opinion, would
             preclude patient participation or impact the benefit-risk ratio

             preclude participation in the study
