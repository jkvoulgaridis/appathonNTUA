  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study tests the effects of an experimental drug PC945 in people with asthma or other
      chronic respiratory diseases whose lungs are infected by Aspergillus fungi and Candida
      yeasts.

      PC945 may be useful in treating patients infected with Aspergillus as, unlike the usual
      treatments, it is inhaled into the lung and has been designed to stay there and treat the
      infection. Participants will continue to receive their usual treatment for their chronic
      respiratory disease. Half of the participants will receive PC945 and half will receive a
      placebo. The amount of fungus and yeast in the patients' phlegm will be measured over the
      course of the study. The study will take place at multiple sites in UK and will include
      approximately 46 participants. The maximum study duration will be about 16 weeks.

          4. Subject must have a positive sputum fungal culture with one or more colonies of A.
             fumigatus complex / A. niger complex or 200 or more colonies of yeast measured using a
             modified standard approach on one occasion obtained within the 28-day screening
             period.

          5. Subject must be able to produce a spontaneous sputum sample.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects who have received more than 2 weeks of intravenous (IV), oral or inhaled
             antifungal therapy within 6 months prior to Visit 3 or any antifungal therapy (IV,
             oral or inhaled) within 2 months of Visit 3.

          2. Subjects taking medication that could significantly increase the risks of AEs with
             triazoles.

          3. Subjects who are receiving antiretroviral protease inhibitors.

          4. Clinical or laboratory evidence of bacterial bronchitis at the point of screening.

          5. Subjects who have used an experimental medical device or received an experimental drug
             within 3 months or within a period less than five times the experimental drug's
             half-life, whichever is longer, before the first dose of the study drug is scheduled.

          6. Clinically significant screening abnormalities (including, but not limited to, vital
             signs, ECG, laboratory tests, physical examination and spirometry) that, in the
             Investigator's opinion, exclude the subject from participation in the study.

          7. Positive test at screening for hepatitis B virus infection, or antibodies to hepatitis
             C virus.

          8. If female, the subject is pregnant (e.g. has a positive serum β human chorionic
             gonadotropin at screening or a positive urinary pregnancy test pre-dose on Day 1),
             lactating or breast feeding.

          9. Subject is an employee or a first-degree relative of anyone employed by Pulmocide, a
             participating clinical trial site, or any contract research organisation involved in
             the study.

         10. Any other reason that the Investigator considers makes the subject unsuitable to
             participate.
