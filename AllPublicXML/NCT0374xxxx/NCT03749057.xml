  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anticoagulant treatment for non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF) associated with cerebral
      infarction/ TIA is one of the recognized treatment of stroke prevention. The ACC/AHA and
      national guidelines for the management of anticoagulation recommend that most of AF patients
      with cerebral infarction or TIA should be administrated anticoagulant therapy within 14 days
      of symptom onset, while European guidelines recommend that the timing of the initiation of
      non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) for AF patients with cerebral infarction
      or TIA is association with stroke severity in light of the &quot;1-3-6-12&quot; principle. However,
      there are still many problems about the use of NOACs in ischemic stroke with AF. for example,
      it is unclear what time to begin NOACs as to difference in stroke severity, ages, comorbidity
      with hypertension, diabetes, heart failure, liver and kidney dysfunction and bleeding risks.
      Thus, the timing of the initiation of NOACs is yet to be further studied. Current urgent need
      is to develop a guideline-based specific regimen in which the benefit-risk factors are
      further balanced with a combination of NHISS, CHA2DS2-VASC and HAS-BLED score.

      Rivaroxaban, a direct coagulation factor Ⅹa inhibitor, blocks the formation of the clot.
      ROCKET-AF study has shown that the efficacy of rivaroxaban is not inferior to that of
      warfarin in AF patients on stroke prevention, and rivaroxaban has a significantly decreased
      bleeding risk compared with warfarin. Recent study indicates that early administration with
      rivaroxaban for AF patients within 14 days of onset does not significantly increase
      hemorrhagic transformation. However, the relevant clinical data of the efficacy and safety of
      early initiation of rivaroxaban in AF patients with cerebral infarction or TIA are lacking in
      China.

      Therefore, the investigators conduct a multicenter cohort study to investigate the safety of
      early rivaroxaban in the AF patient with cerebral infarction or TIA within 12 days of onset.
