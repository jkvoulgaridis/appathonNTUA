  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple solid tumors have positive targets of mesothelin expressed on the surfaces of the
      tumor cells, the investigators use the technique of CRISPR-Cas9 to knocked out the PD-1 of
      the chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells with the combination of Pretreatment by
      Paclitaxel and Cyclophosphamideto to effect the immuno-microenvironment around tumors.

      1. To evaluate the feasibility and safety of CRISPR-Cas9 mediated PD-1 gene-knocked out
           chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells in patients with mesothelin positive multiple
           solid tumors.

        2. To evaluate the duration and in vivo persistence of transferred CAR-T cells.

        3. To observe and measure anti-tumor responses for patients with detectable mesothelin
           positive tumor lesions.
