  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study involves comparing the outcomes after using the Direct Anterior Approach (DAA) and
      the Supercapsular Percutaneously Assisted Total Hip (SuperPATH) approach. These are two
      approaches to hip replacement that both replace hips without cutting any muscles. DAA
      approach has been used for many years, but it has a high learning curve and can be difficult
      for doctors to use, it is however linked with fewer complications when performed by an
      experienced doctor. SuperPATH is a newer technique which has been shown in studies to be
      adopted with less complications even during the learning phase. It also shows cost-saving
      results, showing a reduced length of stay for patients and better 30-day readmission rates.
      There is pressure on surgeons, from both patients and administration to use techniques that
      spare tissue, offer early functionality without compromising long-term outcomes. The
      SuperPATH can meet this benchmark but uptake has been slow, the investigators believe that it
      is due to the learning curve shown by this approach. The senior surgeon at The Ottawa
      Hospital is experienced in both techniques, using a trial the investigators can compare the
      two techniques and help encourage surgeons to change to a procedure that has demonstrated a
      low complication profile.

    <time_frame>This is from baseline (can be measured anytime to a maximum of one month before surgery) to 12 months post-operatively.</time_frame>
    <description>This asks the patient how their hip functions during their daily life. It has 5 subscales measuring Pain, Symptoms, ADL, Sports/Recreation and Quality of Life (which is calculated using all the subscores). Each subscale is calculated using the mean score, with each score range being from 0 to 4. The subscore is normalized such that the lower the number the more extreme the problem is. To calculate Quality of Life, the mean of the other 4 subscores are taken to calculate the score.</description>
