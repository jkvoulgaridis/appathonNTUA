  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall research plan is PECS/SAP blocks with liposomal bupivacaine improve the Overall
      Benefit Analgesia Score averaged over the postoperative days 1, 2, and 3. A 2-point reduction
      in OBAS will be considered the minimal clinically important benefit.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim is to determine whether a PECS/SAP block, using a mixture of bupivacaine and
      liposomal bupivacaine, provides superior recovery compared to routine parenteral and enteral
      analgesia in patients recovering from MICS. The primary outcome will be the simple
      multi-dimensional quality assessment, Overall Benefit Analgesia Score (OBAS score).53 Our
      secondary aims are to: 1) compare cumulative postoperative opioid consumption (pain
      medications administered over one-day periods quantified as morphine equivalents and provided
      by the EMR for the day of surgery and postoperative days 1, 2, and 3; 2) evaluate respiratory
      mechanics (forced expiratory volume in first minute (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC) and
      peak flow) after extubation on the postoperative days 1, 2 and 3 while patients remain
      hospitalized; and, (3) evaluate the Quality-of-Recovery-15 score on the postoperative days 1,
      2 and 3.

    <description>The local anesthetic (LA) used for the PECS II or serratus plane blocks will be a 0.5% bupivacaine HCL, not to exceed 2.5mg/kg or up to 150mg. The LA solution can be diluted with preservative free normal saline for smaller patients to allow for appropriate volume of injection. Treatment patients will also be given liposomal bupivacaine (EXPAREL, Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc. San Diego, CA) in a dose of 266 mg in 20 ml can be safely combined with bupivacaine HCL at a ratio not exceeding 2:1, but cannot be combined with other local anesthetics due to the concern of rapid release of encapsulated bupivacaine and subsequent local anesthetic toxicity.</description>
