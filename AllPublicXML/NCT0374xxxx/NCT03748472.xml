  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SpO2 instability is in the nature of premature infants. Hypoxic episodes occur spontaneously
      in many of these infants, especially after the first week of life. Different interventions
      have been shown to influence the incidence of hypoxemic episodes in premature infants.
      Premature infants are fed via an NG/OG tube. Feeding length might influence the oxygenation
      instability among premature infants therefore the aim of this study is to evaluate the
      changes in oxygenation among preterm infants receiving respiratory support when are fed over
      30 min vs over 2 hours, as documented by SpO2 histograms.
