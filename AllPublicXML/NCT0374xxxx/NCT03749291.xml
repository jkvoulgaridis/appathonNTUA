  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Animal models and studies on small samples of obese adults have shown that gut microbial
      diversity and certain types of bacteria could predict the efficacy of the dietetic treatment
      to improve body mass index (BMI) and the components of metabolic syndrome (MetS). Gut
      microbiota could distinguish the obese with metabolic syndrome patient than that
      metabolically healthy. Dietetic therapy could induce changes in the microbiota that could
      lead to improvement of BMI and the components of the MetS. The aim of MICROBEkids is to test
      whether the motivational intervention a motivational intervention (OBEMAT2.0) (PI15/00970) is
      more effective than the conventional intervention to increase the gut microbial diversity
      and, as a consequence, to improve BMI and MetS components. The role of gut microbiota
      (through modulation of the short chain fatty acids) will be analyzed as cardiovascular risk
      factor and as predictor of treatment success. These objectives will be achieved through a
      clustered clinical trial design with an intervention group that will receive a motivational
      therapy compared to a control group that will receive a conventional intervention, both
      during 12 months. The study sample are 319 children (n= 167 in the intervention group) that
      were enrolled in the clinical trial OBEMAT2.0 (PI15/00970), have had a comprehensive clinical
      assessment before the intervention (ages 8 to 14) and after 12 months (+3) of therapy (ages 9
      to 15) and furthermore have participated in a biological samples collection for the
      investigation on childhood obesity (COLOBEPED, reference C.0004585).

  <detailed_description>

      The study will provide light to several hypothesis:

      - The main hypothesis is that the dietetic intervention in obese children may improve the
      components of the metabolic syndrome by mediation (at least in part) of changes in the
      microbiota.

      Other secondary hypothesis to be demonstrated are:

        -  The microbiota (before the treatment) could be a determinant factor of the metabolic
           syndrome (inflamation, serum lipid profile, insulin resistance) being a key feature
           differentiating the metabolically healthy obese from the obese with metabolic syndrome.

        -  A dietary pattern rich in vegetables and fruits is associated to a gut microbiota
           profile preventing the metabolic syndrome

      How these hypothesis will be demonstrated? A motivational structured intervention to reduce
      weight is applied (under randomized clustered design) to obese children, that are compared to
      an active intervention (not structured) provided by health care professionals, both groups
      during 12 months (+3).

      A baseline and final assessment (before and after the intervention) are performed, in which
      the following information is collected:

        -  Socioeconomics

        -  Anthropometry (weight, height, waist circumference) to calculate the obesity degree (BMI
           z- score) and the presence of abdominal obesity

        -  Body composition: deuterium dilution (in a subsample), bioimpedance, Dual X-Ray
           Absorptiometry and Air displacement pletismography (BodPod)

        -  Blood sample drawn: to analyze lipids profile and insulin resistance

        -  Fecal sample: the gut microbiota diversity and the presence of specific bacteria will be
           analyzed

        -  Dietary intake by a food frequency questionnaire: diet will be analyzed as dietary
           patterns

        -  Systolic and diastolic blood pressure (which will be adjusted as z-score)

Children assigned to the control group receive the usual treatment conducted in primary care centers based on the Clinical Practice Guidelines on the Prevention and Treatment of Child and Adolescent Obesity [Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation], 2009). At visits, the family receive recommendations to carry out a balanced diet, to provide a moderate energy reduction from the previous intake. An increase in physical activity, both in terms of leisure activity, as sports is advised.</description>
