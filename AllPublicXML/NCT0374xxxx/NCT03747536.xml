      Double-blind, clinical trial investigating the effects of ipratropium spray versus placebo
      spray in children with sialorrhea
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Excess drooling, or sialorrhea, is a chronic problem seen in pediatric patients with
      oral-motor dysfunction or neurodevelopmental abnormalities. Despite significant social and
      physical detriment from sialorrhea, an effective and safe treatment remains elusive.

      The investigator's objective is to study the effect of sublingual ipratropium (an
      anticholinergic aerosol spray) on sialorrhea in the pediatric population

      Method: A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled cross-over trial of sublingual
      ipratropium bromide application in pediatric patients with inappropriate drooling. Patients
      are recruited from the sialorrhea clinic and informed consent is obtained. Patients are
      randomized to receive ipratropium bromide, 1- 2 metered doses (sprays) of active drug (21
      micrograms per metered dose) or matching placebo, every 6 hours up to a maximum of 4 times
      per day, in a double-blind, cross-over design using randomization tables. Total treatment
      length is two weeks for each limb of the study with a 2 week washout period. The primary
      outcome measure is the reporting of sialorrhea using a validated scales. Secondary outcome
      includes global assessment of treatment, patient satisfaction, and adverse effects.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Drooling Severity and Frequency Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline sialorrhea at 2 weeks following each treatment arm</time_frame>
    <description>Also referred to as the Thomas Stonell and Greenberg scale. This is a validated tool using patient reported scores for drooling severity and frequency. Drooling severity is scored on a scale with minimum value of 1 and maximum value of 5. A higher value represents a worse outcome. The frequency is scored on a scale with minimum value of 1 and maximum value of 4. A higher value represents a worse outcome. The subscales (severity and frequency) can be interpreted independently or combined through addition to compute a total score.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Drooling impact scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline sialorrhea at 2 weeks following each treatment arm</time_frame>
    <description>The drooling impact scale is a validated self-administered questionnaire used to measure saliva-control in children. The scale consists of 10 questions/subscales, each with a minimum score of 1 and a maximum score of 10. For all subscales, the higher value represents a worse outcome. The total score is reported and is calculated by adding the score of all 10 subscales.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Global Impression of Improvement Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>At start of trial and weekly self recording up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Global Impression of improvement scale is a single 7-point scale that requires the patient/caregiver to assess how much the illness has improved or worsened relative to a baseline state at the beginning of the intervention. The minimum score is 1 and the maximum score is 7. A higher value represents a worse outcome. To be collected through patient booklet</description>
