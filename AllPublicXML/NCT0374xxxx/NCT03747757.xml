    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well cognitive behavioral therapy works in helping patients with acute
      myeloid leukemia or lymphoma with cancer-related fatigue. Behavioral therapy uses methods to
      help patients change the way they think and act. Behavioral skills may help patients with
      acute myeloid leukemia or lymphoma cope with anxiety, depression, and other factors that may
      influence their level of cancer-related fatigue.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and lymphoma patients with
      cancer-related fatigue (CRF) will be satisfied with the cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)
      intervention, and if CBT will be feasible for AML and lymphoma patients with CRF where the
      feasibility will be based on adherence measurement.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine the preliminary effects of CBT on improvement of CRF (Functional Assessment of
      Cancer Illness Therapy (FACIT-F) - Fatigue subscale, its related symptoms, M.D. Anderson
      Symptom Inventory - Acute Myeloid Leukemia / Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDASI-AML/MDS),
      Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS), and Quality
      of Life (FACT-G) in AML and lymphoma patients receiving this combination regimen at the end
      of 8 weeks or 6 months.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore the effects of CBT on hope for future and burdens of treatment and their
      interference with patients' lives using the Herth Hope Index (HHI), and MDASI-AML/MDS.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo CBT consisting of 7 counseling sessions, up to 45 minutes each over the
      phone.
