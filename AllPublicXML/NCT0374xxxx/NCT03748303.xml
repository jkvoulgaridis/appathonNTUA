  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this bridging study is to advance the therapeutic development of
      Allopregnanolone (Allo) by using the intramuscular (IM) route of administration as an
      alternative to the intravenous (IV) route. In order to identify the equivalent IM dose we
      will conduct pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis previously informed by simulations and modeling.
      We will recruit a total of 12 participants, both males and females equally distributed, into
      this single-arm, open-label study.

      PK analysis and dose finding will take place for the initial 4 weeks; some participants may
      not require all 4 weeks of initial dosing to establish maintenance dose. Once maintenance
      dose is established all participants will receive weekly administration of Allo IM until they
      complete 12 weeks total of Allo exposure (5 or 6 clinic visits and 6 or 7 home-nurse visits).
