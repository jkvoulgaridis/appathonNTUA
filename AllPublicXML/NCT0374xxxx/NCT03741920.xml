  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to understand the utility of Personal KinetiGraph movement recording
      system data in the clinical management of Parkinson's disease (PD) in routine clinical care
      at a movement disorders clinic. Specifically:

        1. Measure medication use and clinical management plan changes in a large, multicenter
           cohort among participants undergoing a clinical assessment with an MDS in which the MDS
           reviews the participant's PKG during the clinical assessment in half of the enrolled
           participants (PKG + Group) and in half of the enrolled participants the MDS completes
           the clinical assessment without the PKG (PKG- Group).

        2. Determine the association between frequency of medication changes, the PKG information,
           and other clinical assessments among participants with and without a PKG report of their
           PD motor status available to the clinician at the time of evaluation.

      This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial. The study consists of 3
      phases as follows:

        -  Randomization phase: subjects undergo screening, baseline, interim and 90-day follow-up
           visits

             -  PKG+ Group (standard of care clinical evaluation plus use of PKG data)

             -  PKG- Group (standard of care clinical evaluation without use of PKG data - the MDS
                is blinded to PKG data)

             -  Randomization ratio will be 1:1 with assignments generated in advance of the start
                of the trial by the unblinded statistician who will provide a list containing group
                assignments that will be available in an Electronic Database (EDC) for site use.

             -  The clinical investigator, study site staff, and subject will not be blinded to the
                randomization assignment during the randomization phase of the study

        -  Open-label phase: at the end of the 90-day randomization phase visit for PKG- Group
           subjects, the MDS will report on the PKG and review it with the subject, the subject
           will complete follow-ups with the MDS using the PKG information during the clinical
           assessment following the same process as the PKG+ Group during the randomization phase

        -  Extended open-label follow-up phase: annual follow-ups for all subjects at 1, 2, and 3
           years during which the MDS will use the PKG information during clinical assessments for
           all subjects.

    <description>For subjects in the PKG+ Group, the study MDS will review and report on the PKG prior to the visit and use the information to guide the discussion with the subject during the clinical assessment.

    <description>The Personal KinetiGraph™ (PKG™) Movement Recording System was developed by neurologists at the Melbourne-based Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health. The product is manufactured and marketed by Global Kinetics (GKC).
The Personal KinetiGraph™ (PKG™) Movement Recording System consists of the following:
A wrist-worn data logger designed to acquire data on the kinematics of movement disorder symptoms over a 6-10 day period.
An application to configure the data logger and transfer the acquired data at the end of a recording.
A series of algorithms that analyze the uploaded data, producing a report that is delivered to the clinician. The report contains objective data distinguishing the movement patterns consistent with tremor, bradykinesia, dyskinesia and immobility.</description>
