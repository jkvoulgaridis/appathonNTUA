  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A two-component therapeutic consisting of FCX-013 and veledimex for the treatment of
      localized scleroderma (or morphea). The first component, FCX-013, is autologous human
      fibroblasts genetically-modified using lentivirus and encoded for matrix metalloproteinase 1
      (MMP-1), a protein responsible for breaking down collagen. FCX-013 is designed to be injected
      under the skin at the location of the fibrotic lesions where the genetically-modified
      fibroblast cells will produce MMP-1 to break down excess collagen accumulation. With the
      FCX-013 therapy, the patient will take an oral compound (Veledimex) to induce MMP-1 protein
      expression from the injected cells. Once the fibrosis is resolved, the patient will stop
      taking the oral compound which will stop further MMP-1 production from the injected cells.
      FCX-013 plus veledimex is being developed in anticipation of improving skin function in
      patients by resolving fibrotic lesions and normalizing dermal collagen production

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fibrocell is developing a two-component therapeutic product for the treatment of moderate to
      severe localized scleroderma (morphea). The first component is FCX-013, an autologous
      genetically modified human dermal fibroblast (GM-HDFs) cell product that is genetically
      modified with a lentiviral vector (LV) to express human matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1).
      MMP1 is also known as interstitial collagenase or fibroblast collagenase and is an enzyme
      that under normal physiological conditions breaks down the extracellular matrix.
      Specifically, MMP1 breaks down interstitial collagens, types I, II and III. In addition, the
      FCX-013 cells are also transduced with genetic constructs that encode the RheoSwitch
      Therapeutic System® (RTS®) an inducible promotor system that in the presence of a small
      molecule activator ligand controls expression of the MMP1 gene. The RTS® is activated to
      express MMP1 by the oral administration of the small molecule component. The purpose of this
      open-label single arm Phase 1/2 study is to investigate the safety and effectiveness of
      FCX-013 plus veledimex.
