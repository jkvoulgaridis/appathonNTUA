  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test whether incentivizing post-workout activities (i.e., reflecting on
      workouts) is more effective than incentivizing actual workouts. This study has two
      conditions: reflection condition (with incentives for reflecting on workouts) vs. output
      (with incentives for working out). The focus of the incentives will be reinforced by three
      text messages per week and weekly emails.

      Gym members register online to participate in a 28-day workout program. Upon registration,
      participants are assigned to one of two conditions (a condition that incentivizes reflecting
      on workouts or a condition that incentivizes workouts). Upon registration, participants are
      prompted to create a workout schedule and are given advice that reflecting on workouts can
      help build exercise habits. Over the 28-day intervention period, participants receive text
      message reminders prior to their scheduled workouts and emails reminding them of their
      schedules. In both conditions, participants receive points every day that they go to the gym,
      which can be redeemed for a gift card after the intervention period. In the reflection
      condition, participants can receive bonus points for responding to each of three text
      messages each week asking about them to reflect on their gym visits. In the output condition,
      participants receive the same text messages, but receive bonus points for their first three
      workouts each week, rather than for responding to text messages.

    <description>Participants will receive three texts each week asking a question to reflect on their latest workout, and will receive 500 points for each text they answer. These bonus points are on top of points participants receive for each workout (200 points per workout). Example text: &quot;Which best describes how you felt right after your last workout? 1-Energized, 2-Proud, or 3-Tired? Send your personal reply (e.g., &quot;1&quot;)&quot;</description>
