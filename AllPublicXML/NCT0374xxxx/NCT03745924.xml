  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will collect information on side effects and how well Refixia/REBINYN works during
      long-term treatment (prophylaxis) in males with haemophilia B. While taking part in this
      study, participants will receive the same treatment as given to them by their study doctor.
      All visits at the clinic are done in the same way as the participants are used to. During
      visits at the clinic, participants might be asked for some relevant tests if considered
      useful by their study doctor. During the visits, the participants study doctor might ask if
      the participants had any side effects since their last study visit. The participants will be
      asked to note down the number of bleeds and the treatment of their bleeds as well as their
      regular prophylaxis. During the visits to the clinic, the participants will be asked to
      answer some questionnaires about their quality of life and their ability to be physically
      active. The participant's participation in the study will last for 4-9 years, depending on
      when they join the study. Participants are free to leave the study at any time and for any
      reason. This will not affect their current and future medical care.
