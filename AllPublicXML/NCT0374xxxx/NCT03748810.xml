  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-labeled, prospective, observational, 52-week, clinical study was conducted to
      compare the effectiveness and safety between empagliflozin (25 mg once daily) and
      dapagliflozin (10 mg once daily) in patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes
      despite preexisting triple OAD combination.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All participants included in this study were initially requested to initiate therapy with
      insulin, but they insisted on another form of OAD. When participants declined insulin
      injection and requested another OAD, they were not randomly assigned to each groups. It is
      fairly common among participants with T2D to decline insulin therapy, despite being aware of
      its importance and the benefits in controlling blood glucose. Their lack of willingness to
      use insulin is explained by their avoidance of painful injections, the potential for body
      weight gain and their fear of hypoglycemia. The investigators conducted a regimen consisting
      of four OADs, including empagliflozin or dapagliflozin, to confirm which regimen would be
      effective and safe.
