  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The concentration of folic acid and homocysteine in the blood can be used as independent risk
      factors for a variety of diseases. A sustained decrease in blood folate concentration and an
      increase in homocysteine concentration can damage vascular endothelial cells, causing varying
      degrees of neurodevelopmental abnormalities. Many clinical studies have found that
      anesthetics can affect blood folate and homocysteine concentration, but the effects of
      sevoflurane and propofol on blood folate and homocysteine concentrations are not clear.
      Therefore, this study aims to investigate the effects of sevoflurane and propofol on blood
      folate and homocysteine levels in children.

      Retrospective study: Study the medical history of infants and young children (less than 3
      years old) who underwent sevoflurane or propofol general anesthesia for more than 3 hours
      from January 2018 to December 2018, and compare the preoperative and postoperative serum
      folate changes for retrospective analysis.

      Prospective study：Ten infants and young children (less than 3 years old) who underwent
      general anesthesia from November 7, 2018 to December 31, 2018 in Shanghai Ninth People's
      Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine. Inhalation of 1-8%
      concentration of sevoflurane for general anesthesia induced intubation, followed by
      sevoflurane 2.0 ~ 2.5 Vol% inhalation maintenance, according to the intraoperative situation
      to add opioids. Patients maintained a bispectral index (BIS) monitoring between 50 and 60.
      After induction of general anesthesia in all patients, Serum folate levels were measured
      before the start of surgery, every 1 hour during surgery, and at the end of surgery.
