  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the safety and efficacy of four serial monthly vocal fold
      injections of platelet-rich plasma to treat dysphonia secondary to vocal fold atrophy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vocal fold atrophy and resulting dysphonia (also known as presbyphonia) is a condition
      affecting millions of aging Americans, up to 35% of those 65 or older. Currently used
      treatment methods include voice therapy, injections of inert fillers, and laryngeal framework
      surgery. These modalities are imperfect with voice therapy requiring considerable time
      commitment, filler injections generally temporary in benefit, and surgery with increased
      risks. The investigators intend to conduct a single-arm study to assess the safety and
      efficacy of autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injection for age-related vocal fold
      atrophy. PRP is a substance purified from the patient's own blood that consists of platelets,
      growth factors, and other regenerative molecules that have been shown to promote rejuvenation
      in a variety of tissue types. Patients with vocal fold atrophy identified in the USC Voice
      Center will be offered participation in a study to receive serial PRP injections in one vocal
      fold. Outcome measures evaluated pre- and post-injection and over follow-up visits will
      include various patient reported quality of life indices, objective clinical assessments of
      voice, and laryngeal videostroboscopy examinations. The investigators hypothesize that serial
      PRP injections will significantly improve vocal fold volume, morphology, and dysphonia in
      these patients with no adverse side effects.
