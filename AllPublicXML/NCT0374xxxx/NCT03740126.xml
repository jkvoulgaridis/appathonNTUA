  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to improve early detection of treatable relapse of lung cancer
      and thereby improve survival and quality of life for the patients. The investigators will
      perform a multicenter, randomized controlled trial to 1) assess if surveillance with whole
      body Positron Emission Tomography combined with Computer Tomography (PET/CT) including the
      brain can increase the number of treatable relapses and 2) concurrently collect liquid
      biopsies for later analysis, potentially enabling even earlier and minimally invasive
      detection and characterization of relapse.

    <description>Performance status of study participants at relapse will be assessed using Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status scale from grade 0 to grade 4, where grade 0 corresponds to a patient who is &quot;fully active, able to carry on all pre-disease performance without restriction&quot; and grade 4 is a patient who is &quot;completely disabled; cannot carry on any selfcare; totally confined to bed or chair&quot;.</description>

    <measure>Quality of life / QLQ-C30</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization until first detected relapse or 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life will be assessed every 3rd month using a validated questionnaire, European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionaire Core Questionaire 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30).
The questionaire is filled out by study participants at each control visit and patients score severity of a range of symptoms during the past week on a scale of 1 (&quot;Not at all&quot;) to 4 (&quot;Very much&quot;).</description>

    <description>Quality of life will be assessed every 3rd month using a validated questionnaire, European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionair Lung Cancer 13 (EORTC QLQ-LC13).
The questionaire is filled out by study participants at each control visit and patients score severity of a range of symptoms during the past week on a scale of 1 (&quot;Not at all&quot;) to 4 (&quot;Very much&quot;).</description>

    <measure>Quality of life / Raw score</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization until first detected relapse or 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>From the results of QLQ-C30 and QLQ-LC13 a Raw Score (RS) is calculated (average of all scores) and Quality of Life is calculated as (RS - 1)/3 which outputs a value between 0 and 1, where 0 is a complete absence of symptoms and 1 is the maximum severity of all related symptoms. This will be used for calculation of QALY in the cost-effectiveness analysis.</description>

    <measure>Cost-effectiveness analysis of intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization until 24 months or 12 months after first detected relapse or until death (whichever comes first)</time_frame>
    <description>Cost-effectiveness of the PET/CT regimen vs the CT regimen is assessed with the ICER (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio), i.e. the ratio of net health care costs to net QALYs ( quality-adjusted life years). Net health care costs are estimated as the health care costs difference between the two arms and net QALYs likewise. Health care costs are calculated from register-based information on health care consumption cumulated in 2-yrs follow-up (DRG-rates) supplemented by intervention costs based on project costs. The relevant cost data are available at &quot;Sundhedsdatastyrelsen&quot; using their research service.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), proven by cytology or histology

          -  Patient in clinical stages I-III

          -  Age≥ 18 years

          -  Performance status ≤ 2 at the time of referral to therapy

          -  Patient referred for definitive treatment (e.g. surgery, surgery followed by adjuvant
             chemotherapy, concomitant radio-chemotherapy, conventional or stereotactic
             radiotherapy or radiofrequency ablation).

          -  Patient has given his/her written informed consent before any specific procedure from
             protocol

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient, whose disease has progressed within the first 3 months after cancer
             treatment, e.g. confirmed progressive disease on CT.

          -  Persons deprived of liberty or under guardianship or curators

          -  Dementia, mental alteration, severe psychiatric disease or other circumstances that
             can compromise informed consent from the patient and/or adherence to the protocol and
             the monitoring of the trial

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding women

          -  Patient participating in another interventional study during the surveillance period.
             This is only relevant for studies that might interfere with the intervention, whereas
             studies on late effects will not preclude participation in SUPE-R. Participation in
             protocols related only to initial treatment will not preclude participation in SUPE-R.
             Cases of doubt will be settled by the steering committee.
