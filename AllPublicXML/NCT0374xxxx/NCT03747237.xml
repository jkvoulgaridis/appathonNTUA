    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the correlation between two point distance measurements
      performed by surgeon on patients face with foldable ruler, which is the most commonly used
      method, and the subjective scoring will be done by the patient with the help of the edema
      scale, for measuring edema.

      The patients will be selected among the patients who apply for mandibular impacted third
      molar extraction to Necmettin Erbakan University, Faculty of Dentistry. A total of 60
      patients will be included. All third molar operations will be carried out by the same surgeon
      in all groups with the same technique.Two methods will be used to evaluate the edema on the
      face.

        1. Method The surgeon will measure from three different places on the patient's face ( two
           point distance) with the help of a paper ruler.

             -  Tragus-Pogonion

             -  Tragus-Labial Komissura

             -  Angulus Mandibula-Lateral Kantus Measurements will be made preoperative,
                postoperative 2. and 7. days and saved as milimetre.

        2. Method Patients will be given edema scale.With the help of the edema scale, the patients
           will be evaluated the edema by themselves. When the patient stand in front of the
           mirror, they will be assessed the edema on their face. And a value between 0 and 4 will
           be pointed on the scale postoperative 2. and 7. days.

      A correlation between the results of the first and second methods will be examined.
