  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the current study is to assess differences regarding the acute efficacy,
      safety, procedural duration, radiation exposure and long-term success of the novel AFA-Pro in
      combination of an individualized shortened ablation protocol containing a reduced freezing
      time to the standard approach of a fixed ablation protocol in patients with symptomatic PAF.

    <measure>Freedom from documented atrial tachyarrhythmia (every documented episode of atrial tachyarrhythmia lasting &gt;/=30 seconds will be count as recurrence.</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint of the current study is freedom from documented atrial tachyarrhythmia (&gt;/=30 seconds) documented by ECG 4-12 months after PVI off antiarrhythmic drugs. Atrial tachyarrhythmias comprise AF as well as atrial tachycardia and atrial flutter.
Holter-ECGs as well as 12-lead ECGs will be conducted. Every epsiode of documented atrial tachyarrhythmia (&gt;/=30 seconds)outside the blanking period will count as &quot;recurrence&quot;.</description>

    <measure>Acute procedure success</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0</time_frame>
    <description>Acute procedure success defined as the ability to confirm electrical isolation of the individual pulmonary vein with a circular mapping catheter (achieve catheter). Acute procedure success will be defined as pulmonary vein isolation of all target pulmonary veins.
Pulmonary vein isolation will be detected by entrance block (absence of a pulmonary vein signal) on the circular mapping catheter.</description>

    <description>The individualized &quot;time-to-effect&quot; protocol utilizing the AFA-Pro applies a freeze-cycle until documentation of PVI based on continuous real-time recordings from the Achieve catheter inside the PV. After documentation of PVI the freeze-cycle is prolonged for additional 90 seconds. If no PVI is achieved after 90 seconds or a temperature of -&lt;30° is not reached after 40 seconds the freeze cycle is stopped, the cryoballoon will be repositioned to possibly achieve a better position. Afterwards the freeze-cycle will be restarted. If no real-time PV signal recording can be obtained, a standard freeze-cycle of 180 seconds is applied. No bonus-freeze-cycle is applied in this protocol.</description>

    <description>The fixed-freeze-cycle protocol utilizing the AFA-Pro comprises a fixed freeze-cycle duration of 180 seconds. If PVI is not achieved with the first freeze-cycle, another 180 seconds freeze-cycle will be applied until documented PVI. After PVI no bonus freeze-cycle is applied.</description>

    <intervention_name>Catheter ablation</intervention_name>
    <description>Electrophysiology studies are performed during conscious sedation using boluses of midazolam and fentanyl and a continuous infusion of propofol. Vital parameters are continuously monitored. One 7F standard diagnostic catheter is positioned inside the coronary sinus (CS) via the femoral vein. One 8,5-F sheath is advanced to the left atrium (LA). After transseptal catheterization, intravenous heparin is administered to target an activated clotting time of ≥300 seconds. PV angiographies are obtained for each PV and PV recordings are registered at baseline in SR. The 8.5F transseptal sheath (TS) is changed over the wire for a 12F steerable TS.</description>
