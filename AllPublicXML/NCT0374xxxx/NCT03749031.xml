  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized crossover intervention designed to evaluate effects of daily intake of
      beverages containing orange or apple Pomace on gastrointestinal function as measured by stool
      frequency. Additional outcomes will include aspects of digestive health and self-reported GI
      symptoms and dietary intake as well as analysis of gut microbiota.

    <measure>stool frequency</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes over 7 weeks (daily during 4 week treatment followed by daily during 3 week washout) compared to baseline (daily during 2 week run-in)</time_frame>
    <description>Bowel habits daily diary as weekly averages. Fewer days with no stool, and higher number of stools per week would be better.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-reported GI symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes over 7 weeks (daily during 4 week treatment followed by daily during 3 week washout) compared to baseline (daily during 2 week run-in)</time_frame>
    <description>GI Tolerability questionnaire, 4 selections. The minimum value is Less than usual. The maximum value is Much more than usual. Pomace treament arms expected to have more GI symptoms than juice arms. Less symptoms are better than more.</description>

    <measure>Stool consistency</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes over 7 weeks (daily during 4 week treatment followed by daily during 3 week washout) compared to baseline (daily during 2 week run-in)</time_frame>
    <description>Bristol score, 7 types of stool drawings presented in a chart from lumpy Type 1, to watery Type 7. Improved consistency would be better.</description>

    <measure>Ease of stool passage</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes over 7 weeks (daily during 4 week treatment followed by daily during 3 week washout) compared to baseline (daily during 2 week run-in)</time_frame>
    <description>Rating scale 1 (Very easy) to 5 (Very difficult). Easier passage would be better.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>microbiota changes</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from baseline sample to end of treatment sample (Week 4) and end of 3 week washout sample (Week 7)</time_frame>
    <description>Stool samples for possible explanations of mechanisms of pomace. Higher bacteria associated with fiber fermentation would be better. Species examined include F. Prau, lachnospiraceae, ruminoucoccaceae, bifidobacteria, and changes in alpha and beta diversity as measured by 16S RNA sequencing. Data pending, unknown units at this time.</description>
