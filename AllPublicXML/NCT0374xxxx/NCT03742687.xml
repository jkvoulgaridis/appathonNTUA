    <textblock>
      The options for patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who are not
      candidates for a standard definitive chemoradiotherapy regime are meagre. These are patients
      who are not fit for a chemoradiotherapy schedule of 66 Gy in 2 Gy fractions due to either
      tumour extent, resulting in excessive dose to the healthy tissue in the thorax, or with
      performance status not supporting seven weeks of intensive treatment.

      The aim is to study the efficiency as well as the safety of a new treatment option of
      heterogeneously hypofractionated radiotherapy for patients with locally advanced NSCLC who
      are not candidates for standard, high-dose chemoradiotherapy, either due to excessive
      irradiation of normal tissue (defined as category A patients) or due to fragility of the
      patient (category B patients).

      1.1 Radiotherapy in lung cancer The options for patients with locally advanced non-small cell
      lung cancer (NSCLC) who are not candidates for a standard definitive chemoradiotherapy regime
      are meagre. These patients are not fit for a standard chemoradiotherapy due to either tumour
      extent, resulting in excessive dose to the healthy tissue in the thorax, or with performance
      status not supporting seven weeks of intensive treatment. Such patients could benefit from a
      treatment offering long-term locoregional control leading to improved survival. However, at
      present, they are offered palliative treatment regimens. Alternatively, a full schedule of
      definitive chemoradiotherapy is sometimes attempted, and patient may only complete part of
      the treatment course.

      Favourable alternative treatment options for this group of patients would have to:

        -  Provide a reasonable probability of locoregional disease control.

        -  Result in less expected toxicity.

        -  Be delivered using a shorter treatment schedule than the current 6-7 weeks Standard
           chemoradiotherapy aims at delivering a homogeneous dose distribution to the primary
           tumour and involved lymph nodes. However, studies of patterns of failures in locally
           advanced NSCLC patients indicate that isolated mediastinal nodal failures are less
           common than disease recurrence in the primary tumour site or in bulky lymph nodes. This
           suggests that it might be possible to lower the dose to all or selected parts of the
           involved mediastinal lymph nodes without drastically impacting the combined locoregional
           control.

      Modelling studies indicate that tumour control may mainly depend on mean tumour dose,
      provided that the minimum dose to the tumour exceeds a certain level. One example is provided
      by stereotactic radiotherapy (SBRT), where very heterogeneous dose distributions usually
      results in higher dose in the middle of the tumour compared to the dose to the tumour
      periphery. The Danish NARLAL2 trial [NCT02354274] investigates heterogeneous dose escalation;
      with the most PET-avid part of the tumour used as a driver for the dose escalation. Most
      prospective trials have focused on hyperfractionated, accelerated treatments. Although
      effective, these schedules are also associated with substantial acute toxicity, likely not
      tolerable for borderline curative patients with extensive local disease. Definitive
      moderately hypofractioned radiotherapy has limited clinical evidence in lung cancer patients,
      but has demonstrated promising outcomes in a few trials. The current study aims to use a
      heterogeneous hypofractionated schedule for the treatment of high-risk locally advanced NSCLC
      patients, in order to improve loco-regional control and survival. The central idea is to
      decrease dose to normal tissue by ascribing a heterogeneous dose to the PTV. The gross volume
      of the primary tumour and bulky lymph nodes receive mean doses of up to 66 Gy in 24
      fractions, and thus receive a hypofractionated higher biological effective dose than standard
      66 Gy in 33 fractions.

      1.2 Aim of this study To study the efficiency as well as the safety of a new treatment option
      of heterogeneously hypofractionated radiotherapy for patients with locally advanced NSCLC who
      are not candidates for standard, high-dose chemoradiotherapy, either due to excessive
      irradiation of normal tissue (defined as category A patients) or due to fragility of the
      patient (category B patients).

      2 Purpose To demonstrate the feasibility of a heterogeneous and hypo-fractionated definitive
      (chemo-) radiotherapy schedule for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients not
      candidates for standard, long-course chemoradiotherapy. Outcomes will be reported using
      descriptive statistics, from which the viability of the regimen as a standard treatment will
      be evaluated.

      3 Study design This is a prospective multicentre feasibility study. It includes patients with
      inoperable locally advanced NSCLC (stage IIB-IV) not candidates for standard treatment with
      curative intent. Patients are treated with (chemo-) radiotherapy in 24 fractions, 5 fractions
      a week.

      3.1 Systemic therapy Patients are allowed to receive 1-2 cycles of induction therapy with
      platinum doublet and/or concomitant chemotherapy. Patients with synthesizing mutations such
      as EGFR or ALK are allowed to receive TKI either as induction or as concurrent according to
      the local institution's guidelines.

      3.2 Study sample size and time frame Patients in Denmark with NSCLC treated with palliative
      intent in 2014 had a one-year overall survival of 37.5%. The study is expected to enrol
      patients over a 2-year period, calculated from the date where two centres have opened for
      enrolment. At least 76 patients from category A and at least 75 patients from category B 3.3
      Continuous monitoring of early mortality Any patient death within the first three months of
      radiotherapy initiation will be evaluated by the local site investigator and reported to
      primary investigator. Primary investigator will provide continuous monitoring of early
      mortality in order to ensure that the rate is not unacceptable, and will provide reports to
      all investigators at regular intervals.

      3.4 Data management All dose plans used for patient treatment, including adapted plans, are
      exported to the national dose plan bank (CIRRO), from where doses to tumour, lymph nodes and
      organs at risk are extracted for analysis.

      Baseline PET-CT scans as well as any CT or PET-CT scans at time of disease recurrence should,
      if available, preferably also be transferred to the dose plan bank.

      4 Radiotherapy treatment planning 4.1 Scan procedure

      A CT scan taking into account respiratory motion (i.e. 4D-CT scan, deep inspiration breath
      hold CT scan, or other respiratory controlled CT scans) is acquired:

        -  With intravenous contrast if allowed by kidney function.

        -  Maximum 3 mm distance between CT slices.

        -  Less than four weeks before start of radiotherapy A FDG-PET scan acquired within six
           week of the planning-CT should be used to guide the target delineation.

      4.2 Target volumes The primary tumour is delineated separately as GTV-T. GTV-N includes all
      pathological lymph nodes. In patients with bulky lymph nodes, the dose will be escalated to
      the bulky part of the lymph nodes only, delineated in a separate structure, GTV-Nhigh. Bulky
      lymph nodes are defined as lymph nodes or conglomerates of lymph nodes where the longest
      diameter is 3 cm or more, i.e. corresponding to minimum volume of 14 cm3 for an approximately
      spherical target.

      4.3 Dose planning Patients are treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (static beam
      angles or arc technique). Modern dose calculation algorithms (Monte Carlo, AAA, Collapsed
      Cone or similar) must be used to account for inhomogeneity corrections. Margins are applied
      ensuring that CTV receives a minimum dose of 95% of 50 Gy. All treatments are delivered in 24
      fractions, 5 fractions per week.

      5 Treatment verification and quality assurance 5.1 Verification of treatment position Daily
      imaging must be performed and used for daily correction of treatment position. Tolerances and
      margins depend on the setup strategy and must be defined locally.

      5.2 Adaptive strategy and tumour shrinkage For patients where either the position of the
      tumour, the position of the lymph nodes, patient anatomy, or lung density changes are
      observed to result in dosimetric or geometric changes above the clinic specific tolerances,
      the radiotherapy treatment plan has to be adapted to the observed changes. Deliberate
      reduction of treatment volumes due to tumour shrinkage, is not encouraged.

      5.3 Quality assurance To achieve similar dose planning strategies, all initially
      participating centres have performed dose planning for two representative patients. Centres
      joining the protocol will plan the same patients before including patients for comparison.
      Those plans are to be evaluated by the protocol committee during the trial.

      6 Participants Patients with inoperable NSCLC stage IIB, III or IV with oligo-metastatic
      disease and PS 0-2, who are not candidates for standard curative intended radiotherapy. Two
      general criteria can be used for entry into the protocol: A) The target volume for
      radiotherapy treatment volume is considered too large for a standard treatment of 66Gy in 33
      fractions, considering the expected normal tissue toxicity with a standard treatment plan; or
      B) The patient is too fragile for standard long-course radiotherapy with 66 Gy.

      6.1 Inclusion criteria

        -  Histologically or cytological confirmed locally advanced, inoperable NSCLC.

        -  Age ≥18 years.

        -  Signed informed consent.

        -  Performance status 0-2.

        -  Able to comply with study and follow-up procedures.

        -  Fertile women must have a negative pregnancy test. Fertile men and women must use
           effective contraception. Fertile women included in the study must use the pill, spiral,
           depot injection of gestagen, subdermal implantation, hormonal vaginal ring or
           transdermal patch for the duration of study treatment and one month thereafter.

      6.2 Exclusion criteria

        -  Prior radiotherapy to the thorax, unless there is no significant overlap of current
           treatment volumes with previous treatment fields.

        -  Dose plan conforming to protocol planning criteria not possible.

        -  Uncontrolled metastatic disease.

        -  Other active malignant disease. 6.3 Enrolment Patients are enrolled prior to initiation
           of radiotherapy when criteria in 6.1 and 6.2 are met. Patients enrolled are registered
           in either cohort A or cohort B.

      6.4 Evaluations during treatment Patients will be evaluated and treatment toxicity will be
      registered once during the course of radiotherapy. Adverse Event Registration collected by
      CTC version 4.0.

      6.5 Follow-up Patients will be seen every 3rd month during a follow up period of 24 months
      and thereafter every 6th month until end of study. During the first 24 months, the patient
      will be examined every 3rd month with a CT-scan and afterwards twice a year. Lung function
      test will be performed at 3 months and if needed clinically afterwards. An ECG will be
      performed at baseline as well as at 3 months.

      6.6 Recurrences Local failures are assessed with CT scan of thorax and upper abdomen. All
      recurrences should be verified by biopsy if possible. Patients with recurrence are kept in
      the protocol with regards to collection of follow-up data.

      7 Complications (Evaluation of toxicity) All complication (side effects) will be evaluated
      according to the NCI-CTCAE v 4.0 during all follow-up visits.

      7.1 Side effects The study is based on an overall de-escalation of dose compared to the
      standard treatment, so it is generally expected to observe fewer side effects.

      7.2 Adverse Event (AE) Any unfavourable and unintended sign or symptom related to the organs
      in the thorax: the lungs, the pleurae, the oesophagus, the bronchial tree (including the
      trachea), the heart and the great vessels in the thorax will be reported.

      7.3 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) A SAE is an event occurring during any part of the protocol
      treatment after radiotherapy initiation that results in any of the following: death, a
      life-threatening experience that requires hospitalization or requires intervention to prevent
      permanent impairment/damage. All grade 3 or more radiation-induced lung toxicity, esophagitis
      grade 4, grade 2 pericardial effusion, bronco-pulmonary fistula and oesophagus strictureas
      recorded using CTC -AE V4 [18]. All SAEs will be evaluated by the local site investigator and
      reported to the trial management committee.

      8 Statistical considerations and planned data analyses This study aims at providing an
      alternative option to a purely palliative treatment for NSCLC patients with locally advanced
      disease. Thus the study needs to demonstrate outcomes not considerably inferior to current
      standard palliative treatment. Current one-year survival for palliative patients in the
      Danish Oncological Lung Cancer database is 38% (baseline estimate). The investigators assume
      that the case mix in the current study will consist of somewhat better prognosis patients
      than the average palliative patient, corresponding to a one-year survival of 48% (i.e.
      10%-points better than baseline) in category A patients. In order to establish, with 80%
      power and one-sided confidence of 95%, that the proposed treatment results in a one-year
      survival in which is no more than 5%-points inferior to the baseline (i.e. no worse than
      33%), 69 patients are needed. In order to account for a loss to follow-up of 10%, the trial
      plans to accrue 76 patients in category A. Patients included in category B are inherently
      frail and elderly, with expected worse overall survival than category A patients. Assuming
      33% baseline one-year survival and 43% one-year survival for study patients, and maintaining
      the remainder of the requirements above, 75 category B patients is needed.

      The treatment will be considered ineffective if it cannot be concluded that the one year
      survival rate is no more than 5%-points lower than that of the average palliative patient.
      Locoregional failure rate will be calculated as a cumulative incidence estimate.

      Toxicity, during and after radiotherapy, will be scored using CTC version 4.0 [CTC].
      Incidence of acute and late toxicity grade ≥ 3 and grade 5 will be evaluated, with acute
      toxicity summarized as worst grade during treatment and late toxicity as cumulative incidence
      of toxicity events.

      9 Ethical considerations Patients, who are not candidates for a definitive chemoradiotherapy
      schedule of 66 Gy in 2 Gy fractions, are most often offered purely palliative intent
      treatment regimens, either with low dose radiotherapy or chemotherapy. In this study, these
      patients are offered a radiotherapy schedule with high doses, with an expectation of better
      survival due to improved local control. This study will be performed according to the
      appropriate GCP-ICH regulations and in concordance with the Helsinki Declaration (Seoul
      version, October 2008). Approval from the ethical committee is obtained. The Danish Data
      Protection Agency is informed. All patients must have agreed to participate by signing the
      consent form.
