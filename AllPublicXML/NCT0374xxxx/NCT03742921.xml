        Since the number of patients with PTCL was 48 and 131 in the Japanese and overseas clinical
        studies, respectively, the number of subjects to be surveyed was established at 130 to
        allow comparison of results between this survey and Japanese clinical study, or between
        this survey and overseas clinical study.

        Among events that were established as the key survey items of this survey, QT interval
        prolonged had the lowest incidence (3.8%) in the overseas/Japanese clinical studies of
        Istodax in patients with PTCL. When 130 subjects are collected, it would be possible to
        collect at least 1 case of an event that occurs at the frequency of 2.3% with a reliability
        of 95%. Thus, assuming that adverse events occur under the actual use conditions at similar
        frequencies as in clinical studies, it would be possible to obtain at least 1 case of all
        events that have been established as the key survey items.
