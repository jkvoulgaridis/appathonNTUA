  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women with mood disorders are vulnerable to the negative consequences associated with
      obesity, and face considerable challenges with adherence to behavioral weight management
      interventions. Strategies are needed to support the psychological well-being of this
      population, and improve adherence to weight-related treatment. The goal of this preliminary
      study is to determine the acceptability of a group-based compassion-focused psychoeducational
      intervention among women with mood disorders who are attending a behavioral weight management
      program.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pilot feasibility trial to examine the acceptability and efficacy of compassion-based
      intervention in reducing indices of psychopathology (i.e., internalized weight stigma, mood
      symptoms), and improving weight management outcomes (i.e., physical activity behaviour,
      dieting behaviour, weight loss) among women with mood disorders undergoing lifestyle weight
      management. In this proof of concept study, adult females with a diagnosis of major
      depressive disorder of bipolar disorder will be randomized into two arms: weight management
      treatment as usual + psychoeducation group; weight management as usual + control.
