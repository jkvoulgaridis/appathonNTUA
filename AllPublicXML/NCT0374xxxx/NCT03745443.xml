  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During general anesthesia lung collapses and atelectasis occurs. Preservation of atelectasis
      can cause pulmonary disfunction. The goal of safe anesthesia is to protect the lungs
      intraoperatively. Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is distending pressure that
      prevents alveolar collapse during mechanical ventilation and is a part of recruitment
      maneuver that is often used in patients on mechanical ventilation. Overall effect of PEEP is
      improvement in lung function. PEEP can have adverse effects on hemodynamics. The objective of
      this study was to assess the effect of step up and down PEEP titration on lung function and
      hemodynamics in healthy preschool children during general anesthesia. One group of children
      was ventilated with constant PEEP. the other was submitted to PEEP titration. Changes in lung
      compliance, gas exchange and hemodynamic status were documented as well as any unwanted
      effects.

      Seventy preschool children American Society of Anesthesiologists classification system (ASA)
      I and II scheduled for non-cardiothoracic surgery were allocated in two groups.
      Interventional group (n=35) received PEEP titration and Control group (n=35) didn't. They
      were ventilated only with PEEP 3. PEEP titration: In Intervention group, 20 minutes before
      the end of anesthesia PEEP was increased by 2 on every 5 breaths to 11. Ventilation with PEEP
      11 was maintained for 2 minutes. Then PEEP was reduced by 2 on every 5 breaths to 5 and
      remain as until awakening. Total time to perform titration was 5 minutes. Blood was collected
      in both groups, in equal points of time that is: after induction, 20 minutes before the end
      of surgery and after the end of surgery (20th minute). Investigators tested differences of
      outcome variables between groups and within the Interventional group before and after PEEP
      titration. Hemodynamic monitoring and monitoring of lung function were conducted in
      Interventional group to observe changes during PEEP titration.
