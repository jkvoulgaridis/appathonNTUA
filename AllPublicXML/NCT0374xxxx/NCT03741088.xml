  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will assess the technical performance of the VORTX Rx device to deliver acoustic
      energy for cavitation-based cellular destruction. The planned duration of a single target
      tumor will be 60 minutes or less in a single session and adjusted intra-procedurally as
      necessary per investigator discretion. Subjects in this study must have an adequate acoustic
      window in the abdominal space in order to be eligible for enrollment. All patients who
      undergo ablation with the investigation device will be treated in a hospital environment
      under general anesthesia not to exceed four hours.

    <description>Immunological response of ablation will be evaluated on the basis of immune tests conducted and tumor biomarker assessments (including, but not limited to, immune tests: CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD45+, CD16+, CD56+ and CD19+, C-reactive protein [CRP], complement C3, C4 and CH50, immunoglobulins [IgG, IgM, IgA], interleukin-6 [IL-6], carcinoembryonic antigen [CEA], alfa-fetoprotein [AFP], Cancer Antigens CA15-3 [Breast Cancer] and CA 19-9 [Pancreatic Cancer]) from baseline to evaluation visits 1 day, 1 week and 1 and 2 months post procedure.</description>

    <measure>Assesment of quality of life by using patient questtionaires EORTC QLQ-C30. (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 and 2 months post procedure.</time_frame>
    <description>The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-item generic health-related QoL instrument designed to assess cancer patients' physical, psychological and social functioning. It is composed of 9 multi-item scales (5 functional scales [physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social], a global QoL scale [GQoL], and 3 symptom scales [fatigue, pain, and nausea and vomiting]), 5 single-item symptom scales assessing additional symptoms commonly reported by cancer patients (dyspnoea, loss of appetite, insomnia, constipation and diarrhea), and an item on the perceived financial impact of the disease.
All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0-100. A high scale score represents a higher response level. Thus, a high score for a functional scale represents a high/healthy level of functioning. A high score for the global health status/QoL represents a high QoL. However, a high score for a symptom scale/item represents a high level of symptomatology/problems.</description>

    <time_frame>1-day post ablation and 1 week post procedure.</time_frame>
