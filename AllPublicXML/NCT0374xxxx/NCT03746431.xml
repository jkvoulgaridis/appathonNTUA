      The primary objectives are to:

        1. Evaluate the safety and tolerability of [111In]-FPI-1547 Injection and [225Ac]-FPI-1434
           Injection in patients with advanced refractory solid tumours

        2. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of a single [225Ac]-FPI-1434 Injection

      The secondary objectives are to:

        1. Obtain preliminary data on tumour uptake of [111In]-FPI-1547 Injection in cancer
           patients

        2. Determine the dosimetry of [111In]-FPI-1547 Injection (whole body and individual organs)

        3. Determine the pharmacokinetics of [111In]-FPI-1547 Injection and [225Ac]-FPI-1434
           Injection

        4. Estimate the dosimetry for [225Ac]-FPI-1434 Injection (whole body and individual
           regions)

        5. Describe efficacy of [225Ac]-FPI-1434 Injection

        6. Assess the effect of [225Ac]-FPI-1434 Injection on the QTc interval

        7. Assess changes in human growth hormone (hGh), insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 and
           insulin-like growth binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) following [111In]-FPI-1547 and

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human Phase 1, non-randomized, multi-center, open-label clinical trial
      designed to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics of [111In]-FPI-1547
      Injection and [225Ac]-FPI-1434 Injection and to establish the maximum tolerated dose of a
      single [225Ac]-FPI-1434 Injection in patients with solid tumours with demonstrated tumour
      uptake of [111In]-FPI-1547.

             or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
             requirements.
