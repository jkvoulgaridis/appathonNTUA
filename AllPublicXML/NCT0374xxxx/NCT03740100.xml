  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preclinical data and limited clinical evidence suggest that Head and Neck Squameous Cell
      Carcinoma tumors harboring certain mutations may respond well to PI3K/mTOR inhibition
      (phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/ mammalian target of rapamycin inhibition).

      The current study enrolls patients with refractory and / or metastatic Head and Neck
      Squameous Cell Carcinoma based on the mutational status of their disease to assess the
      response to treatment with bimiralisib, an orally available pan-PI3K/mTOR inhibitor
      (phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/ mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor).
