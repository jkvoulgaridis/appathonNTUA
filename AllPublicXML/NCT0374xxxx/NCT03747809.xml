      2018 Revision of Health Reimbursement in Japan recognized non face-to-face diagnostics, such
      as Online Treatment, as the standard of care. There was a significantly additional cost for
      Cardiovascular Implantable Electronic Devices (CIEDs) Management Fee as well. The adaption of
      Remote Monitoring for CIEDs patients is recommended by the societies based on the clinical
      evidences. However, how QALYs earned by CIEDs Remote Monitoring are justified in Japanese
      reimbursement environment from the cost-effectiveness standpoint is still not so clear. The
      evaluation about the impact on the health economics about the installation of CIEDs Remote
      Monitoring has not been enough due to the lack of the researches around this field. Therefore
      this research is designed to examine the impact of the installation of CIEDs Remote
      Monitoring from the health economics perspective by considering the health insurance system
      and the clinical process in Japan, through Systematic Review methodology.
