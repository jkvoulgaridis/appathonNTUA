    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to collect information on how Ryzodeg® works in real world
      participants. Participants will get Ryzodeg® as prescribed to them by the study doctor. The
      study will last for about 6 to 8 months. The participants will be asked questions about their
      health and their diabetes treatment as part of their normal study doctor's appointment.
