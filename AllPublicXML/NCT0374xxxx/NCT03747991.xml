  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The changes in the organisms making up the gut microbiota in infants who are taking anti-acid
      reflux medications (histamine 2 receptor antagonists) as compared to infants who are not
      taking these medications is not well-studied or understood. Whether these medications change
      the gut microbiota and microbiome, and what that change may imply for children on these
      medications, is the focus of this study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gut microbiota dysbiosis is associated with diseases ranging from localized gastrointestinal
      disorders to neurologic, respiratory, metabolic, hepatic, and cardiovascular illnesses. The
      microbial colonization of the infant gut is known to play a key role in immunologic and
      metabolic pathways impacting on human health. Disruptions during the complex process of
      microbial colonization have been shown to increase disease susceptibility during life. A
      variety of factors are known to influence the gut microbiota, including mode of delivery of
      neonate, host genetic factors, hose immune response, diet, xenobiotics and other drugs,
      infections, and environmental microbial exposures.

      The diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease in the infant population has increased
      during the past two decades. Acid suppression medications are used commonly in infants for
      gastroesophageal reflux disease and other acid-related conditions despite little evidence of
      their efficacy. Multiple studies have shown adverse effects in pediatric patients using
      either proton pump inhibitors or H2 receptor antagonists, the two classes of acid suppression
      medications that are most frequently used in children. Some of these adverse effects may
      result from alterations in the microbiome caused by these medications. Prior studies have
      demonstrated significant changes in microbial composition of both gastric and intestinal
      microbiota with proton pump inhibitor use (5), but to the investigators' knowledge, no prior
      studies have looked at the effect of H2 receptor antagonists on the microbiome in healthy,
      full term infants.
