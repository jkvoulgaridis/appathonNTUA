  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate the effects of non-alcoholic beer in patients with
      type 2 diabetes. Subjects will be divided into two groups: the control group, where
      participants will be consuming a bottle of water (330ml) every day for 12 weeks, and the
      intervention group, where participants will be consuming a bottle of non-alcoholic beer
      (330ml) for the same period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a parallel, controlled randomized trial. The study will compare the effect of
      non-alcoholic beer consumption with water, in patients with type 2 diabetes.

      All patients from both groups will receive a personalized nutritional intervention and will
      be followed throughout the study by a certified nutritionist.
