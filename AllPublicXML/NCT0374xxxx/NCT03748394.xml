    <textblock>
      The study compares the effects of two add-on interventions in primary care rehabilitation, on
      work ability and psychological health, in workers with common mental disorders. One
      intervention consists of a person-centered plan using work-directed treatment modules of
      occupational therapy and physical therapy, during 8 weeks. The other intervention consists of
      supported physical activity during 8 weeks. The primary outcome is work ability, measured by
      the work ability index and days on sick leave.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Common mental disorders (CMD), including mild to moderate depression, anxiety disorders and
      exhaustion disorder, are a major cause of sick leave and work disability. Compared to other
      disorders, work-related problems associated with CMD is sparsely explored. While recommended
      treatments, such as antidepressants or cognitive behavioral therapy have effects on
      psychiatric symptoms, the effect on work capacity is unclear, suggesting a need for
      alternative interventions.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of an add-on work-directed intervention in
      primary care rehabilitation, compared to a physical activity control, for persons with CMD.

      The goal of the experimental condition is to enhance the participant's ability to work by
      creating an individually tailored plan for self-management, supported by occupational and
      physical therapy techniques, such as structuring daily activities, stress management or body
      awareness techniques. Enhancing self-management is the core of this intervention and also a
      new approach compared to earlier efforts to promote work capacity.
