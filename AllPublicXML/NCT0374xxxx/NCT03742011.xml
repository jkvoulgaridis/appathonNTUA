    <textblock>
      The Offspring Born to Mothers with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome in Guangzhou Cohort study
      (PCOS-BIG) was established to investigate the short- and long-term effects of intrauterine
      exposure to maternal PCOS on the health of offspring in Guangzhou, China. Data are collected
      regarding maternal PCOS subtypes, nursing, diet and education as well as health outcomes in
      their later life. Biological samples including blood and tissue samples are also collected
      from participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to preliminary survey, the prevalence of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) among
      Chinese women reached 7.5%. Hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance were considered as the
      main pathogenesis of PCOS. As reported, the secretion of androgen is higher among women with
      PCOS than the healthy reference population throughout their fertile lives. Worth of concern,
      offspring of PCOS patients presented with glucolipid metabolism disorders as early as during
      their childhood, while whose pathogenesis remains unclear. Prenatal exposure of rhesus monkey
      in pregnant to androgens produces glucolipid metabolic alterations in offspring resembling
      those in PCOS, suggesting that the exposure of the fetus to hyperandrogenism during gestation
      could affect the glucolipid metabolism of PCOS offspring. Growing evidence shows that
      different exposures during pregnancy will affect the DNA methylation of offspring and disturb
      their endocrine and metabolism. A birth cohort would provide an opportunity to examine the
      short- and long-term effects of PCOS exposure, such as hyperandrogenism, on health
      consequences of the offspring.
