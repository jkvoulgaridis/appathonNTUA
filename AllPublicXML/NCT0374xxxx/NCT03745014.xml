    <textblock>
      The FDA-cleared Accelerate Pheno™ System and PhenoTest™ Blood Culture (BC) Kit will be used
      to assess the workflow impact of fast identification (ID)/ antimicrobial susceptibility
      testing (AST) in the microbiology lab and in the quality of care in patients with
      Gram-negative rod (GNR) bacteremia. Blood culture work up will be randomized to one of two
      arms: the positive blood culture will either undergo fast ID and AST using the Accelerate
      Pheno™ System and PhenoTest™ BC Kit or processing per the site's standard of care (SOC)
      procedures.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult (≥18 years of age) hospitalized patients with positive blood culture due to
             gram-negative rod (on Gram stain)

          -  Blood culture drawn in the Emergency Department (ED)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients not admitted to hospital

          -  Patients discharged from hospital prior to blood culture positivity

          -  Only the first positive blood culture for each patient of each hospitalization will be
             included during the study period; any subsequent episode of bloodstream infection
             (BSI) will be excluded

          -  Positive blood culture with GNR in the prior 7 days (if known at the time of
             randomization)

          -  Transferred from an outside hospital and had a history of a previously positive blood
             culture of the same organism in the prior 7 days (if known at the time of
             randomization)

          -  GNR plus gram-positive organism, gram-negative cocci, and/or yeast detected on blood
             culture Gram stain

          -  Deceased or palliative care at the time of randomization

          -  Patient who is moribund (does not survive the initial 72 hours after enrollment)
