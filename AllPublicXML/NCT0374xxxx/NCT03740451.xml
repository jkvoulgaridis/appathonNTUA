  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Scientific literature dealing with patients with fibromyalgia conveys they suffer from an
      abnormal response of the autonomic nervous sýstem, where a marked sympathetic hyperactivity
      and a decrease in heart rate variability are emphasized. It is important to know what manual
      therapy techniques may manage to decrease the sympathetic activity and balance the
      sympathetic-vagal tone, therefore improving pain and life quality.

      This study will compare the effects of joint passive mobilization with the effects of soft
      tissue active mobilization on heart rate variability (as an indicator of autonomous
      regulation), psychological well-being (measured by the Ryff scale) and pain in patients with
      fibromyalgia.

      regulation), psychological well-being (measured by the Ryff scale) and pain in patients with
      fibromyalgia.

      The authors expect a stronger decrease in the sympathetic nervous system activation; a
      greater reduction in pain, and a bigger improvement in well-being and anxiety in those
      patients treated with active mobilization of soft tissues than passive mobilization group.
