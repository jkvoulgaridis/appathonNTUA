      Pilot study to evaluate the use of the Personal Activity Intelligence (PAI) score in a
      clinical setting.

      This is a pilot project to evaluate the feasibility of a larger study to evaluate the
      effectiveness of Personal Activity Intelligence (PAI) score in patients with chronic disease,
      as an adjunct to lifestyle medical therapy.

      The PAI score is a proprietary formula developed by PAI Health (PH) to aid physical fitness.
      A PAI score calculation uses biometrics obtained via a device that measures heart rate and
      steps. For this study, Mio Slice, a commercial wrist worn device will be utilized to obtain
      data which will be linked to a smart phone. Data from the smart phone app will be accessed by
      PAI Health. Feedback information will be given to the participants to encourage increased
      physical activity.

      The short-term aim of this study is to evaluate the logistics of utilizing PAI in the patient
      setting.

      The data obtained from this study will be utilized to devise a larger study to evaluate the
      utility of PAI in patients with chronic disease who are receiving lifestyle medical therapy.

    <description>The Personal Activity Intelligence (PAI) Score is a proprietary calculation owned by PAI Health, and not made available to the investigator. The score does take in to account resting heart rate while sleeping, peak heart rate during physical activity, length of time of elevated heart rate, steps. This data is captured via a wearable device, Mio Slice which is synced with a smart phone. Participants are encouraged to keep their PAI Score at 100, or as high as possible.</description>

    <description>Consenting subjects will be given a Mio Slice, along with instructions on how to utilize the device.
They will register on line with PAI Health, and will be asked to sync their device at least once every 7 days. They will be encouraged to look at the device app on their smart phone at least once daily.
After 1 week of obtaining baseline data, subjects will be encouraged to try to obtain a PAI score of at least 30 initially. Once they obtain a score of 30 consistently, they will be encouraged to increase the score toward 50. If they consistently obtain 50, they can increase their goal sequentially toward a maximum goal of 100. The duration of the study will be 12 weeks.</description>
