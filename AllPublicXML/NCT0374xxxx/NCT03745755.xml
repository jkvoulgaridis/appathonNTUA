  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Falls are the leading cause of traumatic death in the elderly with head injury causing half
      of these deaths. Each year, one in three adults over the age of 65 (seniors) fall, and half
      of these seniors seek treatment at a hospital emergency department (ED). There is a major
      evidence gap in the study of brain injury diagnosis in seniors, which is problematic for
      emergency physicians since the number of fall-associated head injuries is rising. ED
      diagnostic tools for risk stratification of these patients do not exist. The investigators
      will derive a novel ED clinical decision rule for detecting traumatic intracranial bleeding
      which will standardize the approach to head CT scans. Once validated, the investigators will
      optimize patient care by ensuring that intracranial bleeding is identified early. By reducing
      the use of head CT, this decision rule will lead to health care savings and streamlined,
      patient-centered ED care.

      This study is designed to develop a unique clinical decision rule for ED physicians
      evaluating senior patients who have fallen. Clinical decision rules are a common method for
      standardizing diagnostic decision-making and minimizing misdiagnosis in the ED. Each patient
      will be assessed at their index ED visit by an emergency physician who will record history
      and examination findings. The primary outcome will be clinically important intracranial
      bleeding diagnosed with 42 days. Patients who return to the ED within 42 days with new
      confusion, headache, loss of balance, repeat falls, change in behaviour, reduced Glasgow Coma
      Scale score or other neurological symptoms will also undergo head CT. All intracranial
      bleeding events will be adjudicated independently.

        ED patients aged over 65 years who present to the ED within 48 hours of having a fall.
        Eligibility is determined by having fallen on level ground (either inside or outside), off
        a chair or toilet seat or off a bed.

        Patients are included regardless of whether they hit their head.
