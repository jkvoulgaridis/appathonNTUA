  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of clinically significant anastomotic leaks (AL) after upper gastrointestinal
      (GI) surgery is approximately 4 % - 20 %, and the associated mortality can be as high as 80 %
      . Nutritional support is a key component of therapy in such cases, related to high prevalence
      of malnutrition and nil per month required for leak treatment.

      In the prophylactic setting, before the occurrence of any AL, a literature review based on
      seven randomised trials showed that enteral nutrition (EN) is associated with shorter
      hospital stay, lower incidence of severe of infectious complications, lower severity of
      complications and decreased cost compared to parenteral nutrition (TPN) following major upper
      GI surgery .

      In the curative setting, after the AL occurrence, very few evidence is available. Only one
      randomized clinical trial suggested the superiority of EN versus TPN after pancreatic surgery
      with a increase of the 30-day fistula closure rate from 37% in the TPN group to 60% in the EN
      group .

      This sole randomised study available did not include all postoperative upper GI AL (PUGIAL)
      that can occur after esophageal, gastric, duodenal, pancreatic surgery (including obesity
      surgery), whereas the concept of enteral nutritional support is highly relevant for all these
      situations.

      However surgeons are usually reluctant to provide EN in case of AL. A randomized study
      suggested the feasibility of EN in 47 patients with upper GI AL but no randomized study to
      date has been designed to test the superiority of EN versus TPN in PUGIAL.

      The study aim is to demonstrate the superiority of EN versus TPN to accelerate AL healing
      after upper GI surgery.

      Hypothesis:

      EN increases the 30-day fistula closure rate in PUGIAL, allowing better HRQOL without
      increasing morbi-mortality.

These scores are then summed to produce raw scale scores for each health concept which are then transformed to a 0 - 100 scale. Thie higher the score is, the better the quality of life is.</description>
