  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is often complicated by elevation of cardiac troponin, a
      marker of myocardial injury, that can be isolated or associated to myocardial infarction
      (MI). A retrospective study showed that corticosteroid treatment lowers incidence of MI
      during the hospital-stay.

      The aim of this clinical trial is to examine whether in-hospital treatment with iv
      methylprednisolone (20 mg b.i.d) may reduce myocardial injury, as assessed by serum
      high-sensitivity cardiac T Troponin) and eventually cardiovascular events during a short- and
      long-term follow-up in patients hospitalized CAP.

      Background. Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is often complicated by elevation of cardiac
      troponin, a marker of myocardial injury, that can be isolated or associated to myocardial
      infarction (MI). A retrospective study showed that corticosteroid treatment lowers incidence
      of MI during the hospital-stay. No data exist so far on the effect of corticosteroids on
      myocardial injury in CAP patients.

      Study design. Double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial. One hundred twenty-two
      eligible patients will be randomized to a week treatment with iv methylprednisolone (20 mg
      b.i.d) or placebo from hospital admission. Serum hs-cTnT will be measured at admission and
      every day until up 3 days from admission. ECG will be monitored every day until discharge.
      After dismission, all patients will be followed-up 2 years.

      Aims of the study. Primary objective of the study is to evaluate if methylprednisolone is
      able to reduce myocardial injury, as assessed by serum high-sensitivity cardiac T Troponin
      (hs-cTnT), in a cohort of patients hospitalized for CAP.

      Secondary aims are to evaluate the potential effect of methylprednisolone on cardiovascular
      events during hospitalization, at 30 day from hospital admission and during 2 years'
      follow-up. The trial will also examine whether the potential protective effects of
      methylprednisolone might be due to platelet activation down-regulation.
