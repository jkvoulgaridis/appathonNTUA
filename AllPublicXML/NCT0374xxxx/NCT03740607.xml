  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immersive virtual reality (iVR) has been used successfully to manage pain with distraction.
      It is a non-invasive treatment modality unassociated with worrisome well-known side effects
      typically seen when opioids and NSAIDS are used, and has previously been used safely in place
      of analgesia during dressing changes and burn care. This study investigates whether iVR can
      be useful as a stand-alone option to manage the pain associated with placement of peripheral
      intravenous (PIV) catheters in adults.

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study of the effect of immersive virtual reality on the perception of
      pain during peripheral IV (PIV) placement. Adult patients who require PIV placement for
      elective surgery will be consented for intervention while in the peri-operative suites (PS).
      The VR intervention will consist of a headset and immersive VR software that allows the
      patient to engage in a virtual world during PIV placement. Subjects will be queried
      immediately after PIV placement using the validated graphic rating scale regarding the
      sensory, cognitive, and affective aspects of discomfort they experienced with PIV placement
      (Appendix A). They will also be asked two validated questions concerning patient satisfaction
      (Dexter et al 1997). A control group of patients will undergo a similar assessment with
      slightly different wording after receiving PIV placement without iVR.

    <description>Randomized consented adult subjects will participate in a six-minute healthcare virtual reality software program via Samsung Gear virtual reality headsets while receiving 18 or 20-gauge peripheral intravenous catheter placement in peri-operative suite in preparation for surgery. They will be asked to rate their pain and discomfort afterwards using a graphic rating scale. They will be asked several questions about satisfaction, in order to elicit clinical significance of this intervention. Demographic information will be collected, and baseline vital signs upon arrival to OR will be abstracted retrospectively.</description>
