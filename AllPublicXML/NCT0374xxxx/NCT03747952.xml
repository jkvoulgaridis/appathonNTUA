    <textblock>
      This proposal is a collaborative effort between MedShape and the University of Texas Medical
      Branch. This is a prospective investigation to assess the clinical outcomes of patients with
      a tibiotalocalcaneal arthrodesis with the Dynamic Compression Intramedullary Nail (DynaNail).
      We are planning on enrolling 30 patients.

      Patients with end-stage tibiotalar (ankle) and talocalcaneal (subtalar) joint arthritis from
      any etiology will be asked to enroll in the study. After informed consent, the patients will
      be asked to complete the following patient reported outcomes questionnaires (standard of care
      for all patients in the Foot and Ankle section): 100mm Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain,
      Short form-36 (SF-36), and the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM). After informed consent,
      they will then be scheduled for surgery in a routine fashion.

      The following surgical procedure is standard of care. The surgical procedure will involve
      both tibiotalar and talocalcaneal joint preparation through any approach (lateral, posterior,
      anterior with sinus tarsi). The use of supplemental bone graft is at the discretion of the
      treating surgeon but must be documented. The MedShape DynaNail will then be inserted
      according to the manufacturer's technique. The patient will be placed in a short leg splint
      and kept non-weight bearing. The patient will be discharged from the hospital when medically
      ready and follow-up in two weeks.

      At two weeks, the patient will return to clinic and their splint will be removed. Non-weight
      bearing radiographs of the hind foot will be taken to assess the amount of travel of the
      compressive element. The patient will be placed in a non-weight bearing cast. The patient
      will then be asked to return in two weeks (4 weeks post-operatively). At this time additional
      non-weight bearing radiographs will be taken to assess the amount of travel of the
      compressive element. The patient will be asked to return at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12
      months, and 24 months after surgery. At 6 months, a CT scan will be obtained to assess
      healing. At each of these time-points, the same patient specific outcome questionnaires will
      be administered.

      Patients will be identified in the clinic by an attending orthopaedic foot and ankle surgeon
      or his physician assistant based on clinical exam and radiographic findings. Inclusion
      criteria include anyone over age 18 who has ankle and subtalar arthritis and has failed
      nonoperative management. Typically, these patients have multiple medical comorbidities and
      therefore the exclusion criteria will be patients who are not healthy enough to undergo
      surgery. Additional exclusion criteria include non-English speakers, and patients that are
      blind, illiterate, or are prisoners. Patients of all racial, religious, and cultural
      backgrounds will be included in this study.

The scale consists of a 100 mm straight line, with patients asked to mark a dot along the line their severity level of pain, with one end representing &quot;the worst pain imaginable&quot; and the other end representing &quot;no pain&quot;. &quot;No pain&quot; is a score of 0, with &quot;the worst pain imaginable&quot; representing a score of 100. The quantitative distances are grouped into the following categories: 0-4 mm = no pain, 5-44 mm = mild pain, 45-74 mm = moderate pain, and 75-100 mm = severe pain.</description>

        Patients will be identified in the clinic by an attending orthopaedic foot and ankle
        surgeon or his physician assistant based on clinical exam and radiographic findings.
        Inclusion criteria include anyone age 18 and over who has ankle and subtalar arthritis and
        has failed nonoperative management. Typically, these patients have multiple medical
        comorbidities and therefore exclusion criteria will include patients who are not healthy
        enough to undergo surgery. Patients of all racial, religious, and cultural backgrounds will
        be included in this study. Approximately 30 patients will be recruited for the study.
