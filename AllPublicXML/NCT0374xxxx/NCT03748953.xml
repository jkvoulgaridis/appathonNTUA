  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of ixazomib maintenance therapy on
      progression-free survival (PFS) compared with placebo, in participants in China with newly
      diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) who have had a major response [complete response (CR), very
      good partial response (VGPR), or partial response (PR)] to initial therapy and who have not
      undergone stem-cell transplantation (SCT).

      This study is a China continuation of the global study C16021 (NCT02312258).

      29-Apr-2020 Enrollment of new patients into this study has been paused due to the COVID-19
      situation. The duration of this pause is dependent on the leveling and control of the
      COVID-19 pandemic.

      The drug being tested in this study is called ixazomib. Ixazomib is being tested to slow
      disease progression and improve overall survival in Chinese participants who have newly
      diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) who have had a major positive response to initial therapy
      and have not undergone stem cell transplantation (SCT). This study will look at the effect of
      ixazomib has on the length of time that participants are free of disease progression and
      their overall survival.

      The study will enroll approximately 105 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned (by
      chance, like flipping a coin) in 3:2 ratio to one of the two treatment groupsâ€”which will
      remain undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an
      urgent medical need):

        -  Ixazomib 3 mg

        -  Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a capsule that looks like the study drug but has
           no active ingredient

      All participants will be asked to take one capsule on Days 1, 8, and 15 of every 28-day
      cycle, for up to 26 cycles or until documented PD or intolerable toxicity, whichever occurs
      first.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in China. The overall time to participate in this
      study is until a total of approximately 60 death events have been reported for Chinese
      participants or FA for OS in the global study (approximately up to 88 months). Participants
      will make multiple visits to the clinic, and every 4 weeks until the next line of therapy
      begins for a follow-up assessment.

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available for all interventional studies after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received (or program is completely terminated), an opportunity for the primary publication of the research and final report development has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>
