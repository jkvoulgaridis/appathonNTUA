    <textblock>
      This pilot study is to investigate if a lesion preparation strategy with Phoenix atherectomy
      before DCB (drug coated balloon) usage in patients with PAD (peripheral artery disease)
      Rutherford Stage 4-5 and mild/moderate/severe calcium can improve outcomes including patency
      and limb salvage and evaluate safety and performance of the combination therapy
