  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase IIB, national, randomized, double-blinded, comparative, multi-center study,
      to assess the efficacy of Olaparib as maintenance after a platinum based chemotherapy in
      patients with Advanced or metastatic endometrial cancer
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 147 patients will be randomized using an Interactive Voice Response System /
      Interactive web system (IVR/IWR system) in a 2:1 ratio to the treatments as specified below :

        -  Olaparib tablets per os 300 mg twice daily,

        -  Placebo tablets per os 300 mg twice daily.

      Before randomization to the study :

        -  Patient should be without evidence of disease (NED), or in clinical complete response or
           in partial response or stable.

        -  Patient must have completed a minimum of 4 cycles of first line platinum based
           chemotherapy (recommended chemotherapy is carboplatine AUC 5 plus paclitaxel 175 mg/m2).

      Patient will be stratified according to :

        -  P53 and MMR Immunohistochemistry, (Y/N)

        -  Response to previous chemotherapy line (Objective response versus Stable)

      Patients will receive Olaparib/Placebo up to disease progression.

    <description>Health related quality of life of the patient. For all scales a high score is equivalent to worse or more problems. Range is the difference between the maximum and minimum possible value of the raw score. All items are scored from1 to 4, giving a range=3. For each scale, calculate the raw score by the addition of item responses divided by the number of items. Then a linear transformation is used to standardise the raw score, so that scores range from 0 to 100. Score= (raw score-1)/rangex100</description>

    <description>EQ-5D is a standardised measure of health status developed by the EuroQol Group in order to provide a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal. The descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. The EQ VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale. The maximum score of 1 indicates the best health state, by contrast with the scores of individual questions, where higher scores indicate more severe or frequent problems.</description>
