  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antipsychotic (AP) medications are considered to be the gold standard treatment for psychotic
      disorders including schizophrenia. However, APs have also been commonly associated with
      serious metabolic adverse effects including weight gain and Type 2 Diabetes, with younger
      populations disproportionately affected. In addition, young individuals treated with these
      agents have also been found to be at high risk for glucose dysregulation, including higher
      rates of prediabetes, with significant associations found between AP use and insulin
      resistance. Due to the concerning prevalence of these AP metabolic effects, it becomes
      important to further elucidate the mechanisms underlying AP effects on glucose metabolism,
      which are still poorly understood. One potential underlying mechanism is insulin which has
      been found to regulate hepatic (liver) glucose production through insulin receptors in the
      brain. These insulin receptors also play a role in neuronal growth and memory, or more
      broadly, cognition. Preliminary data in rat models has demonstrated that the AP olanzapine
      (OLA) inhibits the ability of a central insulin stimulus (acting at the level of the brain)
      to decrease endogenous glucose production (EGP), making this mechanism a prime target to
      translate from rodent models to human research. Furthermore, intranasal insulin (INI)
      administration (an analogous central insulin stimulus) has been repeatedly associated with
      improved cognitive performance for verbal memory and visuospatial functions in humans. Given
      these findings and with the goal of translational research, the present study will
      investigate OLA's effects in healthy human volunteers including: (a) the ability of INI to
      reduce EGP during a pancreatic euglycemic clamp (PEC; a glucose metabolism and insulin
      procedure); and (b) the ability of INI to improve cognitive performance. More specifically,
      the present study hypothesizes that:

        1. INI will be associated with a decrease in EGP relative to intranasal placebo (INP) as
           measured by the PEC. This effect will be inhibited if OLA is co-administered.

        2. OLA administration will be associated with decrements in cognitive measures (i.e.,
           visuospatial, and verbal memory) as compared to placebo (PL). Additionally, OLA
           co-administration will block the beneficial effects of INI on cognition previously
           supported by other studies.

        3. INI will result in adaptive changes in neurochemical and neurohemodynamic measures as
           studied using MRI imaging techniques.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to examine whether a single dose of OLA given to young
      healthy volunteers during PECs can inhibit the activity of a central insulin stimulus (i.e,
      INI) to reduce endogenous glucose production. Secondarily, in an exploratory arm, this study
      seeks to examine whether a single dose of OLA can inhibit improvements associated with INI
      administration on specific cognitive domains (visuospatial, and verbal memory). Further, the
      study will also explore the effects of insulin and OLA on neurochemical and neurohemodynamic
      measures obtained through MRI imaging techniques.

      To accomplish these objectives, this study will have two separate and parallel arms - a
      metabolic PEC arm to study the primary hypothesis, and an MRI imaging and cognitive testing
      arm to study the two secondary hypotheses.
