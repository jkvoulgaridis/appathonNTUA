      BACKGROUND: Previous studies of short-term surgical outcomes after preoperative exposure to
      anti-TNF therapy in ulcerative colitis (UC) patients who have undergone IPAA have been
      conflicting. We sought to determine whether preoperative exposure to anti-TNF therapy affects
      histological measures of fibrosis in the colorectum, which may be a potential factor in
      adverse anastomosis complications following IPAA surgery.

      METHODS: Individuals who received infliximab as maintenance therapy and who received their
      last dose within 180 days of the first stage of IPAA were selected. The control group
      comprised UC patients who were not exposed to anti-TNF therapy, matched by age, sex, BMI,
      disease duration, albumin levels, and post-operative leak outcome. Hematoxylin and eosin-
      (H&amp;E) and trichrome-stained slides from the most distal, well-oriented, full-thickness
      section of colorectum from each patient's total colectomy specimen were evaluated. Blinded
      assessment of the degree of fibrosis in the lamina propria, the submucosa, the submucosa
      immediately adjacent to the muscularis propria, and the subserosa was performed by a single
      observer using a semi-quantitative pictorial scale.
