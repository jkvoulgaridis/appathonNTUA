  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the impact of video communication via telemedicine on the quality of
      emergency care provided to children by paramedic teams supported by a remote physician in a
      simulated out-of-hospital setting. Half of the paramedic teams will use a video telemedicine
      platform for communication with a physician, while the other half will use an audio-only
      platform.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the United States, the current standard of pre-hospital (out-of-hospital) emergency care
      for children with life-threatening illnesses in the community includes remote physician
      medical direction for paramedics providing life-saving therapies while transporting the child
      to the hospital. Most pre-hospital emergency medical service (EMS) agencies use radios
      systems for audio communication between paramedics and physicians. This communication
      strategy is inherently limited as the remote physician cannot visualize the patient for
      accurate assessment and to direct treatment.

      The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate whether use of a 2-way audiovisual connection
      with a pediatric emergency medicine expert (intervention = &quot;telemedical support&quot;) will
      improve the quality of care provided by paramedics to infant simulator mannequins with
      life-threatening illnesses. Paramedics receiving real-time telemedical support by a pediatric
      expert may provide better care due to decreased cognitive burden, critical action checking,
      protocol verification, and error correction.

      Because real pediatric life-threatening illnesses are rare, high-stakes events and involve a
      vulnerable population (children), this pilot randomized control trial will provide early data
      on the efficacy of this intervention in simulated cases of pediatric medical emergencies. The
      primary outcome is &quot;paramedic resuscitation performance&quot; measured by a checklist of
      observable critical actions by independent reviewers during live observation and video
      review. The results of this study will provide important pilot data to estimate the clinical
      effect of this intervention and the sample size needed for a future definitive trial with
      children, a vulnerable population.

    <measure>Paramedic Team Performance score</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>The paramedic team performance score is generated from a 64-item checklist of observable actions for pediatric assessment and resuscitation that are scored dichotomously (observed/not observed). The composite performance score is calculated as the number of observed actions divided by the total number of expected actions per case, and reported as a percentage of completed observed actions. This checklist is validated for simulation-based assessment of paramedic performance using three simulated cases of pediatric pre-hospital emergencies. Paramedic team performance will be rated by 1 live and 2 video raters. The final performance score for each team will be reported as an average score for all three raters.</description>

    <measure>NASA Task load Index</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>This is an extensively validated measure of perceived workload of individuals. It is a multidimensional scale where individuals estimate workload during or after completing a task. It contains 7 domains (mental demand, physical demand, temporal demand, performance, effort, frustration, and anxiety) which are evaluated on a 20-point Likert scale. Study participants will complete this questionnaire immediately after completing the simulation modules.</description>

    <measure>Telemedicine Platform Usability</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>This 14-item questionnaire is a validated measure of all the usability of telehealth platforms (usefulness, ease of use, effectiveness, reliability, and satisfaction). The investigators modified this questionnaire to specifically address the usability of a prehospital telemedicine platform. Study participants will complete this questionnaire immediately after completing the simulation modules.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Error in medication choice</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>This will be any incorrect type of medication utilized by a team during each simulation resuscitation. This includes unanticipated medication choices which the study raters feel was not indicated or potentially harmful by consensus opinion. This data is collected in the paramedic performance checklist.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Error in weight-based medication dosing</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>

    <description>The mobile, HIPAA-compliant, video-conferencing platform, Zoom Pro, will be used on tablet computers as a low-cost telemedicine platform for the intervention group. This platform uses Wi-Fi or cellular data connection for video streaming. The investigators will use the telephone communication on this platform for control scenarios, to mimic the current standard for audio-only consultation. A web-based software platform (WireCastÂ®) will capture video recordings over a secure wireless network.</description>
