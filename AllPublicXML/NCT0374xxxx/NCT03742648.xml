      The purpose of the study was to find out the effectiveness of the Deep Breathing Exercises
      and Incentive Spirometry in Second degree inhalation Burn patients and to find out best
      effective method.It was a Randomized Control Trial performed on the patients of Pakistan
      Institute of Management Sciences hospital Islamabad for duration of 06 months after approval
      of synopsis.30 patients of second degree inhalation burns between the age of 20-50 years
      having good pre burn respiratory state and irrespective of gender discrimination who were
      currently on nasal cannula were randomly allocated in control and experimental groups.However
      all unconscious patients other than second degree inhalation burn and having comorbidities
      were excluded. The conventional treatment with steam inhalation and nebulization followed by
      Incentive spirometry with 10-15cycles and the treatment session lasts for 35-45 minutes for a
      period of 07 days with two sessions of this protocol were given to control group each day.For
      experimental group patients were made to perform different types of deep breathing exercises
      with 5-10 repetitions for a period of 07days with two sessions of this treatment protocol
      each day. Self structured questionnaires with informed consents were used to assess the data
      on day 00 and day 07 by Physiotherapist.The data was then analyzed using SPSS version
      21.0.The results were then formulated using statistical analysis and then were arranged in
      different tables and graphs.

      Objective: To find out the effectiveness of the Deep Breathing Exercises and Incentive
      Spirometry in Second degree inhalation Burn patients and to find out best effective method.

      Study Design:It is a Randomized Control Trial. Place and Duration of Study: Data was
      collected from Department of Burn, Pakistan Institute of Management Sciences hospital
      Islamabad, the study duration is 06 months after approval of synopsis.

      Methodology: A total of 30 Second degree inhalation burn patients were included. Inclusion
      criteria includes both genders of patients between the ages of 20 to 50 years,with good
      Pre-Burn respiratory state and currently on Nasal Cannula.They were then randomly allocated
      using lottery method in control and experimental groups. Exclusion criteria includes all
      unconscious patients other than second degree inhalation burn and with other
      comorbidities.The treatment protocol designed for control group involves conventional
      treatment with steam inhalation and nebulization followed by Incentive spirometry with 10-15
      cycles,the treatment session lasts for 35-45 minutes for a period of 07 days with two
      sessions of this protocol each day.The treatment protocol for experimental group includes
      different types of deep breathing exercises with 5-10 repetitions for a period of 07days with
      two sessions of this treatment protocol each day.The data was collected through
      self-structured questionnaires containing 17 questions and each question has four
      options.Baseline data was collected on Day 00 and then on Day 07 data was recollected for
      comparison of both groups by Physiotherapist.
