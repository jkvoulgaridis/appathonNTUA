  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, the guideline recommended re-perfusion such as intravenous thrombolysis and
      mechanical thrombectomy as the most effective treatment for acute ischemic stroke. However,
      the two methods are restricted by a strict time window, which greatly limits the number of
      the patients receiving treatment. The abundant studies have suggested that good collateral
      circulation can provide compensatory blood supply to save the ischemic penumbra and reduces
      the infarct volume, which improves the prognosis. How to improve collateral circulation in an
      efficient and safe way is a clinical challenge. Our recent experiment results of the animal
      and preliminary clinical experiments show that head-down position may significantly increase
      cerebral perfusion and improve neurological function. Clinically, head-down position is
      simple and easy to operate, and theoretically may increases brain perfusion and improve
      collateral circulation. A pilot randomized clinical trial is designed to investigate the
      effect of head-down position combined with routine rehabilitation in patients with ischemic
      stroke.The study is designed to explore the efficacy and safety of head-down position in
      patients with acute ischemic stroke

    <description>the head position of subjects is lowered to 20 degrees in a supine position between 8:00-22:00 within 24h post-randomization as long as possible. During the procedure, when subjects feel intolerable, the head position will be elevated to lying flat (0 degree) for 5-10min, and then the above procedure is repeated. After 24h post-randomization, the head down procedures with -20 degrees in a supine position with duration of 1-1.5 hour will be performed three times daily at 9:00-11:00, 15:00-17:00 and 20:00-22:00, respectively.</description>
