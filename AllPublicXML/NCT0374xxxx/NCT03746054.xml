  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to the French National Cancer Institute, 35 000 new hematologic cancers are
      observed in France representing 10% of the new cancers. Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) is a
      cancer involving the bone marrow and blood cells, the median age at diagnosis is 53 years in
      the Western world. The prognosis is worse than many other cancers with net survival at 5
      years of 26%.

      Since the approval of imatinib, additional tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been
      approved by the European Medicine Agency, including the second-generation TKIs nilotinib,
      dasatinib, and bosutinib and the third-generation TKI ponatinib. Despite their effect on the
      evolution of CML, there is increasing of cardiovascular toxicities which can impact patient
      morbidity and mortality. The majority of the cardiovascular toxicities are associated with
      the second- and third-generation TKIs. Nilotinib and ponatinib cardiovascular toxicity
      including arterial and venous thromboembolism has decrease the benefit/risk ratio, 10% of
      patients treated with nilotinib 300 mg twice daily and 15.9% treated with 400 mg twice daily
      experienced a vascular complication including myocardial infarction /ischemic heart disease,
      cerebrovascular accidents, or peripheral arterial disease. Regarding ponatinib, serious
      arterial occlusive adverse reactions occurred in 19% of patients.

      In an attempt to reduce major adverse cardiovascular events MACE due to nilotinib and
      ponatinib, currently, then approach is driven by usual clinical practice without any robust
      published evidence. The investigators aim to perform a national clinical trial, multicenter,
      prospective, randomized, with two parallel comparative arms: experimental group with
      cardiovascular active prevention vs non active cardiovascular active prevention based on
      usual clinical practice. Our hypothesis is that active prevention of cardiovascular
      toxicities with optimal medical treatment improves the benefit-risk ratio in CML patients.
      The primary objective is Event Free Survival (EFS) at month 24.

      At admission eligible patients are proposed to participate. Written consent is signed after
      complete oral and written explanation of the protocol is signed.

      The efficacity of the cardiovascular active prevention will be studied by comparing the rate
      of Event free Survival between patients in the Experimental Arm Versus usual Clinical
      practices

      The duration of participation for a subject is equal to 2 years
