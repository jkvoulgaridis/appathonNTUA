  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well pemetrexed and avelumab work in treating patients with
      MTAP-deficient urothelial cancer that has spread to other places in the body. Pemetrexed may
      stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.
      Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as avelumab, may help the body's immune system
      attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.
      Giving pemetrexed and avelumab may work better in treating patients with MTAP-deficient
      urothelial cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the response rate (RR) in patients with (methylthioadenosine phosphorylase)
      MTAP-deficient metastatic urothelial cancer treated sequentially with pemetrexed and
      avelumab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with
      MTAP-deficient metastatic urothelial cancer treated sequentially with pemetrexed and
      avelumab.

      II. To explore the effect of pemetrexed +/- avelumab on the immune system and tumor
      microenvironment including peripheral T-cells, tumor-infiltrating T-cells, macrophages, and
      myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pemetrexed intravenously (IV) over 10 minutes on day 1. Starting cycle 2,
      patients also receive avelumab IV over 60 minutes. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 and 120 days, and then
      every 3 months for 2 years.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologic confirmation of MTAP-deficient metastatic urothelial
             carcinoma. MTAP-deficiency must be verified by institutional Clinical Laboratory
             Improvement Act (CLIA)-certified immunohistochemistry (IHC). Histological variants
             such as glandular, squamous, sarcomatoid, micropapillary, plasmacytoid, and small cell
             changes will be allowed for this trial if these tumors are MTAP-deficient.

          -  Patients can be considered for second line of therapy (after chemotherapy or immune
             checkpoint inhibitor with PD-[L]1 agent) or for third line of therapy (can have
             previously received chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitor with PD-[L]1
             blockade). Any prior intravesical therapy is allowed and does not count as a prior
             line of therapy.

          -  Patients who received methotrexate-containing chemotherapy (e.g.
             methotrexate/vinblastine/adriamycin/cisplatin [MVAC]) as neoadjuvant therapy or
             first-line systemic therapy at least 12 months prior will be allowed for this trial.

          -  All patients must have measurable disease by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
             Tumors (RECIST) version (v)1.1 and tumors of sufficient sizes for biopsy. In general,

             disease should have lesions of &gt;= 1.5 cm in shortest dimension. Patients with disease
             confined to bone may be eligible if a measurable lytic defect is present. The study
             principal investigator (PI) is the final arbiter in questions related to
             measurability. Patients with a three-dimensional mass or pelvic sidewall fixation on
             bladder examination under anesthesia are considered to have measurable disease.

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) =&lt; 2.5 x upper
             limit of normal (ULN), or =&lt; 5 ULN if documented liver metastases are present.

          -  Total bilirubin =&lt; 1.5 x ULN, except subjects with Gilbert's syndrome or liver
             metastases, who must have a baseline total bilirubin =&lt; 3.0 mg/dL.

             from the National Kidney Disease Education Program (NKDEP) (the method reported by MD
             Anderson Cancer Center [MDACC] laboratories).

          -  Negative serum or urine pregnancy test at screening for women of child-bearing
             potential.

          -  Females of childbearing potential who are sexually active with a non-sterilized male
             partner and non-sterilized males must use a highly effective method of contraception
             for 28 days prior to the first dose of investigational product, and must agree to
             continue using such precautions for 180 days after the final dose of investigational
             product; cessation of contraception after this point should be discussed with a
             responsible physician. They must also refrain from egg cell donation for 180 days
             after the final dose of investigational product.

          -  Non-sterilized males who are sexually active with a female partner of childbearing
             potential must use a highly effective method of contraception from days 1 through 180
             post last dose. In addition, they must refrain from sperm donation for 180 days after
             the final dose of investigational product.

          -  The ability to interrupt nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) 2 days before
             (5 days for long-acting NSAIDs), the day of, and 2 days following administration of
             pemetrexed.

          -  The ability to take folic acid, vitamin B12, and dexamethasone according to protocol.

          -  Mild autoimmune conditions (such as localized psoriasis) requiring minimal treatment
             or systemic autoimmune conditions well controlled by target agents such as an
             anti-IL-17 that do not affect overall immune system. Patients with a history of
             Hashimoto's thyroiditis only requiring hormone replacement, type I diabetes, or
             conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger are allowed to

          -  Primary central nervous system (CNS) malignancies or CNS metastases, including
             leptomeningeal metastases, are not allowed. Subjects with previously treated brain

          -  Presence of third space fluid which cannot be controlled by drainage. For patients who
             develop or have baseline clinically significant pleural or peritoneal effusions (on
             the basis of symptoms or clinical examination) before or during initiation of
             pemetrexed therapy, consideration should be given to draining the effusion prior to
             dosing. However, if, in the investigator's opinion, the effusion represents
             progression of disease, the patient should be discontinued from study therapy.

          -  Known or suspected autoimmune disease. Patients with a history of inflammatory bowel
             disease (including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) and autoimmune disorders

             acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, current pneumonitis, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina
             pectoris, symptomatic cardiac arrhythmia, or interstitial lung disease.

          -  Clinically significant (i.e., active) cardiovascular disease: cerebral vascular

             risk based on investigator's judgment are acceptable.

          -  Uncontrolled psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements or compromise the ability of the subject to give written informed
             consent.

          -  Known allergy or hypersensitivity to study drug formulations.

          -  Major surgical procedure (as defined by the PI or co-PIs within 28 days prior to the
