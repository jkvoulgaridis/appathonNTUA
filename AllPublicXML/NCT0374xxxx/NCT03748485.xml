  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adjuvant chemotherapy was unnecessary in pathological stage Ⅱ colorectal cancer following
      initial treatment of surgery without high risk factors of recurrences. The treatment efficacy
      of adjuvant chemotherapy for pT1-3N0M0 colorectal cancer following preoperational
      chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy remains unclear. Part of clinical local advanced colorectal
      cancer(cTxN1-2M0), which turn out to be pT0-3N0M0 after preoperational chemotherapy or
      chemoradiotherapy, might not really need adjuvant chemotherapy due to the down-stage efficacy
      of the preoperational treatments, or the misleading by lymph nodes false-positive imaging
      diagnosis.

    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer(CRC) nowadays rank the 3rd incidence and the 4th mortality in all cancers
      worldwide(ref). Although the coloscopy or liquid biopsy screen has improved the early
      diagnosis of CRC, about 26.5-36.0% of the patients were diagnosed local advanced CRC at the
      first visit. Part of clinical local advanced colorectal cancer(cTxN1-2M0), which turn out to
      be pT1-3N0M0 after preoperational chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy, might not really need
      adjuvant chemotherapy due to the down-stage efficacy of the preoperational treatments, or the
      misleading by lymph nodes false-positive imaging diagnosis. Adjuvant chemotherapy was been
      admitted unnecessary in the pathological stage ⅡA (pT0-3N0M0) CRC following initial treatment
      of surgery without high risk factors of recurrences. The treatment efficacy of adjuvant
      chemotherapy for pT1-3N0M0 CRC following preoperational chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy
      remains unclear. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy/safety of adjuvant
      chemotherapy in clinical local advanced CRC (cTxN1/2M0) following preoperational adjuvant
      therapies and pathologically proved pT0-3N0M0 CRC. Patients are randomized to control
      group(down-staged pT0-3N0M0 CRC with 6 to 8 periods adjuvant chemotherapy) and experimental
      group(watch group, down-staged pT0-3N0M0 CRC without adjuvant chemotherapy). The primary
      endpoint is the 3-years disease-free survival after surgery. Secondary endpoints evaluate
      long-term clinical outcomes, in particular overall survival and side effect of chemotherapy.
