  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to test I-PLAN as a self-management tool to promote hearing
      aid use and benefit (measured by self-reported questionnaires and hearing aid data-logging)
      among new adult hearing aid patients via a randomised controlled trial compared to treatment
      as usual. We hypothesized that the I-PLAN will increase hearing aid use and reduce
      self-reported hearing difficulty via promoting hearing aid use habits and self-regulation
      with respect to hearing aid use.

      The aim of the present study is to test I-PLAN, an intervention designed to promote hearing
      aid use among adult hearing aid patients, for the first time. I-PLAN is the first
      intervention in audiology that has been developed using the behaviour change wheel. It
      consists of three components; i) provision of written information regarding consequences of
      using a hearing aid and not using a hearing aid, ii) the provision of a physical prompt for
      the purpose of prompting or cueing the behavior (hearing aid use) development, and iii)
      creation of a written behavioural plan for hearing aid use.
