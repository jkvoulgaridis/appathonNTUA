  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aortic valve stenosis is the most common valvular heart disease in the developed world,
      affecting 3,9% of population over 70 years of age. If untreated it carries a poor prognosis,
      leading to heart failure and death in 2 years after first symptom presentation. Treatment of
      choice for severe aortic stenosis is surgical aortic valve replacement. A new treatment
      option for severe aortic stenosis emerged in the last decade - Transcatheter Aortic Valve
      Replacement (TAVR). This minimally invasive method was formerly reserved for high risk
      patients deemed unfit for surgical aortic valve replacement. Increasing use throughout the
      developed world and recent studies have established TAVR as a safe and viable treatment
      option also for intermediate-risk patients. TAVR not only enables a less aggressive surgical
      approach, but also a less invasive type of anaesthesia. Anaesthesiologists are trying to
      modify the type of anaesthesia in the way of minimally invasive approach, aiming to improve
      the overall outcome.

      TAVR can be performed under general anaesthesia or conscious sedation (CS). From the start,
      TAVR was performed solely under general anaesthesia. Over time the procedure became routine
      and the anaesthesiologists started to commonly decide for CS. Many US and European
      retrospective studies have established CS to be a safe and compelling method of anaesthetic
      care for TAVR procedures with a favorable perioperative course, less complications, shorter
      intensive care unit and in-hospital stay and lower early mortality, when performed by an
      experienced anaesthesia team. There are many anaesthesia agents currently accepted for CS in
      everyday anaesthesia practice. Presently, reliable data from studies comparing different
      agents for CS for TAVR procedures is scarce. Most of it comes from retrospective
      nonrandomized trials. Propofol is a popular anaesthetic agent for CS. According to current
      studies, it is a safe anaesthetic agent with favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
      profiles with quite low incidence of side effects. In recent years, dexmedetomidine has been
      commonly used for CS having analgesic properties inclusive of its anaesthetic properties. In
      addition, dexmedetomidine is associated with a lesser degree of respiratory depression as to
      other anaesthetic agents. Patient comfort is also believed to be improved with
      dexmedetomidine. Studies comparing outcomes of CS with propofol versus dexmedetomidine for
      different non-cardiac and interventional procedures showed benefits of dexmedetomidine, owing
      to its analgesic properties and preferable respiratory parameters.

      The aim of this study is to compare the outcome of patients undergoing TAVR under CS with
      dexmedetomidine against those undergoing TAVR under CS with propofol. With the results the
      investigators aim to aid in defining the optimal anaesthetic agent for CS for TAVR and
      possibly other interventional cardiology procedures.
