  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Persistent fecal incontinence (FI) after anorectal malformations (ARM) is a common occurence.
      During the last two decades perianal injection therapy has emerged as an option for treating
      patients with FI due to other causes than ARMs. The studies done on different implants have
      always expempted patients with ARM which has led to ARM being a formal contraindication for
      treatment with perianal injection therapy.

      The study aims to treat patients with persistent FI after ARM with perianal injection of
      NASHA/Dx (Solesta®) and follow them with Clinical examination and questionnaires up to 18
      months post treatment.

    <measure>Miller´s incontinence score</measure>
