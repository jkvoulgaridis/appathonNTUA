  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fertility Preservation is now considered as crucial for the well-being of women battling
      cancer. However, others indications have more recently emerged. Women with endometriosis may
      represent a suitable group since they are at risk for compromise ovarian reserve. Data on FP
      in endometriosis patients are rare: only small retrospective study, case-reports and opinion
      publications .Nowadays, there is no available data concerning real indications for PF on
      endometriosis patients (endometriomas, risk of surgery, deep endometriosis?), criteria for
      eligibility (ovarian reserve parameters, age), quality of oocytes and number of oocytes
      necessary to give at least one live birth.

      We propose a monocentric observational cohort study, evaluating the efficacy of oocytes
      cryopreservation as fertility preservation procedure, in young adult female subjects with
      endometriosis, to finally define the criteria of eligibility for PF procedures in case of
      endometriosis.

    <textblock>
      Monocentric observational cohort study, enrolling young patients with endometriosis, without
      birth project for the moment, and asking for fertility preservation, in order to preserve
      mature oocytes.

      Protocol of this study :

        -  information and signatures of consent file ;

        -  ovarian stimulation, oocytes retrieval and mature oocytes cryopreservation (one or more
           procedures)

        -  questionnaires every year, describing quality of life in this context of endometriosis
           and evolution (treatment, surgery, ART, pregnancies)

        -  data about number and rate of thawed oocytes after preservation, pregnancy rate and live
           birth rate with these oocytes.
