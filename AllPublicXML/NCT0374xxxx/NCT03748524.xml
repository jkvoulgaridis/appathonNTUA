        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Able to understand and give informed consent

          2. Capable of attending all study visits according to the study schedule.

          3. Males or females between the ages of 18 to 50 (inclusive).

          4. Are in good health, as determined by medical history and targeted physical exam
             related to this history.

          5. Participants agree not to take any vaccines in the first 60 days after receipt of the
             influenza vaccine

          6. The following laboratory values obtained within 14 days prior to entry..

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥750 cells/mm3

               -  Hemoglobin ≥11.0 g/dL for men and ≥10.0 g/dL for women

               -  Platelet count ≥100,000/mm3

               -  Creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min estimated by the Cockcroft-Gault equation

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (SGPT) ≤5.0
                  times upper limit of normal (ULN)

          7. Willing to:

               -  give FNA specimens for the study. (even if he/she are not willing to give bone
                  marrow aspirates (for any reason), they can be enrolled)

               -  give bone marrow aspirates, but we cannot locate axillary lymph nodes

               -  give both FNA and BMA specimens

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1. History influenza vaccination for the last three years.

             2. Coagulopathy (primary or iatrogenic) which would contraindicate FNA

             3. Any history of allergy to eggs, chicken or gelatin or to any previous influenza
             vaccine

             4. Have an acute illness within 72 hours before vaccination.

             5. A history of a medical condition resulting in impaired immunity (such as HIV
             infection, cancer, particularly leukemia, lymphoma, use of immunosuppressive or
             antineoplastic drugs or X-ray treatment). Persons with previous skin cancers or cured
             non-lymphatic tumors are not excluded from the study.

             6. History of HIV infection, Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C infection

             7. History of any chronic medical conditions that are considered progressive (ex,
             diabetes, heart disease, lung disease, liver disease, kidney disease, gastrointestinal
             diseases and uncontrolled hypertension).

             8. History of excessive alcohol consumption, drug abuse, psychiatric conditions,
             social conditions or occupational conditions that in the opinion of the investigator
             would preclude compliance with the study.

             9. Have taken oral or parenteral corticosteroids of any dose within 30 days before
             study vaccination.

             10. Have taken high-dose inhaled corticosteroids within 30 days before study
             vaccination.

             11. Autoimmune disorders; mild autoimmune disorders such as eczema is not exclusion
             after assessment by the investigator.

             12. Recipient of a blood products or immune globulin product within 42 days of the
             vaccination visit.

             13. Pregnant women and nursing mothers or women who are planning to become pregnant
             for the study duration.

             14. Have received any licensed live vaccine within 30 days or any licensed inactivated
             vaccine within 14 days prior to study vaccination.

             15. Have planned vaccination with any vaccine during first 60 days of study
             participation.

             16. Have received immunoglobulin or other blood products, with the exception of Rho D
             immunoglobulin, within 90 days prior to study vaccination.

             17. Have donated blood or blood products within 30 days before study vaccination, plan
             to donate blood at any time during the duration of subject study participation, or
             plan to donate blood within 30 days after the last blood draw.

             18. Any condition in the opinion of the investigator that would interfere with the
             proper conduct of the trial.
