      Incidence of Postoperative Orthostatic Intolerance and Postoperative Orthostatic Hypotension
      in Patients Undergoing Unilateral Total Knee Arthroplasty

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Early postoperative mobilization is a cornerstone in the so-called fast track multimodal
      perioperative approach and is essential in preventing postoperative morbidity and reducing
      hospital length-of-stay. Intact orthostatic blood pressure regulation is essential for early
      postoperative mobilization. However, early postoperative mobilization can be delayed due to
      postoperative orthostatic hypotension (POH) defined as a fall in systolic pressure &gt; 20 mmHg
      and/or diastolic pressure &gt; 10 mmHg or due to postoperative orthostatic intolerance (POI),
      characterized by dizziness, nausea, vomiting, blurred vision or syncope during mobilization.

      Previous prospective studies of major surgery have reported that OI and OH are common problem
      during early postoperative mobilization, with a prevalence of 42-50%. Retrospective studies
      with a less-defined mobilization protocols have reported am OI prevalence in the range of
      12-60 % across surgical procedures.

      The aim of our study is to determine the incidence of OI during early postoperative
      mobilization in fast track unilateral total knee arthroplasty.
