  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eosinophils (EOS) in peripheral blood are significantly decreased in ST-segment elevation
      myocardial infarction (STEMI) and the reduced EOS indicates severe myocardial damage. Whether
      EOS is a good predictor for in-hospital major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) of patients with
      ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction remains unknown. The aims of this study was to
      evaluate prognostic role of EOS for in-hospital MACEs in STEMI patients who have undergone
      primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)

    <textblock>
      The investigators retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 518 patients with STEMI after
      PCI. MACEs were defined as cardiac arrest, cardiac rapture, malignant arrhythmia and cardiac
      death. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to demonstrate the
      prognostic value of EOS% in in-hospital MACEs. All patients were divided into 2 groups
      according to the best cut-off EOS% value, including reduced EOS% group and control group. Cox
      regression analyses and KM survival curve were used to calculate the correlated between EOS
      with in-hospital MACEs.
