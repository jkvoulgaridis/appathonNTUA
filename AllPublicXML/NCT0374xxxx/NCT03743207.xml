  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Feeding intolerance is frequent among preterm infants in neonatal intensive care units
      (NICUs). Although there are many studies about enteral nutrition strategies and content in
      preterm infants, no evidence-based standards exist for the optimal milk temperature for
      preterm infants. Therefore, in this study the investigators aimed to examine the effects of
      feeding temperature and the possible morbidities.

      Feeding intolerance is one of the most frequent problems among preterm infants. These infants
      are fed with expressed breast milk or preterm formulas of which the temperature is not
      routinely measured. In this study, the investigators aimed to examine the effects of feeds
      with warm versus room temperature milk in preterm infants. Infants with a birth weight of
      ≤1500 g or gestational age of ≤ 34 weeks were included in the study and assigned to two
      different feeding temperature groups (22-24°C and 32-34°C). Some infants in both groups were
      exclusive breast milk fed and some received artificial milk. Feeding tolerance of patients in
      both groups and the consequences were evaluated.

    <description>Fifteen NICU mothers volunteered and expressed their milk for rapid measurement of freshly expressed breast milk. The mean (± SD) temperature of freshly expressed breast milk was found to be 33±1.5 °C in these preliminary measurements. Confirming this finding, the investigators decided to feed these infants with milk at 32 - 34 °C to examine the effects of feeding temperature and the possible comorbidities with a hypothesis that warmer feeding at the temperature of freshly expressed breast milk may be better physiologically.</description>
