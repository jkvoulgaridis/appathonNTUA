  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine whether administering metolazone 60 minutes prior to
      furosemide increases urine output compared with administering metolazone and furosemide
      concomitantly. Participants will have equal chance of being assigned to each group.

    <textblock>
      Diuretic resistance is common among patients with acute decompensated heart failure, and one
      strategy for overcoming this phenomenon is sequential nephron blockade with loop plus
      thiazide-type diuretics. Metolazone is an oral thiazide-type diuretic commonly used for this
      purpose. Due to its delayed absorption, some clinicians suggest that metolazone be given
      30-60 minutes prior to the loop diuretic. However, the efficacy and safety of such a strategy
      has not been investigated despite its added complexity. The purpose of this study is to
      investigate whether pre-dosing with metolazone confers a difference in efficacy and safety
      compared to administering it at the same time as furosemide.
