      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate a new investigational drug, TAK-659, given
      in combination with standard chemotherapy, for the treatment of Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma
      (DLBCL). ?Investigational? means that TAK-659 has not been approved by the United States Food
      and Drug Administration (FDA) for use as a prescription or over-the-counter medication to
      treat a certain condition. The primary purpose of this study is to find the appropriate and
      safe dose of the study drug to be used in combination with standard chemotherapy for the
      treatment of your disease and to determine how well the drug works in treating the disease.
      Other objectives include measuring the amount of the study drug in the body at different
      times after taking the study drug.

      Participation in the study is expected to last for up to 3 years after receiving the last
      dose of the study drug. Patients will receive the study treatment for up to 18 weeks, as long
      as they are benefitting.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety, tolerability, and maximum tolerated dose of TAK-659 when combined
      with R-CHOP in the front-line treatment of high-risk diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess preliminary efficacy of TAK-659 combined with R-CHOP in the front-line treatment
      of high-risk DLBCL.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of TAK-659 in combination with R-CHOP.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of spleen tyrosine kinase inhibitor TAK-659.

      Patients receive rituximab intravenously (IV), cyclophosphamide IV, doxorubicin hydrochloride
      IV over 3-5 minutes, and vincristine sulfate IV on day 1, and prednisone orally (PO) on days
      1-5. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning in course 2, patients also receive spleen
      tyrosine kinase inhibitor TAK-659 PO once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 21
      days for up to 5 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for up to 3
      years.
