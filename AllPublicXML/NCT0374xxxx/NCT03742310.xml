      This study was used to determine the relationship between vitamin D receptor gene
      polymorphism and children's physical and intellectual development, further adjust the doses
      of vitamin D supplementation after birth, and provide individualized vitamin D and calcium
      supplements.

      High risk children aged 0-3 years old who visited the pediatrics clinic and ward of the first
      affiliated hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong university and other cooperative hospitals from 2018 to
      2020 were randomly selected. Personal information of the children and parents who were
      enrollment was collected by questionnaire survey and a follow-up file was established. 500 to
      1,000 people are planned to participate in the study, were randomly divided into research
      group and the control group. Then collect the sample(saliva) of children to examine Vitamin D
      Receptor(VDR) genotype, according to results, divide the research group into high, medium and
      low risk, given individual vitamin D and calcium supplement. Monitor the children's weight,
      body length, head circumference, the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale(NBAS), bailey
      rating scale respectively, up to 3 years old. All sample analyses were performed by the Gene
      Medical Laboratory. Laboratory personnel were blinded to mother and infant outcomes.
