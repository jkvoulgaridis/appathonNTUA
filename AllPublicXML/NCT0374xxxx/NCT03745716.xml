      A Phase III, multicenter, randomized study to compare the rate of CR and duration of CR, in
      patients with TP53-mutated MDS who will receive APR-246 and azacitidine or azacitidine alone.

      Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis. No investigational or commercial
      agents or therapies other than those described below may be administered with the intent to
      treat the patient's disease.

      Patients will be randomized (1:1) to one of two arms:

        1. Experimental arm: APR-246 + azacitidine; or

          -  Age ≥18 years at the time of signing the informed consent form (ICF)

          -  Having at least one TP53 mutation which is not benign or likely benign

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of 0, 1, or 2

          -  If of childbearing potential, negative pre-treatment urine or serum pregnancy test

          -  If of childbearing potential (males and females), willing to use an effective form of

             thereafter

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has a known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or active hepatitis
             B or active hepatitis C infection (testing not mandatory)

               1. Myocardial infarct within six months prior to registration,

               2. New York Heart Association Class II or worse heart failure (Appendix II) or known
                  left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; the institution lower limit of normal

               3. A history of familial long QT syndrome,

               4. Clinically significant pericardial disease

          -  Concomitant malignancies or previous malignancies with less than a 1-year disease free

             squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or adequately resected carcinoma in situ (e.g.
             cervix) may enroll irrespective of the time of diagnosis

          -  Prior exposure to azacitidine, decitabine or investigational hypomethylating agent

          -  Prior exposure to intensive chemotherapy

          -  Use of cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents, or experimental agents (agents that are not
             commercially available) for the treatment of MDS within 14 days of the first day of
             study drug treatment

          -  No concurrent use of erythroid stimulating agents

          -  Patients with history of allogeneic stem cell transplantation

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because APR-246 has not been studied in
             pregnant patients. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events
             in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with APR 246, breastfeeding
             should be discontinued if the mother is treated with APR-246.

          -  Patients with active uncontrolled infections
