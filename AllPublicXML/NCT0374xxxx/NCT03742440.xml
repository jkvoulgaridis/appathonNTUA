  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to evaluate healing in a cohort of patients with chronic wounds (n=40)
      that receive optimal treatment including serial wound debridement and off-loading with total
      contact casts or a boot and GrafixPL PRIME. In addition, the investigators will collect data
      on other potential confounding factors that could affect healing such as medications,
      tobacco, nutrition, comorbidities, diabetes control, infection, perfusion, and activity.
      Wound healing, including wound size and adverse events will be evaluated. The objective of
      this study is to understand the use of this product to evaluate wound healing in 40 patients.
