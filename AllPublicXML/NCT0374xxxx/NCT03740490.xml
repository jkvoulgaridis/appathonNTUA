  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Smoking is becoming increasingly concentrated among individuals with the lowest levels of
      income, education, and occupational status. In fact, smoking rates in the United States among
      people living below the poverty line is nearly twice as high as those above the poverty
      threshold. Highly flexible and low burden technology-based treatment approaches may overcome
      many of the barriers that have limited the use and effectiveness of traditional smoking
      cessation treatments among low socioeconomic status (SES) adults. Ecological momentary
      assessment (EMA), in which mobile devices are used to capture moment-to-moment experiences,
      allows for the measurement of phenomena in real-time within natural settings.
      Smartphone-based smoking cessation apps could offer easily accessible, highly tailored, and
      intensive interventions at a fraction of the cost of traditional smoking cessation
      counseling. The Smart-T app uses a lapse risk estimator to identify moments of heightened
      risk for lapse, and the algorithm tailors treatment messages in real-time based upon level of
      imminent smoking lapse risk and currently present lapse triggers. This study will compare
      smoking cessation rates for those randomized to the Smart-T app or the NCI QuitGuide app.

    <description>Smart-T provides content during the pre-quit and post-quit periods to prepare and support participants during their quit attempt. The Smart-T app contains multiple components including an EMA delivery and data transfer system, automated messages based upon EMA responses, and on-demand content. All participants will receive free nicotine replacement therapy (NRT).</description>

    <description>The National Cancer Institute's QuitGuide app is a free smartphone app and is one of few apps that includes many of the recommendations detailed in the Clinical Practice Guideline. The QuitGuide app aims to help smokers understand their smoking patterns and develop the skills needed to quit smoking. QuitGuide provides content during the pre-quit and post-quit periods to prepare and support participants during their quit attempt. All participants will receive free nicotine replacement therapy (NRT).</description>
