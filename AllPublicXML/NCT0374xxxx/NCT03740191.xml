      This prospective study assess the effectiveness and safety of hypofractionated proton
      radiotherapy in the treatment of intermediate and low risk prostate cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness and safety of spot-scanning based
      hypofractionated proton radiotherapy for the treatment of intermediate and low risk prostate
      cancer. The treatment effectiveness is defined as freedom from biochemical failure. Treatment
      safety will be documented with acute and late morbidity assessments. Dose volume
      relationships for late side effects in organs at risk surrounding the prostate will be
      calculated from the dose volume histogram parameters assessed during treatment planning.
      Patient assessed Quality of life data including sexual function will be collected to increase
      our understanding how the reduction of normal tissue irradiation with proton therapy with
      subsequent decrease in functional impairments will overall affect the patient's life.

    <description>Change of quality of life and sexual function from Baseline following proton therapy. The Prostate cancer-specific Health-Related Quality of Life questionnaire Expanded Prostate Index Composite (EPIC-26) will be used. EPIC is a comprehensive instrument designed to evaluate patient function and bother after prostate cancer treatment. EPIC-26 was developed as a short-form version of the full EPIC. This version contains 26 item and the same 5 domains as the full version of EPIC: Urinary Incontinence, Urinary Irritative/Obstructive, Bowel, Sexual, and Hormonal. Response options for each EPIC item form a Likert scale, and multi-item scale scores are transformed linearly to a 0-100 scale, with higher scores representing better quality of life.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pathological (histologically) proven diagnosis of prostatic adenocarcinoma

          -  Clinical stage T1-T2b

          -  Prostate specific antigen (PSA) ≤ 20 ng/mL

          -  Gleason Score ≤ 7

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance status 0-2

          -  Clinically negative lymph nodes evaluated by imaging (pelvic +/- abdominal CT or MRI
             scan)

          -  Any patient with lymph nodes &gt; 1.0 cm maximum diameter requires further studies to
             address eligibility. Positron emission tomography (PET)-CT is recommended for lymph
             nodes &gt; 1.0 cm. Positive PET-CT indicates malignant involvement. Hence, the patient
             will be staged as &quot;high-risk&quot; and therefore declared ineligible for study
             participation. Negative PET-CT in lymph nodes 1.0-1,5 cm indicates non-involvement and
             thus eligibility. Negative PET-CT in lymph nodes &gt; 1.5 cm is equivocal and requires
             additional work-up, preferably by biopsy.

          -  Patients must be 18 years of age or older. There is no upper age limit.

          -  Patient must be able to provide study-specific informed consent prior to study entry.

          -  Willingness and ability to complete the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite
             (EPIC) Questionnaire to assess Quality of Life.

          -  Previously initiated Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) is acceptable.

          -  Patients with history of chronic bowel diseases may be included.

          -  Patients with previous Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP) performed for
             urinary retention may be included.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior radiotherapy to the pelvic area.

          -  Prior prostate cancer therapy such as: prostatectomy, cryotherapy or hyperthermia.

          -  Prior systemic therapy (chemotherapy) for prostate cancer.

          -  Concurrent cytotoxic chemotherapy for prostate cancer.

          -  Evidence of distant metastases.

          -  Regional lymph node involvement.

          -  International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) &gt; 20

          -  Hip prosthesis

          -  Second invasive malignancy (except of basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma of the
             skin in situ) if not controlled within last two years.
