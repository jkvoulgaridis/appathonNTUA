  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effect of exercising in different body positions on bone growth in osteoporotic women is
      known, but its effect on their function, low back pain, lumbar range of motion and quality of
      life remains unknown. Therefore, the investigators plan to make a comparison of the effect of
      a weight bearing protocol and a non-weight bearing protocol on osteoporotic women with
      chronic low back pain.

      40 women with osteoporosis and low back pain will be divided into two groups. Each group will
      be given a specific exercise protocol, twice a week for four weeks, 45 minutes each time. The
      participants will be tested before starting the program, immediately after finishing it and
      again two months later. The tests will include filling out the Roland Morris Disability
      Questionnaire, the SF-36 quality of life Questionnaire, pain measurement by VAS (Visual
      Analogue Scale) and lumbar range of motion measurement by a digital Inclinometer.

      Statistical analysis will be made in order to compare the dependent variables between groups.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      40 women with osteoporosis and low back pain will be recruited by referral of doctors to the
      physical therapy clinic in Bat-Yam, Israel. Each woman will be tested by one investigator
      after meeting the criteria of eligibility and after obtaining formed consent . The tests will
      include filling out the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire, the SF-36 quality of life
      Questionnaire, pain measurement by VAS and lumbar range of motion measurement by a digital
      Inclinometer. By order of appearance, each participant will be assigned to one of two groups
      - weight bearing group or non-weight bearing group. After recruiting at least 3 participants
      in each group, a different investigator will begin a specific exercise protocol for each of
      the groups for four weeks - twice a week, 45 minutes each time, a total of 8 sessions. After
      each participant finishes all 8 sessions, she will be tested for the second time by the first
      investigator, the same tests as the first time. A third identical test will be preformed two
      months after finishing the program.

      After all the participants finish the program statistical analysis will be made in order to
      compare the dependent variables between groups.
