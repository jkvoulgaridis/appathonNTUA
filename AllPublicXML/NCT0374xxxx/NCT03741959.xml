  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postural abnormalities (PA) are drug refractory complications in patients with Parkinson's
      disease (PD) leading to pain, imbalance, gait disorders and fall-related injuries. It
      ultimately affects the quality of life and the hospitalisation risk. the literature on
      treatment outcomes is scant. Rehabilitation is the cornerstone in the management of PD
      patients, especially for drug-refractory complications. However, the current efforts are only
      partially able to resolve PA in PD. Despite differences in methodologies, the few
      rehabilitative studies support the benefits of trunk rehabilitation in PD with PA. Priorities
      for future research include well-design rehabilitation studies on a large population. The
      early detection and early rehabilitation of PA might avoid fixed irreversible deformities and
      reduce the complications that can accompany them. It ultimately might improve the quality of
      life, reduce the risk of fall-related injuries and hospitalisation rate. A single-blind
      single-blind Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) will evaluate the effects of trunk
      rehabilitation on PA severity, function and disability in outpatients with Parkinson Disease
      and postural abnormalities.

      This RCT with two parallel group will be conducted according to the tenets of the Declaration
      of Helsinki, the guidelines for Good Clinical Practice, and the Consolidated Standards of
      Reporting Trials (CONSORT).

      The target population will be patients with Parkinson Disease who attend to the
      Neurorehabilitation Unit (AOUI Verona) and the Unità Operativa Complessa (UOC) Neurology ward
      (AOUI Verona) where they will be assessed for eligibility.

      Who satisfied inclusion and exclusion criteria were randomly allocated in one of two groups,
      the experimental group and control group. Each patient will undergo rehabilitation.

      Before the start of the study authors designed the experimental and the control group
      protocols. Two physiotherapists, one for each group, carried out the rehabilitation
      procedures. Patients of both groups received 10 individual sessions (60 min/session, 2
      sessions/week, five consecutive weeks). Treatments will be performed in the rehabilitative
      gym of the G.B. Rossi University Hospital Neurological Rehabilitation Unit.

      For the statistical analysis, an intention to treat analysis will be used. Descriptive
      statistics included means, standard deviation and graphs. The Shapiro-Wilk test will be used
      to test data distribution. Parametric or non-parametric tests will be used for inferential
      statistics, accordingly. The T-Test for unpaired data (or the Mann-Whitney test) will be used
      for testing between-group differences at T0 and T1. For this purpose, the changes of the
      score (Δ) between T0-T1 will be computed. The T-Test for paired data (or Wilcoxon signed rank
      tests) will be used to compare within-group changes over time. The level of significance was
      set p&lt;0.05. Software statistics SPSS 20.0 (IBM Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS)
      Statistics for Windows, Version 20.0, Armonk, NY, USA).

    <description>It is a comprehensive assessment designed to monitor the burden and the extent of Parkinson Disease across the longitudinal disease course and provides a clinical end-point in clinical trials. It consists of four sections with a total summed score. Each item have 5 response options (0=normal; 4=severe symptoms/signs). The higher= greater impact of PD symptoms.
The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale - part III (UPDRS III) subscale will be used to measure changes in the motor disability (score range, 0-33; the higher=worse symptoms).</description>

    <description>The PDQ-8 contains eight of the original 39 items of the PDQ-39; one item selected from each of the 8 scales (mobility, activities of daily living, emotional well-being, stigma, social support, cognitions, communications and bodily discomfort). It provides a reliable measure of overall health status and is ideal for studies in which a shorter questionnaire is preferred. Each question is scored from 0-4 points and the scores are summed. the summed scores are then divided by total possible score and given as a percentage score out of 100 (Score range, 32-100; the higher worse health status)</description>
