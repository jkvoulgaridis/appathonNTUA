  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Isometric exercise has been shown to increase the diameter and the blood flow rate of forearm
      veins.At present, more studies focus on the perioperative period to promote the maturation of
      arteriovenous fistula(AVF), while there are few reports on functional maintenance measures
      for the patients with maintenance hemodialysis.This study aims to explore the effect of
      dumbbell exercise on AVF，and evaluate whether patients can carry a 6-pound item with the
      fistula limb in a reasonable way.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Autologous arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is the preferred vascular access for maintenance
      hemodialysis patients. It is estimated that AVF accounts for 85-90% of the permanent vascular
      access in Chinese hemodialysis patients. With the prolongation of dialysis time, aging, and
      the increase of diabetes incidence, the complications of AVF are more and more common, which
      affect the lifetime of AVF. Therefore,self-maintenance of AVF is essential. Among them,
      exercise should be used throughout the entire process of AVF use for the reason that it is
      economical, easy to operate, and highly repeatable.The most common isometric exercise is
      handgrip exercise. However, there are some deficiencies in this exercise, such as lack of
      quantitative standards and burnout of repeated actions. As a result, this study uses
      quantitative dumbbells as a training tool to explore the effect of dumbbell exercise on the
      maintenance of AVF, and further evaluates and breaks the nursing routine of &quot;no lifting
      weights&quot; of fistula limb.
