  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators have designed a pilot study involving chronic hand dermatitis (CHD) patients
      who attend the dermatology clinic at the George Washington Medical Faculty Associates (GW
      MFA) in order to assess the efficacy and safety of apremilast treatment for the treatment of
      moderate to severe CHD.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hand dermatitis is one of the most common skin disorders encountered by dermatologists.
      Chronic hand dermatitis (CHD) is often due to allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) or irritant
      contact dermatitis (ICD) and has a 1-year and lifetime prevalence of up to 10% and 15%,
      respectively, in the general population. On average, the disease affects patients for about 7
      to 11 years.

      Patients with ACD show an increase in cytokines produced from T helper (Th)1 and Th17 cells,
      including (interleukin) IL-17 and IL-23, which are also implicated in the pathogenesis of
      psoriasis. Apremilast, a small molecule phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE-4) inhibitor, has
      demonstrated clinical efficacy and tolerability in the treatment of psoriasis and psoriatic
      arthritis, likely through the blockade of IL-17, IL-23, and several other pro-inflammatory
      mediators. Therefore, it may provide an effective treatment option for other Th1 and
      Th17-mediated disease (such as CHD due to ACD and ICD), which share a common immunologic
      pathway with psoriasis. Investigators hypothesize that apremilast has the ability to decrease
      disease severity in patients with moderate-to-severe CHD that is either secondary to
      psoriasis, or occurring in patients with an atopic or allergic past medical history. Hence,
      investigators have designed a pilot study involving CHD patients who attend the dermatology
      clinic at the George Washington Medical Faculty Associates (GW MFA) in order to assess the
      efficacy and safety of apremilast treatment for the treatment of moderate to severe CHD. The
      objectives are as follows:

      Primary objective:

      1. To evaluate the efficacy of Apremilast 30mg twice daily administered as monotherapy in the
      treatment of moderate-to-severe CHD as assessed by improvement of the Physician Global
      Assessment (PGA).

      Secondary objectives:

        1. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of Apremilast 30mg twice daily as assessed by
           monitoring adverse events, laboratory values (CBC, CMP), and physical examination.

        2. To evaluate CHD lesion time to response (TTR) as assessed by Modified Total Lesion
           Symptom Score (mTLSS).

        3. To evaluate the patient's perception of CHD severity improvement as assessed by the
           Patient Global Assessment (PaGA).

        4. To evaluate the patient's health-related quality of life as assessed by the Dermatology
           Life Quality Index (DLQI) questionnaire a measurement of the patient's subjective
           symptoms.

      STUDY ENDPOINTS

      Primary endpoint:

      1. Proportion of patients achieving a 2 point decrease in Physician Global Assessment (PGA)
      at the end of the study.

      Secondary endpoints:

        1. Proportion of patients achieving Physician Global Assessment (PGA) score of 0 (clear) or
           1 (almost clear) at end of study.

        2. Change in mTLSS, patient global assessment, and DLQI scores from baseline to end of
           study.

        3. Photographic improvement of CHD from baseline to end of study.

    <intervention_model_description>All participants will be patients that have been screened within the Department of Dermatology at the GW MFA. Individuals meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled into the study. A total of 10 patients will be enrolled in the study and each patient will be given Apremilast 30 mg twice daily to be administered for a period of 6 months. Patients will present to clinic for clinical assessments, adverse event monitoring, laboratory testing, and/or photography at the following time periods of therapy: baseline and 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and every 4 weeks thereafter until completion of the 6 month treatment period. Additionally, all patients will be required to return for a 4-week follow up visit after completing the final dose of the study medication.</intervention_model_description>

          1. Adults between the ages of 18-79 years.

          2. Must be in general good health (except for disease under study) as judged by the
             Investigator, based on medical history, physical examination, clinical laboratories,
             and urinalysis. (NOTE: The definition of good health means a subject does not have
             uncontrolled significant co-morbid conditions).

          3. Clinical diagnosis of CHD as defined by hand dermatitis for more than 6 months or more
             than 2 flares within 12 months.

          4. Moderate to severe CHD, defined as a PGA score of 3 (moderate) or 4 (severe).

          5. History of AD, childhood eczema, ACD, or ICD.

          6. History of disease that is unresponsive to conventional treatment (i.e.
             corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, phototherapy) for CHD. Lack of response to
             treatment is defined as an unsatisfactory outcome (no response, transient response to
             ongoing treatment or lack of tolerability) based on patient history and medical
             records.

          7. No other active skin diseases or acute skin infections dominating the clinical
             picture.

          8. Females of childbearing potential (FCBP)† must have a negative pregnancy test at
             Screening and Baseline. While on investigational product and for at least 28 days
             after taking the last dose of investigational product, FCBP who engage in activity in
             which conception is possible must use one of the approved contraceptive§ options
             described below:

        Option 1: Any one of the following highly effective methods: hormonal contraception (oral,
        injection, implant, transdermal patch, vaginal ring); intrauterine device (IUD); tubal
        ligation; or partner's vasectomy;

        OR

        Option 2: Male or female condom (latex condom or nonlatex condom NOT made out of natural
        [animal] membrane [for example, polyurethane]; PLUS one additional barrier method: (a)
        diaphragm with spermicide; (b) cervical cap with spermicide; or (c) contraceptive sponge
        with spermicide.

        † A female of childbearing potential is a sexually mature female who 1) has not undergone a
        hysterectomy (the surgical removal of the uterus) or bilateral oophorectomy (the surgical
        removal of both ovaries) or 2) has not been postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive
        months (that is, has had menses at any time during the preceding 24 consecutive months).

        § The female subject's chosen form of contraception must be effective by the time the
        female subject is randomized into the study (for example, hormonal contraception should be
        initiated at least 28 days before randomization).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. &lt;18 or &gt;79 years of age.

          2. Evidence of tinea mannum involving the hands (verified by positive fungal culture).

             within 4 weeks prior to the start of study medication OR 5 pharmacokinetic /
             pharmacodynamics half-lives (whichever is longer).

          9. Inability to make study visits or anticipated poor compliance.

         10. Pregnant females or nursing mothers. Eligible women of reproductive age will be
             required to adhere to strict pregnancy prevention measures, which includes a negative
             urine pregnancy test at screening and subsequent visits.

         11. History of Tuberculosis, Hepatitis B, C, or HIV.

         12. Any history or evidence of a medical comorbidity that would make the subject, in the
             opinion of the investigator, unsuitable for the study.
