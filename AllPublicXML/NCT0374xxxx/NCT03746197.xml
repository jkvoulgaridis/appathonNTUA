  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether a short interactive video game device is
      associated with performance on standard measures of attention and problem solving in patients
      with systemic lupus erythematosus(SLE). The study is also designed to see if playing the
      video game for four weeks improves attention and problem solving in patients with SLE.

    <measure>Change in Digit Vigilance Test Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>30 Days</time_frame>
    <description>This task measures attention. Scores are based on number of targets found and time to completion. Scores are converted to a t-score based on demographically corrected normative data.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Trail Making Test Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>This is a test of visual attention and task switching. Scores are based on time to completion and number of errors made. Scores are converted to a t-score based on demographically corrected normative data.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Stroop Test Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>This examines cognitive flexibility. The participant reads color words or names ink colors from different pages as quickly as possible within a time limit. The test yields three scores based on the number of items completed on each of the three stimulus sheets as well as in interference score. Scores are converted to a t-statistic based on demographically corrected normative data.</description>

    <measure>Change in Digit Symbol Substitution Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>The participant scans a key and draws the correct symbol below a the corresponding number. Number of symbols drawn in 120 seconds is converted to a t-statistic using demographically corrected normative data.</description>

    <description>The EVO platform assesses perceptual discrimination while single-and multi-tasking. Visuomotor tracking involves navigating a character through a dynamically moving environment while avoiding obstacles. EVO uses adaptive algorithms to change game difficulty on a trial by trial and patient by patient basis for the tracking task and discrimination task with real-time feedback.</description>
