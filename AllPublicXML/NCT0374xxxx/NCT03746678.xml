  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With increasingly more complex surgical patients and the trend toward decreased hospital stay
      after operations, continuity of care and prompt management of symptoms and side effects
      perioperatively are ever more crucial. The investigators' goal is to improve perioperative
      care with a patient-centred mobile application, starting with a pilot in patients undergoing
      elective Cesarean delivery. The investigators have completed a research study where they
      created a prototype based on feedback from patients and anesthesiologists. In this study, the
      investigators would like to learn about how patients use our mobile application after
      delivery and how the mobile application can be integrated into daily practice.

      The objective of this cohort study is to build the mobile application and evaluate its
      feasibility in providing patient education and reminders for self-monitoring for cesarean
      delivery patients. The investigators will measure the extent of patient engagement with our
      application through in-app usage data, as well as receive quantitative and qualitative
      feedback regarding feasibility. By understanding user behavior and needs through
      questionnaires and application usage data, the investigators could design more effective and
      tailored interventions for patients. Results of this study will help further development and
      implementation of an interdisciplinary mobile monitoring and communication platform for
      perioperative care.

      This study is funded by the Dalhousie University Department of Anesthesia, Pain Management &amp;
      Perioperative Medicine.

    <description>C-care is a mobile application developed based on previous research at the IWK Health Centre. It contains topics relevant to Cesarean delivery and the recovery process, which the patient could access at anytime. Patient engagement with the application will be monitored anonymously for 30 days after delivery. On days one to five after delivery, patients will receive a short self-monitoring questionnaire (approximately 1 minute). At the end of two weeks (14 days), patients will complete an online survey regarding overall satisfaction, potential impact on care, usability and feasibility problems. At any point during the study, patients can email us to report any problems with the application.</description>
