  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The literature on the effects of various devices on per-operative anxiety is scarce. There is
      currently no study on the effects of an interactive storyteller on per-operative anxiety in
      pediatric surgery.

      The interactive story teller LUNII (available over the counter in France) would reduce
      pre-operative anxiety, with post-operative effects on pain and hospitalization time.

      The literature on the effects of various devices on per-operative anxiety is scarce. There is
      currently no study on the effects of an interactive storyteller on per-operative anxiety in
      pediatric surgery.

      The interactive story teller LUNII (available over the counter in France) would reduce
      pre-operative anxiety, with post-operative effects on pain and hospitalization time.

      Patients admitted for an alveolar bone graft with an iliac donor site as part of the
      treatment of their cleft lip and palate will be include for two reasons:

        1. It is a homogeneous population - same condition, same treatment, same age at surgery,
           standardized procedure;

        2. It is a population with long individual medical histories and, potentially, subjected to
           significant surgery-related stress.

      Patients will be randomized into two groups: with LUNII and without LUNII.

      In the LUNII group, the interactive story teller LUNII will be delivered the day before
      surgery during the pre-operative medical visit.
