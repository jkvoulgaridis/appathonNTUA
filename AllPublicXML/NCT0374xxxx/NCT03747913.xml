  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is already known from literature that exercise mobilizes stem and progenitor cells into
      the peripheral blood. However, the exact mechanisms thereof remain to be fully elucidated.

      The investigators hypothesize that exercise-induced oxidative stress could be at least one of
      the responsible mechanisms and therefore want to study the exercise-induced stem and
      progenitor cell mobilization in a group of healthy young men when they exercise with,
      compared to when they exercise without antioxidative supplementation.

      The primary outcome is numbers of stem and progenitor cells in the peripheral blood after an
      acute bout of exercise. As a secondary outcome, numbers of apoptotic mature and immature
      cells in the blood will be analysed.
