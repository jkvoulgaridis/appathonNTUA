  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of repeated intravitreal bevacizumab
      injections on blood-aqueous barrier permeability in eyes with neovascular age-related macular
      degeneration (AMD).

    <measure>Anterior chamber (AC) inflammation evaluated with laser flare photometry.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>All patients were examined before and 1 day and 1 month after each intravitreal bevacizumab injection. Subjects were followed for a period of 4 months in both the study and control groups. The final flare photometry value was automatically calculated by averaging 5 individual measurements. A total of 7 measurements were obtained, but the highest and lowest measurement values were excluded by the flare meter. All statistical analyses were performed using STATISTICA 12 statistical software.</description>
