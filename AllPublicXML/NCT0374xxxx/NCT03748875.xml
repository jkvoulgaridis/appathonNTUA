  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Amphetamine-type stimulants (ATSs) have become the most important medical issue as well as
      the social problem. Compared with traditional drugs, ATS are highly neurotoxin and can induce
      cognitive deficit and psychotic symptoms. Due to lack of efficient medical treatment,
      psychotherapy and behavioral interventions are the main treatment strategies so far.
      Mindful-based relapse prevention (MBRP) which combined mindfulness with relapse prevention
      skills, as a novel intervention, has been widely used in prevent craving and relapse among
      addictions. While the current research of MBRP mechanism focus on emotion regulation circuit,
      and there was no study to explore the impulsive circuit, which is the important factor that
      induce the addiction and relapse. However, there was no report about the influence of MBRP on
      Prefrontal-striatal circuits. Based on the previous results, the proposed study will focus on
      evaluating the mechanism of MBRP on prefrontal-striatal circuits, neuropsychological tests
      and functional MRI will be used to investigate the neurobiological mechanism of MBRP on
      prefrontal-striatal circuits and related impulsive behaviors.

    <time_frame>change from baseline, 4，8，12，27and 52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>craving will be measured by visual analogue scale(VAS), participants specify their level of craving by indicating a position along a continuous line between two end-points, score ranges from 0 to 10, 0 refers to the lowest level of craving, 10 refers to the highest level of craving</description>

    <time_frame>baseline，4，8，12，27and 52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>impulsiveness will be measured by Barratt Impulsiveness Scale, the scale is a 30 item self-report measure, Rarely/Never = 1，Occasionally = 2，Often = 3，Almost Always/Always = 4. Assessment is indicated by the total score added together.</description>

    <measure>depression level change</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline，4，8，12，27and 52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>depression level will be measured by patient health questionnaire-9(PHQ-9). The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) is a multiple-choice self-report inventory, and The PHQ-9 is a tool specific to depression which has 9 items. Assessment is indicated by the total score, which made up by adding together the scores for the scale all seven items.System of scoring is Not at all (0 points),Several days (1 point) More than half the days (2 points) and Nearly every day (3 points).PHQ-9 scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represented mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression, respectively.</description>

    <measure>anxiety level change</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline，4，8，12，27and 52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>anxiety level will be measured by Generalized Anxiety Disorder(GAD-7). it has 7 items and measure severity of various signs of GAD according to reported response categories with assigned points. Assessment is indicated by the total score, which made up by adding together the scores for the scale all seven items.System of scoring is Not at all (0 points),Several days (1 point) More than half the days (2 points) and Nearly every day (3 points).</description>

    <measure>addiction severity change</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline，4，8，12，27and 52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>addiction severity will be measured by addiction severity index(ASI). ASI is a semi-structured instrument used in face-to-face interviews conducted by clinicians, researchers or trained techniciansIt measures Medical issues relating to drug use, Employment/Support Status, Levels of Alcohol and Drug Use, Legal Issues Arising from Substance Abuse, Family/Social Factors and Psychiatric/Mental Health Status. Severity ratings are based on the following 10 point scale (0-9).0-1: No real problem, treatment not indicated, 2-3: Slight problem, treatment probably not necessary 4-5: Moderate problem, some treatment indicated 6-7: Considerable problem, treatment necessary 8-9: Extreme problem, treatment absolutely necessary</description>
