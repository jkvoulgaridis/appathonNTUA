    <textblock>
      This sub-study component (n = 60) of The Exchange Project will:

      characterize reductions in cigarette smoking following the provision of: 1) an e-cigarette
      device (JUUL) and supplies (device charger, JUULpods), 2) financial incentives for
      biochemically-verified cigarette cessation + standard nicotine replacement therapy, or 3)
      JUUL + financial incentives for cigarette cessation, among homeless adults randomized to 1 of
      the 3 intervention arms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sub-study participants will be randomly assigned to: 1) earn incentives for quitting smoking
      based on a previously developed incentive schedule for socioeconomically disadvantaged and
      homeless adults in addition to combination nicotine replacement therapy (patches + lozenges),
      2) the provision of an e-cigarette device (JUUL)/supplies (JUULpods) along with directions to
      switch over from combustible cigarettes to e-cigarettes exclusively, or 3) the combination of
      an e-cigarette device (JUUL)/supplies (JUULpods) and incentives for combustible cigarette
      cessation. In all groups, cigarette smoking will be monitored over a 4-week period to
      characterize reductions in cigarette smoking and rates of smoking cessation. It is
      anticipated that individuals who are provided with an e-cigarette device and supplies, and
      are also incentivized for completely switching from cigarette smoking to e-cigarette use will
      show the greatest reductions in cigarette smoking and be the most likely to stop smoking
      combustible cigarettes altogether. The long-term objective of the sub-study is to identify
      strategies to help homeless adults quit smoking or switch to e-cigarettes as a harm reduction
      strategy.

    <description>Participants will receive a JUUL/e-cigarette device and JUUL pods. Each participant in this group will be yoked to a participant in the financial incentives group, thus receiving equal payments. Yoking will reduce or eliminate differential attendance rates between groups because participants have the opportunity to earn the same amount of money regardless of group assignment. Participants will be followed for the first 4 weeks following a scheduled quit attempt.</description>
