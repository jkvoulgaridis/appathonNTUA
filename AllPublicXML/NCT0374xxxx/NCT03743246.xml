    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2, open-label, single arm, multicohort study to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of JCAR017 in pediatric subjects aged ≤ 25 years with CD19+ r/r B-ALL and B-NHL.

      Phase 1 will identify a recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D). Phase 2 will evaluate the efficacy
      of JCAR017 RP2D in the following three disease cohorts: Cohort 1 (r/r B-ALL), Cohort 2 (MRD+
      B-ALL) and Cohort 3 (r/r B-NHL, [DLBCL, BL, or PMBCL]). A Simon's Optimal two-stage study
      design will be applied to Cohort 1 and 2 in Phase 2.

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2, open-label, single arm, multicohort study incorporating Simon's Optimal
      two-stage design to evaluate the safety and efficacy of JCAR017 in pediatric subjects aged ≤
      25 years with CD19+ r/r B-ALL and B-NHL.

      In the Phase 1, up to 5 dose levels will be of JCAR017 will be evaluated. Enrollment will
      commence in pediatric subjects with r/r B-ALL at Dose Level 1 (DL1) of 0.05x10^6 CAR+ T
      cells/kg (maximum DL1 of 5x10^6 JCAR017 CAR+ T cells [non-weight adjusted]). If this dose is
      confirmed to be safe and tolerable, additional subjects will be enrolled at higher dose(s) up
      to 0.75 x10^6 CAR+ T cells/kg (maximum of 75x10^6 JCAR017 CAR+ T cells [non-weight adjusted])
      with the aim to identify the RP2D. Dose escalation/de-escalation will follow a modified
      toxicity probability interval (mTPI-2) algorithm. A Safety Review Committee (SRC) will
      recommend the Phase 2 dose (defined as RP2D) based on an integrated assessment of the safety,
      PK and preliminary efficacy information from at least 10 pediatric subjects treated at the
      RP2D.

      In Phase 2, a minimum of 71 additional subjects (&lt; 18 years of age) will be enrolled into one
      of the 3 cohorts listed below. The sample size for Cohorts 1 and 2 is calculated according to
      Simon's Optimal two-stage design. The 10 or more pediatric subjects treated at the RP2D in
      Phase 1 will form part of the sample size (ie, Cohort 1 and Cohort 2). Therefore, the
      protocol intends to treat 81 primary endpoint evaluable pediatric subjects in Phase 2, if
      warranted by the evaluation of results at the completion of the first stage of the study in
      each cohort.

        -  Cohort 1 (r/r B-ALL): 48 evaluable pediatric subjects (13 subjects in Stage 1 and 35 in
           Stage 2)

        -  Cohort 2 (MRD+ B-ALL): 23 evaluable pediatric subjects (9 subjects in Stage 1 and 14
           subjects in Stage 2)

        -  Cohort 3 (r/r B-NHL [DLBCL, BL, or PMBCL]): 10 evaluable pediatric subjects. Due to the
           very low incidence rate and therefore expected low subject accrual, there is no formal
           sample size for this arm.

      Up to 20 additional B-ALL subjects between 18 and 25 years of age may be enrolled in Phase 2.

      Following treatment with JCAR017 subjects will then enter the post-treatment period for
      disease progression/relapse, safety, CAR T cell persistence, and survival up to 24 months
      after administration of JCAR017.

      Efficacy will be assessed both locally and by an Independent Review Committee. Response
      assessments will be based on bone marrow and blood morphologic criteria, physical examination
      findings, along with laboratory assessments of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and bone marrow
      MRD (B-ALL only) assessments. B-NHL subjects will also have radiographic disease assessment
      by CT/MRI scans and tumor biopsies, if accessible.

      Post-study follow-up for survival, relapse, long-term toxicity, and lentiviral vector safety
      will continue under a separate long-term follow-up protocol for up to 15 years after the
      JCAR017 infusion as per health authority regulatory guidelines.

      An Independent Data Monitoring Committee will monitor the study conduct.

               -  Experimental agents within 4 weeks prior to leukapheresis unless no response or
                  PD is documented on the experimental therapy and at least 3 half-lives have
                  elapsed prior to leukapheresis.

               -  Immunosuppressive therapies within 4 weeks prior to leukapheresis and JCAR017
                  infusion (eg, calcineurin inhibitors, methotrexate or other chemotherapeutics,
                  mycophenolate, rapamycin, thalidomide, immunosuppressive antibodies such as
                  antitumor necrosis factor [TNF], anti-IL-6, or anti-IL-6R).

               -  Donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) within 6 weeks prior to JCAR017 infusion.

               -  Radiation within 6 weeks prior to leukapheresis. Subjects must have PD in
                  irradiated lesions or have additional non-irradiated lesions to be eligible.
                  Radiation to a single lesion, if additional non-irradiated, measurable lesions
                  are present, is allowed up to 2 weeks prior to leukapheresis.

               -  Allogeneic HSCT within 90 days prior to leukapheresis.

         17. Tumor invasion of venous or arterial vessels (B-NHL subjects only).

         18. Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT) or Pulmonary Embolism (PE) within 3 months prior to
             leukapheresis. Subjects with DVT or PE that occurred longer than 3 months prior to
             leukapheresis, who still require ongoing therapeutic levels of anti-coagulation
             therapy, are also excluded.

         19. Existence of CD19-negative clone(s) of leukemia cells
