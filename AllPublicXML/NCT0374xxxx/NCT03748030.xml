  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiation therapy (RT) of the breast is a critical component of modern breast cancer
      treatment. RT treatments have led to improved local control and overall survival of breast
      cancer patients. However, the incidence of radiation induced harmful effects is increasing in
      these patients. This is because in delivering RT, it is difficult to completely avoid
      surrounding non-cancerous normal tissue, including the heart. The main concern here is that
      radiation induced effects on the heart may lead to an increased risk of cardiovascular
      disease later in a patient's life, potentially many years after radiation. Despite methods
      that can detect alterations in blood flow one to two years following radiotherapy, knowledge
      of early radiation effects to the heart is still limited. A previous animal experiment
      performed by our group involved delivering a radiation dose to the heart in a manner similar
      to the way a heart would be exposed, during radiotherapy for a cancer involving the left
      breast. Taking several images over the months following radiation with a new imaging
      technique, hybrid PET/MRI, has suggested an increase in inflammation can be detected as early
      as one-week following irradiation and may be the triggering event for cardiac disease seen in
      women 10-15 years after radiotherapy. The investigators propose a pilot study where 15
      left-sided breast cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy will be imaged before, as well as
      one week and one-year post radiotherapy with our hybrid PET/MRI scanner. Areas of
      inflammation, changes in blood flow, and scar formation within the heart, will be measured by
      looking at the difference between images that are taken after radiation treatment to the
      images taken before treatment. The expectation is that any areas of the heart that show
      detectable differences in the images will be directly related to how much radiation was
      deposited in those areas. The information gained from this pilot study which will correlate
      the amount of radiation administered to the degree and extent of injury will help aid in the
      design of new treatment strategies, that can hopefully decrease or eliminate inadvertent
      heart damage, thereby, improving the quality of life for breast cancer patients.

      Goals: The overall goal of this study is to identify the presence of acute low-dose radiation
      induced cardiac toxicity, including inflammation, in left-sided breast cancer patients
      undergoing radiotherapy using hybrid positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI).

      Methodology: A imaging pilot study composed of 15 left-sided breast cancer patients receiving
      standard radiotherapy is proposed. Patients will be imaged at baseline, within the first
      month post radiotherapy, and within the first-year post radiotherapy using a hybrid
      3T-PET/MRI system (Biograph mMR, Siemens Healthcare). The PET imaging protocol is designed to
      assess changes in both myocardial perfusion and inflammation. The MR imaging protocol,
      acquired simultaneously, will be used to identify heart volume, wall motion, mature fibrosis
      or scar.

      Outcome: The findings of this studies will validate the utility of hybrid PET/MRI to detect
      early inflammatory response, changes in myocardial perfusion, and heart function as a
      function of radiation dose in a human breast cancer population. This will allow consideration
      of new techniques to minimize or eliminate heart complications to future cancer patients and
      provide a non-invasive technique to serially image patients post radiotherapy and to
      investigate the effect of new interventions. Success of this study will stem from a unique
      collaboration of Radiation Oncologists, Medical Physicists, Imaging Scientists, and
      Cardiologists.

        Ultimately, the sample size was based upon practical considerations and that 15 breast
        cancer patients could be accrued relatively easily from new patient clinics, while
        sufficiently providing enough evidence to validate the imaging techniques to be used as a
        non-invasive measure for future clinical trials aimed at reducing or mitigating
        radiation-induced cardiac toxicity.
