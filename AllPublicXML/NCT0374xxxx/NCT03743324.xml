  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate the impacts of radiation and the timing of
      radiation on autologous and prosthetic-based breast reconstruction in Chinese post-mastectomy
      breast cancer patients. The study aims to optimize the timing for autologous/prosthetic
      breast reconstruction which delivers the best aesthetic results while maintains low
      complication rate and best integrates into the comprehensive breast cancer treatment. The
      study is open to all female breast cancer patients undergoing breast reconstruction in the
      department of breast reconstruction in Tianjin medical university cancer institute and
      hospital.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In breast cancer patients, post-operative radiation therapy is an important component in
      breast cancer management. However, in the context of breast reconstruction, radiation can
      have adverse effect as it increases the rate of fat necrosis and leads to fibrosis/ capsular
      contracture in the reconstructed breast mounds. It is therefore necessary to investigate the
      best timing for breast reconstruction, especially in those patients which post-operative
      radiation is required, which does not interfere with overall breast cancer treatment while
      produces the best surgical, aesthetic and psychological outcome. Most studies in this field
      are retrospective, and studies on Chinese cohort are also rare. This multi-center
      prospectively designed clinical trial will include several medical centers across China. The
      investigators will allocate the patients into three arms based on the status and sequence of
      radiation and breast reconstruction, and will further stratify the groups based on the
      different approaches of reconstruction (autologous/ prosthetic based). Both objective and
      subjective (patient oriented) methods will be employed to make evaluations involving
      surgical, aesthetic, and psychological outcomes.

    <description>patient oriented aesthetic, psychological and overall outcome evaluations are made with BREAST-Q (short for breast-questionnaire) post reconstruction module, the the selected questionnaire includes a set of questions regarding : category 1-patients' satisfaction with breasts; category 2-patients' satisfaction with outcome and category 3-patients' psychological well-being. In each category, the total score is generated by Q-score (short for questionnaire-score)software and the total score ranges from 0-100. The higher the score the better the satisfaction.</description>
