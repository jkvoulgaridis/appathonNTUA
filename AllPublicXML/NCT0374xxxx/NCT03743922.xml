      The effects of vitamin D2 supplement during pregnancy on postpartum maternal and fetal
      vitamin D levels: the randomized controlled trial

    <textblock>
      Vitamin D structurally similar to steroids. Made from the skin. And metabolism of the liver,
      kidneys, vitamin D levels in the bloodstream are two types of vitamin D 2 (Ergocalciferol)
      and vitamin D 3 (Cholecalciferol) Vitamin D regulates calcium and phosphorus levels in the
      body. Including the accumulation of minerals in the bone. Vitamin D is important in the
      formation of bones and teeth and the normal growth of children, affects the reabsorption of
      amino acids in the kidneys, regulates the amount of calcium and phosphorus in the blood
      Vitamin D deficiency in pregnant affects the mother and baby example high maternal blood
      pressure during pregnancy, diabetes during pregnancy, increase birth body weight of baby. low
      calcium seizures Infants, baby have bones and growth disorders. Currently, no vitamin D
      supplement is used in pregnant women in Thailand who attend antenatal clinics. The researcher
      has proposed to study the effects of vitamin D supplement during pregnancy on postpartum
      maternal and fetal vitamin D levels by using vitamin D 20,000IU / week
