  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether CPC634 (CriPec® docetaxel) is effective in
      the treatment of patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer who are resistant to prior
      platinum-based chemotherapy

      .

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Phase IIa exploratory 2-stage trial will assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of
      CPC634 (CriPec® docetaxel) administered IV, Q3W to 27 subjects (13 in Stage 1 and 14 in Stage
      2) with ovarian cancer that is resistant to prior platinum-based therapy. Subjects will be
      treated continuously every 21 days at 60 mg/m2, which is the RP2D of CPC634 (CriPec®
      docetaxel) that was determined in the Phase I CT-CL01, until disease progression,
      unacceptable toxicity, or discontinuation for any other reason.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age 8 years.

          2. Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of epithelial ovarian, fallopian
             or peritoneal cancer.

          3. Platinum-resistant recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer (defined as progression within
             6 months after last platinum dose). Subjects who have received a maximum of 2 prior
             treatment lines of which one could have been taxane- based.

          4. Measurable disease according to RECIST version 1.1. Only CA-125 progression without
             any clinical or radiological progression is not allowed.

          5. Performance status (WHO scale/ECOG) 1.

          6. Estimated life expectancy of at least 5 months.

          7. Toxicities incurred as a result of previous anti-cancer therapy (radiation therapy,
             chemotherapy, or surgery) must be resolved to ≤ Grade 2 (as defined by NCI- CTCAE
             version 5.0).

          8. ANC ≥ 1.5 x 109/L; platelets ≥100 x 109/L; hemoglobin ≥ 5.58 mmol/L (≥ 9.00 g/dL)

          9. Creatinine ≤ 1.75 x Upper Limit of Normal (ULN) and estimated creatinine clearance ≥
             30 mL/min according to Cockcroft-Gault formula; Serum albumin levels &gt; 25g/L.

         10. Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN except for subjects with Will Gilbert's syndrome; alkaline

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with platinum-refractory disease. Refractory disease is defined by subjects
             who progressed during the preceding treatment or within 4 weeks after last dose of
             platinum containing therapy.

          2. Less than four weeks since the last treatment with other anti-cancer therapies, (i.e.
