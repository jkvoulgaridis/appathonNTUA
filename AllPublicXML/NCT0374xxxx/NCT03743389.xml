  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pigtail catheter(PC) has been used for thoracic drainage in the patients with pneumothorax or
      traumatic hemothorax/hemopneumothorax, and some study indicated that PC could obtain similar
      outcomes when comparing with chest tube(CT). Although PC could drain air and fluid out from
      pleural cavity and also help pulmonary re-expanding, rare reports are available to thoracic
      post-operative management. Uniportal video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery(VATS) has been
      widely applied in many medical center in recent years, most of mediastinal nodes could be
      resected under uniportal-VATS. This study aims to further study the application of 12G PC
      during post-operative management and comparing the validity and safety between PC(12G) and
      CT(16F) after uniportal-VATS for mediastinal nodes resection.
