      This cross-sectional study was conducted at the Reproductive Endocrinology and Invitro
      Fertilization (REI) unit of our hospital, following the approval of the hospital's ethics
      committee. Patients who underwent gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) treatment
      were enrolled in the study. During oocyte retrieval, follicular fluids of mature follicles
      (≥18 mm) were collected and pooled for each patient. The thiobarbituric acid method was used
      for the sialic acid levels and the absorbance values were measured by a spectrophotometer at
      549 nm.

      This cross-sectional study was conducted at the Reproductive Endocrinology and Invitro
      Fertilization (REI) unit our hospital, following the approval of the hospital's ethics
      committee. The inclusion criteria were as follows; under 40 years of age, normal thyroid and
      prolactin hormone levels, a basal follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level &lt;10 mIU/mL, BMI of
      19-30 kg/m2. Exclusion criteria: a history of ovarian surgery, endometriosis, uterine
      anomaly, any endocrine disease including congenital adrenal hyperplasia, smokers, use of any
      medications and hormones in the last 3 months. Before the IVF treatment serum follicle
      stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), prolactin (PRL), thyroid-stimulating
      hormone (TSH), and estradiol (E2) levels were measured on the third day of the cycle. Age,
      body mass index, duration of stimulation, duration of infertility, the total dose of
      gonadotropins, E2 on the day of hCG administration, number of oocytes retrieved,
      fertilization rate, and pregnancy rate were recorded.

      All patients underwent gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) treatment. Oocyte
      retrieval was done 36 hours after the hCG injection and ICSI was used for all patients.
      Embryo transfer was performed 48-72 hours after the oocyte retrieval.

      During oocyte retrieval, follicular fluids of mature follicles (≥18 mm) were collected from
      the first follicle entered and were aspirated for each patient. Follicle aspirates, which
      were not clear and contaminated with blood, were excluded. Total and free sialic acid levels
      were measured in the follicular fluid.
