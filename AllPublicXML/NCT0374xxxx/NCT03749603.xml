      Brief description: The purpose of this study is to assess the iron status and to confirm the
      usability of the non-invasive ZnPP measurement for screening the different stages of iron
      deficiency defined by standard measurements from blood.

      Detailed Description:

      The primary objective of this study is to assess the iron status and the prevalence of the
      different stages of iron deficiency measured and defined by the standard blood iron
      measurements and by the non-invasive measurement of red blood cell Zinc Protoporphyrin
      fluorescence in the microcirculation of the lower lip.

      The secondary objective is to compare and to assess the usability of the non-invasive ZnPP
      measurement versus other standard iron status measurements from blood in distinguishing the
      different stages of iron deficiency.

      Subjects will be enrolled into the study after signing an assent form in addition to having
      parental informed consent signed. Total study duration is 1 day.
