  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While substance use disorders have been found to have relapse rates on part with other
      chronic illnesses such as hypertension and asthma long term abstinence remains elusive for
      many. The FDA has recently approve a long acting subcutaneous injectable formulation of
      buprenorphine. This study aims to determine the feasibility of enrolling and randomizing
      patients seeking treatment at an outpatient substance abuse clinic to buprenorphine/naloxone
      films which dissolve under the tongue vs. long acting buprenorphine injection with all other
      treatment aspects held constant. The study also aims to determine the effectiveness of
      monthly injections of Sublocade® compared to daily oral Suboxone® SL therapy in the treatment
      of moderate to severe opioid use disorder after twenty-four weeks of treatment.

      While substance use disorders have been found to have relapse rates on part with other
      chronic illnesses such as hypertension and asthma long term abstinence remains elusive for
      many. Fortunately, the FDA has recently approved a long acting subcutaneous injectable
      formulation of buprenorphine. While this drug has proven effective in retaining patients in
      care and decreasing drug cravings as compared to placebo, this drug has not been tested in a
      real world clinic setting and no studies exist comparing it to the current formulations of
      buprenorphine. The objective of this study is to perform a randomized pilot study directly
      comparing sublingual buprenorphine/naloxone to long acting buprenorphine subdermal injection
      in a standard Office-Based Opioid Agonist Treatment (OBOT) clinic. The study team will
      compare patient retention, percentage of negative urinary drug screens, and withdrawal scores
      between the two groups. The findings will provide insight for US providers seeking more
      effective and efficient ways to treat Opioid use disorder (OUD) in the outpatient setting.

    <intervention_model_description>Patients admitted to the WFBMC Medication-Assisted-Therapy (MAT) clinic with a diagnosis of moderate/severe Opioid-Use Disorders (OUD) who are more than 18 years old will be approached for enrollment in this study. Because of the nature of a pilot study, it's proposed a total of 30 patients, 15 in each group. Subjects will be started and titrated to optimal Suboxone® SL dose for 14 days. After the 14 day, the subject will be started on the treatment to which they are randomized, either Suboxone® SL or Sublocade®. Control group -Suboxone®SL: Patients assigned to this group will continue with their already established dose of Suboxone ®SL films for 24 weeks along with weekly therapy. Study drug-Sublocade® group: Patients assigned to this group will receive the study drug (subcutaneously) every 4 weeks for a total of 6 doses along with weekly therapy. At the end of the 24-weeks subjects will continue the medication of their choice within the constraints of their insurance provider.</intervention_model_description>

After the 14 day induction phase, the subject will be started on the treatment to which they were randomized, either Suboxone® SL or Sublocade®. Subjects with significant opioid craving (&gt; 20 mm on the Opioid Craving Visual Analog Scale) or withdrawal (a score of &gt; 12 on the Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale) after 14 days of treatment will be started on Sublocade® only at the consensus of the research team. Otherwise they will undergo an additional 7 day titration period. Study drug with Sublocade® group: Patients assigned to this group will receive the study drug (300 mg subcutaneously) every 4 weeks for a total of 6 doses along with weekly therapy. The location and specifications of its application will follow the recommendations by the FDA previously published.</description>
