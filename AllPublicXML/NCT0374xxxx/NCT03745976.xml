  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ever-evolving prosthetic activity as described in a Swedish study that predicts 469 TKA per
      10,000 inhabitants in 2130. Increased consultation of controls and post-arthroplasty
      follow-up is expected. There is a legal obligation to ensure long-term follow-up without
      official recommendation on follow-up procedures. The objective is to compare a consultation +
      Xray by the surgeon versus an Xray and a questionnaire completed by the patient who had a
      knee or hip replacement. This is to demonstrate the equivalence of both.

      All patients who come back for an annual check of a prosthesis should complete this
      questionnaire and perform an X-ray of their prosthesis. The study lasts one year and includes
      all the patients with a previous knee or hip arthroplasty.

      The result of the questionnaire and Xray will be compared to that of the consultation and
      Xray.

      An english study published an article showing that a follow up by questionnaire versus a
      consultation was also effective.

      For this study, investigator is going to take back all the patients having to return to
      consultation in 2017. . Normally at 3 months, 1, 3, 5, 10, 15 and 20 years post-operatively.

      Thus investigator will be able to see the number of patients seen in consultation compared to
      the theoretical number The purpose of this study is to highlight the non-inferiority of the
      questionnaire compared to the consultation for screening for complications at 10 years.

      If this proves to be the case, only complicating patients could be reviewed by calling them
      to the radio and their questionnaire.
