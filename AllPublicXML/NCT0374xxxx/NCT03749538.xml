  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systemic autoimmune myopathies are a heterogeneous group of rheumatic diseases that primarily
      affect the skeletal muscles. The transcranial current stimulation technique has been
      frequent, for example, in patients with ischemic stroke or for the optimization of muscular
      performance in athletes. However, to date, there are no studies evaluating this technique in
      patients with systemic autoimmune myopathies. Therefore, the main objective of the present
      prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study is to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of the application of a transcranial current stimulation session in patients with
      systemic autoimmune myopathies.

    <textblock>
      Systemic autoimmune myopathies are a heterogeneous group of rheumatic diseases that primarily
      affect the skeletal muscles. Depending on the clinical, pathophysiological and laboratory
      characteristics, they may be subdivided into polymyositis, dermatomyositis, antissintetase
      syndrome, immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy, and among others. Recently, the literature
      has been presenting better pharmacological treatment options to control these diseases.
      Despite these advances, this group of diseases still continues to be associated with high
      morbidity and functional disability, mainly due to the proximal muscular weakness of the
      scapular and pelvic girdles that may prevent the total recovery of these patients. On the
      other hand, the association of the transcranial current stimulation technique with motor
      recovery has been frequent, for example, in patients with ischemic stroke or for the
      optimization of muscular performance in athletes. However, to date, there are no studies
      evaluating this technique in patients with systemic autoimmune myopathies. Therefore, the
      main objective of the present prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study
      is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the application of a transcranial current
      stimulation session in patients with systemic autoimmune myopathies.

    <description>This partially validated tool measures the serum activities of at least 2 of the 4 muscle-associated enzymes including creatine phosphokinase (CK), the transaminases (ALT, AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LD) and aldolase. The reference range value of each muscle enzyme will depend on the laboratory anaysis (kits). International Unit: U/L.</description>

    <description>Transcranial current stimulation session: the energy of the anode (transcranial current stimulation) will have as its source a battery-powered DC generator and will be exerted by two electrodes measuring 5x7cm and attached to the head. The electrodes will be located of the primary motor cortex. The electrode with positive charge (anode) will be positioned at contralateral to the dominant limb and the negative charged electrode will be positioned in the supraorbital region ipsilateral to the dominant limb. The active current of direct transcranial stimulation will be applied with the intensity of electric current of 2mA and density of 0.057 mA/cm2 with duration of 20 minutes. During the session, patients will remain seated.</description>
