    <textblock>
      PHOENIX is a window of opportunity (WOP), open-label, multi-centre, phase IIa trial
      comprising multiple non-comparative treatment cohorts with patient allocation via
      randomisation. The trial consists of two parts: a post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy, preoperative
      WOP component (PART 1); and a post-operative component (PART 2).

      PHOENX aims to assess whether short exposure to a DNA damage response (DDR) inhibitor and/or
      anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy in a preoperative WOP in patients with post-NACT high residual
      disease, generates a signal of anti-tumour biological activity within residual disease
      tissue.

    <description>Changes in the proliferation gene expression signature post WOP intervention within the post-treatment biopsy compared to pre-treatment baseline biopsy. A patient will be defined as being a responder if there is a ≥1.5-fold drop in the proliferation gene expression in the surgical resection sample.
The proliferation gene signature will be based on 11 highly correlated proliferation genes shown in multiple studies including those published by The Cancer Genome Atlas and they also contribute to the calculation of the proliferation score in the publicly available PAM50 classifier. The list consists of: CCNB1, UBE2C, BIRC5, NDC80, CDC20, PTTG1, RRM2, MKI67, TYMS, CEP55, and NUF2.
For each sample, a proliferation gene module score will be calculated according to the expression of the relevant genes.

          9. Patients must be suitable for a mandatory pre-treatment baseline biopsy performed Day
             -1 or 1 of the window of opportunity (WOP) and a post-treatment biopsy performed on
             Day 14 of the WOP. Registered patients who are approached for trial entry will be
             required to consent to the pre- and post- WOP treatment biopsy. If it is deemed unsafe
             to proceed with biopsy upon Trial Entry the patient will not be eligible for Trial
             Registration.

         10. Patients with clinical stage II disease or clinical suspicion of metastatic disease
             must have staging studies as per standard of care to exclude metastatic disease
             (axillary lymph nodes or internal mammary node involvement will not be regarded as

         11. Patients with stage III disease must have staging studies as per standard of care at
             any point after diagnosis but before Trial Registration, to exclude metastatic disease
             (axillary lymph nodes or internal mammary node involvement will not be regarded as
             evidence of metastatic disease), even if asymptomatic.

         12. Patients with previous invasive cancers (including breast cancer) are eligible if the

         14. Patients must be a) surgically sterile (i.e. if female have undergone a hysterectomy,
             bilateral salpingectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; if male have undergone a bilateral
             orchidectomy);; b) have a sterilised sole partner; or c) be post-menopausal; or d)
             must agree to practice total/true abstinence; or e) use two highly effective forms of
             contraception in combination during the period of trial treatment and be willing to do

          1. Amenorrheic for 1 year or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal treatments

          2. Luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels in the
             post-menopausal range for the institution for women &lt; 50 years of age not using
             hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. Please note: in absence of
             amenorrhea for 1 year, a single LH and/or FSH measurement is insufficient.

          3. Radiation-induced oophorectomy with last menses &gt;1 year ago

          4. Chemotherapy-induced menopause with &gt;1 year interval since last menses

          5. Surgical sterilisation (hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy or bilateral
             oophorectomy)

        Exclusion Criteria for Trial Registration:

          5. Severe concurrent disease, infection or co-morbidity that, in the judgment of the
             local Investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for Trial Registration;

          6. Resting ECG with QTc&gt;470msec for females and &gt; 450 msec for men on 2 or more time
             points within a 24 hour period, factors which increase the risk of QTc prolongation or
             family history of long QT syndrome;

             opinion would cause reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition, that
             contraindicates the use of trial treatment, that may increase the risk associated with
             trial participation, that may affect the interpretation of the results, or that would
             make this trial inappropriate for the patient;

         16. Patients with a known hypersensitivity to the trial treatments or any excipients of
             the products;

         17. Previous allogenic bone marrow transplant or double umbilical cord blood
