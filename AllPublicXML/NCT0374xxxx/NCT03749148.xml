  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy in reducing disease activity and safety
      of Dupilumab in adult patients with cholinergic urticarial (CholU) who are symptomatic
      despite H1-antihistamine treatment (licensed dose).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment with Dupilumab has been shown to reduce clinically significant exacerbations and to
      improve skin symptom control as well as quality of life in moderate to severe atopic
      dermatitis patients and in moderate to severe asthma patients. It has been approval by EMA
      for the treatment of atopic dermatitis patients in September 2017.

      Dupilumab is a novel monoclonal antibody that inhibits interleukin-4 (IL-4) and
      interleukin-13 (IL-13) signaling and was previously found to be effective in atopic
      dermatitis and asthma. Considering that CholU and atopic diseases share many common features
      (e.g. key pathogenic role of mast cells and IgE, itch is a dominant symptom, Th2 dominance),
      it is reasonable to expect that Dupilumab is beneficial in CholU.

      These results suggest that Dupilumab may provide an effective treatment option for patients
      with insufficient treatment responses to H1-antihistamines exhibiting wheal and flare type
      skin reactions.

      The gold standard treatment of CholU consists of administration of antihistamines. In most
      patients, symptoms persist with standard dosing of antihistamines. In
      antihistamine-refractory patients with cholinergic urticaria, no other licensed treatment is
      currently available. In 2014, omalizumab has been licensed for add-on therapy in CSU patients
      who still have symptoms despite standard-dosed antihistamine treatment, but not for chronic
      inducible forms of urticaria. Accordingly, there is still a great medical need for additional
      treatment options of CholU patients that are refractory to antihistamine treatment.

      Dupilumab has excellent potential to provide symptom control in CholU. This study will
      provide additional valuable insights into the therapeutic potential of Dupilumab in improving
      quality of life in these patients, in addition to managing CholU symptoms.

             positive hCG laboratory test.

         24. Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of
             becoming pregnant, UNLESS they are using highly-effective methods of contraception
             during the duration of the study. Highly-effective contraception methods include:

               -  Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of
                  the patient), Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
                  contraception.

               -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without
                  hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment.
                  In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has
                  been confirmed by follow-up hormone level assessment

               -  Male sterilization (at least 6 m prior to screening). For female patients on the
                  study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient.

               -  Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or other
                  forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate &lt;
                  1%), for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception

               -  Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS) In case of
                  use of oral contraception women should have been stable on the same pill for a
                  minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment.

        Note: Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have
        had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile
        (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or six months of spontaneous
        amenorrhea with serum FSH levels &gt; 40 mIU/mL; or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy
        (with or without hysterectomy) at least six months ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone,
        only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone
        level assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential.
