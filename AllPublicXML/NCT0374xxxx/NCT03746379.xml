  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia; is a chronic and rheumatic condition characterized by diffuse pain. In patients
      with fibromyalgia syndrome, there is an increase in psychiatric symptoms, especially
      depression, anxiety, and somatoform disorders. Kinesophobia is defined as anxiety against
      pain and pain caused by painful injury and re-injury. The aim of this study was to
      investigate the relationship between kinesophobia and sensory processing in patients with
      fibromyalgia.
