      This study quantified the displacement of the center of pressure in the computer in real time
      and record this data for future analyzes

      The wobble board is an unstable equilibrium platform, constant training on this platform
      generates an improvement in balance and strengthens the muscles, it is ideal for
      rehabilitation exercises and balance conditioning. However, these platforms do not provide
      quantitative data on exercises performed on it. And the force platform that provide this
      quantitative data is static, offering no difficulty in maintaining balance. In this way, a
      sensor board wobble board was developed using a conventional wobble board with a plate
      attached to it, between the plate and the platform are eight strain gauges sensors that are
      activated according to the position of the force applied on the platform, the values of the
      sensors are collected by software that demonstrates the point of greatest pressure on the
      disk and its displacement during the exercises, with this data it is possible to determine
      the stability of the user and observe their behavior during the exercises.

    <description>The test was performed in a single, 30-minute session. The test is divided into two phases, with feedback and no feedback from the system. The order of phases was randomized. In each phase the volunteer will remain balanced on the wobble board for 15 seconds under the conditions of the phase. This test is repeated 3 times with a 30 seconds rest between them, then the next phase is performed. With feedback the volunteer can observe the system responses. Without feedback the volunteer can not observe the response of the system.</description>
