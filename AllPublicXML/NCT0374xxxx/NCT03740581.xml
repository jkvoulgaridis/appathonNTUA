  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic foot ulcer is one of the most serious, most costly and at times life threatening
      complication of diabetes. The lifetime incidence of foot ulcer occurrence in diabetes is up
      to 25%. Despite the advent of numerous types of wound dressings and off-loading mechanisms,
      the ulcer healing rates in diabetes have remained dismally low. Hyperglycemia impairs the
      inflammatory, proliferative and remodeling phases of an ulcer. There are retrospective
      studies linking improvement of HbA1c to wound area healing rate. The investigators
      hypothesised that intensive glycemic control in a patient of diabetic foot ulcer improves the
      healing process. To explore this hypothesis, the investigators are conducting this randomized
      control trial with the primary aim of wound healing in patients of diabetic foot ulcer on
      either intensive glycemic treatment or conventional (pre-existing) glycemic treatment.
