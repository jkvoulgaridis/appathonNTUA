    <description>Surgical technique: Via left lateral thoracotomy, the heart is lifted and supported on two deep pericardial points with 4-0 or 5-0 Prolene double arrmed suture. Each suture is passed through the reinforced frame of the collagen membrane containing the stem cells (VB-C01) and then tied, while the upper part of the patch is held with forceps. After securing the lower part of the pericardial layer, the heart is allowed to slowly recover its position with the pericardial cavity while the collagen membrane is mobilized to cover all of the target area. If necessary, some sutures can be used to fix the patch VB-C01 to the epicardial surface of the heart. Each suture is likewise passed through the reinforced frame of the membrane.</description>
