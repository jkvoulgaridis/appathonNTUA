  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of implants has significantly increased prosthetic options for edentulous patient.
      However, implant placement in the Posterior mandibular region is often hampered significantly
      by insufficient atrophic width limitations

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ridge splitting technique causes lateral ridge expansion which creates new implant bed by
      longitudinal osteotomy, positioning buccal cortex laterally. The buccal cortex is positioned
      laterally to create space between buccal and lingual cortical plates, which is filled by an
      endosseous implant with or without any graft material limitations.

      Ridge split technique is a very predictable procedure that can achieve substantial gains in
      horizontal ridge width of the edentulous posterior mandible without associated morbidity.
      This technique allows the clinician to augment the site and do the implant insertion in a
      single stage surgery, shortening the healing period drastically.

      In the conventional ridge splitting technique, a complete flap is raised to allow adequate
      visibility of the bone defect which can result in disturbance of vascular supply and increase
      bone resorption rates. In this case report, a new innovative computer guided closed alveolar
      ridge splitting flapless technique has been advocated to avoid this disruption.

      As Guided implant placement showed a statistically superior accuracy when they are compared
      with freehand placement after guided osteotomy Computer guided ridge splitting may have a
      superior accuracy than the freehand ridge splitting and may reduce the time of surgery,
      healing period and post-operative pain.

    <description>The computer guided ridge splitting for patients with atrophic posterior mandible and with residual bone width at least 3 to 5mm of residual ridge.
The selected patients will be informed of the nature of the research work and informed consent will be signed.
Radiographic examination included preoperative digital panoramic radiograph with 1:1 magnification for each patient as a primary survey to obtain an approximation of the available bone height and detect the presence of remaining roots and localized pathosis.
Computer surgical guides are fabricated for partially edentulous patients using teeth and tissue as support for the guide.
The same surgeon performed all surgeries. All surgical procedures were performed under strict aseptic conditions, all patients received nerve block local anesthesia (Articaine 4% 1:100 000 epinephrine).
A crestal incision is made using No. 15 blade extending over the posterior mandible using computer guided surgical stent.
