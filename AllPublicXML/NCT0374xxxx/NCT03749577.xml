  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim at comparing the efficacy of a 2 weeks supplementation by L-citrulline
      or beetroot juice to L-citrulline placebo or denitrated beetroot juice respectively on
      Raynaud's phenomenon severity. Raynaud's phenomenon severity will be assessed through the
      Raynaud Condition Score, daily frequency of attacks or cumulative attack duration (expressed
      as min) daily collected by patients in a diary. Each Volunteer will choose his own main
      outcome among these 3 criteria.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) is a clinical condition that follows an exaggerated
      vasoconstriction of extremities in response to a cold or emotional stress. Microvascular
      dysfunction and alteration of the endothelial NO-dependent vasodilatation pathway through NO
      synthases (NOS) represents one of the main mechanisms.

      A pharmacological treatment in RP is proposed to patients when conservative measures are not
      efficient enough to control the symptoms: calcium channel blockers remains the first line,
      phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors as a second line treatment, while intravenous iloprost
      remains restricted to patients with digital ischaemia. Vasodilator therapies are commonly
      associated with side effects due to the non-specific systemic vasodilation that often result
      in permanent discontinuation. Many patients prefer complementary and alternative therapies,
      but none has proven its efficacy. Therefore, there is still room for improvement in the
      treatment of RP, and research is needed in this area.

    <description>Change from baseline in the Raynaud's Condition score (RCS). RCS is participant's rating of difficulty considering number of attacks, duration, amount of pain, numbness, or other symptoms caused in the fingers (including painful sores) due to the Raynaud's phenomenon every day and impact of Raynaud's alone on use of hands every day. An 11 point Likert scale is used to rate the difficulty caused by the condition each day with 0 = no difficulty and 10 = extreme difficulty.</description>
