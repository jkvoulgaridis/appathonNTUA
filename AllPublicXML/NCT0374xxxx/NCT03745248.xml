    <textblock>
      Individuals with degenerative cerebellar disease (DCD) exhibit gradual loss of coordination
      resulting in impaired balance, gait deviations, and severe, progressive disability. With no
      available disease-modifying medications, balance training is the primary treatment option to
      improve motor skills and functional performance.

      Aerobic training, on the other hand, may modify DCD progression as evident from animal data.
      Compared to sedentary controls, aerobically trained DCD rats have enhanced lifespan, motor
      function, and cerebellar Purkinje cell survival. Numerous animal studies also document that
      aerobic training has a direct, favorable effect on the brain that includes production of
      neurotrophic hormones, enhancement of neuroplasticity mechanisms, and protection from
      neurotoxins.

      The effects of aerobic training in humans with DCD are relatively unknown, despite these
      encouraging animal data. A single study to date has evaluated the benefits of aerobic
      exercise on DCD in humans, and this was a secondary outcome of the study. Although
      participants performed limited aerobic training during the study, modest functional benefits
      were still detected.

      The main objective of this project will be to compare the benefits of aerobic versus balance
      training in DCD. The investigators hypothesize that both aerobic and balance training will
      improve function in DCD subjects, but that the mechanisms in which these improvements occur
      differ.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in SARA score</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Ataxia severity will be measured using the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA).SARA evaluates the degree of ataxia by measuring gait, stance, sitting balance, speech, finger-chase test, nose-finger test, fast alternating movements, and heel-shin test.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in gait speed</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>For the walking assessment, participants will walk as fast as possible on a 10-meter runway six times, and the investigators will average the times of trials 3-6 to determine gait speed expressed in meters/second.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in static balance</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Static standing balance will be assessed by measuring postural sway during two, one-minute trials. Participants will stand with arms crossed over their chest and feet shoulder-width apart under two conditions: eyes open and eyes closed. Data will be collected using Bertec's dual split-belt treadmill (Bertec, Columbus, OH) embedded with force plates. Balance deficits will be calculated as the magnitude of postural sway (sway amplitude) using custom Nexus and Bodybuilder software (Vicon, Denver, CO).</description>

    <description>Participants will be given a stationary exercise bike for home use. They will be instructed to use the exercise bike five times a week for thirty-minute sessions. The exercise intensity prescription will be based on the subject's VO2max determined on pre-test day. The exercise program will start at 60% of intensity per session, and then will be increased by steps of 5% intensity every 2 sessions until participants reach 30 minutes of training at 80% intensity. Participants will be contacted weekly by e-mail or phone to answer any questions about the exercise protocol and will be instructed to log each training session. Subjects will record duration of exercise, perceived exertion, average heart rate, maximum heart rate, and distance.</description>

    <description>A physical therapist will tailor a home balance training program for each participant based on pre-training capabilities. Subjects will be asked to perform exercises five times a week for thirty-minute sessions. Both dynamic and static exercises will be performed in sitting and standing positions. Exercises will start with stabilizing in a challenging static position and progress to dynamic arm and leg movements in the same or modified position. Participants will be contacted weekly by e-mail or phone to answer any questions about the exercise protocol and will be required to log their exercise effort in terms of frequency and level of balance challenge. Individuals will be instructed to perform more difficult exercises if balance challenge scores are low.</description>
