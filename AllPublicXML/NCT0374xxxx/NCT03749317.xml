             investigator's discretion.

          2. Current or relevant history of physical or psychiatric illness, any medical disorder
             that may make the subject unlikely to fully complete the study, or any condition that
             presents undue risk from the investigational product or procedures.

          3. Have known or suspected intolerance or hypersensitivity to the investigational
             product, closely related compounds, or any of the stated ingredients.
