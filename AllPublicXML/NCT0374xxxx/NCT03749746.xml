  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preeclampsia causes devastating maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality with a high
      recurrence risk and a rapid, occult progression to cardiovascular disease after delivery.
      There is a critical need for effective interventions to reduce these risks. This is a pilot
      randomized controlled trial of a novel postpartum lifestyle intervention compared to women
      who take home blood pressure measurements and women with usual care who are overweight and
      obese in the first year after preeclampsia. The investigators hypothesize that the
      intervention will lead to improved weight loss and blood pressure in the first year
      postpartum, which has broad implications for future pregnancy and long-term cardiovascular
      health.

      The overall objective of this study is to conduct a pilot trial of an internet-based
      lifestyle intervention and home blood pressure monitoring in the year after delivery among
      overweight and obese women with preeclampsia to evaluate feasibility, acceptability and to
      assess the effect of the intervention. The investigators hypothesize that compared to usual
      care, an internet-based lifestyle intervention implemented in the immediate postpartum period
      in overweight and obese women with preeclampsia improves weight loss at one year postpartum.
      90 overweight or obese women with preeclampsia will be randomized into internet-based
      lifestyle intervention plus home blood pressure monitoring, home blood pressure monitoring
      alone, or usual care groups in the postpartum period. The investigators will assess
      feasibility by the proportions of women who are eligible, enroll, and remain in the study at
      one year. The effect of home blood pressure monitoring on blood pressure and progression to
      sustained hypertension will also be explored. A successful outcome of this study would have a
      direct impact to improve cardiovascular health and future pregnancy health in women who have
      had preeclampsia.

    <description>The intervention is comprised of four key components: (1) The online curriculum consists of 12 modules on healthy eating and physical activity adapted from the Diabetes Prevention Program and specifically targeting postpartum women. (2) Self-monitoring and tracking program, in which participants will be provided with a Bluetooth-enabled blood pressure cuff and digital scale and will be provided real-time feedback on their blood pressure and weight trends. (3) A registered dietitian will act as a lifestyle coach for participants with regular review of progress and provision of coaching notes, support and suggestions. (4) Finally participants will have access to a customized online toolbox, including dietary tracking sheets and recipes from the American Heart Association (AHA).</description>
