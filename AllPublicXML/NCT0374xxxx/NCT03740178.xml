  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of MK-4334
      administered once daily (QD) in participants with Alzheimer's clinical syndrome receiving a
      stable, daily dose of donepezil 10 mg, taken orally (PO). This includes participants with
      symptoms of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD). It
      is hypothesized that the true geometric mean minimum plasma concentration at 24 hours (C24)
      is at least 60 nM at steady state in the presence of steady-state donepezil 10 mg.
