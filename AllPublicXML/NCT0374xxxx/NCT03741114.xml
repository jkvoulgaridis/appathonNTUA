  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Placenta previa (PP) is an obstetric condition that is closely linked with massive obstetric
      hemorrhage with a varied incidence about once in every 150-250 live births. Insertion of
      intrauterine balloon tamponade has been suggested in the management of massive postpartum
      hemorrhage (PPH). The Bakri balloon has a sausage-like spindle shape and a drainage lumen and
      is made of silicon. It has been used in cases of uterine atony and placenta previa with a
      success rate of 90%. However, Bakri balloon is not available in all countries.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the use of intrauterine inflated Foley's
      catheter balloon with or without intravenous tranexamic acid to control PPH during cesarean
      delivery in cases of placenta previa.

      Eligible participants were allocated to one of two groups. Group (I): patients managed by
      Intrauterine Inflated Foley's Catheter Balloon after delivery of the fetus. Group (II):
      patients received 1 gm tranexamic acid (TA), (2 ampoules of CapronÂ® 500 mg /5 ml; Cairo,
      Egypt) intravenous just before skin incision plus Intrauterine Inflated Foley's Catheter
      Balloon. In group I, patients received a single injection of intravenous saline before skin
      incision prepared in a syringe and coded by a pharmacist in the pharmacy of the hospital.
      Neither the surgeon nor the anesthetist will know the nature of the IV administered drug
      before cesarean section.
