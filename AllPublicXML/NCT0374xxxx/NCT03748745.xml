  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the drug-drug interaction of SH229 tablets and
      Daclatasvir dihydrochloride tablets. The study also evaluates the pharmacokinetics and
      tolerability of co-administration of SH229 tablets and Daclatasvir dihydrochloride tablets in
      healthy subjects. This study provides evidence for the designing of following clinical trial
      protocols.
