  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fine particulate matter &lt; 2.5 microns (PM2.5) air pollution is a leading global risk factor
      for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. PM2.5 presents a serious ongoing public health
      threat to patients living in highly-polluted countries (ex: China, India) where air quality
      is projected to remain extremely poor (far exceeding World Health Organization Air Quality
      Guidelines) for the foreseeable future. This study reviews the benefits of personal level
      intervention (wearing N95 respirator) over long term, to prevent clinical events among
      patients with cardiovascular disease.

      CLEANAIR-ACS will be an investigation within ASPIRE, that will test the ability of
      personal-level intervention (N95 respirators combined with nasal cyclones) to improve
      validated surrogate markers of cardio-metabolic health in patients with a recent Acute
      Coronary Syndrome (ACS). Patients with ACS are a vulnerable patient population with
      vulnerability and at risk for future cardiovascular events. This vanguard phase study in
      Beijing involving patients exposed to high levels of air pollution who have recently
      sustained an ACS event, is necessary to obtain feasibility data and gather a battery of
      information allowing for the appropriate design of a larger clinical outcome trial. What is
      more, positive results would provide critically-important information demonstrating for the
      first time that it is feasible to &quot;prescribe&quot; the use of these personal protection devices to
      cardiac patients, and that their usage is capable of translating into demonstrable health
      benefits (i.e., improved BP and insulin sensitivity) over the long-term.

      The study hypothesis is that long-term personal-level interventions to reduce exposure to
      PM2.5 can be feasibly performed for 1-year post-acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and will result
      in significant improvements in validated surrogate cardiometabolic endpoints predictive of
      morbidity/mortality.
