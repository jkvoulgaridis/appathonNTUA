  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children and adults with XLH recruited will be treated with calcitriol alone (without
      phosphate supplementation) for one year, during which the calcitriol dose will be escalated
      during the first 3 months of therapy. The investigators hypothesize that treatment of adults
      and children with XLH alone will improve serum phosphate levels and skeletal mineralization
      without causing an increase in kidney calcifications. The study will also examine if
      calcitriol therapy will improve growth in children.
