  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Square knots are the gold standard for hand-tied surgical knots; however, they are difficult
      to reproduce in deep body cavities and can inadvertently result in slipped knots. The
      investigators have shown in previous work that the reversing half-hitch alternating post
      (RHAP) surgical knot is a non-inferior alternative to the square surgical knot based on its
      tensile strength and performance in limited working spaces. Prior to introducing RHAP knot in
      routine surgical practice, it is important to objectively demonstrate similar physical
      characteristics of anastomosis created using RHAP and standard square knots. This study aims
      to compare the burst pressure of cadaveric porcine small bowel anastomosis constructed using
      RHAP and standard square knots on a flat surface and in a simulated deep body cavity.

      The investigators are conducting a prospective randomized controlled study of novice medical
      students allocated to proficiency-based training in RHAP and square surgical knots. Knot
      tying proficiency will be assessed using a knot-tying checklist. Number of repetitions and
      time required to achieve proficiency will be tracked for each group. Once proficiency has
      been achieved by participants in RHAP and square knots group, each participant will perform
      two-hand sewn small bowel anastomosis using cadaveric porcine small bowel. One anastomosis
      will be performed on a flat surface and the other will be formed in a simulated deep body
      cavity. Burst pressure of the anastomoses will be tested using a column of water, and results
      will be compared between groups. Simple descriptive statistics will be performed for both
      groups. Between group comparisons of knot-tying proficiency and burst pressure will be
      performed using t-test. Learning curves within each group will be analyzed using paired 1-way
      ANOVA. SPSS Statistics (v. 21, IBM, New York, USA) will be used for all statistical analysis,
      with significance set to p&lt;0.05.

      The investigators hypothesize that burst pressure of cadaveric porcine small bowel
      anastomosis will be equivalent for anastomosis constructed using RHAP and standard square
      knots.

      The results of this study will provide further validity evidence in support of RHAP as
      suitable alternative to the square surgical knots.

    <description>Once the enterotomy in the porcine small bowel has been repaired by participants with knots according to the randomized intervention arm, blinded evaluators will tie off one end of the bowel and fill the other end with normal saline. Pressure will be applied the bag of normal saline and the pressure at which the repaired enterotomy leaks will be recorded. The pressure will be recorded in mm Hg.</description>
