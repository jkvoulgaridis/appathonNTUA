  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter global study
      designed to compare the efficacy and safety of tislelizumab in combination with concurrent
      chemoradiotherapy (cCRT) followed by tislelizumab monotherapy versus cCRT alone, and
      tislelizumab given sequentially after cCRT versus cCRT alone, in newly diagnosed stage III
      subjects with locally advanced, unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The primary
      endpoint is centrally-assessed progression free survival (PFS) in the intent-to-treat (ITT)
      population. .

    <measure>Number of Participants With Lung Cancer Symptoms Assessed by the Corresponding Domains of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30 (EORTC-QLQ-C30) and Lung-Cancer Specific QLQ-LC13</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-item, questionnaire assessing quality of life (QoL), psychosocial burden and physical symptoms. It is classified into 15 domains: 5 functional subscales (physical functioning, role functioning, emotional functioning, cognitive functioning, and social functioning); 3 multi-item symptom subscales (fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and pain); each item is measured on a 4 point response scale; (not at all, a little, quite a bit, very much), with the exception of the 2 items measuring global health and QoL, (measured on a 7-point response scale). Scores are linearly transformed to 0 to 100 scores. Scores vary from 0 (worst) to 100 (best) for the functional dimensions and GHS, and from 0 (best) to 100 (worst) for the symptom dimensions; higher scores = better QoL, better functioning, or more severe symptoms, respectively. The LC13 covers 13 typical symptoms of lung cancer patients, such as coughing, pain, dyspnea, sore mouth, peripheral neuropathy, and hair loss.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Lung Cancer Symptoms Assessed by the Corresponding Domains of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30 (EORTC-QLQ-C30) and Lung-Cancer Specific QLQ-LC13</title>
        <description>The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-item, questionnaire assessing quality of life (QoL), psychosocial burden and physical symptoms. It is classified into 15 domains: 5 functional subscales (physical functioning, role functioning, emotional functioning, cognitive functioning, and social functioning); 3 multi-item symptom subscales (fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and pain); each item is measured on a 4 point response scale; (not at all, a little, quite a bit, very much), with the exception of the 2 items measuring global health and QoL, (measured on a 7-point response scale). Scores are linearly transformed to 0 to 100 scores. Scores vary from 0 (worst) to 100 (best) for the functional dimensions and GHS, and from 0 (best) to 100 (worst) for the symptom dimensions; higher scores = better QoL, better functioning, or more severe symptoms, respectively. The LC13 covers 13 typical symptoms of lung cancer patients, such as coughing, pain, dyspnea, sore mouth, peripheral neuropathy, and hair loss.</description>
