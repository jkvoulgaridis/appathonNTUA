    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study looking at past results of the Mastering Diabetes program utilizing a
      survey.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adult past and present participants of Mastering Diabetes will be sent an email asking for
      their participation in the survey. The email will contain a hot link to a REDCap survey which
      will begin with a description of the study followed by a consent form. Once the consent is
      agreed, the survey will ask for participants' demographics and information about the
      variables described below

      No personal identifiable information is being collected.

      The data from this study will help develop a prospective study to better evaluate the
      effectiveness of Mastering Diabetes in controlling diabetes.

      Future comparative studies between programs are anticipated, which will help identify the
      strengths and weaknesses of different programs, as well as identify subpopulations that might
      benefit from one program as opposed to another.

      Data will be shared via posters and papers among the lifestyle medicine community to help
      contribute to better lifestyle interventions.

    <description>The Mastering Diabetes provides a step-by-step program to transition to a low-fat, plant-based, whole-food lifestyle and reduce overwhelm. The program also provides direct access to expert coaches in the online community, which contains others living with all forms of diabetes. I includes access to live Q&amp;A videoconferences twice per month to interact with coaches and personalize the experience.
The program is designed with seven core modules. Many participants continue in the program after completion of the modules for ongoing support.
The cost was $29/month or $249/year, but as of July 2018, only the $249/year option is offered.</description>
