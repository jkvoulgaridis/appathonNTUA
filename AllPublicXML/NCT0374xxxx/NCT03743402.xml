      In the Pain Self-Management Training for Opioid Taper (PSMOT) study, the effectiveness of a
      multicomponent intervention will be tested, compared with usual care, on opioid dose and pain
      outcomes among patients on high dose (≥ 50 mg morphine equivalent dose) long-term opioid
      therapy in a randomized controlled trial. This intervention will have 4 components: a)
      telephone-delivered evidence-based pain self-management training, b) web-based video of
      successfully tapered patients with motivational interviewing debriefing, c) a voluntary,
      self-paced opioid taper, and d) opioid and non-opioid prescribing guidance for the patient's
      primary care provider.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a National Institute on Drug Abuse-funded R34 pilot study of pain self-management training
      for prescription opioid taper support, it was demonstrated that 22 weeks of opioid taper
      support promotes opioid dose reduction more effectively than usual care (43% vs 19% dose
      reduction from baseline) with no increase in pain intensity and significantly reduced
      activity interference. This intervention will now be adapted and tested in a large integrated
      primary care system. To address patients' fears of opioid taper that limited recruitment into
      this pilot study, subjects will be randomized to pain self-management training and then
      offered the option of self-paced opioid taper: Pain Self-Management Training for Opioid Taper
      (PSMOT). Specifically, the effectiveness of this intervention will be tested, compared with
      usual care, on opioid dose and pain outcomes among patients on high dose (≥ 50 mg morphine
      equivalent dose) long-term opioid therapy (LtOT) in a randomized controlled trial. This
      intervention will have 4 components: a) telephone-delivered evidence-based pain
      self-management training, b) web-based video of successfully tapered patients with
      motivational interviewing debriefing, c) a voluntary, self-paced opioid taper, and d) opioid
      and non-opioid prescribing guidance for the patient's primary care provider. Specific Aim 1:
      To adapt a previously developed prescription opioid taper support intervention into a
      telephone-delivered pain self-management training that provides the option for supported
      opioid taper (PSMOT). This will be delivered in multiple primary care clinics by a nurse
      interventionist trained and supervised by a pain psychologist and will include guidance in
      opioid and non-opioid medication prescribing. Specific Aim 2: To test in a randomized trial
      the effects of this PSMOT intervention on: a) opioid outcomes: daily opioid dose (primary
      outcome), percent dose reduction from baseline, problem opioid use (interview, questionnaire,
      and electronic health record text indicators), and patient-reported opioid problems; and b)
      pain-related outcomes: PEG (self-report of Pain intensity, Enjoyment of life interference,
      General activity interference; primary outcome), pain self-efficacy, and depression symptoms.
      Hypotheses pertaining to opioid use: Patients receiving LtOT for chronic non-cancer pain
      (CNCP) randomized to the PSMOT intervention, as compared with those randomized to usual care,
      will have lower opioid doses, greater percent reduction of opioid dose, lower proportions
      with problem opioid use, and lower levels of patient-reported opioid-related problems at 6
      and 12 months after randomization. Hypotheses pertaining to pain outcomes: Patients receiving
      LtOT for CNCP randomized to the PSMOT intervention, as compared with those randomized to
      usual care, will have lower PEG scores, higher levels of pain self-efficacy, and lower levels
      of depressive symptoms at 6 and 12 months after randomization. The proposed trial will
      determine whether pain self-management training can promote prescription opioid taper in
      higher-dose long-term opioid therapy patients without increasing pain levels or activity
      interference. If this trial is successful, then prescribers and patients may be able to
      pursue supported opioid taper without fear of escalating pain.
