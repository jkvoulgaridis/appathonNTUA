  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate a blood test to measure circulating tumor
      DNA (ctDNA). It is hypothesized that ctDNA may identify patients who can be considered for
      additional therapy. 40 People with non-metastatic non-small cell lung cancer will be asked to
      take part in this study. Participants will have approximately 3 teaspoons of blood withdrawn
      from a vein at three different times. These times will be before primary treatment (either
      surgery or radiation therapy), 1 month after primary treatment, and 4 months after primary
      treatment.

      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate a blood test to measure circulating tumor
      DNA (ctDNA). It is hypothesized that ctDNA may identify patients who can be considered for
      additional therapy. 40 People with non-metastatic non-small cell lung cancer will be asked to
      take part in this study. Participants will have approximately 3 teaspoons of blood withdrawn
      from a vein at three different times. These times will be before primary treatment (either
      surgery or radiation therapy), 1 month after primary treatment, and 4 months after primary
      treatment. The total amount of blood withdrawn during the study will be approximately 9
      teaspoons. Participants will be followed every 3 months for 12 months to determine if a
      confirmed recurrence or progression has occurred. Participants will also be asked to complete
      questionnaires on their quality of life and their smoking behaviors. As part of this study, a
      blood sample will be obtained and DNA from participants blood sample will be purified. DNA,
      or deoxyribonucleic acid, stores and transmits inherited traits, such as eye color or blood
      type. As part of this research project, participant's DNA will be studied in an effort to
      find out if there are genes that contribute to medical conditions like their cancer that are
      part of the study. If participants have surgery to have tumor removed or if participants have
      a biopsy of their tumor, the study would like to take some of the leftover tissue to purify
      and study the DNA from the tissue sample.

For the QLQ-C30 - All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level. For the QLQ-LC13 - All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high score for the scales and single items represents a high level of symptomatology or problems.</description>

    <description>ctDNA measures will be taken and descriptive statistics will be estimated. These include means, standard deviations, and 95% confidence intervals. Next, within group changes in ctDNA levels will be measured for each of the four groups. These change values will be estimated with 95% confidence intervals. In addition, paired t-tests will be performed to determine whether there were statistically significant changes in ctDNA levels at time points post-treatment or follow-up. After these paired analyses are performed, an exploratory longitudinal mixed model will be fit to examine the change in ctDNA levels.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with histologically confirmed or clinically suspected stage I, II or III
             NSCLC, provided such patients will be scheduled for a procedure that will provide
             histologic confirmation of the diagnosis (if the procedure does not provide histologic
             confirmation of the diagnosis of NSCLC the particular patient will be removed from the
             study and replaced).

          -  Scheduled for treatment with surgery or radiotherapy (Stage I), surgery and
             chemotherapy (Stage II), or chemoradiotherapy (Stage III). For stage I receiving
             radiotherapy, treatment must be stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) consisting
             of 3-5 fractions.

          -  Ability to provide blood sample at the following time points: pre-treatment, 1 month
             post definitive treatment, and 4 post definitive treatment.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign an IRB-approved informed consent
             document.

          -  Staging studies including PET-CT for all patients prior to the initiation of primary
             treatment, as a pretreatment requirement. For patients with Stage II and III, MRI or
             CT of the brain is needed prior to the initiation of primary treatment. Patients,
             however, may be registered and have the pretreatment blood sample collected, provided
             that the staging studies are being scheduled. Registered patients who are found, after
             screening tests, to have Stage IV disease will be removed from the study and replaced.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Females who are pregnant

          -  History of organ transplant.

          -  For stage II and III patients, must be able to receive chemotherapy.

          -  Active cardiovascular issues in the past 6 months.
