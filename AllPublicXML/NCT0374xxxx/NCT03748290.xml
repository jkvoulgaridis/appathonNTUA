  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Central neuropathic pain (CNP) is defined as chronic pain due to injury or disease in the
      central nervous system. This pain is most common among people with a spinal cord injuries
      (SCI), with a prevalence of about 50%. The central pain usually develops within a few months
      of spinal cord injury - and this period is significance in terms of this research work. This
      pain is one of the most complex and challenging pain syndromes. One of the reasons for this
      stems from its adherence to most treatments. Another reason is that there is partial
      information about the mechanism responsible for its development. Animal studies suggest that
      it is possible to prevent and / or reduce its development or reduce its strength by
      preventive treatment (given immediately after the injury). Currently, the treatments found to
      prevent or reduce central pain in animals are anti Inflammation and neuronal excitability
      suppressors such as interleukin 10.

      The purpose of this study,is to explore whether pre-treatment with pregabalin prior to the
      development of the central pain will prevent the incidence of pain or reduce its intensity by
      improving pain regulation and reducing hypersensitivity.

      The goal of the pharmacotherapy is to reduce the hypersensitivity- lyrica is used to reduce
      chronic neuropathic pain by reducing the degree of hypersensitivity in the pain system.

      the objectives of this study are to examine whether early treatment of central pain can
      prevent or reduce the incidence of pain by improving pain regulation and reducing
      hypersensitivity. That is, whether there will be a difference between those who take
      Lyrica-Pregabalin (a drug that reduces hypersensitivity of pain) compared to placebo.

      Methods: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in which people with a fresh
      SCI will receive lyrica or placebo as soon as possible from their arrival at the
      rehabilitation hospital for 2-3 months during which pain system characteristics will be
      measured and monitored for central pain development.

    <masking_description>The placebo pills will be purchased from Trilog, which is licensed and licensed by the Ministry of Health to prepare random drug kits (the company has an agreement with Sheba). The drug will be used by the company that supplies the drug and placebo, so that the researchers in the study did not know which treatment was given to each patient. This information will be received at the end of the study, or if the subjects for any reason participate in the research</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Central neuropathic pain severity: McGill pain questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Two major quantitative parameters are derived: (1) the number of words chosen (NWC) by the subject from a list of descriptors (total score ranges between 0-19), and (2) the pain rating index (PRI)â€” based on summing the rank values of these words (total score ranges between 0-65). Higher values represent worse outcome.</description>

    <measure>Pain modulation capacity - Visual analog scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>0=no pain, 10=most intense pain imaginable, Higher values in the VAS represent worse outcome. This outcome will be assessed with the conditioned pain modulation and the temporal summation experimental paradigms.
The Conditioned Pain Modulation (CPM) paradigm is an experimental paradigm the results of which indicate on the capacity of the pain modulation systems. The magnitude of CPM will be the outcome measure and it is calculated by subtracting a pain rating on the VAS of a noxious stimulus administered alone and in the presence of another, remote stimulus.
The temporal summation of pain (TSP) paradigm is an experimental paradigm the results of which indicate on the level of excitability of the pain system. The magnitude of TSP will be the outcome measure and it is calculated by subtracting a pain rating on the VAS given at the termination of a continuous noxious stimulus from that given at the beginning of the same stimulus.</description>
