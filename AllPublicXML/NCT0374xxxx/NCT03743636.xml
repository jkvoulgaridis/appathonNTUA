  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      NICE is a randomized clinical trial that will examine the effects of nicotinamide riboside
      (NR) both with and without resveratrol to test whether, among people with PAD, NR
      significantly improves walking performance more than placebo and whether NR combined with
      resveratrol significantly improves walking performance more than placebo. If our findings
      support our hypotheses, results will be used to design a large, definitive randomized
      clinical.

      We will randomize 90 participants with PAD to one of the following three groups: NR +
      resveratrol, NR + placebo, or placebo + placebo. Our primary outcome is change in six-minute
      walk distance between baseline and 6-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes are change in
      maximal treadmill walking time, patient-reported walking ability (measured by the Walking
      Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ)), quality of life (measured by the Short Form-36 Physical
      Functioning (SF-36 PF) score), and physical activity (measured by accelerometer). Calf
      skeletal muscle biopsy specimens collected in participants in the NICE Trial will be analyzed
      for NAD+ abundance, stem cell (satellite cell) abundance and muscle fiber phenotype.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        All participants will have PAD. PAD will be defined as an ankle-brachial index (ABI) &lt;0.90
        at the baseline study visit.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Above- or below-knee amputation.

          2. Critical limb ischemia.

          3. Wheelchair-bound or requiring a walker to ambulate.

          4. Walking is limited by a symptom other than PAD.

          5. Current foot ulcer on bottom of foot.

          6. End stage renal disease defined as a GFR less than 20 ml/min/1.73 M2.

          7. Significant liver impairment defined as two or more hepatic function enzymes &gt;3.0
             times the upper limit of normal. [NOTE: participants who meet this criterion may
             undergo a re-test of hepatic function tests to determine whether initially elevated
             hepatic enzymes represented a transient or spurious phenomenon.]

          8. Failure to successfully complete the 2-week study run-in.

          9. Planned lower extremity revascularization, orthopedic surgery, or other major surgery
             during the next six months.

         10. Lower extremity revascularization, orthopedic surgery, cardiovascular event, coronary
             revascularization, or other major surgery in the previous three months.

         11. Participation in supervised treadmill exercise during the previous three months.

         12. Major medical illness including renal disease requiring dialysis, lung disease
             requiring oxygen, Parkinson's disease, a life-threatening illness with life expectancy
             less than six months, or cancer requiring treatment in the previous two years. [NOTE:
             potential participants may still qualify if they have had treatment for an early stage
             cancer in the past two years and the prognosis is excellent. Participants who only use
             oxygen at night may still qualify.]

         13. Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) score &lt;23 or dementia.

         14. Participation in or completion of a clinical trial in the previous three months.
             [NOTE: after completing a stem cell or gene therapy intervention, participants will
             become eligible after the final study follow-up visit of the stem cell or gene therapy
             study so long as at least six months have passed since the final intervention
             administration. After completing a supplement or drug therapy (other than stem cell or
             gene therapy), participants will be eligible after the final study follow-up visit as
             long as at least three months have passed since the final intervention of the trial.]

         15. Currently taking study drug(s) or has taken study drug(s) in past six months.

         16. Increase in angina or angina at rest

         17. Non-English speaking.

         18. Visual impairment that limits walking ability.

         19. Women who are pregnant or who are pre-menopausal will not be eligible.

         20. In addition to the above criteria, investigator discretion will be used to determine
             if the trial is unsafe or not a good fit for the potential participant.

        Potentially eligible participants will be advised that Medicare coverage for 12 weeks of
        supervised treadmill exercise is now available. Potential participants who have not
        participated in supervised treadmill exercise covered by Medicare and who desire to
        participate will be referred back to their physician for follow-up. These individuals may
        become eligible six months after they complete supervised treadmill exercise.

        Vulnerable populations (fetuses, pregnant women, children, prisoners, and institutionalized
        persons) and adults unable to consent will not be included in the study.
