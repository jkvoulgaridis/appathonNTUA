  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective randomized study to examine the effects of exposure to dulaglutide
      on the prevention of stress-hyperglycemia and the metabolic inflammatory response in the
      perioperative period

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stress hyperglycemia is common in the perioperative period and is associated with increased
      risk of death postoperatively. Counterregulatory hormones and inflammatory mediators appear
      to modulate the acute biological response to stress; however, the pathophysiological pathways
      that result in stress hyperglycemia and its link to poor clinical outcomes are not well
      understood. At least half of non-Diabetes Mellitus (DM) patients undergoing cardiac surgery
      develop stress hyperglycemia shown to be an independent risk factor of morbidity and
      mortality. The current approach to treat hyperglycemia with insulin has major limitations
      including high resource utilization and high risk of hypoglycemia.The main goals of the study
      are to examine baseline and postoperative metabolic profiles of non-diabetic CABG patients
      with stress hyperglycemia and to study the effect of a long-acting GLP-1 RA on the prevention
      of stress-hyperglycemia and modulation of metabolic stress during cardiac surgery.

      The Study will be conducted in 2 Parts. The First part of the study aims to provide new
      insights into the mechanisms underlying the metabolic and inflammatory responses to surgical
      stress The first part is a nested case control study.The Second part of the study will
      examine whether exposure to a long acting glucagon like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1
      RA), dulaglutide can improve glycemic control and ameliorate the inflammatory response to
      acute surgical stress. This study is a randomized study with assignment to either dulaglutide
      or placebo two to three days prior to surgery in non-Diabetes Mellitus obese patients (BG&lt;126
      mg/dL, HbA1c &lt;6.5%, BMI &gt;27, age&gt; 45 years) undergoing CABG surgery.The study ultimately
      wants to provide evidence to support the use of novel therapies to prevent and manage stress
      hyperglycemia in the inpatient setting.

    <description>Stress-hyperglycemia is defined as Blood Glucose levels &gt;140 mg/dl and requiring insulin therapy during the postoperative period. To to determine if dulaglutide can prevent stress-hyperglycemia, number of Blood Glucose levels (BG) &gt; 140 mg/dl during post operative period between patients randomized to dulaglutide or placebo arms are recorded and compared. Information on BG measurements both at bedside by glucose meter and by hospital laboratory will be collected. BG will be measured every 1-2 hour during continuous insulin infusion (CII) in the ICU, and before meals and at bedtime after transition to regular wards.</description>
