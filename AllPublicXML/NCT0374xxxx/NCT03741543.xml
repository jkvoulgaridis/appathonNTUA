  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this study is to investigate how home dwelling people with early-stage
      dementia cope with their disease, explored through their participation in a 12-week health
      promotion course, through 3 sub-studies; 1) The users' experience in gaining information
      about dementia and meeting others in the same situation, 2) observation of the group
      interactions and support processes, and 3) investigate the effect of the 12-week health
      promotion course for people with early stage dementia on their cognitive function,
      psychosocial function and health behaviour.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators build on a health promotion intervention originally
      developed by Buettner and Fitzimmons (2009), called &quot;Health Promotion for the Mind, Body, and
      Spirit&quot;. The Health Promotion intervention consists of 12 weekly 2-hour sessions. Each group
      has up to 6 participants, and the groups are facilitated by two professional group leaders.
      The course has been designed to provide information on the disease process and on healthy
      behaviours to prevent problems that are common later in the disease. The 12-week course
      includes nutrition, cognitive fitness, stress reduction, communication, information about the
      course of the disease, and coping strategies. During the first class session, each
      participant received a nametag and a booklet. This booklet is a critical component of the
      educational method for the participants. The booklet contains 12 dividers for the 12 modules
      that the instructor taught during the course. The caregiver is not present at the course,
      however the participants are encouraged to share the booklet provided at the course with the
      caregiver between sessions.

      Design: a quasi-experimental study with multiple methods:

        1. assessment of cognitive function, psychosocial function and health behaviour is
           collected at baseline (prior to attending the 12-week course) and follow-up interviews
           are arranged shortly after the 12-week course. For each participant a caregiver also has
           to take part for proxy interviews.

        2. the users' experience of attending the 12-week health promotion course will be collected
           through qualitative individual interviews with the participants and their caregiver
           after attending the course.

        3. over the duration of the course a moderate participant observation will be carried out
           to explore changes over the 12-week course, in-session behaviour, social interaction and
           to capture motivational and empowering aspects of the course.

    <description>Qualitative data will be collected through semi-structured individual interviews with both participants and their caregiver (proxy), and through moderate participant observations following the participants over the duration of the 12-week course. The interview guide and observational protocol consist of pre-selected topics, including (1) communication, (2) participant engagement, (3) social interaction within the group, (4) peer support (5) change in perception of living with dementia and (6) educational outcome. The qualitative data will be explored using content analysis.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in depressive symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Depressive symptoms will be measured by the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD) (Alexopoulos et al., 1988).The CSDD is an assessment of signs and symptoms of depression in people with dementia. Each item is rated for severity on a scale of 0-2 (0=absent, 1=mild or intermittent, 2=severe). Sum score above 10 indicate a probable major depression. Scores above 18 indicate a definite major depression. Scores below 6 are associated with absence of significant depressive symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in self-rated health</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Self-rated health will be measured by The EuroQol visual analogue scale (VAS) (The EuroQol group, 1990). The EQ VAS measures the participants self-rated Health-Related Quality of Life on a vertical, visual analogue scale, form 0-100. Where 0 presents &quot;worst imaginable health state&quot; and 100 represents &quot;best-imagined health state&quot;.</description>

    <measure>Change in managing personal activities of daily life</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The levels of personal functioning in daily life will be measured by Lawton and Brody's Physical Self-Maintenance Scale. The sum-score is based on six items (range 0-30), with higher scores indicating a lower function.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in managing instrumental activities of daily life</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The levels of instrumental functioning in daily life will be measured by Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale (I-ADL) (Lawton et al, 1969). The I-ADL sum-score is based on eight items (range 0-31), with higher scores indicating a lower function.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in neuropsychiatric symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Neuropsychiatric symptoms will be assessed using The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) (Cummings, et al., 1994), a 12-item questionnaire developed to assess behavioural disturbances in people with dementia. Scores are entered for the frequency and degree of seriousness of each symptom over the last four weeks, and subsequently multiplied into a symptom score. The total possible maximum score is 144. A higher score reflects increased frequency and severity of the disturbances.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in carer stress/burden</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>To measure caregiver burden the Relative Stress Scale (RSS), will be used. RSS assesses the caregiver burden for people caring for individuals with dementia. The RSS has 15 different questions, each scored 0-4 (0=never/not at all, 1=rarely/a little, =sometimes/moderately, 3=frequently/quite a lot, 4=always/considerably perceived burden), with a total score range of 0-60. Higher scores reflect a higher reported caregiver burden.</description>
