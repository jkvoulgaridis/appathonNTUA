      This trial is aimed to study the immunological and pathological characteristics of influenza
      versus non-influenza severe community-acquired pneumonia patients in ICU, and correlate
      findings with occurrence of secondary invasive pulmonary aspergillosis infection.

      All consecutive patients aged 18 or older admitted to ICU during the inclusion period with
      respiratory distress due to influenza positive/negative community acquired pneumonia (CAP)
      will be included.
