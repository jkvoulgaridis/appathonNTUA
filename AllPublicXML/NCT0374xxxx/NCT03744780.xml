  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Emotional eating is a behaviour that has been linked to weight concerns, mental health
      concerns, and disordered eating. Effective interventions have been developed to treat
      emotional eating, however these exist solely in the context of promoting weight loss.
      Emotional eating is not exclusive to those who struggle with weight and thus interventions
      are needed that target those who engage in emotional eating regardless of their weight
      status. The present study aims to do so through the implementation of a one day Acceptance
      and Commitment Therapy (ACT) workshop for emotional eaters.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Emotional eating is defined as increased food consumption in response to negative emotions,
      and has been linked to weight concerns, mental health concerns, and disordered eating
      behaviours. Effective interventions have been developed that address emotional eating, namely
      to improve weight loss. Such interventions are based in Acceptance and Commitment Therapy
      (ACT), which encourages tolerance of internal cues, such as emotions, and external cues, such
      as food.

      Emotional eating, however, is not exclusive to those who struggle with their weight. Many
      individuals maintain a normal weight despite engaging in emotional eating. These individuals
      still consume an excess of high calorie (for which they somehow eventually compensate), high
      fat, and high sugar foods as part of their emotional eating. Unhealthy dietary habits such as
      these have been shown to be associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality, as well
      as health concerns including diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Individuals with normal
      weight are not eligible for ACT programs described above, despite the increased risk of
      health concerns associated with emotional eating.

      The present study aims to test the feasibility and acceptability of a one-day ACT workshop to
      reduce emotional eating and improve health that is not focused on weight loss as its primary
      outcome, and rather targets all individuals who engage in emotional eating.

    <time_frame>Assessed from baseline to 2-weeks post-intervention and 3-months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Emotional eating, as assessed by the Dutch Eating Behaviour Questionnaire Emotional Eating Subscale (DEBQ-EE). Participants are asked to rate the frequency with which they engage in particular eating behaviours, on a 5-point Likert-type rating scale from never (1) to very often (5), with higher scores reflecting higher emotional eating. Only the emotional eating subscale of the DEBQ will be assessed and is calculated by averaging the 13 items that assess emotional eating.</description>

    <description>Distress tolerance, as assessed by the Distress Tolerance Scale (DTS). Participants are asked to indicate the extent to which they agree with statements aimed at assessing distress tolerance, absorption, appraisal, and regulation from 1 (strongly agree) to 5 (strongly disagree), with lower scores reflecting lower distress tolerance. Subscale scores are derived by calculating the means of the items that make up each subscale. Total score is calculating by averaging the four subscales.</description>

Minimum score is 10 and maximum score is 60.</description>

    <description>Mindful eating, as assessed by the Mindful Eating Questionnaire (MEQ). It is a 28-item self-report measure that assesses five domains of mindful eating: disinhibition, external cues, awareness, emotional response and distraction. Participants are asked to indicate the extent to which extent they agree with each item from 1 (&quot;never&quot; / &quot;rarely&quot;) to 4 (&quot;usually&quot;/ &quot;always&quot;), with higher scores reflecting higher levels of mindful eating. Total score is derived by taking the mean of the five subscales.</description>

    <description>This is a one-day intervention using Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) technique to target and reduce emotional eating. The intervention will be modeled after Frayn and Knäuper's (2016) brief emotional eating intervention, which was derived from Forman et al.'s (2013) &quot;Mind Your Health program&quot;. During the workshop, the following topics will be discussed, based on the three processes of ACT: (1) values clarification/commitment, (2) acceptance/distress tolerance, and (3) mindfulness/awareness.</description>

          <description>Emotional eating, as assessed by the Dutch Eating Behaviour Questionnaire Emotional Eating Subscale (DEBQ-EE). Participants are asked to rate the frequency with which they engage in particular eating behaviours, on a 5-point Likert-type rating scale from never (1) to very often (5), with higher scores reflecting higher emotional eating. Only the emotional eating subscale of the DEBQ will be assessed and is calculated by averaging the 13 items that assess emotional eating.</description>

Participants are asked to indicate the extent to which extent they agree with each item from 1 (“never” / “rarely”) to 4 (“usually”/ “always”), with higher scores reflecting higher levels of mindful eating. Total score is derived by taking the mean of the five subscales.</description>

          <description>Distress tolerance, as assessed by the Distress Tolerance Scale (DTS). Participants are asked to indicate the extent to which they agree with statements aimed at assessing distress tolerance, absorption, appraisal, and regulation from 1 (strongly agree) to 5 (strongly disagree), with lower scores reflecting lower distress tolerance. Subscale scores are derived by calculating the means of the items that make up each subscale. Total score is calculating by averaging the four subscales.</description>
