  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background : Non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are responsible for 25% of reported
      adverse drug events which include immunological and non-immunological hypersensitivity
      reactions. NSAIDs have been reported to be the second most common cause of drug-induced
      hypersensitivity reaction (DHR). They are almost mandatory in a human life and therefore, the
      drug allergy work-up goes up until a DPT in order to confirm or rule out the diagnosis.

      Objective: Detect eliciting dose thresholds during NSAIDs DPT in order to suggest optimal
      step doses and to describe subgroups at higher risk during the DPT

      Methods:This retrospective study, using the survival analysis, comprised all patients who
      attended the allergy service of the UH of Montpellier from 1997 till 2017 with a clinical
      history related to NSAIDs DHR, who underwent NDAIDs DPT that turned positive and who gave
      their consent to be included in the study . The Patients are selected from the Drug Allergy &amp;
      Hypersensitivity Database (DAHD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      DHRs to NSAIDs may be induced by both specific immunological mechanisms and mechanisms not
      based on immunological recognition (cross-hypersensitivity reactions [CRs]) .They are almost
      mandatory in a human life and therefore, the drug allergy work-up goes up until a DPT in
      order to confirm or rule out the diagnosis. Although the overall prevalence of NSAID
      hypersensitivity has been reported between 0.6 and 7% of the general population .

      The NSAIDs‚Äêinduced hypersensitivity reactions involve different mechanisms and present a wide
      range of clinical manifestations from anaphylaxis or severe bronchospasm developing within
      minutes after drug ingestion to non-immediate responses appearing after days and weeks This
      data-driven approach in designing the DPT protocol is the second step in improving DPT
      standardization, after BL antibiotics.
