  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patellofemoral pain (PFP) is the most common chronic pathology in sports medicine and
      physiotherapy clinics. As pain and inflammation are the main symptoms of PFP, non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory and analgesic medications are often utilized to decrease pain and
      inflammation; however alternative treatments are increasingly being sought due to the
      cardiovascular and gastrointestinal side effects of traditional pain medications. Most
      researchers advocate conservative treatment, though there is still insufficient clarity
      regarding the effectiveness of conservative treatment modalities. Dietary interventions for
      PFP have not received any attention in clinical literature, yet there is a growing body of
      evidence indicating that cherries have significant anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and
      pain-mediating effects.

      Therefore, the primary purpose of the proposed investigation was to test (using a randomized
      control investigation) the ability of a tart cherry juice blend to provide symptom relief in
      recreational athletes with PFP and to understand the biological and mechanical mechanisms
      behind any changes in PFP symptoms.

    <measure>Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) - patellofemoral scale</measure>
    <time_frame>6-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This is a questionnaire based measurement that allows participants to subjectively rate the extent of their patellofemoral pain symptoms. This measurement is scored on a 0-100 scale with 100 indicating no pain.</description>

    <measure>COOP-WONCA - psychological wellbeing</measure>
    <time_frame>6-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This is a questionnaire based measurement that allows participants to subjectively rate their psychological wellbeing. This measurement provides a value that is an average score of 6 questions (overall health, daily activities, physical fitness, feelings, social activities and change in health) that range from 1-5. A lower score indicates better psychological wellbeing.</description>

    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality index, is a questionnaire that consists of 19 self-rated questions, grouped into 7 components. Each component is scored separately, weighted equally on a 0 - 3 scale and the scores of the 7 components are then added to give a global score, which has a range of 0 - 21 with higher scores indicating worse sleep quality.</description>
