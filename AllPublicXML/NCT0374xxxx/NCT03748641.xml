    <textblock>
      This study will assess efficacy and safety of niraparib in combination with AA-P for the
      treatment of participants with metastatic prostate cancer. Niraparib is an orally available,
      highly selective poly (adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, with
      potent activity against PARP-1 and PARP-2 deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-repair polymerases. AA
      is a pro-drug of abiraterone and selectively inhibits the enzyme 17α-hydroxylase/C17,20-lyase
      (CYP17), which is found in the testes and adrenals, as well as in prostate tissues and
      tumors. In participants with metastatic prostate cancer, DNA-repair gene defects (DRD) are
      identified in approximately 15 percent (%) to 20% of tumors. The study will consist of 4
      phases: a prescreening phase for biomarker evaluation only, a screening phase, a double-blind
      treatment phase, and a follow up phase. During the prescreening phase participants will be
      evaluated for DRD and then will be assigned to one of the 2 cohorts based on their biomarker
      status. Treatment will be administered daily and is planned to be continuous until disease
      progression, unacceptable toxicity, death, or the sponsor terminates the study. Efficacy,
      pharmacokinetics, biomarkers, participants reported outcomes and safety will be assessed. The
      total duration of study will be approximately up to 73 months.

    <measure>Radiographic Progression Free Survival (rPFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 40 months</time_frame>
    <description>As per blinded independent central review, rPFS is defined as time from randomization date to date of radiographic progression or death, whichever occurs first. Radiographic progression will be evaluated by Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3) as follows: progression of soft tissue lesions measured by computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging as per response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) 1.1; progression by bone lesions observed by bone scan and based on PCWG3. As per criteria, any bone progression must be confirmed by a subsequent scan greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 6 weeks later. Week 8 scan will be baseline to which all subsequent scans will be compared to determine progression. Bone progression is defined as one of the following: participants whose confirmatory scan shows &gt;=2 new lesions will be considered to have bone scan progression and who did not show &gt;= 2 new lesions will not be considered to have bone scan progression when compared to Week 8 scan.</description>

    <description>Time to symptomatic progression is defined as the need to initiate/record any of the following; a. the use of external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) for skeletal symptoms; b. the need for tumor-related orthopedic surgical intervention; c. other cancer-related procedures (for example: nephrostomy insertion, bladder catheter insertion, EBRT, or surgery for tumor symptoms other than skeletal); d. cancer-related morbid events (for example: fracture [symptomatic and/or pathologic, cord compression, urinary obstructive events); e. initiation of new systemic anti-cancer therapy because of cancer pain.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants with Treatment-Emergent Adverse events (TEAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately up to 73 months</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant administered a medicinal (investigational or non investigational) product. AE does not necessarily have a causal relationship with intervention. AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with use of a medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product, whether or not related to that medicinal product. TEAEs are those events that occur or worsen on or after first dose of study drug through 30 days after last dose of study drug.</description>

Severity criteria includes grades:1) Mild: easily tolerated, causing minimal discomfort and no interference with everyday activities 2) Moderate: sufficient discomfort to cause interference with normal activity 3) Severe: extreme distress, significant impairment of functioning/incapacitation. Prevents everyday activities 4) Life-threatening: urgent intervention indicated 5) Death</description>
