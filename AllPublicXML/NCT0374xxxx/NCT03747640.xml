    <description>The Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory (FMI) is a 14-item instrument. Respondents indicate their experiences relating to the items on a 4-point Likert scale (rarely, occasionally, fairly often and almost always), and the total score is calculated by adding all the scores on the 14 items of the FMI. Total scores range from 14-56, with higher scores indicating higher levels of mindfulness.</description>
