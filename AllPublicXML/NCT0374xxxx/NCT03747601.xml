  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to translate temporal interference (TI) stimulation
      methodology into humans and examine its safety, feasibility, steerability, and focality. In
      the proposed early phase human experiment, the ability to apply TI stimulation will be
      assessed along spatial dimensions to selectively modulate neural activity and assess the
      feasibility of selective targeting deep brain structures without exciting overlaying cortex.
      The overall goal of the study is to advance TI methodology and its translation to humans.

      The specific aims in this study are to

        -  Assess the safety of TI stimulation.

        -  Assess the feasibility, focality, and steerability of TI stimulation by selectively
           modulating activity in subregions of a cortical area (calcarine cortex)

      It is hypothesized that TI stimulation can be used to impact different regions of the visual
      field that are represented within the calcarine fissure of the human brain.

      It is hypothesized that TI will be well tolerated by human subjects and side effects will be
      consistent with other forms of transcranial electric current stimulation (tES).

      This is an investigational early phase testing of temporal interference (TI) stimulation in
      humans. The overall aim of the study is to assess the safety, feasibility, focality, and
      steerability of TI stimulation by selectively modulating activity in subregions of a cortical
      area (calcarine cortex - the primary visual cortex)

      Healthy subjects who meet inclusion and exclusion criteria will be entered into the study.
      The study will recruit up to 20 subjects with the aim to complete 12 subjects.

      Study Visits:

      The study will consist of up to 6 study visits. The screening and baseline visit, the MRI
      visit, and up to 4 TI study. The screening and baseline visit and TI visits will occur at
      Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in the Berenson-Allen Center. The MRI visit will take
      place at the Boston University Cognitive Neuroimaging Center. After Informed Consent is
      obtained, the following screening and baseline procedures will be completed:

        -  Inclusion and exclusion criteria review

        -  Subject demographics

        -  Handedness assessment

        -  Medical history and medication review

        -  Physical and Neurological exam conducted by a Neurologist or Neurologic Nurse
           Practitioner

        -  Baseline perimetry assessment

        -  Baseline EEG

        -  The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) assessment

        -  All female subjects will undergo a pregnancy test and pregnant women will be excluded

        -  Screening for retinotopic mapping - assessing the participant's ability to hold fixation
           with their eyes for experimental trials

        -  MRI safety review

      The MRI session will take place at the Boston University Cognitive Neuroimaging Center under
      a Boston University submitted and approved protocol that is specific to this study. An MRI
      scan of the brain will be conducted while the participant views visual stimuli to obtain each
      individual's retinotopic map. This data will be provided to the study team at Beth Israel
      Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) to conduct the study visit and for analysis.

      Each subject will then undergo up to 4 TI stimulation sessions (2 minimum) separated by at
      least 2 days to minimize the risk of carry over effects of the stimulation. In each visit,
      the participant will receive TI stimulation to one of four regions of retinotopic
      representation in the calcarine fissure:

        1. peripheral visual field in the deep region of the fissure

        2. foveal visual field in the polar region of the fissure

        3. superior quadrant of the visual field in the lower bank of the fissure

        4. inferior quadrant of the visual field in the upper bank of the fissure The cortical
           targets will be defined by electrical field modelling that will be used to optimize the
           electrode placement. Regions #1 and #2 will be stimulated in the first two visits with
           the order of stimulation regions to be counterbalanced between participants. If an
           effect is noted, participants will be asked to complete the additional 2 visits in which
           regions #3 and #4 will be stimulated.

      Each visit will consist of up to 4 blocks of stimulation paired with a visual discrimination
      task and assessment of visual disturbance with an Amsler grid. The stimulation blocks will
      each be completed at a different frequency - a control stimulation where TI visual effect is
      not anticipated (e.g 2 or 20 hertz (Hz)), a no offset stimulation (e.g. matched carrier
      stimulation frequencies such as no envelope modulation is anticipated) and up to 2
      frequencies ranging from 8 to 12. The most common signal from visual cortex during wakeful
      relaxation is in the frequency range (8-12 Hz). It is hypothesized that TI with a residual
      effective stimulation frequency of 1-20 Hz will be ideally suited for activation of the
      targeted visual cortex.

      Participants will be monitored throughout he visit for any adverse effects and a tES
      side-effect questionnaire will be administered at the beginning and end of each stimulation
      visit to additionally track any adverse effects. Although any visual disruption induced by
      the stimulation is expected and anticipated to be transient in nature, a visual perimetry
      assessment will be completed to compare to baseline.

    <description>2-4 Temporal Interference stimulation sessions. The device is an experimental non-invasive electrical brain stimulator that functions similar to existing non-significant risk devices for electrical stimulation, including human non-invasive brain stimulation. Briefly, the device produces alternating current electrical stimulation in a kilohertz (kHz) range and results in less net charge applied within the brain. The device is powered by rechargeable 20 volt (V) battery (i.e. there is no connection to building power supply). The current is hardwired and limited to 5 milliamp (mA) via internal resistors. It includes extra safety features such as onboard fuses to limit any abrupt high current, and an emergency stop button which effectively insulates the subject and resets the device. The device was tested and characterized at all the required load conditions.</description>
