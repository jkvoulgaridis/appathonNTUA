      This study investigates the psychophysiological responses to aversive stimuli in a population
      of 133 children clinically diagnosed with conduct disorder (CD) and/or
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Participants were administered with either
      omega-3 or placebo for a period of 6 months and were exposed to three stimuli every three
      months: 1) a loud sound, 2) threatening photographs from the International Affective Picture
      System (IAPS), and 3) the Trier Social Stress Task (TSST). Participants' psychophysiological
      features of heart rate and galvanic skin conductance were measured and analyzed in relation
      to their omega-3/placebo condition clinical diagnosis.

    <description>Children in this group will be given 400 mg of DHA and 600 mg of EPA. Caregivers will be instructed to give two 500mg Omega-3 capsules twice a day, at breakfast and at the evening meal for 6 months. Parents will be seen by the attending on a monthly basis for standard treatment procedure.</description>

    <description>Omega-3 supplement is a highly concentrated fish oil brain booster supplement that helps compensate for the neurocognitive and brain dysfunction which acts as a predisposition to antisocial and violent behaviour. Individuals with antisocial personality disorder have been found to show an 11% reduction in gray matter in the prefrontal cortex (Raine et al. 2001), and structural prefrontal impairments are hypothesised to result in disinhibition of limbic subcortical structures that give rise to aggressive behaviour. Omega-3 (specifically DHA) is known to play a key role in neuronal structure and function.</description>
