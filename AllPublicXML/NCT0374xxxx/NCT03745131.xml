  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During an outbreak of monkeypox in the UK in 2018, a third generation smallpox vaccine,
      Imvanex, was used for the first time to immunise healthcare workers who had been, or were
      expected to be, in contact with cases of monkeypox. This study will examine the antibody
      responses in these healthcare workers compared to control groups, to provide evidence that
      the vaccine can produce a response consistent with protection when used in this context.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study intends to describe antibody responses to a third generation smallpox vaccine,
      Imvanex® (MVA-BN, Bavarian Nordic GmBH; also known as Imvamune®), in cohorts of individuals
      who received the vaccine for pre-exposure or post-exposure prophylaxis against monkeypox
      during a monkeypox outbreak in the UK. In addition to quantifying anti-vaccinia virus
      antibody responses to vaccine, the study intends to demonstrate that vaccine-induced
      antibodies neutralise the specific monkeypox viruses involved in the UK outbreak, and also
      reference monkeypox viruses. The use of Imvanex® during the UK outbreak represents the first
      ever use of Imvanex® as a public health intervention for a monkeypox outbreak, and this study
      will provide an opportunity to quantify and characterise antibody responses to Imvanex®
      administered in a non-trial setting.
