  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Advanced laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) remains a highly morbid and fatal disease
      despite aggressive interventions. Mortality is high in this cohort: laryngeal cancer affects
      over 13 000 patients in the United States, with over 3500 deaths annually.The results of the
      Veterans Affairs Cooperative Studies Program Laryngeal Cancer Trial and subsequent studies
      demonstrated similar overall survival (OS) rates for organ preservation protocols involving
      radiotherapy (RT) or chemoradiotherapy (CRT) when compared to surgery, with the benefit of
      preserving the larynx in a large majority of patients. As such, the use of RT or CRT has
      become the predominant initial intervention for patients with laryngeal SCC.However, the
      prognosis of recurrent and persistent laryngeal SCC is particularly dire.In this study,the
      investigators sought to identify preoperative predictors of survival for patients with
      recurrent or persistent laryngeal SCC in order to set patient expectations and address
      modifiable risk factors. Identification of predictors of survival may also identify patients
      who could benefit from novel therapeutic agents in a neo/adjuvant fashion. Herein,we examine
      a cohort of patients with recurrent or persistent laryngeal SCC after definitive RT/CRT who
      has undergone total laryngectomy in order to identify potential preoperative predictors of
      clinical outcomes.

      Demographic, clinical, and survival data were abstracted. Death was verified via medical
      records and the social security death index. Primary outcome measures were OS (time from
      salvage laryngectomy to death from any cause), disease-specific survival (DSS; time from
      salvage laryngectomy to death from recurrent/persistent laryngeal SCC), and DFS (time from
      salvage laryngectomy to laryngeal SCC recurrence)
