  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to investigate different approaches of local application of
      antibiotics/antiseptics intraoperatively in Chinese patients undergoing post-mastectomy
      implant based breast reconstruction, and aims to single out an intervention method that
      limits the use of antibiotics and maintains low rates of surgical site infection and capsular
      contracture. Patients who undergo post mastectomy breast reconstruction in the breast
      reconstruction department in Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital are
      eligible to enter the study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is an ongoing trend towards implant based breast reconstruction in post-mastectomy
      patients in China. In 2015, more than 60% of patients undergoing breast reconstruction in
      Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital opted for implant based breast
      reconstruction. One of the major complications in implant based breast reconstruction is
      infection, which could cause implant explantation, delay the time to adjuvant therapies in
      breast cancer patients, and inflict adverse psychological effects. Although empirical
      intravenous and/or oral antibiotics are suggested peri-operatively, local applications of
      antibiotics/antiseptics and their combinations are applied differently in many medical
      centers worldwide, and some even suggest against the use of intraoperative local antibiotics.
      Furthermore, there is no consensus as to the local application of antibiotics
      intraoperatively for breast reconstruction patients in Chinese population. We therefore
      designed an open-label prospective randomized control trial in our Chinese patient population
      to investigate the effects of three different approaches of intraoperative surgical site
      intervention with antibiotics and or antiseptics. In each groups, all peri-operative
      interventions are standardized to best reduce bias. Short-term infection rate and long-term
      capsular contracture rate will be observed in the hope of singling out the best modality in
      our medical center to integrate into the overall comprehensive treatment for female breast
      cancer patients.
