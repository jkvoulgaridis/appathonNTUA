      -  1. Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) could be performed with or without
           extracorporeal circulation (ECC).

        -  2. OSA (Obstructive Sleep Apnea) could be influenced by in intravenous perfusion.

        -  3. ECC could influence the amount of intravenous perfusion administered to the patient.

      The aim of this study was to examine the influence of ECC on the development of OSA.

      (Apnea Hypopnea Index) will be used to assess this potential influence.

    <description>Change from baseline AHI (Apnea Hypopnea Index, which is the average amount of apnea and hypopnea per four of sleep) at the 3rd postoperative day. The AHI is derived from the polysomnography which will be performed to all of the patients the day before surgery and the 3rd postoperative day.</description>
