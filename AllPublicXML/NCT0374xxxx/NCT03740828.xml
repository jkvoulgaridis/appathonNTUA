  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to demonstrate that the KIDScore D3 may be used to identify those
      embryos on Day 3 that are most likely to form blastocysts.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The safety and effectiveness of the KIDScore D3 was investigated in a prospective study. The
      study was performed as a single arm, multicenter clinical study conducted at six sites in the
      United States. This was a non-interventional clinical study where the KIDScore D3 was not
      used during patient treatment. Briefly, the purpose of the study was to collect data to
      evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the KIDScore D3's ability to predict which embryos
      are most likely to develop to blastocyst stage. This was evaluated by using the KIDScore D3
      as adjunct information to traditional morphological grading. Imaging data was collected on
      embryos cultured to day 5. Embryologists were masked to imaging data and evaluation was only
      based on morphology and KIDScore D3 scores.

      This study aims at analyzing the utilization of established morphology methods with adjunct
      outcome of an algorithm (KIDScore D3) that provides a score (1 - 5) from timings of
      morphokinetic events.

      A double-blinded, multi-center study, designed to evaluate the odds ratios and other measures
      for outcomes of methodologies used for embryo assessment: day 3 morphology alone and day 3
      morphology with KIDScore D3 results as adjunct information.

    <description>The primary endpoint of this study was to assess the association between the adjunct prediction using KIDScore D3 of blastocyst outcome and the actual blastocyst outcome. The Odds Ratio (OR) for the adjunct prediction of blastulation is required to be statistically significantly greater than 1, for good/fair embryos. This will demonstrate that adjunctive use of KIDScore D3 leads to embryologist predictions for Day 5 blastulation that is informative for blastocysts outcome.</description>

    <measure>Embryo-Level Diagnostic Performance Measures</measure>
    <time_frame>1-2 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The specificity was calculated for morphology alone prediction and compared to the specificity for adjunct prediction. Comparable calculations was done for sensitivity, negative predictive value, positive predictive value, negative likelihood ratio and positive likelihood ratio. The above measures were given both as an overall and for each panelist, assessing the performance measures without and with adjunct prediction.</description>

    <description>This analysis included the top 2 embryos selected by each panelist based on morphology alone. The assessment of whether or not the OR is significantly greater than 1, was done by the use of a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM)</description>
