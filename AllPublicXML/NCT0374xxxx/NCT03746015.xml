    <textblock>
      The vaccine being tested in this study is Takeda's Tetravalent Dengue Vaccine Candidate
      (TDV). TDV is being tested to protect people against dengue fever. This study will look at
      the immunogenicity and safety of TDV in flavivirus-naïve and dengue-immune adults.

      The study will enroll approximately 44 patients. Participants will be categorized into two
      groups based on results from serological testing performed by the trial center outside the
      scope of this trial (up to 70 days [10 weeks] prior to Day 1 [Month 0]):

      Group 1: Flavivirus-Naïve Participants Group 2: Dengue-Immune Participants

      All participants will receive subcutaneous injection of TDV on Day 1 (Month 0) and Day 90
      (Month 3).

      This trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to participate in this
      study is 12 months. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, and 9 months after
      last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
