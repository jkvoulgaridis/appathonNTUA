  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We will investigate whether the use of Virtual Reality (VR) preoperatively and
      intraoperatively can help treat pain and anxiety, as measured by patient feedback, vital
      signs trends, and the amounts of anesthetics, pain medications and anxiolytics used during
      surgical procedures. The VR intervention will be studied during short hand surgeries normally
      performed using local anesthesia and sedation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Virtual Reality (VR) is a powerful and inexpensive technology that has been effectively used
      in healthcare settings to treat anxiety and pain, with minimal side effects. In the last two
      decades, opioid abuse and deaths related to opioids have increased, and opioid naive patients
      are at increased risk of opioid abuse when opioids are used during their surgical procedures.
      In addition, anesthetics, anxiolytics and analgesics, namely opioids, have a myriad of side
      effects that worsen patient experience, and lead to complications and increased costs. There
      are limited studies on the use of VR in the perioperative setting. Our study is a randomized
      controlled trial to investigate the use of VR to treat anxiety and pain in perioperative
      settings. We will recruit 56 patients, 28 in the control group and 28 in the VR group,
      undergoing short (&lt;2 hrs) hand or upper extremity surgeries under local anesthesia and
      monitored anesthesia care (MAC). The control group will receive standard anesthetic
      management and the VR group will be exposed to VR in the preoperative setting and during the
      surgical procedure, using the clinically validated AppliedVR software. The data collected
      will included satisfaction questionnaires and pain scores for anxiety/pain pre- and post-
      procedure, vital signs trends to assess sympathetic response during surgery, and amount of
      anesthetics used. We hypothesize that the VR group will show decreased anxiety and pain,
      increased satisfaction, and decreased use of anesthetics during the procedure.
