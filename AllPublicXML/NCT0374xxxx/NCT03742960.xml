  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare sleep neurophysiology and behavior in adolescents
      with MDD with hypersomnia (MDD-HYP) and insomnia (MDD-INS) with healthy controls (HC). In
      addition, the investigators will test the efficacy of a simple behavioral sleep restriction
      on mood and sleep in their sample.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The World Health Organization has identified depression as the leading cause of burden of
      disease amongst young people. Subjective sleep complaints are often a core symptom of
      depression and highly prevalent with 60-90% of depressed adolescents suffering from disrupted
      sleep. This sleep disruption often takes the form of insomnia (e.g., difficulty falling or
      staying asleep, or waking too early) or hypersomnia (prolonged sleep episodes or excessive
      daytime sleepiness). The aim of the trial is to examine the efficacy of a simple behavioral
      sleep restriction two weeks in duration on mood and sleep in adolescents ages 14 to 17 years
      with and without major depressive disorder. During this period sleep is objectively measured
      using actigraphy and monitor mood using self-report. The results of the study will inform
      whether a simple behavioral sleep restriction beneficially impacts mood and sleep.

    <measure>Change in self-reported sleep efficiency (defined as total sleep time divided by time in bed and thus expressed as a percentage) as assessed via sleep diary</measure>
    <time_frame>Two weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in self-reported sleep efficiency will be measured via sleep diary. The data will be collected by ecological momentary assessment (EMA). Time in bed (TIB) is defined as the time between participants reporting going to bed and waking up. Total sleep time (TST) is defined as TIB minus the amount of time participants report taking to fall asleep (sleep onset latency; SOL) and the duration of waking after sleep onset (WASO).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in self-reported mood assessed via the Multidimensional Mood Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Two weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in self-reported mood will be measured via ecological momentary assessment. Participants will fill out the Multidimensional Mood Questionnaire four times a day (morning, after school, at dusk and 30 minutes before bedtime). The Multidimensional Mood Questionnaire assesses the state &quot;happy/sad&quot; on a visual analog scale from 0 to 100. The mean across the day will be calculated.</description>

    <measure>Change in Repetitive Negative Thinking (focus on problems) assessed by one question from the Response Style Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Two weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in repetitive negative thinking will be measured via ecological momentary assessment. Participants will answer the question about &quot;focus on problems&quot; on a scale from 0 [not at all] to 100 [very much]) once a day (evening).</description>

    <measure>Change in depressive symptoms from 1 to 3 days prior to the sleep manipulation and the end of the manipulation (second to last or last day of sleep manipulation)</measure>
    <time_frame>Two weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The change in depressive symptoms from 1 to 3 days prior to the sleep manipulation and the end of the manipulation (second to last or last day of sleep manipulation) will be measured via Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CES-D; measures symptoms associated with depression), Strengths &amp; Difficulties Questionnaires (SDQ; measures strengths and difficulties in general) and the Assessment of Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS; assesses the presence of anhedonia [the inability to experience pleasure].</description>

    <description>The change in depressive symptoms from 1 to 3 days prior to the sleep manipulation and the end of the manipulation (second to last or last day of sleep manipulation) will be measured via Screen for Child Anxiety-Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED; screens anxiety disorder categories).</description>
