  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Septic shock is a common and critical illness in ICU.The vascular dysfunction of septic shock
      is manifested by vasospasm and decreased arterial vascular reactivity . Current studies have
      shown that the main mechanisms of vasospasm and decreased arterial vascular reactivity
      include increased vasospasm and down-regulation of receptor sensitivity , and eventually
      cause a decrease in vascular smooth muscle contractility.A large number of vasodilators are
      released during septic shock, in which inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and
      prostacyclin (PGI2) are important vasodilators leading to septic shock vasospasm.At present,
      vasoactive drugs are widely used in clinically to improve vascular tone and are important
      means of circulation support. However, when the infection is heavier, the reactivity of the
      blood vessels to the vasoactive drugs is lowered, and it is difficult for the large doses of
      the vasoactive drugs to maintain the circulation stability. At this time, the use of
      vasoactive drugs alone does not benefit patients with septic shock and may require the
      combination of other drugs.From the perspective of Chinese medicine, shock is a disease of
      yang. Shenfu injection has the effect of rejuvenating the yang and replenishing the qi. This
      trial was designed to give patients with septic shock the use of Shenfu injection to
      determine the specific effects of Shenfu injection on vascular reactivity in patients with
      septic shock.
