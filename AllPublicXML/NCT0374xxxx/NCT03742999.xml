  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to investigate potential benefits of adding augmented biofeedback
      training to standard therapy in improving eye-hand coordination in children with hemiplegic
      cerebral palsy .Participants were divided randomly into three equal groups. Group (A)
      received specially designed program of physical therapy intervention strategies to facilitate
      visual motor integration and visual perception over a period of three months. Group (B)
      received augmented biofeedback training only, and group (C) received augmented biofeedback
      training and same physical therapy program as group (A).

      Children were assigned randomly into three groups of equal number (A, B and C). Children were
      selected randomly by collecting all names of children that matched the inclusion criteria of
      the study then upload the names and gender using an electronic program (SPSS) which divided
      the sample into three equal groups (A), (B) &amp; (C). Group A: this group included fifteen
      children with spastic hemiplegic CP. Children of this group received specially designed
      program of physical therapy exercises to facilitate eye-hand coordination to improve
      visual-motor coordination and grasping skills, which included: unbutton buttons, and button
      in all again; put the pellets in the bottle as fast as he/she can; place the shapes on its
      form board; build steps, wall, pyramid and a tower from cubes; cut out a line, square,
      triangle, and rectangular shapes on a paper by scissor; string squared cubes and lace the
      holes of strip. The tools used in training program were: button strip, lacing strip and its
      lace, mottle with screw- on cap, markers with different colors, beads and its lacing, square
      cubes, pellets, papers, blunt scissors, colored cubes, different types of form board and its
      shapes. Adjusted chair and table were used to accommodate differences in children's body
      built. Children were trained for 60 minutes per session, three times a week for three
      consecutive months.

      Group B: this group included fifteen children with spastic hemiplegic CP. Children of this
      group received training using the E-Link Upper Limb Exerciser for 60 minutes per session,
      three times a week for three consecutive months. Group C: this group included fifteen
      children with spastic hemiplegic CP. Children of this group received the same physical
      therapy program as conducted for group A, and training with E-Link Upper Limb Exerciser as
      conducted for group B. The training was for 60 minutes per session, three times a week for
      three consecutive months.

      The participated children were assessed by the Peabody Developmental Motor Scale (2nd
      edition) (PDMS-2) Test before and after the three months of the treatment program. The
      average time required for evaluating each child was 40 min. The assessment and training
      methods were applied according to the instructions provided in the test and equipment
      manuals, no modifications were necessary.
