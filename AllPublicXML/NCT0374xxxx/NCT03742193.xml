  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Second-line chemotherapy
      combined with Apatinib for the patients with resectable pulmonary metastasis of osteosarcoma.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After standard chemotherapy and surgery for the localized disease, pulmonary metastases of
      osteosarcoma occurs in up to 40% of cases and still remain challenging without satisfactory
      regimen. Apatinib is a oral kinase inhibitor of receptor tyrosine targeting VEGFR2. A pilot
      study indicated that Apatinib improved the PFS after multi-line chemotherapy failure, and
      might partly reversed chemo-refractory status for advanced osteosarcoma. Thus, the
      investigators explored the efficacy of combining Apatinib with current available second-line
      chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone for treating first resectable pulmonary
      metastases of osteosarcoma following the failure of first-line chemotherapy and
      wide/radical-margin surgery. Participants will receive 250 mg of apatinib twice daily
      combined with gemcitabine-docetaxel (GD) regimen before and after the surgical resection of
      the pulmonary metastases. Osteosarcoma patients with pulmonary recurrence only at baseline
      will be recruited in the study. The primary end point is progression-free survival rate (PFR)
      compared with historical control. A12 month PFR of 30% or less is considered inactive, while
      a 12 month PFR of 50% or greater is regarded as of interest for additional development. With
      a type I error rate of 5% and a power of 83%, the number of patients needed for this design
      is 43.
