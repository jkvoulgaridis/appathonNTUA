  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Placenta previa (PP) is an obstetric condition that is closely linked with massive obstetric
      hemorrhage with a varied incidence about once in every 200 live births. It is considered one
      of the causes of the increased need for blood transfusion and cesarean hysterectomy. PPH due
      to PP typically starts during cesarean section (CS) in the placental bed, at the lower
      uterine segment mostly after placental separation. Proceeding for cesarean hysterectomy can
      be the only effective line of management in spite of the associated high morbidity rate.

      Various conservative measures have been developed to avoid hysterectomy and preserve
      fertility in patients with PP. Bilateral Uterine artery ligation (BUAL) is one of the
      reported surgical procedures carried out in these cases as it is easy and quick. It can be
      used alone or with adjunctive measures with a fair success rate. The aim is to reduce the
      blood supply to the uterus and to prevent postpartum hemorrhage.

      Tranexamic acid is a lysine analog which acts as an antifibrinolytic via competitive
      inhibition of the binding of plasmin and plasminogen to fibrin. The rationale for its use in
      the reduction of blood loss depending on the implication of the coagulation and fibrinolysis
      processes implicated in the control of PPH. However, concerns about possible thromboembolic
      events with parenteral administration of TA have stimulated increasing interest in its
      topical use.

      Study inclusion criteria will be women undergoing elective cesarean delivery for complete
      placenta previa which not respond uterotonic and simple hemostatic maneuvers like placental
      bed hemostatic sutures Eligible participants were allocated to one of two groups. Group (I):
      patients managed by bilateral uterine artery ligation (BUAL) after delivery of the fetus
      which not respond uterotonic and simple hemostatic maneuvers like placental bed hemostatic
      sutures. Group (II): patients received 1 gm TA (2 ampoules of CapronÂ® 500 mg /5 ml; Cairo,
      Egypt) topically applied to the placental bed plus BUA when not respond to uterotonic and
      simple hemostatic maneuvers like placental bed hemostatic sutures.
