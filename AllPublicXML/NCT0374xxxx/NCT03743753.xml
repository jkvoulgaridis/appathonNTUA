    <textblock>
      This pilot study uses a randomized controlled trial design to introduce an educational
      session for breast reconstruction patients. Participants will be randomly assigned to the (1)
      control group or the (2) experimental group. The control group will receive the current
      standard educational information from the surgeon along with an information package, while
      participants in the experimental group will also receive an additional education session
      before their operation about what to expect during their reconstructive journey. Satisfaction
      with care, anxiety about the procedure and recovery, and health related quality of life will
      be measured in all patients using established questionnaires. Additionally, feasibility
      outcomes will be reported and the results of this study will be used to demonstrate whether a
      larger version of this study can be successfully completed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a feasibility, randomized controlled trial (RCT) to introduce a novel,
      pre-operative educational session for breast reconstruction patients. It will follow a
      single-center, 1:1 allocation, two-arm parallel group superiority design.

      The primary objective of this trial is to determine feasibility of a larger, definitive RCT.
      The primary outcomes will allow for an accurate assessment of recruitment, study completion,
      efficient resource requirements and utilization, and treatment effect size. This will not
      only enhance the likelihood of success of a future RCT and allow us to foresee potential
      issues in study design, but also provide an opportunity for patient feedback on the
      educational intervention. The secondary objective is to address whether the novel,
      pre-operative educational intervention improves satisfaction (as measured with the BREAST-Q),
      health-related quality of life (as measured with the PROMIS-29) and decrease anxiety (as
      measured with the STAI for adults) in breast reconstruction patients at compared to the
      standard of care.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to the (1) control group or the (2) experimental
      group. The control group will receive the current standard educational information from the
      surgeon along with an information package, while participants in the experimental group will
      also receive an additional education session before their operation.The session will be
      provided after the patient chooses their desired method of reconstruction and signs consent
      for their surgery. The session is specifically tailored to the method of breast
      reconstruction (autologous or alloplastic) the patient will undergo. It is a one-on-one
      session delivered by the research assistant using a visual aide on an iPad (power point
      presentation). The educational session reviews the basics of their reconstruction, explains
      the normal in-hospital course and post-operative recovery, reviews potential complications
      and provides advice from previous breast reconstruction patients. The information, visual
      aids, and lesson plan were created after a needs assessment of McMaster University breast
      reconstruction patients was performed (literature review, surgeon input, and semi-structured
      patient interviews).

      The questionnaires (BREAST-Q, PROMIS-29 and STAI) will be administered to all participants at
      4 time points: trial recruitment/initial consultation or preoperative appointment (1-2 weeks
      before surgery), and 3 follow-up time points (2-4 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months after
      surgery). If the participant is undergoing two-stage implant based reconstruction, the
      questionnaires will also be administered 1-2 weeks before the second surgery, and 2-4 weeks
      and 3 months after the second surgery. Qualitative interviews will be performed at 6 months
      post-operation with participants in the experimental group and control group. They will
      explore the patient perspective to identify ways to improve the content and delivery method
      of pre-operative education, and if in the control group, satisfaction with the standard care
      and information provided.

    <measure>Feasibility of the research study as measured by retention rate</measure>
    <time_frame>This will be calculated through study completion, an average of 1 year, at the time when every enrolled participant is set to complete the final follow up.</time_frame>
    <description>The primary feasibility outcome will be retention rate at the 6 month-follow up. Retention rate is the percentage of enrolled participants who remain in the study until all study requirements are complete. A retention rate of &gt;90% will indicate that a larger scale study is feasible.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>This questionnaire will be administered at the 1-2 week pre-operative visit and at the 2-4 weeks, 3 months and 6 months post-operation. (Also administered 1-2 weeks before, 2-4 weeks and 3 months after the 2nd surgery for implant based reconstruction).)</time_frame>
    <description>This will be measured using the BREAST-Q questionnaire. The BREAST-Q is a patient reported outcome measure of patient satisfaction with breast reconstruction.The reconstructive module of the BREAST-Q will be administered. The questionnaire is composed of 10-13 sections depending on whether the participants underwent autologous or alloplastic reconstruction and whether the participant underwent radiation. All questions are answered on 3, 4, or 5 point Likert scales. The answers of each sections are totaled and compared to the equivalent Rasch transformed score. Zero represents the worst possible score and 100 represents the best.</description>

    <measure>Anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>This questionnaire will be administered at the 1-2 week pre-operative visit and at the 2-4 weeks, 3 months and 6 months post-operation. (Also administered 1-2 weeks before, 2-4 weeks and 3 months after the 2nd surgery for implant based reconstruction).)</time_frame>
    <description>This will be measured using the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) for adults questionnaire. The STAI is a patient reported outcome that measures situational and trait anxiety. Of the two subscales, the State Anxiety Scale (S-Anxiety) evaluates the current state of anxiety. The Trait Anxiety Scale (T-Anxiety) evaluates relatively stable aspects of &quot;anxiety proneness&quot;, including general states of calmness, confidence and security. The STAI has 40 items, 20 items allocated to each of the S-Anxiety and T-Anxiety subscales. All items are rated on a 4-point Likert Scale. Scores range from 20 to 80, where higher scores indicate higher anxiety.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health-related quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>This questionnaire will be administered at the 1-2 week pre-operative visit and at the 2-4 weeks, 3 months and 6 months post-operation. (Also administered 1-2 weeks before, 2-4 weeks and 3 months after the 2nd surgery for implant based reconstruction).)</time_frame>
    <description>This will be measured with the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS-29) questionnaire. The PROMIS-29 is a generic health-related quality of life survey that assesses 7 domains (physical function, pain interference, fatigue, sleep disturbance, anxiety, depression, satisfaction with participation in social roles) and is designed to measure self-reported physical, mental and social health and wellbeing. The questions are answered on a 5-point Likert Scale. There is also one 11-point rating scale for pain intensity. In symptom-oriented domains (pain interference, fatigue, sleep disturbance, anxiety and depression) higher scores represent worse symptomatology. In function-oriented domains (physical functioning and social role) higher scores represent better functioning.</description>
