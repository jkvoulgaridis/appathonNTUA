  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blinded, two-arm, clinical study. This study is expected to last
      for approximately 6 months, comprised of 4-8 weeks of enrollment period, 28 days of treatment
      and 3 months of follow up. The enrollment will be completed prior to the beginning of initial
      treatment. The study will be closed when 48 subjects have completed the study. The enrollment
      will be randomized 1:1 to Neurocytotron treatment or mock treatment (placebo). Upon the
      completion of the study period, the placebo group will receive treatment, if the study
      results show benefits to patients.

      The placebo group will not receive treatment with Neurocytotron, unless the group assigned to
      the treatment shows positive results.

      In the design, the 3-month follow-up period is sufficient because 100% of the patients are
      current patients of the research centers; therefore, patient safety will be continuously
      controlled after the study is closed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients 1 to 6 years old.

          -  We will include this age range because children with CP less than 1 year old have a
             high mortality rate, in addition, the clinical evolution stabilizes after the second
             year of life, and the potential effect of treatment is optimized in the first 5 years.

          -  A clinical diagnosis of spastic cerebral palsy, or spastic and dyskinetic, secondary
             only to hypoxic/ischemic encephalopathy

          -  For spasticity, having scored at least 3 on the Ashworth scale, and 3 on the gross
             motor scale.

          -  For dyskinesis, any desgree.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient with diagnosis of ataxia

          -  Current or recent history (within 2 months) of significant bacterial, fungal, viral,
             or mycobacterial infection.

          -  Having a condition considered as causing or likely to cause co-morbidities, as
             determined by the investigator based on medical history, physical examination, vital
             signs, and clinical laboratory tests.

          -  Subject with magnetic implants, pacemakers, claustrophobia or any other condition that
             precludes them from entering or staying in the treatment device.

          -  Children with previous neurosurgery within 6 months at the time of screening.

          -  History of malignancy.

          -  History of congenital heart disease

          -  Subjects who are unable or unlikely to comply with the protocol, determined by the
             majority vote of the investigators. For example, patients exposed to secondary smoking
             in their home environment.

          -  Patients with more than 4 seizures per week, in the last 2 weeks, or more than 10
             seizures in the month prior to admission.

          -  Surgery related to spasticity treatment

          -  Patients who have been treated with botulinum toxin in the last 6 months
