      -  Determine changes in the xerostomia characteristics and discomfort degree by means of
           questionnaires addressed to the physician and subject of study.

        -  Determine the volume of submaxilar saliva without stimulation and with stimulation by
           sialometry (SL).

        -  Detect changes in volume, vascularization and fibrosis of submaxillary glands based on
           magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast.

        -  Detect changes of submaxillary gland functionalism based on Gammagraphy (GF).

    <description>Autologous bone marrow aspiration is used as a cellular source to obtain MSVs and is subjected to the protocolized anticoagulant procedure. After checking the perfect condition of the shipment and the correct completion of the documentation that accompanies it, the processing of the bone marrow will be carried out. The processing of the bone marrow will be done in the Cell Therapy Unit of the IBGM under NCF, within 24 hours of the completion of the aspiration</description>
