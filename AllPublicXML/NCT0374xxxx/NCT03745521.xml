  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Through observation of patients with X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets/osteomalacia (XLH) for
      up to 5 years, the study intends to collect data that allow achievement of the following
      objectives:

        1. To determine medical characteristics of the disease and the disease process

        2. To determine physical and psychological burden on patients as well as economic burden

        3. To assess the efficacy and safety of the treatment of the disease
