  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) and Hypoparathyroidism (HP) are two of the most frequent
      disorder of Calcium-Phosphorus (Ca-P) metabolism. The Ca/P ratio is an accurate tool to
      differentiate patients with PHPT from healthy subjects, according to a previous single-centre
      study. The reliability of this index is based on the fact that serum Ca and P are inversely
      related together either in healthy subjects or in patients with PHPT and HP.

      The aim of this study is to investigate the accuracy and diagnostic value of Ca/P ratio in
      the diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism and hypoparathyroidism. The definition of a
      valid cut-off of serum Ca/P ratio for patients with these disorders will be of help
      especially in those patients with apparently normal biochemical profile, but suggestive for
      primary hyperparathyroidism and hypoparathyroidism.
