  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pharmacokinetics (PK), open-label, uncontrolled, multicenter phase II trial with
      age-staggered approach.

      The primary objective is to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of P03277 in plasma
      following single intravenous injection of 0.05 mmol/kg body weight in pediatric population
      aged from 2 to 17 years.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A population PK approach and an age-down staggered approach will be used. Patients will be
      recruited into 3 predefined age groups: 12-17, 7-11 and 2-6 years. The inclusions will start
      with the older group (Adolescents, 12-17 years), followed by Preadolescents (7-11 years) and
      finally Young Children (2-6 years of age).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Female or male pediatric patient aged 2 to 17 years,

          -  Patient scheduled to undergo routine Central Nervous System contrast-enhanced MRI,

          -  Patient whose parent(s) or legal guardian (where applicable) having read the
             information provided his/her/their consent to patient's participation in writing by
             dating and signing the informed consent prior to any trial related procedure being
             conducted,

          -  Patient with capacity of understanding who received age- and maturity-appropriate
             information and provided his/her assent to participate in the trial (as required by
             national regulations),

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient planned for treatment or procedure (e.g. surgery) that would prevent from
             obtaining the required blood samples or performing other trial procedures between the
             screening visit and up to 1 day after P03277 administration,

          -  Patient whose preceding to P03277 administration or subsequent treatment or procedure
             (e.g., diuretics, clinically significant blood loss or blood transfusion) would alter
             P03277 pharmacokinetic parameters,

          -  Patient with acute or chronic renal insufficiency defined as estimated Glomerular
             Filtration Rate (eGFR) out of age-adjusted normal values [eGFR must be calculated
             based on bedside Schwartz equation],

          -  Patient with history of bleeding disorder,

          -  Patient with known severe liver disease,

          -  Patient with known cardiac disease (e.g., heart rhythm anomalies, long QT syndrome),

          -  Patient with any clinically significant abnormal 12-lead ECG that in the
             Investigator's opinion would affect the safety evaluation or place the patient at
             risk,

          -  Patient with electrolyte or fluid imbalance that at Investigator's judgment presents
             undue risk assessed within 1 month prior to P03277 administration,

          -  Patient undergoing a change in chemotherapy within 1 day prior to or 1 day after
             P03277 administration,

          -  Patient who received or will receive any other contrast agent for CT and/or MRI within
             1 week prior to or 1 week after P03277 administration,

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding female patient [female patient with childbearing potential
             (who experienced menarche) must have a negative urine pregnancy test within 24 hours
             prior to P03277 administration and must be using medically approved contraception if
             sexually active].
