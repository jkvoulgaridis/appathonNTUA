  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      By means of digital droplet PCR (ddPCR), this study examines blood samples from patients
      newly diagnosed with cervical cancer to investigate whether it is possible to measure the
      presence and amount of HPV DNA in these blood samples. The first blood sample is taken at
      time of diagnosis, and follow-up blood samples are collected during treatment- and follow-up
      visits. We expect to find a correlation between the disease stage and the viral load and also
      a decline in viral load after treatment. Furthermore, we hope that this method may serve as a
      way of detecting disease recurrence earlier than what is possible today.

    <textblock>
      This study hypothesises that in patients with HPV-related cervical cancer, HPV DNA may be
      released into the bloodstream from tumor cells. These fragments of HPV DNA shed by tumor may
      therefore be measured in blood samples from the patients. By using the same setting as for
      real-time PCR with PCR primers and probes for fluorescence detection, the study uses digital
      droplet PCR (ddPCR), a method based on dilution and partitioning of the blood sample in many
      reaction chambers or droplets, to measure absolute quantities of HPV DNA fragments in blood
      samples from women with different stages of cervical cancer. Patients are recruited at the
      time of diagnosis, where a baseline blood sample is collected. Follow-up blood samples are
      collected during treatment and at follow-up visits up to two years after the diagnosis. We
      expect the HPV DNA load to decrease after treatment, and if an increase in viral load is
      detected during follow-up, we expect this to be an early sign of a disease recurrence. The
      method may therefore become an effective monitoring tool in these patients in terms of
      detecting a ongoing disease recurrence, which gives us the chance to intervene and treat
      these patients before the disease becomes too disseminated.
