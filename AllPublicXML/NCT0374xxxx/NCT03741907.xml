    <textblock>
      In the last decades cesarean section rates are getting higher in many countries. The rise in
      those rates encourages obstetricians to improve operative techniques for a better maternal
      and fetal outcome.

      Despite its worldwide spread, a general consensus on the most appropriate technique to use
      has not yet been reached.

      The most known surgical technique is the MLC . A modified extraperitoneal method of caesarean
      section :&quot; French Ambulatory Cesarean Section ( FAUCS) was described in the middle of the
      90's by &quot;Denis Fauck&quot; and &quot;Jacques Henri Ravina &quot; However, no study comparing these two
      cesarean techniques was conducted. From where the investigators initiate this study .

    <textblock>
      Caesarean Section (CS) is one of the most commonly performed operations worldwide The rate of
      CS continues to rise, despite initiatives to counter this trend. Cesarean sections have a
      higher morbidity rate than vaginal deliveries, with a substantial care and cost measurable by
      the mean hospital stay, the use of analgesics, and the potential for complications .
      Crucially, the birth of a new baby is an unique incentive to return quickly to &quot;normal&quot;
      function. Improving the cesarean section techniques is therefore of considerable importance
      in modern obstetrics.

      One of the most widely used cesarean section techniques is the MLC method developed by
      Michael Stark et al. This approach is indicated as the optimal technique in view of its
      characteristic of reducing lower pelvic discomfort and pain, thus improving quality of life
      However, this intraperitoneal C-section interfere at least with future fertility desire.

      The French Ambulatory Cesarean Section (FAUCS) technique has been employed by 10
      practitioners in France for approximately 20 years. In a retrospective study over 3000 cases
      this innovative approach seems to provide a shorter recovery time with a Hospital discharge
      the day after surgery . Investigators introduced this technique in &quot;Mongi Slim&quot; university
      hospital in January 2018. In this study, investigators compare the FAUCS and the MLC
      techniques in termes of mother and child outcomes

Scores 7 and above are generally normal; 4 to 6, fairly low; and 3 and below are generally regarded as critically low and cause for immediate resuscitative efforts.)</description>
