    <textblock>
      A multi-centre, double-blind, randomized-controlled trial to study the efficacy and safety of
      gabapentin to reduce the need for strong opioid use in the treatment of radiation-induced
      pain in head and neck cancer (HNCA) patients undergoing a curative 7-week radio(chemo)therapy
      course with curative intent. The aim of this study is to establish if addition of gabapentin
      is more effective in reducing the need to start (or dosage-increase) a strong opioid for HNCA
      pain than a matching placebo additional to standard pain management (WHO-ladder step 2 and
      3).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although pain is a major symptom in head and neck cancer (HNCA) patients, few studies focus
      on pain management in this population. Current optimal HNCA pain control usually requires the
      use of a strong opioid (WHO-ladder step 3), increasing the risk of opioid side effects and
      toxicities. Gabapentin, originally an anticonvulsant drug, has been effectively used
      off-label to treat multiple neuropathic pain syndromes such as cancer pain, and has been
      suggested to reduce the need for high doses of strong opioids in HNCA patients under
      radio(chemo)therapy. A multi-centre, phase III, double-blind, randomised-controlled trial
      will be set up randomising patients between the experimental group (E) receiving gabapentin,
      or the control group (C) receiving a matching placebo, both in addition to standard analgesic
      therapy (steps 2 and 3 on WHO-ladder). The investigators aim to establish if addition of
      gabapentin is more effective in reducing the need to start (or dosage-increase) a strong
      opioid for HNCA pain than a matching placebo additional to standard pain management
      (WHO-ladder step 2 and 3), in HNCA patients scheduled for a curative 7-week
      radio(chemo)therapy course.

    <masking_description>Both patient groups will receive gabapentin or a matching placebo additional to the standard analgesic therapy, and will be asked to consume the content following the predefined directions provided to them. Both the investigators and the patients will be blinded for the IMP, since gabapentin and the matching placebo will appear identical.
The clinical pharmacist responsible for clinical trials as well as Bimetra clinics will receive a sealed envelope from the statistician with the information necessary for decoding.</masking_description>

    <description>Pain assessment of subtypes of patients, according to their tumour location, through the Neuropathic Pain Scale. Patients give a score between 0 until 10 on different aspects of pain as pain sharpness, heat/cold, dullness, intensity, unpleasantness, and surface vs. deep pain which all represent the subtypes of the Neuropathic Pain Scale. A score between 0 and 10 will be assigned to these different subtypes of pain, with a score of 0 if the patient has no pain, a score of 5 if the patient has moderate pain and a score of 10 if the patient copes with the worst possible pain. So higher values represent worse pain. The scores on all these subscales are not combined as we are interested in the subtypes of pain themselves.</description>

    <description>Patients randomised to the experimental group will receive a prescription for a gabapentin starting dose of 100 mg three times a day (ter in die, t.i.d) /day per orally, additional to the analgesics according to standard local practices.
Gabapentin dosage may be gradually increased based on individual patient response and tolerability, and as per standard practice in accordance with the drug label. The dose can be further increased in 300 mg/day increments (dose increments of 50% - 100%) every two to three days, up to a maximum dose of 3600 mg/day. The minimum time to reach a dose of 1800 mg/day is one week, to reach 2400 mg/day is a total of two weeks, and to reach 3600 mg/day is a total of three weeks.</description>
