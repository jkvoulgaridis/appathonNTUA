  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the effect of a pranayama focused yoga intervention on
      posttraumatic symptom severity in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder undergoing
      standard psychotherapy/cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Therefore, short pranayama
      sessions of 5-10 minutes will be provided to the patients directly before each of standard
      CBT units, while the control group will get standard CBT alone. It should further be
      investigated, whether Pranayama can enhance the affective tolerance of patients with
      posttraumatic stress disorder towards the used exposure techniques of CBT.

    <masking_description>Participants and Therapists (Care Provider) could not be blinded according to the nature of the intervention. However, therapists will be blinded to allocation concealment as they do not be aware of the patients' group assignment at baseline assessment until they open the opaque randomization envelope, which contains the patient randomization number and group assignment. The random sequence generation and the envelopes were prepared by the study coordinator who is not involved patient recruitment. Patients received post intervention questionnaires from a study assistant/nurse of the respective outpatient department who is also blinded to the patients' group assignment. After completing the questionnaires, the study assistant will sent them to study coordinator so that the therapist could not influence the patients' answers.</masking_description>
