  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with conductive hearing loss fitting the inclusion criteria will be asked to
      participate in the study. All subjects will be randomized to wear either first the adhesive
      or the conventional bone conduction hearing aid. They will wear either device for two weeks.
      They will use the second device for another two weeks. Audiologic tests and quality of life
      questionnaires will be assessed at the beginning of the study after two weeks with the first
      device and after two weeks with the second device. Additionally, all patients will be asked
      to keep a diary including daily wearing time of the device.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to show, that the ADHEAR will be worn ~75%(~11 to 15
      hours per day) of the waking hours, whereas the Contact Mini will be worn ~ 50% (~5 - 8 hours
      per day) of the waking hours (p&lt;0.05). The authors expect this difference due to increased
      wearing comfort, reduced/no pressure to the skin of the ADHEAR. The primary objective will be
      assessed with the diary patients are asked to use.

      Audiologic testing will consist of free field audiometry, Freiburger monosyllables test and
      Oldenburg sentence test. All tests will be performed with and without the devices.

      Quality of life and hearing related questionnaires will consist of the AQoL-8D and the SSQ12.
