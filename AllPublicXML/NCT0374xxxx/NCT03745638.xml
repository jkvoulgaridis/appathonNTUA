        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adolescents aged ≥ 12 to 17 years, inclusive, and men and women aged ≥ 18 years.

          -  Participants diagnosed with AD as defined by the Hanifin and Rajka criteria.

          -  AD duration of at least 2 years.

          -  Participants with an IGA score of 2 to 3 at screening and baseline (VC period) and 0
             to 4 at Week 8 (long-term safety period).

          -  Participants with % BSA (excluding scalp) of AD involvement of 3% to 20% at screening
             and baseline (VC period) and 0% to 20% at Week 8 (long-term safety period).

          -  Participants who agree to discontinue all agents used to treat AD from screening
             through the final follow-up visit.

          -  Participants who have at least 1 &quot;target lesion&quot; that measures approximately 10 cm^2
             or more at screening and baseline. Lesion must be representative of the participant's
             disease state and not be located on the hands, feet, or genitalia.

          -  Willingness to avoid pregnancy or fathering of children.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Unstable course of AD (spontaneously improving or rapidly deteriorating) as determined
             by the investigator in the 4 weeks prior to baseline.

          -  Concurrent conditions and history of other diseases:

               -  Immunocompromised.

               -  Chronic or acute infection requiring treatment with systemic antibiotics,
                  antivirals, antiparasitics, antiprotozoals, or antifungals within 2 weeks before
                  baseline.

               -  Active acute bacterial, fungal, or viral skin infection within 1 week before
                  baseline.

               -  Any other concomitant skin disorder, pigmentation, or extensive scarring that, in
                  the opinion of the investigator, may interfere with the evaluation of AD lesions
                  or compromise participant safety.

               -  Presence of AD lesions only on the hands or feet without prior history of
                  involvement of other classical areas of involvement such as the face or the
                  folds.

               -  Other types of eczema.

          -  Any serious illness or medical, physical, or psychiatric condition(s) that, in the
             investigator's opinion, would interfere with full participation in the study,
             including administration of study drug and attending required study visits; pose a
             significant risk to the participant; or interfere with interpretation of study data.

          -  Use of any of the following treatments within the indicated washout period before
             baseline:

               -  5 half-lives or 12 weeks, whichever is longer - biologic agents (eg, dupilumab).

               -  4 weeks - systemic corticosteroids or adrenocorticotropic hormone analogs,
                  cyclosporin, methotrexate, azathioprine, or other systemic immunosuppressive or
                  immunomodulating agents (eg, mycophenolate or tacrolimus).

               -  2 weeks - immunizations and sedating antihistamines, unless on long-term stable
                  regimen (nonsedating antihistamines are permitted).

               -  1 week - use of other topical treatments for AD (other than bland emollients).
                  Diluted sodium hypochlorite &quot;bleach&quot; baths are allowed as long as they do not
                  exceed 2 baths per week and their frequency remains the same throughout the
                  study.

          -  Participants who have previously received JAK inhibitors, systemic or topical.

          -  Ultraviolet light therapy or prolonged exposure to natural or artificial sources of UV
             radiation within 2 weeks prior to baseline and/or intention to have such exposure
             during the study, which is thought by the investigator to potentially impact the
             participant's AD.

          -  Positive serology test results at screening for HIV antibody.

          -  Liver function tests: aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase
             (ALT) ≥ 2 × upper limit of normal (ULN); alkaline phosphatase and/or bilirubin &gt; 1.5 ×
             ULN (isolated bilirubin &gt; 1.5 × ULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and
             direct bilirubin &lt; 35%).

          -  Pregnant or lactating participants, or those considering pregnancy.

          -  History of alcoholism or drug addiction within 1 year before screening or current
             alcohol or drug use that, in the opinion of the investigator, will interfere with the
             participant's ability to comply with the administration schedule and study
             assessments.

          -  Current treatment or treatment within 30 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer)
             before baseline with another investigational medication or current enrollment in
