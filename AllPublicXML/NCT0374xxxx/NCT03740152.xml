  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transcranial Light Therapy involves non-invasive and invisible beams of light that increase
      energy metabolism in the brain. Transcranial light therapy has been found to promote brain
      metabolism. The purpose of the study is:

      To asses the change in cerebral blood flow induced by the Transcranial Continuous and Pulse
      Near-Infrared Light Therapy in healthy subjects.

      To correlate with cognitive performance the change in cerebral blood flow induced by the
      Transcranial Continuous and Pulse Near-Infrared Light Therapy in healthy subjects.

      To correlate with skin pigmentation the change in cerebral blood flow induced by the
      Transcranial Continuous and Pulse Near-Infrared Light Therapy in healthy subjects.

      To assess the safety and tolerability of the Transcranial Continuous and Pulse Near-Infrared
      Light Therapy in healthy subjects

    <textblock>
      During study visits a clinician applies transcranial light therapy to both sides of a
      participant's forehead for about 30 minutes. The study involves, 1 screening visit which may
      last up to 3 hours, 3 transcranial light therapy treatment visits, and 1 posttreatment visit
      (5 total visits to the Massachusetts General Hospital).

      All eligible participants will have 1 visit with continuous light, 1 visit with pulsed light,
      and 1 visit with sham light. Cerebral blood flow will be measured before and after each light
      session using DCS-spectroscopy. During sham transcranial light therapy visits, the
      transcranial light therapy device will not produce near infrared waves (e.g., light energy
      that cannot penetrate the skin and cranium). The participant will not know which treatment is
      received at each visit.

             (e.g. condoms plus spermicide) if sexually active.

          3. Subject Informed Consent obtained in writing in compliance with local regulations
             prior to enrollment into this study.
