  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed project underscores the following: 1) The prevalence of uncontrolled/undiagnosed
      hypertension (HTN) in underrepresented groups presenting to the ED is alarmingly high, and 2)
      ED engagement and early risk assessment/stratification is a cost-effective, feasible
      innovation to help close health disparity gaps in HTN. This proposal involves a two-arm
      randomized controlled trial of up to 770 patients from the Emergency Department at University
      of Illinois Hospital with elevated blood pressure (BP). The primary objective is to determine
      the effectiveness of an emergency department-initiated Educational and Empowerment (E2)
      intervention with a Post Acute Care Hypertension Consultation (PACHT-c) intervention (arm 2)
      on the primary outcome of mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) differences between the two
      trial arms at 6-months post intervention. Secondary objectives include evaluating the
      effectiveness of this ED education and empowerment intervention on mean SBP and diastolic
      blood pressure (DBP) differences at 3-months, and mean DBP differences at 6-months.
      Additionally improvement in cardiovascular risk score (as measured by the Atherosclerotic
      Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD) Risk Score), medication adherence (as measured by the Modified
      Morisky Scale), primary care engagement (measured by compliance with outpatient follow-up
      appointments), and HTN knowledge improvement (as measured by a validated HTN knowledge
      survey).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a single-site randomized controlled trial (RCT) focused on a high-risk ED
      population with evidence of moderately elevated BP (≥140/90 mmHg) at discharge. ED patients
      will be recruited and randomized into two arms: 1) usual care (preprinted discharge
      instructions and 48-72 hour referral to a federally qualified health center (FQHC) or
      assigned provider as appropriate); 2) ED-initiated E2 intervention program followed by 48-72
      hour referral to a FQHC (or assigned health center). Based on the ED population demographics
      (70% ethnic minorities), the majority of participants will be underrepresented minorities
      (NHB and Hispanic) and low-income individuals. The investigators propose the following
      specific aims and hypotheses:

      Aim 1: Evaluate the effectiveness of an ED-based E2 + PACHT-c intervention (arm 2) on the
      primary outcome of mean SBP difference at 6-months post-intervention compared to usual care
      (arm 1).

      H1: The mean SBP difference (from baseline) will be significantly greater in the E2+ PACHT-c
      group (arm 2) compared to the usual care group (arm 1) at 6- months post-randomization, i.e.,
      SBP change in arm 2 &gt; arm 1 at 6-months post-randomization.

      Aim 2: Evaluate the effectiveness of an ED-based E2 intervention with PACHT-c on the
      secondary outcome of mean SBP and DBP differences at 3-months, and mean DBP differences at 6
      months post-intervention compared to usual care.

      H2: The mean SBP and DBP differences from baseline to 3- months post-intervention and mean
      DBP at 6-months post intervention will be significantly greater in the ED-based E2
      intervention compared to the usual care group, i.e., SBP and DBP change in arm 2 &gt; arm 1 at 3
      -months post-intervention and DBP change in arm 2 &gt; arm 1 at 6 -months post-intervention.

      Aim 3: Examine if the E2 intervention reduces racial disparities. Specifically, if the
      intervention is as effective in racial minorities as non-minorities. This will be an
      exploratory analysis and will primarily focus on changes in cardiovascular risk
      score/profile. Also included will be an assessment of intervention mediators: primary care
      engagement, medication adherence, and HTN knowledge in these same patients at 3 and 6-months
      post randomization-intervention.

    <description>As measured by the Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD) Risk Estimator Plus at baseline, 3 months, and then at 6 months.
Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease Risk Estimator Plus provides a patient's 10-year risk and a lifetime of developing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The 10-year calculated ASCVD risk a quantitative estimation of absolute risk based upon data from representative population samples. The lifetime calculated ASCVD risk represents a quantitative estimation of absolute risk for a 50 year old man or woman with the same risk profile.
The estimator provides risk as a percentage, ranging from 0-100%. A higher percentage is considered a worse outcome.</description>

    <description>As measured by the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale at baseline, 3 months, and then at 6 months.
The 4-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-4) is a validated instrument to assess self-reported patient adherence related to antihypertensive medication. The modified Morisky scale provides a total score with a range of 0 to 4, with higher scores indicating lower adherence to medication. The scores of the modified Morisky scale can be classified as low compliers (3-4), medium compliers (1-2) and high compliers (0) based on its criterion validity with BP control. A higher score on the scale is a worse outcome.</description>

    <description>As measured by a validated HTN knowledge survey at baseline and then at 6 months.
The hypertension knowledge survey is a 10-item, validated tool developed to assess hypertension knowledge in low literacy patient populations. The scale assesses respondents' knowledge in defining hypertension, lifestyle, and behaviors that may affect BP levels, and the long-term consequences of HTN. The survey has been validated in an urban population that included a high proportion of black and Latino patients. Scores are categorized into tertiles that indicate low (≤7), medium (8), or high (9-10) levels of HTN knowledge. The tool comes from: Shane S, Muntner P, Kawasaki L, Hyre A, DeSalvo K. Hypertension Knowledge Among Patients from an Urban Clinic. Ethnicity &amp; Disease. 2008; 18: 42-47.</description>
