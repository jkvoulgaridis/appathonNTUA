  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) is one of the first stages of assisted reproductive
      treatment. The goal is to mimic the ovarian cycle while stimulating the ovaries to
      overproduce eggs capable of being fertilized, thus maximizing the chances of reproductive
      success. The stimulation phase involves the use of different hormonal medications but
      requires tests to check the development of follicles, and hormonal adjustment to get the
      optimal ovarian response to stimulation.

      However, between 9 to 24% of patients fail to respond adequately to standard stimulation
      protocols, resulting in Poor Ovarian Response (POR). In addition to the low oocyte
      production, POR results in a restricted number of good quality embryos with appropriate
      implantation potential, suggesting a compromised oocyte quality.

      POR is one of the most challenging problems in reproductive medicine. Poor responders are
      difficult to treat since their response to stimulation tend to be deficient even when using
      different drugs or protocols. In recent years, different therapeutic alternatives have been
      proposed for these patients. However, to date, the optimal stimulation protocol has not yet
      been described and oocyte donation is often offered as their only option to achieve
      pregnancy.

      Recently, evidence has emerged that supplementation with a specific hormone, luteinizing
      hormone (LH), during or prior to COS could lead to improved reproductive outcomes in poor
      responders by increasing the number of oocytes retrieved and improving their quality.

      The present study aims to evaluate the effect of the treatment with LH prior to COS on the
      ovarian response in patients with POR and advanced maternal age, the worst prognosis but more
      frequent group of poor responders attending fertility clinics. We will assess whether LH
      treatment prior to COS increases the number and quality of oocytes retrieved in those
      patients and, finally, analyse the impact in their chances of getting pregnant and having a
      baby.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. -Patients with POR according to specific criteria that are in line with the criteria
             defined by the ESHRE (Bologna Criteria), according to which a patient is classified as
             a poor ovarian responder when she meets two of the three of the following criteria:

         10. - Known allergy or hypersensitivity to the drugs administered during the trial.

         11. - Concurrent significant medical pathologies that would endanger the patient's safety
             (uncontrolled thyroid or adrenal dysfunction, severe hepatic or renal impairment,
             etc.) or interfere with the test evaluations or the clinical outcomes (i.e. confirmed
             thrombophilia).

         12. - Use of concomitant medication or any other circumstances that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, interferes with the development of the trial or does not ensure the
             safety and efficacy of the data.

         13. - Simultaneous participation in another clinical trial or previous participation in
             this study.

         14. - Participation in another clinical study two months before inclusion in the present
             study that could affect its objectives.
