  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Building confidence and capabilities to transfer rehabilitative knowledge and skills into
      lifestyle-workable strategies for changing health behaviours among stroke survivors are
      important to optimise health outcomes and reduce risks of recurrent stroke. The aim of this
      project is to promote stroke survivors' health by building confidence and positive
      expectations of recovery outcomes, and enabling their engagement in stroke self-management
      behaviours.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomised controlled trial will be conducted to determine the effectiveness of a programme
      &quot;Coaching Ongoing Momentum Building On stroKe rEcovery journeY&quot; (&quot;COMBO-KEY&quot;), a home
      visiting and phone coaching programme, on community-dwelling stroke survivors' self-efficacy,
      outcome expectation, and engagement in stroke self-management behaviours. An estimated sample
      of 134 stroke survivors will be recruited. COMBO-KEY will be underpinned by Bandura's
      constructs of self-efficacy and outcome expectation. It will be delivered by trained coaches.
      Outcomes will be measured at baseline and immediately after completion of the programme.
      Generalised estimating equations model will be used to assess the differential changes in
      outcome variables from pre-test to post-test between the intervention and control groups with
      adjustment for their baseline levels.

    <time_frame>Change from baseline level to immediately after completion of the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The 13-item Chinese version of the Stroke Self-Efficacy Questionnaire will be used. The items assess the stroke survivors' confidence in performing self-management behaviours over a 0-no confidence to 10-very confident points scale. All item scores are summed (total 0-130). Higher scores indicate higher self-efficacy.</description>

    <measure>Change in the level of outcome expectation of stroke self-management behaviours</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline level to immediately after completion of the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The 11-item Chinese version of the Stroke Self-management Outcome Expectation Scale will be used. The items assess the stroke survivors' confidence in the occurrence of outcomes after performing the self-management behaviours. All item scores are summed (total 0-110; each item is rated over 0-Strongly disagree to 10-Strongly agree). Higher scores represent higher confidence towards positive outcome.</description>

    <time_frame>Change from baseline level to immediately after completion of the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The 11-item Chinese version of the Stroke Self-management Behaviours Performance Scale will be used. The items ask the stroke survivors' satisfaction with their performance of self-management behaviours. All item scores are summed (total 0-110; each item is rated over 0-Strongly disagree to 10-Strongly agree). Higher scores represent higher satisfaction.</description>

    <measure>Change in the level of health-related quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline level to immediately after completion of the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The 49-item Chinese version of the Stroke Specific Quality of Life Scale will be used. The items ask the stroke survivors' agreement to the health conditions and difficulties in performing the tasks described. All item scores are summed (total 49-245; 1-Strongly disagree/couldn't do it to 5-Strongly agree/no trouble). Higher scores represent higher health-related quality of life.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the level of depressive symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline level to immediately after completion of the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The 15-item Chinese version of the Geriatric Depression Scale will be used. The stroke survivors will be asked for agreement to the items based on their condition (total 0-15; Yes-1 score or No-0 score). A score of 5-8 indicates mild depression; 9-11 moderate depression; and 12-15 severe depression.</description>

    <time_frame>Change from baseline level to immediately after completion of the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The 11-item Chinese version of the Reintegration to Normal Living Index will be used. The stroke survivors will be asked the extent to which the items described their situation (total 11-55; 1-A small extent to 5-A great extent). Higher scores represent better community reintegration.</description>

    <description>The intervention will last for eight weeks with four home visits and five phone coaching sessions. It will also consist of a 4-item resource package for stroke survivors (including a stroke self-management and self-discovery workbook, a health and life planning toolkit, and videos on sharing of experience by survivors who managed their post-stroke challenges successfully, and a stroke self-management quick reference guide). A telephone hotline for survivors and caregivers to seek information and support related to stroke self-management will also be established. A programme protocol will be developed to ensure the consistent delivery of the programme.</description>
