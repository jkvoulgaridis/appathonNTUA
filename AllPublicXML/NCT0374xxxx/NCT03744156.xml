  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Insomnia affects 67-88% of chronic pain patients. SPIN II is a randomized controlled clinical
      trial that will compare the effects of two cognitive behavioral sleep treatments in women
      with fibromyalgia and insomnia. This trial will yield important information about the roles
      of sleep, arousal, and brain structure and function in the development and maintenance of
      chronic pain in women with fibromyalgia.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This mechanistic trial will assess sleep, pain, arousal, and neural imagining outcomes at
      baseline, post-8 week behavioral treatment (CBT-I or SHE), as well as at 6 and 12 month
      followups. This information will provide novel information about the neural structures and
      functional networks associated with chronic pain, and their manipulation through a cognitive
      behavioral intervention to improve insomnia. Demonstration that a relatively brief
      intervention can reverse or resolve pain related maladaptive neural plasticity, and improve
      or resolve clinical pain symptoms would have immediate and far-reaching implications for
      millions of chronic pain sufferers as well as for the US healthcare system and economy.
