  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to see if a behavioral intervention known as retrieval-extinction
      training (RET) might affect craving in response to nicotine cues (e.g., pictures, videos and
      objects) and smoking behavior in men and women who smoke cigarettes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a recently published NIDA-funded study, the investigators found that lasting reductions in
      craving and smoking could be achieved with a brief behavioral intervention designed to alter
      memory processes underlying smoking-related nicotine addiction. The proposed project will
      replicate and extend these findings by 1) increasing the dose of intervention so as to
      bolster the observed treatment effects, 2) employing brain imaging methods to identify
      patterns of brain activity uniquely associated with the intervention and potentially
      predictive of treatment outcome, 3) extending follow-up period to more completely document
      the long-term effects of the intervention. Positive findings from this study could lead to
      the development of brief therapy that will not only improve treatment outcomes for smokers,
      but also be used in the treatment other substance use disorders and frequently co-occurring
      comorbidities such as PTSD.

    <measure>Mean Change on Craving Questionnaire Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Between Week 1 and Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>At each visit (baseline, intervention sessions, and follow-up test sessions), participants will complete a Craving Questionnaire survey at multiple timepoints during each visit (baseline, and after each cue exposure). The craving questionnaire lists four statements about craving for cigarettes (e.g., &quot;I have an urge for a cigarette&quot;), and the participants rate how they agree with the statements at that moment on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = strongly disagree and 5 = strongly agree). This measure will examine the change in behavioral response to cues over the course of the study, and differences in response between the R-E arms and NR-E arms.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change on Mood Form Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Between Week 1 and Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>At each visit (baseline, intervention sessions, and follow-up test sessions), participants will complete a Mood Form survey at multiple timepoints during each visit (baseline, and after each cue exposure). The mood form lists nine moods or emotions (e.g., &quot;Happy&quot; or &quot;Unhappy&quot;), and the participants rate how they are experiencing the moods at that moment on a scale of 0 to 6 (0 = Not at all and 6 = Extremely). This measure will examine change in behavioral response to cues over the course of the study, and differences in response between the R-E arms and the NR-E arms.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change in Heart Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Between Week 1 and Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>At each visit (baseline, intervention sessions, and follow-up test sessions), study staff will collect participant heart rate at multiple timepoints during each visit (baseline, and after each cue exposure). Study staff will connect participants to a BIOPAC MP100 data acquisition system using two electrodes affixed to the participants' ribcage or wrists to collect this data. This measure will examine change in physiological response to cues over the course of the study, and differences in response between the R-E arms and NR-E arms.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change in Skin Conductance</measure>
    <time_frame>Between Week 1 and Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>At each visit (baseline, intervention sessions, and follow-up test sessions), study staff will collect participant skin conductance at multiple timepoints during each visit (baseline, and after each cue exposure). Study staff will connect participants to a BIOPAC MP100 data acquisition system using two Ag/AgCI electrodes attached to the second phalanx of the first and third fingers of the participants' non-dominant hand to collect this data. This measure will examine change in physiological response to cues over the course of the study, and differences in response between the R-E arms and NR-E arms.</description>

    <description>At each visit (baseline, intervention sessions, and follow-up test sessions), study staff will collect participant blood pressure (both systolic and diastolic pressures) at multiple timepoints during each visit (baseline, and after each cue exposure). Study staff will connect participants to a non-invasive arm cuff to collect this data. This measure will examine change in physiological response to cues over the course of the study, and differences in response between the R-E arms and NR-E arms.</description>

    <intervention_name>Retrieval Extinction Training (RET)</intervention_name>
    <description>Retrieval extinction training (RET) is a behavioral intervention that involves cue-elicited retrieval followed by extinction training (i.e., massed unreinforced exposure to drug-associated cues). The first element of RET involves briefly presenting drug-associated cues to retrieve drug use memories. The second element, occurring after a brief interval, involves extinction training. It is argued that the initial retrieval of the memories prior to extinction training initiates a period of instability, which is followed by reconsolidation of the memories back into long-term storage. Extinction training during the period of instability is presumed to overwrite the original drug-associated cue with a non-drug-associated cue, to attenuate expression of drug-seeking behavior.</description>

    <description>The control retrieval extinction training (RET) for the NR-E arms serves as the control intervention to the RET behavioral intervention. The first element of the control RET involves briefly presenting retrieval cues that contain neutral, non-smoking content. The second element, occurring after a brief interval, involves extinction training. Based on findings from the previous NIDA-funded R21, the R-E arm reported a significant 25 percent reduction in cigarettes smoked per day during the follow-up period versus the control NR-E arm.</description>

    <description>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will identify patterns of brain activity associated with RET and potentially predictive of treatment outcomes. The fMRI is used during the baseline and 24-hour follow-up test sessions while participants complete a cue-reactivity task. The collection of fMRI data is based on findings from human fear conditioning fMRI studies, in which groups receiving RET in the reconsolidation window exhibited less fear that was associated with attenuated BOLD response in the amygdala, relative to the control. We propose that the R-E arm will evidence attenuated cue reactivity in medial prefrontal cortex, limbic regions and ventral striatum, and that greater reduction in BOLD response in regions of interest will predict decreased smoking.</description>
