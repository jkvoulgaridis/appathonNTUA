  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter retrospective study designed to compare overall survival (OS) by PD-L1
      expression status in patients with RCC who have received systemic chemotherapy for recurrent
      or metastatic RCC, to determine whether the prognosis is worse in PD-L1-positive than in
      PD-L1-negative RCC.

      Total 600 RCC surgical specimens will be collected from patients who started systemic
      chemotherapy for recurrent or metastatic RCC between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2015 at
      about 30 participating study sites in Japan.

      PD-L1 expression status (IC; immune cell) on tumor-infiltrating immune cells will be
      evaluated by IHC, and classified by score: IC0 (PD-L1-negative) and IC1, IC2, IC3
      (PD-L1-positive). Unless otherwise specified, between-group comparisons will be performed
      between IC0 and IC1/2/3.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Malignancies other than RCC is co-existed from the time of nephrectomy and death.

          -  2. Treatment with anti-CTLA-4 antibody, anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies as first-line
