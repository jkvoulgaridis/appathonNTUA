  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer worldwide is the third most common in men and the second in female,
      although mortality is not as high as its incidence, there is less survival in developing
      countries. According to data from the World Health Organization, in 2012, there were an
      estimated 1.4 million cases and 693,900 deaths from this disease. Patients with rectal cancer
      are frequently taken to resection surgery as a curative management of their malignant
      pathology, according to the type of resection or reconstruction. In a high number of cases,
      they are management with colorectal anastomosis with a derivative ileostomy in the same
      procedure. The closure of this ileostomy is usually done after two to three months of the
      procedure, however in our environment it could take up to six or twelve months, during which
      time the patient is exposed to social difficulties, management problems and complications,
      derived from it. The early closure (7-12 days of its creation) of an ileostomy, despite the
      little evidence, seems to be a safe, feasible procedure that would save the patient having to
      live temporarily with an ileostomy.

      General purpose:

      To compare the frequency of perioperative complications and quality of life between early
      closure of the derivative ileostomy versus conventional closure in postoperative patients
      with low anterior resection for rectal cancer.

      Materials and methods:

      Controlled clinical trial, randomized, to be carried out at the National Cancer Institute of
      Colombia E.S.E. Eligible candidates for the study will be patients older than 18 years who
      have undergone a previous resection of the rectum plus a derivative ileostomy for colorectal
      cancer. All patients eligible for inclusion will undergo computed axial tomography with
      rectal contrast medium on postoperative day 5. Those who meet the inclusion criteria and do
      not present any of the exclusion criteria will enter the study, prior willingness to
      participate by part of the patient and obtaining verbal and written informed consent. Through
      computer-generated randomization, patients will undergo early closure (between 7 and 12 days
      after the ileostomy) versus conventional closure (after 90 days or more time from the
      creation of the ileostomy). A sample size of 81 patients was calculated for each arm. The
      follow-up will be done in both groups at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after the creation of the
      ileostomy, including complications using the Clavien-Dindo classification and quality of life
      using the FACIT-C format. The statistical analysis will be done by protocol and intention to
      treat. The perioperative complications associated with the closure of the ileostomy, the
      complications associated with the presence of ileostomy, hospital stay, and quality of life
      will be analyzed.

      Expected impact:

      The investigators hope to find that the early closure of ileostomy in patients during the
      immediate postoperative period of previous resection due to rectal cancer is safe in terms of
      morbidity and mortality, feasible and with benefits in quality of life during the immediate
      postoperative period compared with patients to whom they are closed late (after 3 months).

Using the Clavien-Dindo classification (It consists of 7 grades (I, II, IIIa, IIIb, IVa, IVb and V). The introduction of the subclasses a and b allows a contraction of the classification into 5 grades (I, II, III, IV and V) depending on the size of the population observed or the of the focus of a study.
Complications that have the potential for long-lasting disability after patient's discharge (e.g.: paralysis of a voice cord after thyroid surgery) are highlighted in the present classification by a suffix (&quot;d&quot; for disability). This suffix indicates that a follow-up is required to comprehensively evaluate the outcome and related long-term quality of life)</description>
