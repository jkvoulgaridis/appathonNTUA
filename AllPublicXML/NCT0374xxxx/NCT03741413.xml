  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rh negative blood group is a rare blood group in China, as it only accounts for 0.3-0.4
      percent of the Han population. Therefore, low inventory is often found in blood collection
      and supply agencies in many regions in China. On July 18, 2018 blood stockpile of O-negative
      and B-negative in Guangzhou Blood Center reached the warning line, and we took measures for
      emergency recruitment. O-negative and B-negative blood donors whose last donation dates were
      between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2017 were identified and randomly assigned to three
      groups. Three different recruitment text messages were send to these groups respectively. At
      the same time, A-negative and AB-negative blood donors were marked as control group. We
      observed the re-donation rates among four groups within three months.
