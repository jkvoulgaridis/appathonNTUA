  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date, no interventions to prevent violence in refugee camp schools have ever been
      rigorously evaluated. The primary objective of this project is to test the effectiveness of
      the Empateach intervention to prevent physical violence from teachers to students in
      Nyarugusu Refugee Camp, Tanzania. Secondary objectives are to assess the impact of the
      Empateach intervention on student's depressive symptoms, experience of emotional violence and
      educational test scores. A two arm cluster RCT with parallel assignment will be conducted.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      School is one of the most common settings where children may experience violence; and
      emerging evidence suggests that in some settings, school staff may be one of the most common
      perpetrator of violence against children.To date, no interventions to prevent violence in
      refugee camp schools have ever been rigorously evaluated. The primary objective of this
      project is to test the effectiveness of the Empateach intervention to prevent physical
      violence from teachers to students in Nyarugusu Refugee Camp, Tanzania. Secondary objectives
      are to assess the impact of the Empateach intervention on student's depressive symptoms,
      experience of emotional violence and educational test scores.

      The aim of the Empateach intervention is to improve 'student and teacher well-being;
      self-regulation; teacher classroom management and teacher's use of positive discipline
      techniques'. Participants in the intervention condition will receive a 10-week group
      intervention.

      A two arm cluster RCT will be conducted, with parallel assignment and an approximately 1:1
      allocation ratio. Cross-sectional surveys of students will be conducted at three time points:
      a baseline, a midline immediately after the 10 week intervention; and an endline 6 months
      after then end of the intervention. The primary outcome, violence from school staff to
      students, will be measured using an adapted version of the ICAST-CI.

    <description>All teachers in intervention schools will be invited to participate. Participants in the intervention condition will receive Empateach, a 10-week group intervention. Groups meet 14 times for 1-1.5 hour length sessions, which are led by peers. The aim of the Empateach intervention is to improve 'student and teacher well-being; self-regulation; teacher classroom management and teacher's use of positive discipline techniques. The intervention uses cognitive behavioural therapy techniques to change negative thought and behaviour patterns related to corporal punishment. The teachers receive information on alternatives to corporal punishment, planning exercises and reinforcement SMS, and because the intervention is in a group setting, social support to change their behaviours. They discuss their experiences and challenges in group sessions.</description>

             The hypothesized intervention effect will be in all students being taught by
             participating teachers; however we will measure effects of the intervention in
             students who are aged 9 years and over. Data will be collected from both students and
             teachers.
