    <textblock>
      This is a 16-Week Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo Controlled, Parallel-Group, Multicenter
      Study Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety of OPN-375 186 μg Twice a Day (BID) in Adolescents
      with Bilateral Nasal Polyps followed by a 12-Week Open-Label Treatment Phase. The total
      planned number of subjects is approximately 120 adolescents (12-17 years of age) who will be
      randomly assigned to receive 1 of 2 study treatments using a 2:1 ratio (OPN-375 186 μg:
      Placebo). For the PK sub-study, up to 14 subjects will be enrolled to obtain 10 completers.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of intranasal administration
      of OPN-375 186 μg Twice a Day (BID) versus placebo in adolescents with bilateral nasal
      polyposis and nasal congestion by analyzing the reduction of nasal congestion/obstruction
      symptoms at the end of Week 4 measured by the 7-day average instantaneous morning diary
      symptom scores and the reduction in total polyp grade at Week 16 as determined by a nasal
      polyp grading scale score measured using a 0 to 6 point severity grading scale.
