  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the body's immune response at different time points
      to an FDA-approved seasonal influenza vaccine. By better understanding the way the immune
      system responds to the influenza vaccine, the investigators can design more effective
      vaccines against influenza.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study of seasonal, cell-cultured inactivated influenza vaccine
      (cc-IIV4) in healthy males and non-pregnant females aged 18 to 45 years old, inclusive. This
      clinical study is designed to comprehensively evaluate the characteristics and kinetics of
      the immune response to influenza vaccine.

      By developing a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms by which the immune system
      responds to influenza vaccine, including innate immune system responses, the effect of early
      influenza exposures, and (eventually) the effect of potent adjuvants, the investigators will
      be better equipped to design more highly effective vaccines to conquer seasonal influenza and
      prevent influenza pandemics.

      Data from this pilot observational study will guide the design of global studies addressing
      age-specific responses, the impact of sex and geography, and the role of adjuvants on
      influenza immunity.

             all study visits.

          -  Are males or non-pregnant females, 18-45 years of age, inclusive.

          -  Are in overall good health. (As determined by medical history and physical examination
             to evaluate acute or currently ongoing chronic medical diagnoses that could affect the
             assessment of the immunogenicity of influenza vaccine.)
