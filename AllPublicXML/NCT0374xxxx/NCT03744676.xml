    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase 2 study to determine the safety, PK, and efficacy
      of lisocabtagene maraleucel (JCAR017) in subjects who have relapsed from, or are refractory
      to, two lines of immunochemotherapy for aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in the
      outpatient setting. Subjects will receive treatment with JCAR017 and will be followed for up
      to 2 years.

      This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase 2 study to assess the safety and antitumor activity
      in adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin Lymphoma when administered
      with lisocabtagene maraleucel (JCAR017) in the outpatient setting.

      Upon the successful product generation of lisocabtagene maraleucel, subjects will enter the
      treatment phase of the study. Treatment will include lymphodepleting chemotherapy followed by
      lisocabtagene maraleucel administration. Subjects will then enter the post-treatment
      follow-up phase of the study and will be followed for approximately 24 months for safety,
      disease status, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and survival. Long-term follow-up
      will continue under a separate long-term follow-up protocol, per health regulatory authority
      guidelines, currently up to 15 years after the last lisocabtagene maraleucel administration.

    <description>The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 is a validated quality of life measure applicable to subjects with any cancer diagnosis. It is composed of 30 items that address general physical symptoms, physical functioning, fatigue and malaise, and social and emotional functioning. Subscale scores are transformed to a 0 to 100 scale, with higher scores on functional scales indicating better function and higher scores on symptom scales indicating worse symptoms.</description>

    <description>The EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) is a standardized measure of health status developed by the EuroQol Group in order to provide a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal. The EQ-5D-5L consists of the EQ-5D-5L descriptive system and the EQ Visual Analogue scale (EQ VAS). The descriptive system comprises dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression). Each dimension has 5 levels (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, extreme problems). The VAS rating scale is a vertical 20 cm visual analogue scale with the end points labeled best imaginable health state at the top and worst imaginable health state at the bottom having numeric values of 100 and 0 respectively. The participant is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking (or placing a cross) in the box against the most appropriate statement in each of the 5 dimensions.</description>

During lisocabtagene maraleucel production, subjects may receive low-dose chemotherapy for disease control. Upon successful generation of lisocabtagene maraleucel product, subjects will receive treatment which will include lymphodepleting chemotherapy followed by one dose of lisocabtagene maraleucel administered by intravenous (IV) injection.</description>
