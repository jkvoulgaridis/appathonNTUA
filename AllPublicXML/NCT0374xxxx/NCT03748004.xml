  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individual placement support (IPS) is an evidence-based supported employment model for people
      with severe mental illness, designed to achieve employment in mainstream competitive jobs,
      either part-time or full-time. The aim of this study is to assess the (i) effectiveness of
      embedding the (IPS)/Peer Support intervention as part of the primary care centre in securing
      employment of adults living in the downtown eastside in comparison to the usual treatment
      WorkBC (control group). (ii) effectiveness of IPS/Peer Support versus the usual treatment
      (WorkBC) in improving mental illness, quality of life and personal recovery through
      participation in employment.

      This 18-month mixed methods study consists of an effectiveness multi-site randomized
      controlled trial of the IPS/peer support intervention plus an embedded qualitative
      exploration of participants' experiences. All clients receiving primary care services from
      one DTES clinical site who are employment ready and are not receiving mental health services
      will be randomly assigned to IPS &amp; Peer Support (experimental group) or WorkBC (control
      group). Clients are required to participate in the intervention for 16 weeks and will be
      assessed at baseline, 1-, 3-, and 6-months post study intervention start-date for both
      groups. Assessments will include the 5 questionnaires administered at baseline which cover
      the following: Employment Quality, Employment Sustainability, Education Quality and Quantity,
      Quality of Life, Community Engagement and Clinical significant levels of depression and
      anxiety.
