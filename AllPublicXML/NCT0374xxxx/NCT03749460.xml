  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and how well nivolumab and ipilimumab works
      when given together with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in treating patients with
      salivary gland cancers. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab and
      ipilimumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the
      ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Stereotactic body radiation therapy uses special
      equipment to position a patient and deliver radiation to tumors with high precision. This
      method can kill tumor cells with fewer doses over a shorter period and cause less damage to
      normal tissue. Giving nivolumab and ipilimumab and SBRT may work better in treating patients
      with advanced salivary gland cancers.

      Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats
      every 2 weeks for up to 12 courses and then every 4 weeks for additional 8 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive ipilimumab IV
      over 60 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for up to 4 courses in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning week 3, patients undergo 3
      fractions of stereotactic body radiation therapy every other day in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 8 or
      12 weeks.

             cooperation with the requirements of the trial

          -  Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit
