  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are 3 levels of severity of anoxo-ischemic encephalopathy (EAI): mild, moderate and
      severe. Therapeutic hypothermia is beneficial in children with moderate EAI. It is
      ineffective in severe EAI and may be deleterious if there is no EAI. He continues to question
      his interest in light EAIs.

      There are few studies on the becoming of children with a mild anoxic-ischemic encephalopathy
      and not set hypothermia.

      The main hypothesis of the study is that term newborns with anoxo-ischemic encephalopathy who
      did not require therapeutic hypothermia have normal psychomotor development at 2 years.
