          -  Patient has failed to respond to conservative treatment of CTS

          -  CTS confirmed by strong clinical signs and positive Nerve Conduction Velocity (NCV)
             test

          -  Patient, or authorized representative, signs a written Informed Consent form to
             participate in the study, prior to any study mandated procedures Patient is willing

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has a prior or current musculoskeletal or neurologic condition that limits
             strength, motion, or sensation in the affected hand that is unrelated to carpal tunnel
             syndrome.

          -  Patient with stiff wrist, suspected space occupying lesions or other anatomic
             abnormalities of the forearm, wrist or hand or other concerns related to patient
             anatomy such as small wrist and/or thin skin

          -  Prior invasive treatment of the hand or wrist for disease processes such as De
             Quervain's syndrome, arthritic wrist etc. on the intended treatment side

          -  Previous trauma/fracture or other anatomic abnormalities of the forearm, wrist or hand
             on the intended treatment side

          -  Patient has an ipsilateral injury or other conditions affecting hand function

          -  Patient has had previous CTR surgery on the affected hand

          -  Patient has severe chronic median nerve neuropathy shown by the EMG and NCS that shows
             denervation of the thenar muscle

          -  Active local or systemic infection

          -  Known allergy to any device component

          -  Known severe allergy to contrast reagent that cannot be managed with premedication

          -  Any significant medical condition(s) that would place patient at excessive risk for
             surgery such as: known bleeding disorder including thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt;
             80,000), thrombasthenia, hemophilia or Von Willebrand's disease, unstable cardiac
             disease, renal failure or uncontrolled diabetes
