  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To study the feasibility and usefulness of multimodal MR compared to multimodal CT to select
      patients with acute ischemic stroke and favorable clinical outcome after mechanical
      thrombectomy. The specific objectives are to compare (1) the door-picture time and door-groin
      puncture time, (2) the rate of patients with acute stroke selected for endovascular treatment
      and (3) the safety and clinical response after thrombectomy between the two groups selected
      according to the imaging modality.

      Methodology: Single-center, randomized 1:1 and stratified by age and NIHSS study of
      consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke. Occlusion site, ischemic volume (core) and
      perfusion volume will be studied by an automated perfusion system (RAPID software) in both
      neuroimaging groups. Mechanical thrombectomy criteria will be based on the presence of an
      Intracranial Carotid Artery (ICA) or Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA)-M1 occlusion and a volume
      of core lower than 70cc in the Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF) or Diffusion Weighted Image (DWI)
      sequences. Modified Rankin scale at 90 days and the rate of intracranial hemorrhage and
      mortality will be considered as variables of response.

    <textblock>
      In acute ischemic stroke, arterial occlusion lead to a brain ischemia that will progress to
      brain death of the ischemic area if the clot is not rapidly removed. Advanced neuroimaging
      can help us to distinguish between the irreversible injury brain parenchyma or core and the
      potential reversible ischemic tissue or penumbra. Multimodal neuroimaging techniques (MR and
      CT) have been developed in order to distinguish between core and penumbra areas and have been
      used to select patients in most of the last randomized clinical trials that have demonstrated
      the benefit of endovascular treatment. There is no agreement about which multimodal technique
      offers a better information to select patients for endovascular treatment.

      The main aim is to study the feasibility and usefulness of multimodal MR compared to
      multimodal CT to select patients with acute ischemic stroke and favorable clinical outcome
      after mechanical thrombectomy.

      The specific objectives are: Primary: to confirm no differences in long-term clinical outcome
      and safety in patients treated with endovascular therapy selected by multimodal CT or MR; and
      Secondary: (1) compare the feasibility of both techniques in this setting, (2) the
      door-picture time and door-groin puncture time of both techniques.

      Methodology: Single-center, randomized (1:1) and stratified by age and NIHSS study of
      consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke. Occlusion site, ischemic volume (core) and
      perfusion volume will be studied by an automated perfusion system (RAPID software) in both
      neuroimaging groups. Mechanical thrombectomy criteria will be based on the presence of an
      intracranial ICA or MCA-M1 occlusion and a volume of core lower than 70cc in the CBF or DWI
      sequences. Modified Rankin scale at 90 days and the rate of intracranial hemorrhage and
      mortality will be considered as variables of response.

    <description>Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) ordinal distribution in each group. The mRS measures the patient functional status. It range from 0 to 6, and the values are (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6). The 0 value indicate a patient completely functional independent and without neurological deficit and 6 value indicate death. The value 1 indicate a minor neurological deficit but the patient is fully independent, the value 2 indicate that the patient do not perform all his activities (like work) but is fully independent for the daily activities so can live alone without assistance, value 3 indicates a patient partially dependent taht can not live alone during more than a week, value 4 indicates a patient totally dependent in a wheelchair but able to be some hours without assistance, and value 5 indicates a patient totally dependent in bed.</description>

It will be performed a multimodal MR taking into account that after discard an intracerebral haemorrhage and confirm an ischemic lesion if the patient fulfill criteria to receive intravenous alteplase, the test will be paused just to administer the treatment and immediately put again into the machine to complete the MR images. With all the information vascular neurologist will be decide if it is necessary administer endovascular treatment.</description>
