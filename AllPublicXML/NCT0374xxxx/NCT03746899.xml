      This is an Expanded Access program (EAP), sponsored by WideTrial for the treatment of
      critical limb ischemia (CLI).

      Widetrial, an Expanded Access specialist, has arranged to supply participating sites with
      PLX-PAD for CLI patients who cannot participate in the ongoing research trial and who seek
      exploratory treatment options. This program includes FDA-authorized cost recovery, meaning
      payment is required to cover a portion of the costs of delivering product and complying with
      regulatory obligations.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adult male or female subjects between ages 45 to 99 years of age at the time of
             screening.

          2. Subjects with a diagnosis of PAD due to atherosclerosis at the stage of CLI, with
             minor tissue loss up to the ankle level (ulcer/s and/or necrosis).

          3. Ankle pressure (AP) ≤70 mmHg or toe pressure (TP) ≤50 mmHg in the index leg or
             transcutaneous oxygen pressure (TcPO2) ≤30 mmHg.

          4. Subject unsuitable for revascularization (by any method) in the index leg based on
             unfavorable risk-benefit assessment of the physician investigator. Unsuitability to
             revascularization should be based on any of the following:

               1. Anatomic considerations as: inappropriate target artery, diffuse/extensive tibial
                  and/or peroneal artery lesions, inadequate distal run-off.

               2. Technical considerations as: inappropriate bypass conduit, failed recent
                  revascularization.

               3. Medical considerations: subject's comorbidities.

          5. Signed informed consent form.

          6. Subjects are not eligible for the ongoing phase III study with PLX-PAD in CLI
             (PLX-CLI-03) due to at least one of the following criteria:

               1. Evidence of active localized osteomyelitis secondary to contiguous focus of
                  infection, unless amputation is expected within 1 month post PLX-PAD
                  administration. In case of osteomyelitis, patients must be treated with
                  antibiotics during screening and PLX-PAD administration or as long as there is
                  evidence of active infection.

               2. Subject on renal replacement therapy or with eGFR &lt;15 mL/min.

               3. Current treatment with high dose systemic steroids (prednisone equivalent &gt;7.5
                  mg/day) or topical steroids on the index leg.

               4. History of autologous bone marrow transplantation (if not due to hematologic
                  malignancy) or solid organ transplantation, clinically stable.

               5. Immunocompromised subjects due to disease for any reason, including
                  immunosuppressive therapy, at screening (for steroid therapy, refer to the
                  criterion c)

               6. CLI with major tissue loss (Rutherford Category 6) in the contralateral leg.

               7. Diabetes mellitus with glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) &gt;10% at Screening.

               8. HIV controlled by antiretroviral therapy

               9. Past drug or alcohol abuse. Known history of cancer is eligible if occurred
                  beyond 2 years before screening

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Non-atherosclerotic PAD and vasculitis (e.g., Buerger's disease [thromboangiitis
             obliterans], Takayasu's arteritis, etc.).

          2. CLI with major tissue loss (Rutherford Category 6) in the index leg. Ulcers from
             venous or neuropathic origin if not associated with at least one ulcer from arterial
             origin.

          3. Evidence of active infection in either leg (e.g., cellulitis, myositis) except
             localized osteomyelitis secondary to contiguous focus of infection, under antibiotic
             treatment.

          4. Subject having undergone surgical/endovascular revascularization or major/minor
             amputation, in either leg, less than 1 month prior to Screening.
