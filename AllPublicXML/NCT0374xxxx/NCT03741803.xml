  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine if neonates (who already have an increased risk of
      hyperbilirubinemia due to mother's history of having previous neonate who received
      phototherapy for hyperbilirubinemia) have higher bilirubin levels 24 hours after birth with
      delayed cord clamping.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  mothers delivering at 35 weeks or greater

          -  mothers who have had at least 1 previous child that received phototherapy for
             hyperbilirubinemia

          -  multiple gestations can be included unless the neonate does not meet criteria for
             delayed cord clamping as described below or due to concerns about safety of delayed
             cord clamping for timing of delivery of the 2nd twin (ie: 2nd twin requires immediate
             delivery intervention)

        Exclusion Criteria:

        - Neonates who do not meet criteria for delayed cord clamping (any infant that any provider
        in the room felt needed evaluation by the neonatal transport team immediately so that the
        infant would be handed off for resuscitation. If the patient required delivery by cesarean
        section the delayed cord clamping protocol would be abandoned).
