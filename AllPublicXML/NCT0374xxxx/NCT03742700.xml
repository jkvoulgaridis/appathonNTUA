  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of our study was to assess acute, short term respiratory (airflow, FeNO, O2
      saturation, exhaled air temperature) and cardiovascular (heart rate, blood pressure)
      responses to smoking an e-cigarette in exclusive e-smokers and dual users and to compare
      these effects with responses to smoking a tobacco-cigarette in exclusive tobacco smokers.

    <masking_description>Subjects were divided into 4 groups (n=30 each) based on their self-declared smoking status: control (C), tobacco cigarette smokers (T-Smokers), exclusive e-cigarette users (E-Smokers) and dual users (T/E-Smokers).</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>O2 saturation</measure>
    <time_frame>pre - post (1 minute after exposure) - post (30 minute after exposure)</time_frame>
    <description>The O2 measurement was made in the sitting position using the PULSOX 2 electronic pulse meter. The result was recorded 15 seconds after the start of the measurement.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Concentration of nitric oxide (FeNO)</measure>
    <time_frame>pre - post (1 minute after exposure) - post (30 minute after exposure)</time_frame>
    <description>FeNO measurements were made using the standard procedure in the sitting position with a clip attached to the nose using a NIOX MINO device for measuring fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO). Subjects were instructed to breathe as deeply as possible through the mouthpiece to achieve maximum lung filling and then to exhale 50ml/sec for 10s. The measured FeNO values were expressed in ppb (parts per billion).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>exhaled carbon monoxide (CO)</measure>
    <time_frame>pre - post (1 minute after exposure) - post (30 minute after exposure)</time_frame>
    <description>During the measurement, requirements regarding the length and intensity of the exhalation were taken into account. The measurements were made using the PiCo Smokylyzer device. The measured CO levels were expressed in ppm (parts per million).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>temperature of exhaled air</measure>
    <time_frame>pre - post (1 minute after exposure) - post (30 minute after exposure)</time_frame>
    <description>The measurement was made using the standard procedure in the sitting position using an X-Halo Breath Thermometer [20]. Respondents were instructed to breathe according to the procedure recommended by the device manufacturer. The temperature of exhaled air was expressed in Celsius degrees (°C).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>spirometric testing</measure>
    <time_frame>pre - post (1 minute after exposure) - post (30 minute after exposure)</time_frame>
    <description>Airflow and lung volume were measured in the sitting position with a noseclip according to the ATS/ERS guidelines. The measurements were made using the EasyOne 2001 spirometer and included FEV1, FVC, FEV1% FVC, PEF and MEF75,50,25. Expiratory maneuvers were repeated until a minimum of three technically correct, repeatable measurements were obtained.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>heart rate</measure>
    <time_frame>pre - post (1 minute after exposure) - post (30 minute after exposure)</time_frame>
    <description>Heart rate was measured in the sitting position, the result of measurement was expressed in beats per minute.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>blood pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>pre - post (1 minute after exposure) - post (30 minute after exposure)</time_frame>
    <description>Blood pressure was measured in the sitting position, the result of measurement was expressed in mmHg.</description>
