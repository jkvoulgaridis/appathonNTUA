  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fat is a filler with ideal properties as it naturally integrates into tissues with 100 %
      biocompatibility. Moreover, fat contains different cell types, including adipocytes,
      fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, and adipogenic progenitor cells
      called&quot;preadipocytes&quot;2, adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) which have a differentiation
      potential similar to that of other mesenchymal stem cells and it could be harvested in great
      amounts with minimal donor-site morbidity, ASCs have proved to be particularly promising for
      regenerative therapies. In addition, it's relatively inexpensive and readily available, which
      makes it an attractive alternative for facial augmentation.

      On the other hand PEEK is considered a highly biocompatible material with mechanical
      properties almost similar to cortical bone. It is widely used in cranioplasties and facial
      reconstruction.

    <textblock>
      The chin is the most noticeable facial structure which plays an important role in perception
      of facial esthetics; therefore deficient chin is considered an annoying defect for the
      patient. Traditional techniques used for correction, which are osseous genioplasty and
      alloplastic augmentation, have some reported complications. These complications include
      hematoma in the floor of the mouth; though a rare complication is considered to be a life
      threatening condition. Also, wound dehiscence, infection, Chin hypoesthesia/dysesthesia due
      to mental nerve injury which occurs in 3.4% to 12% of cases , chin ptosis, lip ptosis,
      drooling, and an increase in lower teeth show due to failure to reattach the mentalis muscle
      to its natural origin on the anterior face of the mandibular body and tooth root damage which
      may occur during the osteotomy. Also bone resorption, implant displacement, infection and
      foreign body reaction were reported as a complication with some alloplastic implants .

      This study aims to avoid the complications of surgical correction of deficient chin by using
      less invasive approach.

      Trial design:

      3 Groups of patients will be assigned to this trial: Study group1: Will use autogenous fat
      augmentation in deficient chin. Study group2: Will use onlay PEEK augmentation in deficient
      chin. Control group: Surgical correction of deficient chin with sliding genioplasty. Trial
      design: Randomized Controlled clinical Trial

    <description>assessment of soft tissue profile changes using computerized software ,land marks will be determined on soft tissue mask of patient's cone beam computed tomography (cbct) .The Frankfort horizontal (FH) plane will be chosen as a reference line .Horizontal soft tissue changes will be recorded parallel to the FH line and perpendicular on the nasion vertical (NV), whereas the vertical soft tissue changes will be recorded parallel to the NV and perpendicular on the FH line.The advancement will be measured by the change in the position of point Pg preoperatively and postoperatively (T2) from the NV line.The points (Pg, Pg', Me, Me', and B) will be measured for vertical and horizontal movements by a line from each point and perpendicular to the NV and the FH</description>

    <description>The procedure will be done under general anesthesia; the donor site lower abdomen, flank, lateral thigh, or inner thigh will be infused using a solution that consisted of 100 ml of normal saline with 50 mg (0.05%) of lidocaine and 0.1 ml of epinephrine. Liposuction will be performed using a 2-mm blunt cannula. A 20-cc syringe will be used to collect the fat. The fat will be injected into the chin in a supraperiosteal (subcutaneous) plane with a blunt 2-mm cannula using a fanning technique.</description>
