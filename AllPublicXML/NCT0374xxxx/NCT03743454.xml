  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is important to determine the attitudes and behaviors of individuals towards regular
      exercise participation in order to direct individuals to physical activity or to implement
      effective practices related to increasing their participation.

      The aim of this study was to determine the awareness of physical activity in young adults,
      the relationship between physical activity awareness and physical activity level and to
      investigate the differences between sexes.

    <description>Physical activity will be assessed with IPAQ-SF questionnaire. IPAQ-SF is a self-report questionnaire that assesses PA in the last 7 days. Using the IPAQ-SF scoring system, the total number of days and minutes of PA were calculated for each participant as recommended in the IPAQ website. The IPAQ-SF records the activity in four intensity levels: sitting, walking, moderate intensity (e.g., leisure cycling), and vigorous intensity (e.g, running or aerobics).</description>

    <time_frame>After they completed the IPAQ-SF, its taken in the sixth minute.</time_frame>
    <description>Physical activity awareness will be assessed with Cognitive Behavioral Physical Activity Questionnaire (CBPAQ). The CBPAQ scale consists of 15 items, including three sub-dimensions: personal barriers, outcome expectations and self-regulation. The individual items are rated at 1-5 according to the situation in which they are most appropriate. The higher the score, the higher the level of awareness.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Steps</measure>
    <time_frame>After the individuals permission, number of steps will be taken at the end of the first week.</time_frame>
    <description>Number of steps will be evaluated by smartphone pedometer. Pedometer provides data about the number of steps taken by the individual, so it accurately measures the individual's walking activity only. Individuals which has less than 5000 steps per day were classified as &quot;sedentary&quot;, 5000-7499 steps &quot;low active,&quot; 7500-9999 &quot;somewhat active&quot; and 10000 steps and more were classified as 'active'. Number of steps per week will be taken from individuals and mean steps per day will be calculated from number of steps per week.</description>
