  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigated the efficacy of the Lido-Patch (lidocaine 5% medicated plaster) in
      treatment of pain caused by PHN which is a neuropathic pain syndrome (nerve-related pain
      conditions) following an acute attack of herpes zoster (shingles).

      Participants were treated up to 10 weeks in this study: an 8-week Run-in Phase of open-label
      treatment with Lido-Patch was followed by a 2-day to 14-day Double-blind Phase with
      Lido-Patch or Placebo Patch treatment. Only participants responding to open-label treatment
      with Lido-Patch were included in the Double-blind Phase. In a Follow-up Phase without
      treatment, the safety of participants was monitored for 1-2 weeks. Alternatively, patch
      application could be continued for up to 12 months in the clinical study KF10004/02.

    <intervention_model_description>An enriched enrolment, randomized-withdrawal, parallel-group design was applied. Only participants responding to open-label active treatment were included into the Double-blind Phase.
The study comprised:
A non-controlled, open-label enrichment phase with Lido-Patch treatment (Run-in Phase).
A double-blind, randomized-withdrawal phase (Double-blind Phase).
Upon request of the participant, treatment could be continued in the clinical study KF10004/02.
A Follow-up Phase without treatment for participants not continuing in KF10004/02.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>From Day 1 until time to exit in Double-blind Phase (maximum Day 14)</time_frame>
    <description>The time to exit was defined as the number of days after randomization where worsening of the pain relief score by 2 or more categories on a 6-item pain relief scale (verbal rating scale, VRS) on 2 consecutive days in comparison to the average pain relief in Week 8 of the Run-in Phase was reported.
The average pain relief in Week 8 of the enrichment phase was to be stated by the participant at the randomization visit. The VRS comprised the categories 1 = worse, 2 = no pain relief, 3 = slight, 4 = moderate, 5 = a lot, 6 = complete.</description>

    <time_frame>From screening at each visit up to the final visit (Week 10) [6 time points in total]</time_frame>
    <description>The CPSI is a 5-point verbal rating scale (VRS) designed to provide information on the influence of the pain on sleep quality with the items trouble falling asleep, needing sleep medication, and awakened by pain during the night/in the morning (categories of the VRS: never, rarely, sometimes, usually, always); in addition, the overall quality of sleep (categories of the VRS: poor, fair, good, very good, and excellent) was assessed. Participants were asked to complete the CPSI questionnaire at each visit.</description>

    <description>The SF-MPQ includes 15 words (11 sensory, 4 affective). Each word or phrase is rated on a 4-point intensity scale (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe). In addition, the 6-point Present Pain Intensity (PPI) rating (no pain, mild, discomforting, distressing, horrible, excruciating) is included as a visual analogue scale for rating pain intensity.</description>

    <description>Investigators were to describe their global impression of change (CGIC), i.e., the overall impression of the change of the participant's condition by answering the question &quot;Compared to the patient's condition at admission to the project, how much has he/she changed?&quot; The verbal rating scale comprises the categories not assessed [0], very much improved [1], much improved [2], minimally improved [3], no change [4], minimally worse [5], much worse [6], and very much worse [7]. When assessing the overall impression, the investigator was to refer to the Run-in Phase only.</description>

    <description>The Short Form 36 Quality of Life Index (SF-36 [Trade Mark]) standard version with a 4-week recall period was used as a self-assessment.
Eleven questions were answered on binomial (Yes/No) or on 3-, 5-, or 6-point categorical scales to generate the 8 raw scales (Physical Functioning, Role-Physical, Bodily Pain, General Health, Vitality, Social Functioning, Role-Emotional, Mental Health). Higher values of the raw scales represent a better outcome. The raw scales were converted into a transformed scale (transformed scale = [(actual raw score - lowest possible raw score) / possible raw score range] x 100).</description>

    <measure>Allodynia Assessment</measure>

    <description>Allodynia severity was rated using the following categorical scale: 0 = no pain or discomfort to touch; 1 = uncomfortable, but tolerable to touch; 2 = painful; 3 = extremely painful, participant cannot stand touching.
The test was conducted by means of a brush (type N12). The painful PHN area was stroked with the brush and the intensity of allodynic pain was assessed.</description>

             0-10), at the screening and enrolment visit. The pain assessment is the participant's
             recall of the pain intensity since the previous week.

          -  Written informed consent given.

        Randomization Criteria:

          -  Participants must be regularly (minimum every second day) using the Lido-Patch for
             control of pain in the last 4 weeks of the run-in phase. The participant must wait for
             pain to increase before applying a new patch.

          -  The participants' average daily pain intensity (with patch on) must be 7 or less on an
             11-point NRS (scale of 0-10), and must increase during the phases when a patch is not
             worn, during Week 8 of the Run-in Phase.

          -  Before randomization, the participant must have an average relief with Lido-Patch of
             &quot;moderate&quot; or better, on a 6-item scale (worse, no pain relief, slight, moderate, a
             lot, complete) during Week 8 of the Run-in Phase.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participation in another study of investigational drugs or devices parallel to, or
             less than 30 days before screening, or previous participation in this study.

          -  Known to or suspected of not being able to comply with the study protocol.

          -  Any clinically significant condition that would, in the investigator's opinion,
             preclude study participation for instance alcohol, medication or drug dependency,
             neurotic personality, psychiatric illness, epilepsy or suicide risk.

          -  Pregnancy or nursing mother.

          -  Woman in childbearing age without satisfactory contraception.

          -  Hypersensitivity to lidocaine or amide-type local anesthetic drugs.

          -  Active herpes zoster lesion or dermatitis of any origin at the affected site with PHN.

          -  Evidence of another cause for pain in the area affected by herpes zoster in addition
             to PHN, such as lumbar radiculopathy, surgery or trauma, if this could confound
             assessment or self-evaluation of the pain due to post herpetic neuralgia.

          -  Participants who had neurological ablation by block or neurosurgical intervention for
             control of pain in PHN.

          -  Participants using topically applied analgesic compounds on the PHN affected area.

          -  Presence of other severe pain that could confound assessment or self-evaluation of the
             pain due to PHN.

          -  Participants with severe hepatic disorder and/or alanine or aspartate aminotransferase
             equal to or above 3-fold the upper limit of normal (ULN).

          -  Participants with severe renal disorder and/or increased serum creatinine equal to or
             above 1.5-fold the upper limit of normal (ULN).

          -  Participants who are undergoing active treatment for cancer, are known to be infected
             with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or being acutely and intensively
             immunosuppressed following transplantation.
