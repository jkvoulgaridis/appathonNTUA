  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to monitor adherence to a clothing-attached breathing monitor,
      respiratory patterns, and activity levels in COPD patients, and correlate those respiratory
      patterns and activity levels with patient-reported symptoms and events. To achieve this
      purpose, Spire will collect data from a wearable monitor that participants attach to the
      participant's clothing, an associated smartphone application, and completion of weekly
      questions. The wearable monitor and the consumer smartphone application to be used are
      consumer products and currently available in the market.

      This study does not include clinical intervention and no doctors will be involved in this
      study.

      No clinical tests or office visits are included in this study. All data will be collected
      through an online survey tool and remotely through the wearable sensors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory, observational, non interventional, single-arm, open label, remote
      pilot study involving up to 150 self-reported COPD participants. Eligible participants will
      wear the Spire biophysiological health monitors for a period of 9 months while the
      participants report symptoms on a weekly basis via brief surveys. If and when participants
      incur a COPD-related exacerbation which results in a medication change after hospitalization
      or contact with a healthcare provider, participants will report this on the weekly surveys.
      When this survey is read by a study nurse, the nurse will follow up with the participant by
      phone to conduct a post-exacerbation phone screening. This data would provide context to
      inform how to correlate the biosensor-sensed physiological parameters with the exacerbation
      self-reported data. All study participants will be remotely distributed throughout the United
      States.

    <description>Participants will wear a Spire health monitor every day for 9 months and receive weekly emails with a short survey about the participant's condition and symptoms. If participants fail to respond to this email or Spire detects that a participant is not wearing the monitor, participants will be contacted by a nurse. While participants are wearing the monitor, Spire will make sure the sensors are collecting data but will not review the data in real time. If a participant's monitor stops sending data to Spire for more than 24 hours, the participant will be contacted. If the participant is unreachable for 10 days the participant's emergency contact will be contacted. If neither the participant nor the emergency contact is reachable over 24 days the participant will be removed from the study.</description>
