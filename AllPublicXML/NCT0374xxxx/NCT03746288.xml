    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, controlled clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of CAN008 administered once-weekly with re-radiation therapy (rRT) in patients with an
      initial relapse of GBM. The subjects will be randomized into the treatment group (CAN008 +
      rRT) or the control group (rRT). The investigational treatment can be continued as long as
      the subjects have experienced lasting clinical benefits (complete response [CR], partial
      response [PR] or stable disease [SD]).

      This study will be carried out in GBM subjects with an initial or second relapse. The
      subjects must have received standard care, including combination of radiotherapy and TMZ
      after surgical resection, and must be candidates for re-radiation therapy (rRT).
