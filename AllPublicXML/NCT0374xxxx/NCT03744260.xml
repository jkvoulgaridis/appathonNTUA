  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of lumbar medial branch radiofrequency
      ablation (RFA) on lumbar multifidi muscle size and clinical spinal stability. Specifically,
      this study is designed to highlight the comparison of multifidi muscle architecture using
      ultrasound imaging (USI) and MRI before and after lumbar medial branch RFA. This study will
      also include a commonly utilized functional assessment of the lumbar spine to evaluate the
      effects of RFA on lumbar spinal stability.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for the lumbar spine (lower back) is a procedure used to treat
      lower back pain secondary to facet arthritis. The procedure ablates (burns) a small nerve
      that goes to the arthritic joint in the back. This nerve also innervates a muscle called the
      multifidus, thought to be important for lumbar stability. The investigators are conducting a
      study to evaluate if RFA has any impact on multifidi size, spinal stability, and overall
      function. The tools the investigators will be using to assess the multifidi muscles are
      musculoskeletal ultrasound, MRI, physical therapy assessment, and functional questionnaires.
      The goal of the study is to determine if RFA impacts the multifidi in a clinically
      significant fashion, causing atrophy, spinal instability, and/or functional decline.

    <measure>Score on Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months after radiofrequency ablation procedure</time_frame>
    <description>The Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) is a unidimensional measure of pain intensity in adults. Respondents are asked to select a whole number (0-10 integers) that best reflects the intensity of his/her pain. The 11-point numeric scale ranges from '0' representing one pain extreme (e.g. &quot;no pain&quot;) to '10' representing the other pain extreme (e.g. &quot;pain as bad as you can imagine&quot; or &quot;worst pain imaginable&quot;).</description>

    <measure>Percentage Score on the Modified Oswestry Disability Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months after radiofrequency ablation procedure</time_frame>
    <description>This is a patient-completed questionnaire which gives a subjective percentage score of level of function (disability) in activities of daily living in those rehabilitating from low back pain. It examines perceived level of disability in 10 everyday activities of daily living, which each statement scored from 0 (no disability) to 5 (worst pain). An aggregate score (percentage) is then calculated, with 0% indicating no disability to 100%, indicating crippled or bed-bound.</description>
