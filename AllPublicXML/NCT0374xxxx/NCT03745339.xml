      Background:

      People with addictions often find it hard to choose the long-term benefits of abstinence over
      the short-term effects of using drugs. Researchers think this is partly due to parts of the
      brain involved in certain types of learning and decision-making. Researchers want to test
      these basic functions using a simple task with pictures and odors.

      Objective:

      To see if performance in a learning task differs between people who have opioid-use disorder
      and people who don t.

      Eligibility:

      Adults 21-50 years old who are willing to fast for at least 6 hours and smell food odors.
      Those with an opioid-use disorder must either not use for at least 3 weeks or be in
      treatment.

      Design:

      Participants will have 1 visit that will take up to 5 hours.

      Before the visit, participants will be asked to not eat or drink anything except water for at
      least 6 hours.

      At the visit, participants will be checked for signs of intoxication.

      Participants will give urine and breath samples.

      Participants will have tests of learning and behavior. They will look at shapes on a computer
      screen. The shapes will be paired with different food odors.

      The odors will come from a sterile tube placed under the nose.

      Participants will have their breathing monitored with a belt around the upper abdomen.

      About 30 days and 60 days later, participants will be called and asked about their drug use
      over the past 30 days.

      Background. People with substance-use disorders may have difficulty guiding their behavior on
      the basis of not-yet-experienced outcomes such as long-term effects of substance use. Use of
      mental inferences about future outcomes can be tested in a relatively simple laboratory task
      called sensory preconditioning.

      Objective. To test whether sensory-preconditioning performance is worse in people with
      opioiduse disorder (OUD) than in healthy, demographically matched controls. To increase
      generalizability, we will examine OUD participants who are in agonist treatment (abstinent or
      not) and OUD participants who are abstinent but not in treatment. We do not have a hypothesis
      about differences between those two groups, but we hypothesize that among agonist-treated OUD
      participants, performance will correlate with degree of abstinence.

      Participant population. We will enroll 3 groups of men and women: (1) history of OUD, but
      abstinent for at least 3 weeks and not in agonist treatment, (2) OUD being treated with an
      agonist (buprenorphine or methadone), (3) no history of a substance-use disorder (except
      nicotine, for matching purposes) and not using any drug for nonmedical purposes.

      Experimental design. Between-groups cross-sectional single-session laboratory study, with
      telephone follow-up at 30 and 60 days.

      Methods. Each participant will participate in a sensory preconditioning task conducted in a
      single session. The task uses food odors delivered via nasal cannula and paired with visual
      cues on a computer screen. There are three phases: (1) Preconditioning, in which 2 pairs of
      visual cues (A+B, C+D) are shown on the computer screen; participants should acquire
      automatic associations between A+B and between C+D. (2) Conditioning, in which participants
      learn associations between the second cue of each pair (B and D) and either a sweet odor
      (B1), a savory odor (B2), or no odor (D); and (3) Probe Test, in which participants predict
      whether a visual cue will be paired with the sweet odor, the savory odor, or no odor, by
      pressing a left, middle, or right button. No odors are actually delivered in the probe test.
      The test of inference guided behavior is the ability to associate visual cues A and C with an
      odor despite their never having been directly paired with an odor. In telephone follow-up at
      30 and 60 days, participants will be asked to report drug use and associated problems since
      the session or follow-up call.

      Primary outcome measures. (1) Value-based outcome inference as measured using responding to
      cues A minus C in the probe test. It is defined as the percentage of trials in which
      behavioral responses indicate a prediction of any odorant (sweet or savory), independent of
      whether this prediction is correct. Responding to cues B minus D will be used as a covariate
      to control for differences in olfactory acuity and non-inference-based task performance.

      Secondary outcome measures. (1) The percentage of trials in which the odor prediction is
      correct. (2) Response latency per cue type. (3) Amplitude and (4) latency of respiratory
      (sniff) responses per cue type. (5) Acquisition (% responding to B minus D in the last run of
      conditioning) during the training portion of the inferencing task. (6) Drug use and
      associated problems at follow-up.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        The enrollment target for the protocol is 120 (40 healthy controls, 40 patients on agonist
        maintenance, and 40 participants who have met DSM 5 criteria for OUD, but are now abstinent
        (for at least 3 weeks) and not on agonist maintenance.

        All Participants

          -  Control Group

               -  Age between 21 and 60 years inclusive. Rationale: objective olfactory impairment
                  grows more prevalent with age; after age 53, the prevalence is 24.5%, increasing
                  to 62.5 % in people aged 80-97 years.

               -  Willing to fast for at least 6 hours prior to the study session and be exposed to
                  food odors.

          -  Abstinent OUD group

               -  Age between 21 and 60 years inclusive. Rationale: objective olfactory impairment
                  grows more prevalent with age; after age 53, the prevalence is 24.5%, increasing
                  to 62.5 % in people aged 80-97 years.

               -  Willing to fast for at least 6 hours prior to the study session and be exposed to
                  food odors.

               -  History of opioid-use disorder (DSM-5), to be assessed via the Mini International
                  Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). History of SUDs can include substances in
                  addition to opioids (e.g., cocaine).

               -  Abstinent &gt; 3 weeks from all illicit substances (tobacco smoking and nondependent
                  drinking permissible), to be assessed via 30-day timeline follow-back calendar.
                  (Current abstinence will be confirmed via urine screen: see exclusion criteria.)
                  Rationale: Although heterogeneity will be considerable, what all enrollees will
                  have in common is having become abstinent from opioids long enough to be past
                  withdrawal symptoms. Their heterogeneity in duration of abstinence and other
                  drughistory measures will enable us to examine relationships between those things
                  and inferencing performance.

          -  In-treatment OUD group

               -  Age between 21 and 60 years inclusive. Rationale: objective olfactory impairment
                  grows more prevalent with age; after age 53, the prevalence is 24.5%, increasing
                  to 62.5 % in people aged 80-97 years.

               -  Willing to fast for at least 6 hours prior to the study session and be exposed to
                  food odors.

               -  Current enrollment in treatment for OUD with buprenorphine or methadone. Current
                  use of illicit substances during treatment is permissible but not required.
                  Rationale: Again, heterogeneity will be considerable, but what all enrollees will
                  have in common is having sought treatment for their OUD and being currently
                  maintained on an agonist that permits adaptive everyday functioning. Their
                  heterogeneity in ongoing use of illicit substances will enable us to examine
                  relationships between inferencing performance and treatment response.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Control Group only

             -- History of a substance-use disorder (except nicotine, for matching purposes), or
             current use of any drug for nonmedical purposes

          -  Control Group and Abstinent Group

               -  Anosmia, dysosmia, or hyposmia (poor olfactory function), to be assessed via
                  Sniffin

          -  History of neurosurgery, ear/nose/throat (ENT) surgery (including laryngectomies,
             tracheotomies), or cardiac surgery (including pacemaker or neurostimulator placement).
             To be assessed by history and physical. Rationale: could impair task performance.

          -  Current use of medications that may impact olfaction including macrolides,
             antimycotics, fluoroquinolones, ACE inhibitors, protein kinase inhibitors, proton pump
             inhibitors, and intranasal zinc products. To be assessed by history and physical.
             Rationale: could impair task performance.

          -  History of endocrine disorders, including hypothyroidism, hypoadrenalism, and diabetes
             mellitus; significant medical illness including cardiovascular disease, cancer,
             chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, renal insufficiency requiring dialysis,
             etc. To be assessed by history and physical. Rationale: could impair task performance.

          -  History of DSM-5 major psychiatric disorder including uncontrolled major affective
             disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, schizophrenia, and PTSD. (Candidates will not
             be excluded for a history of depression that is now being successfully treated.) To be
             assessed by MINI interview. Rationale: could impair task performance.

          -  History of significant food or non-food allergy, including latex, detergents, soaps.

             performance

          -  Current use of medications that affect alertness (e.g. barbiturates, benzodiazepines,
             cannabinoids, chloral hydrate, haloperidol, lithium, carbamazepine, phenytoin, etc.)To
             be assessed by history and physical. Rationale: could impair task performance.

          -  For women: pregnancy. To be assessed by history and physical and by urine testing.
             Rationale: Could affect task performance-physiological and hormonal changes during
             pregnancy influence rhinological function.

          -  Any other medical illness or condition that in the judgment of the investigators is
             incompatible with study participation.

          -  Cognitive impairment severe enough to preclude informed consent or valid self-report
             (per History &amp; Physical and Evaluation to Sign Consent).

          -  Urine positive for any illicit drug. Rationale: Controls should have no drug use;
             abstinent OUD group should have no drug use in the last 3 weeks which would include
             the several-day time frame to which urine screens are sensitive. In-treatment OUD
             participants may test positive during screening because they may have ongoing use.
             However, they will be asked to test negative on the day of their experimental session,
             so that the three groups will be more comparable in terms of acute drug exposure.

          -  Current signs or symptoms of opioid withdrawal, to be assessed in the Abstinent group
             via the Clinical Opioid Withdrawal Scale (COWS) and the Subjective Opioid Withdrawal
             Scale (SOWS).

          -  Unwillingness to smell one of more of the task odors (pot roast; cooked onions; fried
             potato; sauteed garlic; gingerbread; strawberry; cake; dulce de leche).

          -  Anosmia, dysosmia, or hyposmia (poor olfactory function), to be assessed via Sniffin
             Sticks threshold test &lt;4; or presence of a known smell, taste or ear-nose-throat
             disorder, to be assessed by history and physical.

          -  History of degenerative processes of the CNS (Parkinson disease, Alzheimer disease);
             other neurologic diseases (Huntington disease, multiple sclerosis, other motor-neuron
             diseases); inflammatory conditions (sarcoidosis, Wegener granulomatosis); or
             significant cerebrovascular disease including (but not limited to) epilepsy, stroke,
             or meningitis. To be assessed by history and physical. Rationale: any of these could
             impair task performance.

          -  History of traumatic brain injury (TBI) or major head trauma with sustained loss of
             consciousness (&gt;30 min). To be assessed by history and physical. Rationale: could
