  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current treatment based on evidence-based medicine for acute ischemic stroke mainly
      includes reperfusion (intravenous thrombolysis, mechanical thrombolysis), anti-platelet and
      stroke units. About 1/3 patients can obtain good prognosis through intravenous thrombolysis.
      Good prognosis can be gotten from about 50 percent of patients with big artery disease by
      mechanical embolization. However, only a small proportion of the population can be treated
      with restoration perfusion in the time window. The main purpose of antiplatelet therapy is to
      prevent the recurrence and progression of stroke, and stroke unit is a kind of management
      mode. How to improve the neurological function of patients has been a hot and difficult
      problem in clinical practice.

      A large number of basic and clinical studies have proved that remote ischemic conditioning
      (RIC) has protective effect on ischemic stroke. Hahn et al showed that RIC could play a
      neuroprotective role in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury in MCAO model. Other studies
      have also confirmed that preconditioning RIC has a neuroprotective effect on cerebral
      ischemia in animal models. One open label study by Hougaard et al shows that RIC can improve
      the NIHSS score in acute ischemic stroke patients. One recent study found that 300
      consecutive days RIC therapy for the patients with symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic
      stenosis significantly reduced the recurrence rate of stroke, improved the mRS score and
      recovered the blood flow in the lesion site. Furthermore, several studies have also shown
      that RIC can not only improve the neurological function of patients with cerebral infarction
      after intravenous thrombolysis and mechanical thrombolysis, but also protect the secondary
      brain injury after carotid stenting. These results suggest that RIC has a neuroprotective
      effect on ischemic stroke and deserves further study.

      Based on the above discussion, this study aims to explore the efficacy and safety of RIC in
      the treatment of acute moderate ischemic stroke.
