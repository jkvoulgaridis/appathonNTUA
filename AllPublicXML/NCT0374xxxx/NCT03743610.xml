  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators expect to find that different intensity and altitude exposure levels will
      show what kind of intermittent exposure protocol is more beneficial to athletes and healthy
      individuals that experience acute exposure to altitude during exercise. This may furthermore
      be related to acute altitude exposure for recreational exercise use as well.
