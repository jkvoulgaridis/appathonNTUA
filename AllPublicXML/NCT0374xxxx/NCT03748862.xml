  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to examine the effects of opioid taper plans as documented in
      the electronic medical record for Kaiser Permanente Washington (KPWA) patients. The study
      will compare different types of opioid tapering plans and will report on their effectiveness
      in producing sustained taper or discontinuation of long-term opioid therapy for chronic
      non-cancer pain while maintaining adequate pain control. The study population is KPWA
      patients receiving long-term opioid therapy from 2010 to 2017.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Opioid taper is now encouraged by many health care organizations, but it is unclear if
      explicit plans for opioid taper by primary care providers are effective at promoting tapering
      or discontinuation, and if they are effective, which components account for their
      effectiveness. Patients receiving long-term opioid therapy (LtOT), who are candidates for
      tapering, often perceive a low risk of overdose and a high risk of increased pain with opioid
      tapering. They fear opioid withdrawal and lack of effectiveness of non-opioid therapies. For
      patients with opioid tapering experience, support from family and a trusted health care
      provider eased opioid tapering. Many patients report improved quality of life following
      taper.

      Little data exists on the optimal opioid taper strategy, including: use of long or
      short-acting opioids, frequency of clinic visits, use of adjunctive medications and the role
      of psychological support. Recent initiatives to reduce high-dose opioid use at Kaiser
      Permanente Washington offer an opportunity to study the effect of opioid taper plans and
      their components in an integrated care system with an electronic health record including all
      health encounters and pharmacy dispensing.

      This study will report the proportion of LtOT patients who successfully taper compared to a
      similar group of LtOT patients who don't achieve tapering or discontinuation of tapering. We
      will also evaluate whether taper plans, defined by the patient's primary care provider,
      increase the likelihood of successfully tapering comparing the two groups cited above.

    <description>First, the study will describe the proportion and characteristics of patients on long-term, high-dose opioid therapy (LtOT) for chronic non-cancer pain who: a) initiate a taper attempt, b) successfully taper, or c) discontinue opioids. Demographic and clinical characteristics of patients who successfully taper will be compared to characteristics of patients who do not. We consider a successful taper to have occurred when a patient's average quarterly morphine milligram equivalents (MME) dose (calculated as the rolling average of the current and previous quarter's mean quarterly MME) falls below a specified threshold for two consecutive quarters after study entry. Each quarter of a sustained taper must meet one of the following two criteria and can be a combination of the two:
Low dose of â‰¤30 MME (considered a &quot;safe&quot; dose)
At least a 50% reduction in MME from the near peak dose</description>

        To be eligible for this study a patient must be receiving long-term opioid therapy (LtOT)
        as follows: 1) must be Kaiser Permanente Washington (KPWA) patient, 2) must receive opioid
        therapy consisting of at least a 60-day supply and a mean daily dose of at least 50
        milligrams morphine equivalent (MME) per calendar quarter for two consecutive calendar
        quarters between Jan 2011 and Dec 2015, 3) must not die, have a gap in health plan
        enrollment or pharmacy benefits during the two calendar quarters in which they qualified
        for study entry, 4) must have no cancer diagnoses during the study period (2010-2017), and
        5) must have at least two quarters of follow-up after study entry.

        A sub-analysis will focus on LtOT patients with a mean daily dose of at least 90 MME
        instead of 50 MME.
