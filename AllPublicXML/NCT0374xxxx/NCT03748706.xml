    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2a, multi-center, open-label study of PTI-125 in mild-to-moderate AD
      patients, 50-85 years of age. A total of twelve (12) patients will be enrolled into the
      study. Patients will receive 100 mg b.i.d. of PTI-125. The objectives of this study are to
      investigate the safety, pharmacokinetics and effect on biomarkers of PTI-125 following 28-day
      repeat-dose oral administration.
