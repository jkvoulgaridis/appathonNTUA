  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current standard of care prior to determination of brain death in subjects with suspected
      anoxic brain injury is to exclude complicating medical conditions that may confound clinical
      assessment (such as severe electrolyte, acid base, endocrine or circulatory disturbance),
      achieve normothermia and normal systolic blood pressure over 100 mmHg (with or without
      vasopressor use), exclude the presence of neuromuscular blocking agents (with the presence of
      a train of 4 twitches with maximal ulnar nerve stimulation) as well as to exclude the
      presence of CNS depressant drug effects. At the present time the latter is done by history,
      drug screen and allowing enough time for paralytic and sedative drugs to be metabolized and
      cleared from the body. Clearance is calculated by using 5 times the drug's half-life assuming
      normal hepatic and renal functions. Half-life can also be prolonged in subjects who have been
      treated with induced hypothermia. Literature search revealed articles with general guidelines
      and approaches to brain death, but none addressed pharmacological reversal of sedative drugs

  <detailed_description>

      Question of proposed study is whether a subject's comatose state is secondary to delayed
      clearance of a previously administered CNS depressant. By using pharmacologic reversal agents
      of commonly used benzodiazepines and opioids, the investigators aim to identify participants
      that may likely improve after complete clearance of the drugs from their system.

      Prospective trial with enrollment of 30 subjects in 2 intensive care units at Palmetto Health
      Richland from January 1st 2019 to June 30th 2020. Research procedures will be performed in
      the intensive care setting. If participants had undergone targeted temperature management
      (33-36 degrees Celsius for 24 hours via intravascular or surface control methods, with or
      without sedation or neuromuscular blockade, followed by rewarming actively or passively at
      0.25-0.5 degrees per hour over 8-12 hours to 37 degrees) investigators will wait 24 hours
      after rewarming prior to testing. End point is to evaluate if pharmacological reversal agents
      would result in improved GCS scores or return of cerebral or brainstem functions in some
      comatose subjects, which will be considered a positive test result.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults with cardiac arrest who may have completed targeted temperature management
             (hypothermia protocol) and have had no neurological recovery after 24 hours of
             rewarming will be enrolled. Subjects will have a suspected diagnosis of anoxic brain
             injury secondary to cardiac arrest, and seizures ruled out with an EEG. All subjects
             are expected to be unable to consent and consent will be obtained from their legal
             authorized representative.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Spontaneous recovery of neurological functions, presence of seizures on EEG,
             individuals who are not yet adults, pregnant women and prisoners.
