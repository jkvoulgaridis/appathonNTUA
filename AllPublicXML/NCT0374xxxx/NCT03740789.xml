    <textblock>
      It remains unknown whether antiviral therapy is beneficial for chronic hepatitis B (CHB) with
      normal or mild ALT.The investigators aim to evaluate the antiviral indications combining
      liver biopsy and clinical parameters,and further clarify the response indexes of clinical
      results such as virological, serological, biochemical and histological responses from a
      retrospective observational cohort study on antiviral therapy in HBeAg positive and negative
      patients with different ALT levels,especially when ALT lower 2 times upper limit of normal
      (ULN).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is estimated that 400 million people worldwide are chronically infected with hepatitis B
      virus (HBV).Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) often leads to serious health conditions including
      decompensated liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Therefore, the goal of
      chronic hepatitis B (CHB) therapy is to achieve sustained suppression of HBV replication and
      remission of liver disease.Clinical CHB management guidelines suggest recommend threshold for
      antiviral therapy when ALT was more than 2 times ULN.No antiviral drugs are recommended for
      patients with normal ALT or mildly elevated ALT unless they exhibit symptoms of advanced
      fibrosis or liver cirrhosis.But chronic HBV infections with normal or mild ALT levels may
      develop latently into CHB,even cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).The ALT level is
      easily influenced by many factors.Antiviral therapy may still be needed for some HBV patients
      with normal or mildly abnormal ALT levels. Therefore, the investigator's purpose is to
      evaluate of antiviral indications and therapeutic effect by liver biopsy and clinical trial
      parameters on chronic HBV infection with different ALT levels,especially when ALT lower 2
      times upper limit of normal (ULN).

        All the patients underwent a liver biopsy were followed for at least 12 months(range,12-48
        months) and follow-up assessments were performed at months 12, 24, 36 and 48.All the
        patients were detected Serum HBV DNA,HBV markers,including HBsAg,HBsAb,HBeAg,HBeAb,and
