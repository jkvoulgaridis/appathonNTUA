  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Premature cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in patients with kidney
      disease (CKD). Excessive cardiac mortality is thought to be secondary to non-atherosclerotic
      processes, with left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy (LVH) and remodelling being the predominant
      phenotypical features. Along with other risk factors, subclinical ischaemia and haemodynamic
      perturbations associated with haemodialysis (HD) are thought to contribute to the ultimate
      development of LV systolic and diastolic dysfunction. The development of these adverse
      features reflects a specific cardiomyopathy due to CKD and subsequently, to uraemia. Patients
      receiving hemodialysis (HD) have a higher incidence rate of heart failure (predominantly with
      preserved ejection fraction), with phenotypically eccentric hypertrophic remodelling,
      systolic and diastolic dysfunction as well as high rate of interstitial myocardial fibrosis.
      Detection and ultimately reversal of the development of this CKD-related cardiomyopathy are
      important goals for improving the CVD, morbidity and mortality of CKD patients.The objectives
      of this study are, firstly, to investigate the complex myocardial phenotype in patients with
      various stages of CKD, secondly, to relate the CMR-measures to outcome, and thirdly, to be
      able to estimate the effects of chronic uremia/hypervolemia. Deciphering the predominant
      driver of remodelling on an individual level may help to personalise anti-remodelling
      strategies. Native T1 and T2 mapping imaging provide non-invasive imaging tools to detect
      myocardial fibrosis and oedema, respectively. Prognostic associations of these measures may
      clarify the relative prevalence of adverse phenotype and their relative contribution to
      adverse events and poor outcome. The role of chronic water retention and uraemia may be
      associated with interstitial myocardial oedema promoting further the remodelling process.
