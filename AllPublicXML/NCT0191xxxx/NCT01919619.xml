    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies the side effects of lenalidomide and ipilimumab after stem
      cell transplant in treating patients with hematologic or lymphoid malignancies. Biological
      therapies, such as lenalidomide, may stimulate or suppress the immune system in different
      ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as
      ipilimumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the
      ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving lenalidomide with ipilimumab may be a
      better treatment for hematologic or lymphoid malignancies.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety of lenalidomide in combination with ipilimumab in autologous and
      allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Overall response rate. II. Overall survival, progression-free survival. III. Cumulative
      incidence of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) with the competing risk of
      relapse in allogeneic transplant patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive lenalidomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 of courses 1, 3, 5 and
      7. Beginning 1-3 days after the last dose of lenalidomide patients receive one dose of
      ipilimumab intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes of courses 2, 4, 6 and 8. Treatment repeats
      every 28 days for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36
      months.
