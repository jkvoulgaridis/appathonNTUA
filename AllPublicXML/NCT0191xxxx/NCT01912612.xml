  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early stage breast cancer is typically treated with surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy,
      and/or endocrine therapy. Following treatment, 25-60% of breast cancer survivors have
      reported chronic pain, which can be difficult to manage. Duloxetine is a serotonin
      norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor that is FDA approved for treatment of depression, anxiety,
      fibromyalgia, diabetic neuropathic pain, knee arthritis, and low back pain.

      Pilot data suggest that duloxetine is effective in management of endocrine therapy-associated
      musculoskeletal pain, and a randomized placebo controlled trial of duloxetine has
      demonstrated efficacy for treatment of chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain. In this
      mechanistic study of duloxetine versus placebo, we will investigate the change in pain
      sensitivity with treatment in order to evaluate both why duloxetine is effective for
      management of pain for some patients, as well as predictors of who is likely to benefit from
      duloxetine. A total of 84 women with early stage breast cancer who have chronic pain
      following treatment, as well as 48 women who are pain free, will be enrolled. All subjects
      will undergo assessment of pain sensitivity and complete questionnaires. Subjects with pain
      will be treated with duloxetine for a total of 7 weeks, with pain sensitivity assessments
      before treatment and after 4 weeks of full-dose treatment.

      sensitivity with treatment in order to evaluate both why duloxetine is effective for
      management of pain for some patients, as well as predictors of who is likely to benefit from
      duloxetine. The original protocol planned enrollment of a total of 84 women with early stage
      breast cancer who have chronic pain following treatment, as well as 48 women who are pain
      free. However because of challenges with logistics of the protocol and pain testing, on which
      patients were enrolled first at the University of Michigan and then the University of Utah,
      only a total of 36 patients with pain and 46 controls were enrolled. All subjects will
      undergo assessment of pain sensitivity and complete questionnaires. Subjects with pain will
      be treated with duloxetine for a total of 7 weeks, with pain sensitivity assessments before
      treatment and after 4 weeks of full-dose treatment. The data from the control patients will
      be compared to those from the patients with pain to understand more about the differences
      between patients who do and do not experience treatment-related pain, and to interpret the
      post-intervention patient-reported and pain assessment results.
