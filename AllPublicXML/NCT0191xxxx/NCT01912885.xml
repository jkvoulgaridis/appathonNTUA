      INTRODUCTION: Overactive bladder syndrome is defined by The International Continence Society
      as urgency, with or without incontinence, usually with increased urinary frequency and
      nocturia. It is difficult to estimate the prevalence of this syndrome because many patients
      do not seek medical help, despite considerable negative impact on quality of life. Lower
      urinary tract dysfunctions can be treated using electrical stimulation of the posterior
      tibial nerve. This therapy is conservative, effective, inexpensive and promotes high adhesion
      to treatment. It has good results, decreasing symptoms of urgency, urge-incontinence, urinary
      frequency and nocturia . Due to lack of consensus on the parameters of this technique,
      further research is necessary. OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of protocols for the
      electrical stimulation of the posterior tibial nerve for treatment of non-neurogenic
      overactive bladder. METHODS: The study was a blind randomized clinical trial. The study will
      accept up to 145 women with overactive bladder diagnosis for at least six months prior to the
      beginning of the study. The subjects will be divided into five groups: group TENS 0-1
      (placebo group), group TENS 1-1 (electrical stimulation of one leg once a week), group TENS
      1-2 (electrical stimulation of one leg twice a week), group TENS 2-1 (electrical stimulation
      of two legs one a week) and group TENS 2-2 (electrical stimulation of two legs twice a week).
      Physical evaluation will be done at the beginning and at the end of the treatment. Evaluation
      will be done using the King &quot;s Health Questionnaire, the International Consultation
      Incontinence Questionnaire - Short Form, the Overactive Bladder Questionnaire, a three day
      urinary diary and a table for follow-up treatment.

      Participants will be recruited from Urogynecology Physical Therapy Outpatient Clinic of a
      university hospital and randomly assigned using website www.randomization.com and distributed
      into five groups considering the sites of application and frequency of attendanc, listed
      above.

      Data will be collected by the investigator using interview and physical examination and will
      be safely stored in computer.

      For this study, in terms of urinary frequency, the standard deviation was estimated at 3.25
      episodes of urinary urgency (SD=3.25). With 80% power and 95% confidence, the sample size
      calculation was 25 women in each group, plus a possible sample loss of around 20%, resulting
      in a sample size of 29 women per group, for a total of 145 patients in the study.

      The chi-square test was used to assess whether there was an association between sample
      description variables and treatments. The analysis of variance F-test was used to assess
      whether there were differences in the numerical descriptive variables between treatment
      groups. The nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare treatments in terms of the
      difference between before and after for each quality of life and voiding diary variables. If
      there was statistical significance, the Dunn multiple comparison test was performed, with
      p-values of less than 0.05 considered significant. The analysis of variance model with
      repeated measures was used to compare data from the specific voiding diary according to the
      treatment groups and sessions. Significant comparisons were evaluated with Tukey post-hoc
      test. To approximate data to the normality, a 1/log (variable+1) transformation was done. For
      the follow up analysis, it was used the ANOVA three ways, with Holm Sidak post-hoc test for
      comparison of scores. All the statistical tests developed were based on a significance of 5%,
      i.e., the null hypothesis was rejected when the p-value was less than 0.05.
