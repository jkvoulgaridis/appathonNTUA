      The purpose of the proposed project is to develop and test how well an internet-based
      behavioral pain self-management program, the Pain EASE program, can be used for treating low
      back pain in Veterans. Veterans' experiences with usability and satisfaction with the Pain
      EASE program will also be examined. Behavioral interventions such as exercise and cognitive
      behavior therapy are known to be effective for low back pain but are often not readily
      available or easily accessed. Veterans will be able to access the Pain EASE program via their
      computer with an internet connection, which will increase access to this type of treatment.
      Study participants will receive 10 weeks of access to the Pain EASE program, which will teach
      them pain coping skills to manage their low back pain. The primary outcome is pain-related
      functional interference.

      OBJECTIVES: The primary objectives of the proposed study are to: (1) develop an integrative,
      Internet-based, Veteran-centered behavioral intervention, the Pain EASE program for chronic
      low back pain (CLBP), and (2) examine preliminary efficacy, usability, and satisfaction of
      this intervention in a representative sample of Veterans with CLBP. The primary hypothesis
      states that a clinically meaningful reduction in pain-related functional interference will be
      observed following ten weeks of exposure to the Pain EASE program relative to baseline. The
      secondary hypotheses state that clinically meaningful reductions in ratings of average pain
      intensity on a 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain imaginable) numeric rating scale at the ten week
      post-baseline follow-up assessment interval will be observed, in addition to statistically
      significant reductions in fatigue, sleep problems, depressive symptoms, and negative mood at
      the ten week post-baseline assessment. The tertiary hypotheses state that participants will
      report high levels of interest, site usage, and satisfaction.

      RESEARCH DESIGN: A non-randomized pilot study with two phases is proposed to develop and
      evaluate an internet-based behavioral pain self-management program. Phase I will solely
      involve qualitative data collection. Repeated quantitative assessments during Phase II will
      be conducted at baseline and 10-weeks post-baseline.

      METHODOLOGY: A 24-month pilot study with two phases is proposed. During Phase I, the Pain
      EASE program will be developed and feedback from 15 Veterans with CLBP and an Expert Panel of
      pain management clinicians will be used to modify the program. During Phase II, a pilot
      feasibility trial of the Pain EASE program with 55 Veterans with CLBP will be conducted.
      Subjects will be a total of 70 patients receiving care at the VA Connecticut Healthcare
      System (VACHS) who report chronic low back pain. The primary criteria for inclusion are
      constant pain of at least three months duration with at least a moderate level of average
      pain (i.e., scores of 4 or greater on a 0 [no pain] to 10 [worst pain imaginable]) on a
      numerical rating scale of pain and indication of the &quot;preparation&quot;, &quot;action&quot;, or
      &quot;maintenance&quot; stage of readiness to change on a brief five item staging checklist. All
      patients must have access to a computer with an internet connection. Excluded will be
      patients with life threatening or acute physical illness, current alcohol or substance abuse
      or dependence, current psychosis, suicidal ideation, dementia, and individuals seeking
      surgical pain treatment. All participants will continue to receive their usual care from
      Veterans Health Administration (VHA) providers. During the 10-week therapeutic window, weekly
      telephone calls from research staff will serve to cue and monitor participants' use of the
      Internet program. At ten weeks post-baseline, participants will be formally reassessed.
      Primary and secondary hypotheses involving quantitative data will be analyzed using an
      intent-to-treat principle and will employ t-tests and non-parametric analogs and regression
      analyses.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Multidimensional Pain Inventory Interference Subscale</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 10 weeks post-baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Self-report measure of pain-related functional interference. The 9-item Interference subscale, scores ranging from 0-6, of the West Haven-Yale Multidimensional Pain Inventory (WHYMPI)-Interference scale assesses pain-related interference. Lower scores indicate less pain-related interference (i.e., better outcome). A reduction in WHYMPI-Interference Scale scores of 0.6 or greater has been identified as an indicator of meaningful improvement in physical functioning.
Outcome was calculated as a change from baseline score to 10-week post-baseline score (i.e., 10 weeks post-baseline value minus baseline value).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Numeric Rating Scale of Pain Intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 10 weeks post-baseline</time_frame>
    <description>self-report measure of pain intensity measured on a 0-10 likert scale. Participants are asked, &quot;Please rate your pain by indicating the number that best describes your average pain over the past week on a 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as bad as you can imagine) scale&quot;. Scores of 1-3 reflect mild pain, 4-6 moderate pain, and 7-10 severe pain. Lower scores reflect less pain, and therefore, better outcome.
Outcome was calculated as a change from baseline score to 10-week post-baseline score (i.e., 10 weeks post-baseline value minus baseline value).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Profile of Mood States</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 10 weeks post-baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Total mood symptoms score reported. The 65-item Profile of Mood States (POMS) is a multidimensional measure of emotional functioning designed to assess six dimensions of mood &quot;over the past week, including today&quot;. Each item is scored on a 0-5 Likert scale, where 0= &quot;not at all&quot; and 5= &quot;extremely&quot;. Total Mood Disturbance score ranges from 0 to 200. Higher scores reflect poorer functioning. Lower scores correspond to better outcomes.
Outcome was calculated as a change from baseline score to 10-week post-baseline score (i.e., 10 weeks post-baseline value minus baseline value).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 10 weeks post-baseline</time_frame>
    <description>General fatigue scale reported. Fatigue was assessed using the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI), which is a 20 item measure that can be scored to produce 5 dimensions: general fatigue, physical fatigue, mental fatigue, reduced motivation, and how subscale statements regarding fatigue represent their experiences. Score range from 4 to 20. Higher total scores correspond with more acute levels of fatigue. Lower scores correspond to better outcomes.
Outcome was calculated as a change from baseline score to 10-week post-baseline score (i.e., 10 weeks post-baseline value minus baseline value).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 10 weeks post-baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The MOS Sleep Scale is a 12 item measure that is segregated into subscales addressing seven sleep domains (i.e. sleep disturbance, snoring, awaken short of breath or with headache, adequacy of sleep, somnolence, a problems index 1 and a problems index 2). An additional single item assesses quantity of sleep. The sleep domains and problems index are scored on a 0 - 100 possible range, and higher scores indicate more of the concept being measured. Lower scores on sleep disturbance, for example, reflect less disturbed sleep, which is a better outcome.
Outcome was calculated as a change from baseline score to 10-week post-baseline score (i.e., 10 weeks post-baseline value minus baseline value).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Beck Depression Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 10 weeks post-baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Depressive symptom severity was assessed using the 21-item Beck Depression Inventory. Scores range from 0 - 63. Higher scores indicate more severe depression symptomatology. Lower scores correspond to better outcomes (i.e., less depressive symptom severity).
Outcome was calculated as a change from baseline score to 10-week post-baseline score (i.e., 10 weeks post-baseline value minus baseline value).</description>

        <title>Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory</title>
        <description>General fatigue scale reported. Fatigue was assessed using the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI), which is a 20 item measure that can be scored to produce 5 dimensions: general fatigue, physical fatigue, mental fatigue, reduced motivation, and how subscale statements regarding fatigue represent their experiences. Score range from 4 to 20. Higher total scores correspond with more acute levels of fatigue. Lower scores correspond to better outcomes.
Outcome was calculated as a change from baseline score to 10-week post-baseline score (i.e., 10 weeks post-baseline value minus baseline value).</description>

        <title>Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale</title>
        <description>The MOS Sleep Scale is a 12 item measure that is segregated into subscales addressing seven sleep domains (i.e. sleep disturbance, snoring, awaken short of breath or with headache, adequacy of sleep, somnolence, a problems index 1 and a problems index 2). An additional single item assesses quantity of sleep. The sleep domains and problems index are scored on a 0 - 100 possible range, and higher scores indicate more of the concept being measured. Lower scores on sleep disturbance, for example, reflect less disturbed sleep, which is a better outcome.
Outcome was calculated as a change from baseline score to 10-week post-baseline score (i.e., 10 weeks post-baseline value minus baseline value).</description>
