  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether Appethyl™, made from spinach, will reduce
      appetite and hunger given on the same day of testing.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Four hours after breakfast a small amount of liquid to drink will be given to a participant
      that will contain either the Appethyl™ or placebo. Participants will be given a lunch of
      about 750 calories and 40% fat prepared by the Metabolic Kitchen and be asked to eat all of
      it. Participants will have food choice testing performed 4 hours after starting their lunch
      meal. This will be done in two ways. Participants will be given a list of two foods that are
      made of carbohydrate like bread and pretzels and be asked which is most preferred.
      Participants will also be given a list of foods that differ in the amounts of fat,
      carbohydrate and protein that they contain and will be asked to mark the ones that appeal to
      them.

      Participants will be presented with a pizza in a quantity more than they could reasonably be
      expected to eat 5 hours after the start of their lunch meal and be asked to eat to their
      satisfaction over 30 minutes. Participants are not expected to eat all of the pizza.

You will be presented with a standard lunch and then (5 hours after lunch) pizza in a quantity of more than you could reasonably be expected to eat 5 hours after the start of your lunch meal and be asked to eat to your satisfaction over 30 minutes.

    <description>The Visual Analogue scale allows you to mark a vertical line across the horizontal scale on how hungry you are or not. The Visual Analogue scale was used to evaluate hunger, fullness, longing for food, prospective intake, satisfaction, desire for salty food, desire for savory food, thirst, and desire for sweet food. The scale ranged from 0 to 100mm; the higher values indicated greater outcomes.</description>

          <description>Appethyl™ liquid once four hours after breakfast.
Appethyl™: Four hours after breakfast participants will be given a small amount of liquid to drink that will contain Appethyl™. Participants will not know which they are getting and it will be decided randomly, like flipping a coin. Participants will be presented with a pizza in a quantity more than they could reasonably be expected to eat 5 hours after the start of their lunch meal and be asked to eat to their satisfaction over 30 minutes. Participants are not expected to eat all of the pizza.</description>
