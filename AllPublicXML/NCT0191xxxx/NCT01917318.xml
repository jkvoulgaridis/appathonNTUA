      A Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Random Order Crossover Pilot Study of Iloperidone for
      Symptoms of Arousal in PTSD.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During Period A, subjects will receive 8 weeks of iloperidone or placebo (2 weeks titration
      period followed by 6 weeks on stable dose). Then they will be reassessed for response during
      Period A; study drug will be discontinued and washed out over the following 2 weeks. They
      will then begin Period B on the alternate blinded treatment with similar titration and
      assessment, initially weekly and then every other week for a total of another 8 weeks. The
      purpose of the study is to determine whether Iloperidone is effective in the treatment of
      some symptoms in patients with PTSD, particularly difficulty falling or staying asleep,
      trauma dreams and daytime irritability or outbursts.

    <measure>Change in Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) Part B and D</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization and at the end of each treatment period. Placebo treatment lasted 8 weeks. Iloperidone treatment lasted 2 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) is a structured interview used to diagnose and assess PTSD. Part B of CAPS evaluates symptoms of re-experiencing. Part D evaluates avoidance and numbing.
CAPS-B scores range from 0 to 40 where higher scores indicate more symptoms. A score 0 means no re-experiencing symptoms.
CAPS-D scores range form 0 to 56 and higher scores indicate more symptoms. A score 0 means no avoidance or numbing symptoms.
The primary endpoint was changes in CAPS part B and D after 8 weeks of treatment.</description>

    <measure>Number of Awakenings</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization and after 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks of placebo treatment. Only 1 week of wrist actigraphy was recorded during iloperidone treatment .</time_frame>
    <description>Number of awakenings was measured by wrist actigraphy and sleep logs. Actigraphy results were downloaded at each study visit. The mean value during placebo treatment was calculated. There was only 1 value during iloperidone treatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Aggression</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization and 8 weeks of treatment, during both treatment periods</time_frame>
    <description>Aggression was measured by the Modified Overt Aggression Scale (MOAS).This assessment measures four types of aggressive behavior (verbal, aggression against property, autoaggression, and physical aggression) . Total scores on the MOAS range from 0-40, with a higher score indicating more aggressive behavior.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sleep Latency</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization and after 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks of placebo treatment. Only 1 week of wrist actigraphy was recorded during iloperidone treatment .</time_frame>

    <measure>Wake-time After Sleep Onset (WASO)</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization and after 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks of placebo treatment. Only 1 week of wrist actigraphy was recorded during iloperidone treatment .</time_frame>
    <description>WASO was measured by wrist actigraphy and sleep logs. Actigraphy results were downloaded at each study visit. The mean value during placebo treatment was calculated.There was only 1 value during iloperidone treatment.</description>

    <measure>Suicidal Ideation</measure>
    <time_frame>Total course of the study. CSSRS was administered during each study visit. Suicidal ideation during lifetime and during the month prior to screening were also explored</time_frame>
    <description>The presence of suicidal ideation was monitored over the course of the trial by the first section of the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS). This first section of the scale consists of 5 questions that can be answered yes or no. The number of participants who reported experiencing suicidal ideation is reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Intensity of Suicidal Ideation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Intensity of Suicidal Ideation was monitored over the course of the trial by the second section of the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS). This section is only administered if the patient answers yes to the first section. The section consists of 5 questions that refer to the most severe level of ideation endorsed in the first section of the CSSRS. The total score ranges from 2 to 25, with a higher number indicating more intense ideation and greater risk.
Only lifetime intensity of suicidal ideation was explored as the patient had no suicidal ideation from the month prior to beginning the study to the completion of the study</description>

    <description>The presence and severity os suicidal behavior was monitored over the course of the trial by the third section of the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS). This sections consists of questions about 5 suicidal behaviors and non‚Äêsuicidal self injurious behavior and it can be answered yes or no. The number of participants who experienced suicidal behavior is reported.</description>

        <description>The Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) is a structured interview used to diagnose and assess PTSD. Part B of CAPS evaluates symptoms of re-experiencing. Part D evaluates avoidance and numbing.
CAPS-B scores range from 0 to 40 where higher scores indicate more symptoms. A score 0 means no re-experiencing symptoms.
CAPS-D scores range form 0 to 56 and higher scores indicate more symptoms. A score 0 means no avoidance or numbing symptoms.
The primary endpoint was changes in CAPS part B and D after 8 weeks of treatment.</description>
