  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To find possible therapeutic targets to help prevent long-term brain and behavioural side
      effects in survivors of childhood leukemia that may have been caused by chemotherapy
      (Treatment-Related late Adverse Neuro-Cognitive Effects: TRANCE). The study hypothesis is
      that genetic variations of the elements in the folate-related cycles and methotrexate
      disposition networks are associated with the deficit phenotype (TRANCE) of childhood leukemia
      survivors.

      Hypothesis Genetic variants of the elements in the folate-related cycles and methotrexate
      disposition networks are associated with the TRANCE phenotype of childhood leukemia
      survivors.

      Objectives

        1. To identify TRANCE phenotypes of the childhood leukemia survivors.

        2. To characterize the folate and vitamin B12 levels of these children

        3. To identify DNA methylation patterns associated with TRANCE trait in the leukemia
           survivors

        4. To identify SNPs associated with the TRANCE trait in the leukemia survivors.

        5. To identify the &quot;deficit genotype&quot; associated only with the TRANCE leukemia survivors,
           but not with general population children who show developmental phenotypes similar to
           TRANCE: TRANCE-unique deficit variant

        6. To replicate the association between the TRANCE-unique deficit variants and the TRANCE
           trait in a population of childhood leukemia survivors.

        7. To evaluate the importance of rare genetic variants in the TRANCE trait in the leukemia
           survivors.

      Study design: A case-control study of leukemia survivors

      Analyses

        1. Leukemia survivors will be characterized by their status of neurocognitive function, and
           categorized into the Deficit case and the non-deficit Control case.

        2. They will be also characterized by the following attributes

             1. Pathway-based genetic variant status (folate and PK-related genes)

             2. Folate and vitamin B12 status

             3. Epigenetic markers

        3. Comparative analyses between neuro-cognitiive deficit phenotype (TRANCE) and Control on
           those parameters

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Folate, vitamin B12 and iron intake</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 6 months from the enrolment</time_frame>
    <description>Folate and other vitamin intakes vary among individuals. Folic acid fortification in Canadian food product has changed the Canadian population norm of folate status, virtually eliminating folate deficiency status. However, a large inter-individual variation still remains. We will use a Supplement Questionnaire to capture information on all and any supplements that participants may be currently taking.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Folate status</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 6 months from the enrolment</time_frame>
    <description>In order to complement the Supplement Questionnaire (above), we will measure the folate concentration in plasma and red blood cells.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Serum vitamin B12</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 6 months from the enrolment</time_frame>
    <description>Vitamin B12 and folate pathways interact to maintain biochemical homeostasis. To complement the intake assessment (above), we will measure serum vitamin B12.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Iron status</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 6 months from the enrolment</time_frame>
    <description>Iron status affects cognitive function of children. In addition to the intake assessment (above), we will estimate iron status by measuring hemoglobin and soluble transferrin receptor.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Epigenetics marker</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 3 months from the end of enrolment</time_frame>
    <description>DNA methylation signals represent one of the most stable epigenetic markers, which are known to be affected by environmental factors including drugs and nutrients such as folate. Environmental information conveyed through these factors is translated into gene expression changes mediated by DNA methylation. Although this may contribute to neuro-cognitive deficits of the leukemia survivors, there is no prior data in this regard. Therefore, the aim of this exploratory analysis is to determine if there is any indication that DNA methylation patterns are altered in the participants. DNA will be isolated from each of the blood, buccal swab, and saliva samples and modified using sodium bisulfite, which will then be used to determine DNA methylation patterns.</description>
