      This is a single arm, phase I study to assess the tolerability of abatacept when combined
      with cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil as graft versus host disease prophylaxis in
      children undergoing unrelated hematopoietic stem cell transplant for serious non-malignant
      diseases as well as to assess the immunological effects of abatacept. Participants will be
      followed for 2 years.

    <textblock>
      Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) represents the only viable cure for
      children who suffer from a wide variety of rare, serious non-malignant diseases, such as
      Fanconi Anemia, Hurler syndrome, and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. A major obstacle to
      the success of HSCT is morbidity and mortality from graft versus host disease (GVHD), driven
      by donor T cells recognizing and reacting against disparate host antigens. This trial is
      being conducted as a step toward testing the long-term hypothesis that the costimulation
      blockade agent abatacept can be added to a standard post-transplant GVHD prophylaxis regimen,
      cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil, to improve disease-free survival after unrelated
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) using reduced intensity conditioning for
      children with non-malignant diseases (NMD). This study will have the following Specific Aims:

      Specific Aim #1: To conduct a multicenter pilot assessing the tolerability of abatacept
      (n=10). Patients will receive four doses (10 mg/kg IV on days -1, +5, +14 and +28), a
      schedule well tolerated by adolescents and adults with hematologic malignancies in a previous
      pilot. Abatacept will be combined with cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil.

      Specific Aim #2: To examine the immunological effects of abatacept in this setting.

      Three reduced intensity conditioning regimens that have been shown to be effective in
      achieving sustained engraftment in patients with non-malignant diseases are available for
      use, depending on the patient's disease:

        -  Patients with Fanconi anemia will receive fludarabine, low dose cyclophosphamide, and
           anti-thymocyte globulin.

        -  Patients with severe aplastic anemia will receive low dose total body irradiation,
           fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and anti-thymocyte globulin.

        -  Patients with other NMD will receive either the low dose total body irradiation regimen
           or an alemtuzumab, fludarabine, thiotepa, and melphalan regimen.

    <measure>Tolerability of Abatacept</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year post-transplant</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint for this trial will be tolerability, defined in terms of the success in administering all prescribed doses of abatacept.
Abatacept will be deemed to be poorly tolerated if any of the following conditions are met:
More than one dose is withheld.
Death from an infection that occurs within 30 days of receiving the last prescribed dose of abatacept, but that is not preceded by systemic immunosuppressive therapy for GVHD
Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) that occurs within 100 days of receiving the last prescribed dose, but that is not preceded by systemic immunosuppressive therapy for GVHD.
If less than 4 patients (of at least 18 evaluable patients) tolerate abatacept poorly, abatacept will be deemed tolerable. If there are fewer than 18 evaluable patients, if 3 of the first 10 patients treated tolerate abatacept poorly, abatacept will be deemed tolerable.</description>
