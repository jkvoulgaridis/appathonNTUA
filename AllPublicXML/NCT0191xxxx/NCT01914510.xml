  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2 study to see how useful, safe, and tolerable an investigational drug called
      ENMD-2076 is in treating patients with ovarian clear cell carcinomas.

      ENMD-2076 is an oral drug that works by blocking certain enzymes called Aurora A and tyrosine
      kinase from working. These enzymes are needed for cells to divide including cancer cells.
      ENMD-2076 also works by stopping the growth of new blood vessels which would provide the
      tumor with nutrients for it to grow. It is believed that by blocking Aurora A and tyrosine
      kinase enzymes from working and stopping new blood vessels from growing, the tumors may stop
      growing or shrink.

      During the study, participants will be asked to take ENMD-2076 once a day, everyday. Every 28
      days will be called a cycle. While receiving the study drug, participants will be asked to
      visit the clinic for tests and procedures. During Cycle 1, participants will be asked to
      visit the clinic about once a week and during Cycle 2 and future cycles, participants will be
      asked to visit the clinic on days 1 and 15. As a part of the study, tumor tissue (archival
      and fresh tumor biopsy) will be taken for biomarker research. When participants stop the
      study drug, they will be asked to have an end of study drug visit.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have histologically documented diagnosis of ovarian clear cell carcinoma.

          -  Any number of prior chemotherapy regimens will be allowed but must include 1 line of
             platinum based therapy, and may include chemotherapy, biologics or other targeted
             therapies (except for Aurora A targeted therapies).

          -  Meet RECIST criteria (version 1.1) within 28 days of start of treatment by having
             measurable disease defined as one or more lesions that can be accurately measured in
             one or more dimensions. Areas of previous radiation may not serve as measurable
             disease unless there is evidence of progression post radiation.

          -  At time of registration, if the patient has had previous treatment it must have been
             at least 4 weeks since major surgery or radiation therapy; four weeks from any other
             previous anti-cancer therapy including biologics. Patients must have recovered from
             their treatment-related events with the exception of alopecia.

          -  Are ≥18 years of age

          -  Have clinically acceptable laboratory screening results within certain limits
             specified below:

          -  Women of child-producing potential must agree to use effective contraceptive methods
             prior to study entry, during study participation, and for at least 30 days after the
             last administration of study medication. A serum pregnancy test within 72 hours prior
             to the initiation of therapy will be required for women of childbearing potential.

          -  Have the ability to understand the requirements of the study, provide written informed
             consent, abide by the study restrictions, and agree to return for the required
             assessments.

        <description>Progression Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the time from first day of treatment to the first observation of disease progression or death due to any cause or last follow up. PFS will be censored for patients who are alive and free of progression at time of last follow-up.</description>
        <time_frame>Response will be determined based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria 1.1. Progression free survival is the time from the first day of treatment to the first observation of disease progression or Death/last F/U.</time_frame>

Dose reductions to 225mg and 150mg (200mg and 150mg for patients with body surface area under 1.65m2) are permitted, along with up to two weeks of therapy interruption for recovery from toxicity or intercurrent illness.</description>
