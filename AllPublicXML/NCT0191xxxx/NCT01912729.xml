  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The mission of this project is to develop novel systems of care that can provide efficacious,
      scalable, cost-effective, participant friendly behavioral intervention technologies (BITs)
      for the prevention of depression in adolescents. The investigators define BITs as
      interventions that use information and telecommunications technologies such as the internet,
      mobile or traditional phones, computers and/or other technologies to support and deliver
      psychological and behavioral interventions. Through usability testing, focus interviews, and
      field trials, investigators may modify the technologies and intervention based on immediate
      usage data.

    <measure>Program Logins Per Participant by Week.</measure>

    <description>Program usage data were examined by number of logins per participant by week. Participants in the study tended to access the program multiple times and explored the program tools.</description>

    <measure>USE (Usefulness, Satisfaction and Ease of Use) Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4 and Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>A modified version of the Usefulness, Satisfaction and Ease of use questionnaire (USE; Lund, 2001) was used, particularly regarding the participants' relationships with the peer network. The USE questionnaire is a 19 item measure of usability with 4 subscales: Usefulness, Ease of Learning, Ease of Use, and Satisfaction. The items are rated on 7 point Likert rating scales, with 1 = Strongly disagree to 7 = Strongly agree.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>SUS (System Usability Scale) Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4 and Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The SUS questionnaire is a 10 item measure that assesses usability, acceptability and satisfaction; each item has five response options for respondents, from 1 = Strongly disagree to 5 = Strongly agree. The participant's scores for each question are converted to a new number, added together and then multiplied by 2.5 to convert the original scores of 0-40 to 0-100. Specifically, for odd items: subtract one from the user response. For even-numbered items: subtract the user responses from 5. This scales all values from 0 to 4 (with four being the most positive response). Add up the converted responses for each user and multiply that total by 2.5. This converts the range of possible values from 0 to 100 instead of from 0 to 40. A SUS score above a 68 would be considered above average and anything below 68 is below average.</description>

        <description>A modified version of the Usefulness, Satisfaction and Ease of use questionnaire (USE; Lund, 2001) was used, particularly regarding the participants' relationships with the peer network. The USE questionnaire is a 19 item measure of usability with 4 subscales: Usefulness, Ease of Learning, Ease of Use, and Satisfaction. The items are rated on 7 point Likert rating scales, with 1 = Strongly disagree to 7 = Strongly agree.

        <title>SUS (System Usability Scale) Questionnaire</title>
        <description>The SUS questionnaire is a 10 item measure that assesses usability, acceptability and satisfaction; each item has five response options for respondents, from 1 = Strongly disagree to 5 = Strongly agree. The participant's scores for each question are converted to a new number, added together and then multiplied by 2.5 to convert the original scores of 0-40 to 0-100. Specifically, for odd items: subtract one from the user response. For even-numbered items: subtract the user responses from 5. This scales all values from 0 to 4 (with four being the most positive response). Add up the converted responses for each user and multiply that total by 2.5. This converts the range of possible values from 0 to 100 instead of from 0 to 40. A SUS score above a 68 would be considered above average and anything below 68 is below average.</description>
