    <textblock>
      Hsp90 inhibitor AUY922 and erlotinib hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor cells by
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. This phase I/II trial is studying the
      side effects and best dose of Hsp90 inhibitor AUY922 when given together with erlotinib
      hydrochloride and to see how well it works in treating patients with stage IIIB-IV non-small
      cell lung cancer.

      This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of Hsp90 inhibitor AUY922 followed by a phase II
      study. Patients receive Hsp90 inhibitor AUY922 IV over 1 hour once weekly and oral erlotinib
      hydrochloride once daily. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up
      periodically.

    <measure>Maximally Tolerated Dose (MTD) of AUY922 and Erlotinib Treatment Combination (Phase I)</measure>
    <time_frame>During the first 4 weeks of treatment for each patient.</time_frame>
    <description>To determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD), and recommended phase II dose of AUY922 when given in combination with erlotinib for patients with acquired resistance to erlotinib. (Phase I)
Escalation of dose will be in a 3+3 design. If no dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) are seen in 3 patients enrolled at that dose level, then dose will be escalated to the next dose level and the next 3 patients will be enrolled at that dose. Alternatively, if 1 DLT is seen in 3 patients at that dose level, 3 more patients will be added at that same dose level. If 1 DLT is seen in 6 patients at that dose level, MTD will be determined to be at that dose. If more than 1 DLT is seen at that dose level, then the prior lower dose level will be the considered the MTD.
DLT is defined as any of the following related to the investigational agent: Death and grade 3 and 4 specific hematological and non-hematological toxicities defined in the protocol.</description>

    <time_frame>At 8 weeks from treatment initiation</time_frame>
    <description>Overall response rate (ORR) will be measured per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions and assessed by CT scan or MRI:
Complete response (CR) defined as disappearance of all target lesions. Partial Response (PR), defined as &gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions.
Stable Disease (SD) defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for partial response nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.
Progressive Disease (PD) defined as having at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions</description>

    <description>To characterize the toxicity profile for the combination of erlotinib and AUY922.
Toxicity data will be collected every week for the first 28 day cycle and then every two weeks during treatment and up to 28 days after the last treatment.

        <title>Maximally Tolerated Dose (MTD) of AUY922 and Erlotinib Treatment Combination (Phase I)</title>
        <description>To determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD), and recommended phase II dose of AUY922 when given in combination with erlotinib for patients with acquired resistance to erlotinib. (Phase I)
Escalation of dose will be in a 3+3 design. If no dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) are seen in 3 patients enrolled at that dose level, then dose will be escalated to the next dose level and the next 3 patients will be enrolled at that dose. Alternatively, if 1 DLT is seen in 3 patients at that dose level, 3 more patients will be added at that same dose level. If 1 DLT is seen in 6 patients at that dose level, MTD will be determined to be at that dose. If more than 1 DLT is seen at that dose level, then the prior lower dose level will be the considered the MTD.
DLT is defined as any of the following related to the investigational agent: Death and grade 3 and 4 specific hematological and non-hematological toxicities defined in the protocol.</description>

In general adverse events (AEs) will be graded according to the following:
Grade 1 Mild AE Grade 2 Moderate AE Grade 3 Severe AE Grade 4 Life-threatening or disabling AE Grade 5 Death related to AE</description>
