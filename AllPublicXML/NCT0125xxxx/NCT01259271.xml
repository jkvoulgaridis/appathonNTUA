  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine if a new device, the SNS (Selective Nerve
      Stimulator), is effective in changing the way nerves work as pain killing drugs sometimes do.
      During this study, the study team will place 2 adhesive patches on the inside of one of the
      wrists of the non-dominant hand (if the subject is right-handed the electrodes will be placed
      on the subject's left wrist) of the study subject. These patches will be connected by wires
      (leads) to a small box with a headphone jack. This is designed to provide gentle electrical
      stimulation through the skin. This study will look at the amount of change from normal nerve
      function, the sensory effects (feeling, sensations in the body), and any changes the subject
      has when performing the 2 hour tests. The safety of the study device will also be evaluated.

      Single center, single blind, randomized, crossover design, sham controlled pilot study using
      Selective Nerve Stimulation (SNS) signal for nerve modulation with three amplitudes
      (supra-threshold,sub-threshold and sham)

      The primary objective of this proof of concept study is to:

      • Evaluate median nerve modulation with selective nerve stimulation amplitudes
      (supra-threshold, sub-threshold, and sham) by means of objective quantitative sensory tests
      (QST) and Sensory Nerve Conduction Threshold Tests (sNCTs) in healthy subjects.

      The secondary objectives to be evaluated in this study are to:

        -  Establish device safety profile

        -  Evaluate patient reported sensory descriptions and perception during modulation

    <description>The primary effectiveness endpoints are the modulation of median nerve perception or nerve physiology as measured by:
QST evaluated by method of levels for vibratory perception threshold (VS) in ABeta fibers and for cold sensation threshold (CS) in alpha gamma fibers and warm sensation threshold (WS) in c fibers.
sNCTs Current Perception Threshold (CPT) in ABeta, Alpha gamma and c fibers (CPT2k, CPT250, CPT5 respectively).</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Supra-threshold is defined as the nerve stimulation amplitude at which a subject can tolerate sensory responses (like tingling, tapping in the thumb, index or middle fingers) but will not cause pain or duress to the subject. The intervention (TAMS device), is stimulating through tyco extended wear electrodes that are placed directly on top of non dominant hand healthy median nerve fibers and they feel the paresthesia or tingling sensation.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Sub-threshold</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Sub-threshold is defined as the nerve stimulation amplitude just below the sensory perception of the subject. The intervention (TAMS device), is stimulating through tyco extended wear electrodes that are placed directly on top of non dominant hand healthy median nerve fibers. Subjects do not feel the paresthesia or tingling sensation despite there being a signal transmitted..</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Sham Control</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Sham Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>All subjects in the sham arm will go through the same process / experimental setup as in each of the active stimulation arms; however there will be no stimulation signal during the sham stimulation (output set and SNS box locked at 0 V). As this is the Sham control, there is no intervention but rather the intevention (TAMS device) setup (Tyco electrodes, wires and stimulator) are sent with the subject as if it were on (and just like Subthreshold arm the subjects cannot feel the stimulation). Audible alerts (to signify that the box is unplugged) will be disabled throughout the duration of the study. This sham arm will be used to assess the placebo effect caused by the stimulation and hence isolate the true effect of stimulation.</description>
