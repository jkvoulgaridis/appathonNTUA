  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mapatumumab is a fully human, agonist monoclonal antibody that activates the cell death
      pathway in tumor cells by specifically binding to TRAIL-R1 with high affinity. Sorafenib, a
      multikinase inhibitor, is the standard of care for treatment of patients with advanced
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The mechanisms of sorafenib and mapatumumab action suggest
      that these agents could interact synergistically. This is a Phase 2, multi-center,
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      mapatumumab in combination with sorafenib in subjects with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.

        <title>Time to Progression-Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) Assessment</title>
        <description>Time to progression is defined as the time from randomization to radiologic disease progression based on blinded independent review (BICR) of imaging scans using modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors assessment (mRECIST) for hepatocellular carcinoma. The primary analysis was performed using Kaplan Meier methods. The median time to progression is reported with one-sided 90% confidence interval. Analysis was performed on the modified Intent to Treat (mITT) Population which comprised of all randomized participants who received at least part of 1 dose of study agent (mapatumumab/placebo and/or sorafenib) with participants analyzed according to the groups to which they were randomized. NA indicates upper limit was not measurable as one-sided confidence interval is presented.</description>

A treatment-emergent AE is an AE that emerged during treatment, having been absent pre-treatment, or worsened relative to the pre-treatment state.

        <title>Number of Participants With Severe AEs</title>
        <description>An AE is any unfavorable or unintended sign, symptom, or disease that is temporally associated with the use of a study agent but is not necessarily caused by the study agent. Severity of AEs were graded using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE), Version 4.0. Grade 1 represents mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated. Grade 2 represents moderate; minimal, local or non-invasive intervention indicated. Grade 3 represents severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling. Grade 4 represents life -threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated. Grade 5 represents death related to AE. Severe AE is defined as AEs classified by investigator as severe (causing inability to carry out usual activities), life threatening or fatal using NCI-CTCAE Version 4.0 grading.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Worst Toxicity Grade-chemistry Parameters</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected for the evaluation of following chemistry parameters: alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), amylase, bilirubin, gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), calcium, potassium, magnesium, albumin, sodium and creatinine. Laboratory toxicities were graded based on the NCI-CTCAE version 4.0. Grade 1 represents mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated. Grade 2 represents moderate; minimal, local or non-invasive intervention indicated. Grade 3 represents severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling. Grade 4 represents life -threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated. Number of participants with worst toxicity grades for any abnormalities observed in any chemistry parameters during the study is presented.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Worst Toxicity Grade-hematology Parameters</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected for assessment of the following hematology parameters: activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), hemoglobin, international normalized ratio (INR), lymphocytes, neutrophils, platelets and white blood cells (WBC). Laboratory toxicities were graded based on the NCI-CTCAE version 4.0. Grade 1 represents mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated. Grade 2 represents moderate; minimal, local or non-invasive intervention indicated. Grade 3 represents severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling. Grade 4 represents life -threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated. Number of participants with worst toxicity grades for any abnormalities observed in any hematology parameters during the study is presented.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Anti-mapatumumab Antibodies</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected for the assessment of serum antibodies. The presence of anti-mapatumumab antibodies was assessed using a validated electrochemiluminescent immunoassay. The assay incorporated a tiered testing approach which used screening and confirmation steps. The anti-drug antibody (ADA) confirmed positive participants were separated into transient or persistent antibody positives. Persistent positive refers to positive immunogenic response at 2 or more assessments or at the final assessment. Transient positive refers to positive immunogenic response at only 1 assessment and negative at the final assessment.</description>

        <description>SBP and DBP were obtained on Day 1 of each cycle. Baseline is the last assessment prior to first dose. Change from Baseline is the value at indicated time point minus the value at Baseline. NA indicates standard deviation could not be calculated as only one participant was analyzed at the specified time point.</description>
