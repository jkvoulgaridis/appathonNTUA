  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will see if the study drug will be a good treatment for type 2 diabetes in
      children 10 to 17 years old.

      The groups will be low-dose and high-dose. The children will have a 2 in 5 chance of being
      assigned to the low-dose group. They will have a 3 in 5 chance of being assigned to the
      high-dose group.

      We believe the study drug will be safe, well tolerated, and improve blood sugar control.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Colesevelam oral suspension will be studied as treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)
      to evaluate clinical safety and efficacy in patients aged 10-17 years. The patients may have
      been treated with Metformin or have had no antidiabetic drug treatment in the previous three
      months.

      Study Hypothesis: Colesevelam oral suspension for pediatric subjects with T2DM is safe, well
      tolerated, and shows improved blood sugar control (as evidenced by a significant change from
      baseline in hemoglobin A1C [HbA1c]).
