      The purpose of this study is to determine whether lithium carbonate is safe, well-tolerated,
      and effective at treating progressive forms of multiple sclerosis.

    <textblock>
      In progressive multiple sclerosis (MS), patients experience worsening disability through a
      combination of inflammatory and neuro-degenerative processes. To test whether low-dose
      lithium carbonate ameliorates disability accumulation in progressive MS, patients with
      progressive MS were randomly assigned to take lithium in either the first or second year of a
      two-year trial. The trial was designed as a cross-over study to maximize exposure to lithium
      to for two reasons: 1) To increase the number of persons with MS exposed to lithium for
      purposes of assessing safety and tolerance; and 2) To increase the power to detect changes in
      the primary radiological outcome (change in brain volume) and also in secondary clinical
      outcomes (disability, mood, fatigue, cognition).

    <description>The Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) is an ordinal scale ranging from 0 to 10 used to assess disability in multiple sclerosis (MS). A score of 0 denotes no neurological impairments and no neurological exam abnormalities, while a score of 10 denotes death due to MS. The EDSS is derived from subscales called Functional System Scales at the lower range of the EDSS, and from ambulatory impairments and overall functional impairment at higher ranges of the scale. The Functional System scores (Vision, Brainstem, Pyramidal, Sensory, Cerebellar, Cognitive, Bladder and Bowel) are used to generate the EDSS based on pre-specified rules that determine the overall EDSS score.</description>

        <title>Change in Expanded Disability Status Scale Score</title>
        <description>The Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) is an ordinal scale ranging from 0 to 10 used to assess disability in multiple sclerosis (MS). A score of 0 denotes no neurological impairments and no neurological exam abnormalities, while a score of 10 denotes death due to MS. The EDSS is derived from subscales called Functional System Scales at the lower range of the EDSS, and from ambulatory impairments and overall functional impairment at higher ranges of the scale. The Functional System scores (Vision, Brainstem, Pyramidal, Sensory, Cerebellar, Cognitive, Bladder and Bowel) are used to generate the EDSS based on pre-specified rules that determine the overall EDSS score.</description>

      <desc>Serious and unexpected adverse events were collected for both lithium and observation years. However, since this was an open-label study, subjects were only asked about medication side effects during the lithium-treatment portion of the study.
