  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this Investigation is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Lyrica in
      medical practice. Also, occurrence of unknown and known adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in
      subjects treated with Lyrica will be monitored during the survey period, and whether an
      additional treatment outcome investigation and/or a post-marketing clinical study is required
      in the future will be determined.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All the patients whom an investigator prescribes the first Lyrica® should be registered
      consecutively until the number of subjects reaches target number in order to extract patients
      enrolled into the investigation at random.

    <description>An adverse drug reaction (ADR) was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to LYRICA Capsules in a participant who received LYRICA Capsules. A serious ADR was an ADR resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Relatedness to LYRICA Capsules was assessed by the physician.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Effectiveness Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>At Week 13</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical effectiveness of LYRICA Capsules was determined by the physician based on the following categories: (1) effective, (2) ineffective, or (3) impossible to judge at Week 13 of the treatment. Clinical effectiveness rate, which was defined as the percentage of participants who achieved clinical effectiveness over the total number of the analysis population, was presented along with the corresponding 2-sided 95% CI. For the participants who completed or discontinued the treatment before Week 13, the data at the time of the completion or discontinuation was used for the analysis.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and at Week 13</time_frame>
    <description>The pain experienced at Week 13 during the past 24 hours was rated by participants at the time of getting up in the morning on an 11-grade scale, ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (the most severe pain possible). Mean change from baseline in participant-rated pain score at Week 13 was presented along with standard deviation. For the participants who completed or discontinued the treatment before Week 13, the data at the time of the completion or discontinuation was used for the analysis.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Participant-rated Sleep Interference Score at Week 13</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at Week 13</time_frame>
    <description>The sleep interference (inability to sleep because of pain) experienced at Week 13 during the past 24 hours was rated by participants at the time of getting up in the morning on an 11-grade scale, ranging from 0 (no disturbance) to 10 (totally unable to sleep because of pain). Mean change from baseline in participant-rated sleep interference score at Week 13 was presented along with standard deviation. For the participants who completed or discontinued the treatment before Week 13, the data at the time of the completion or discontinuation was used for the analysis.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Participant-rated Sleep Interference Score at Week 13</title>
          <description>The sleep interference (inability to sleep because of pain) experienced at Week 13 during the past 24 hours was rated by participants at the time of getting up in the morning on an 11-grade scale, ranging from 0 (no disturbance) to 10 (totally unable to sleep because of pain). Mean change from baseline in participant-rated sleep interference score at Week 13 was presented along with standard deviation. For the participants who completed or discontinued the treatment before Week 13, the data at the time of the completion or discontinuation was used for the analysis.</description>
          <population>The analysis population for this outcome measure comprised of participants for whom the evaluation outcome of participant-rated sleep interference score was available and who satisfied the inclusion criteria among the baseline analysis population.</population>
