  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study will evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of crenezumab versus placebo in participants with prodromal to mild AD.
      Participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive either intravenous (IV) infusion of crenezumab
      or placebo every 4 weeks (Q4W) for 100 weeks. The final efficacy and safety assessment will
      be performed 52 weeks after the last crenezumab dose. Participants will then have the option
      to enter the Open Label Extension (OLE) study if eligible. Participants who do not enter the
      OLE study will have additional follow-up visits at 16 and 52 weeks after the last dose,
      primarily for safety and also for limited efficacy assessments.

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 105 in Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 105</time_frame>
    <description>The CDR-SB rates impairment in 6 categories (memory, orientation, judgement and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies and personal care) on a 5-point scale in which no impairment = 0, questionable impairment = 0.5 and mild, moderate and severe impairment = 1, 2 and 3 respectively. The score range is from 0 to 18 with a high score indicating a high disease severity. The difference in mean change from Baseline to Week 105 between Crenezumab and Placebo treated participants was estimated. Mixed model repeated measures (MMRMs) adjusting for disease severity, APOEe4 status, geographic region and the use or non-use of anti-dementia medications at baseline were used to estimate the mean change from baseline for this primary endpoint. Data after 29 January 2019 are censored for the primary and secondary efficacy analyses to avoid potential biases due to investigators, participants, raters, etc. being potentially influenced by early closure of the study due to lack of efficacy.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 105 on Cognition, as Assessed by Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognition (ADAS-Cog) (Subscale) 13 (ADAS-Cog-13)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 105</time_frame>
    <description>The ADAS-Cog-13 assesses multiple cognitive domains including memory, comprehension, praxis, orientation, and spontaneous speech. Most of these are assessed by tests although some are rated by the clinician on a 5-point scale. The ADAS-Cog-13 is the ADAS-Cog-11 with 2 further items: delayed word recall and total digit cancellation. The score range for ADAS-Cog-13 is from 0 to 85 with high scores representing severe dysfunction. The difference in mean change from Baseline to Week 105 between Crenezumab and Placebo treated participants was estimated. Mixed model repeated measures (MMRMs) adjusting for disease severity, APOEe4 status, geographic region, and the use or non-use of anti-dementia medications at baseline were used to estimate the mean change from baseline.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 105 on Severity of Dementia, Assessed Using the CDR-Global Score (CDR-GS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 105</time_frame>
    <description>The CDR-GS represents a semi-structured interview which rates impairment in 6 categories (memory, orientation, judgement and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care) on a 5-point scale in which CDR 0 = no dementia and CDR 0.5, 1, 2 or 3 = questionable, mild, moderate or severe dementia respectively. The range in scores for the CDR-GS is from 0 to 3 and a high score on the CDR-GS would indicate a high disease severity. The difference in mean change from Baseline to Week 105 between Crenezumab and Placebo treated participants was estimated. Mixed model repeated measures (MMRMs) adjusting for disease severity, APOEe4 status, geographic region, and the use or non-use of anti-dementia medications at baseline were used to estimate the mean change from baseline.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 105 on Severity of Dementia, Assessed Using the Mini Mental State Evaluation (MMSE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 105</time_frame>
    <description>The MMSE is a set of standardized questions used to evaluate possible cognitive impairment and help stage the severity level of this impairment. The questions target 6 areas: orientation, registration, attention, short-term recall, language and constructional praxis/visuospatial abilities. The scores on the MMSE range from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating better function. The difference in mean change from Baseline to Week 105 between Crenezumab and Placebo treated participants was estimated. Mixed model repeated measures (MMRMs) adjusting for disease severity, APOEe4 status, geographic region, and the use or non-use of anti-dementia medications at baseline were used to estimate the mean change from baseline.</description>

    <measure>Zarit Caregiver Interview for Alzheimer's Disease (ZCI-AD) Scale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 105</time_frame>
    <description>The ZCI-AD is a modified version of the Zarit Burden Interview, which was originally designed to reflect the stresses experienced by caregivers of people with dementia. This modified version includes slight modifications in item and title wording (e.g., removal of &quot;your relative&quot; to refer directly to the patient, removal of &quot;burden&quot; from title) and the use of 11-point numerical rating scales. The ZCI-AD scale consists of a total of 30 items. Total scores will be calculated with a total score range from 0 to 300 (higher scores indicate a higher burden on the caregiver). The difference in mean change from Baseline to Week 105 between Crenezumab and Placebo treated participants was estimated. Mixed model repeated measures (MMRMs) adjusting for disease severity, APOEe4 status, geographic region, and the use or non-use of anti-dementia medications at baseline were used to estimate the mean change from baseline.</description>

    <measure>EQ-5D Questionnaire Domain Score for Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 105</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D is a standardized measure of health status designed to provide a simple generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal. It is broadly applicable across a wide range of health conditions and treatment. The EQ-5D assesses five domains to provide a health state index. These are anxiety/depression, pain/discomfort, usual activities, mobility, and self-care. The scores on the EQ-5D ranges from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state). The difference in mean change from Baseline to Week 105 between Crenezumab and Placebo treated participants was estimated. Mixed model repeated measures (MMRMs) adjusting for disease severity, APOEe4 status, geographic region, and the use or non-use of anti-dementia medications at baseline were used to estimate the mean change from baseline.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Adverse Event (AEs) and Serious Adverse Event (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up until 16 weeks after the last dose of study drug (up to 117 weeks).</time_frame>
    <description>An Adverse Event is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Anti-Crenezumab Antibodies</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 105</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were considered positive or negative for ADA based on their baseline and post-baseline sample results. The number and percentage of participants with confirmed positive ADA levels were determined for Crenezumab and Placebo groups. The prevalence of ADA at baseline was calculated as the proportion of participants with confirmed positive ADA levels at baseline relative to the total number of participants with a sample available at baseline. The incidence of treatment-emergent ADAs was determined as the proportion of participants with confirmed post-baseline positive ADAs relative to the total number of participants that had at least one post-baseline sample available for ADA analysis.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 105 in Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) Score</title>
        <description>The CDR-SB rates impairment in 6 categories (memory, orientation, judgement and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies and personal care) on a 5-point scale in which no impairment = 0, questionable impairment = 0.5 and mild, moderate and severe impairment = 1, 2 and 3 respectively. The score range is from 0 to 18 with a high score indicating a high disease severity. The difference in mean change from Baseline to Week 105 between Crenezumab and Placebo treated participants was estimated. Mixed model repeated measures (MMRMs) adjusting for disease severity, APOEe4 status, geographic region and the use or non-use of anti-dementia medications at baseline were used to estimate the mean change from baseline for this primary endpoint. Data after 29 January 2019 are censored for the primary and secondary efficacy analyses to avoid potential biases due to investigators, participants, raters, etc. being potentially influenced by early closure of the study due to lack of efficacy.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 105 on Cognition, as Assessed by Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognition (ADAS-Cog) (Subscale) 13 (ADAS-Cog-13)</title>
        <description>The ADAS-Cog-13 assesses multiple cognitive domains including memory, comprehension, praxis, orientation, and spontaneous speech. Most of these are assessed by tests although some are rated by the clinician on a 5-point scale. The ADAS-Cog-13 is the ADAS-Cog-11 with 2 further items: delayed word recall and total digit cancellation. The score range for ADAS-Cog-13 is from 0 to 85 with high scores representing severe dysfunction. The difference in mean change from Baseline to Week 105 between Crenezumab and Placebo treated participants was estimated. Mixed model repeated measures (MMRMs) adjusting for disease severity, APOEe4 status, geographic region, and the use or non-use of anti-dementia medications at baseline were used to estimate the mean change from baseline.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 105 on Severity of Dementia, Assessed Using the Mini Mental State Evaluation (MMSE)</title>
        <description>The MMSE is a set of standardized questions used to evaluate possible cognitive impairment and help stage the severity level of this impairment. The questions target 6 areas: orientation, registration, attention, short-term recall, language and constructional praxis/visuospatial abilities. The scores on the MMSE range from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating better function. The difference in mean change from Baseline to Week 105 between Crenezumab and Placebo treated participants was estimated. Mixed model repeated measures (MMRMs) adjusting for disease severity, APOEe4 status, geographic region, and the use or non-use of anti-dementia medications at baseline were used to estimate the mean change from baseline.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 105 Assessed Using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q)</title>
        <description>The NPI-Q is an informant-based instrument that evaluates 12 neuropsychiatric disturbances common in dementia: delusions, hallucinations, agitation, dysphoria, anxiety, apathy, irritability, euphoria, disinhibition, aberrant motor behavior, night-time behavioral disturbances and appetite and eating abnormalities. The severity of each neuropsychiatric symptom is rated on a 3-point scale (mild, moderate and marked). The total severity score range is from 0 to 36 with higher scores representing higher severity. The difference in mean change from Baseline to Week 105 between Crenezumab and Placebo treated participants was estimated. Mixed model repeated measures (MMRMs) adjusting for disease severity, APOEe4 status, geographic region, and the use or non-use of anti-dementia medications at baseline were used to estimate the mean change from baseline.</description>

          <description>The NPI-Q is an informant-based instrument that evaluates 12 neuropsychiatric disturbances common in dementia: delusions, hallucinations, agitation, dysphoria, anxiety, apathy, irritability, euphoria, disinhibition, aberrant motor behavior, night-time behavioral disturbances and appetite and eating abnormalities. The severity of each neuropsychiatric symptom is rated on a 3-point scale (mild, moderate and marked). The total severity score range is from 0 to 36 with higher scores representing higher severity. The difference in mean change from Baseline to Week 105 between Crenezumab and Placebo treated participants was estimated. Mixed model repeated measures (MMRMs) adjusting for disease severity, APOEe4 status, geographic region, and the use or non-use of anti-dementia medications at baseline were used to estimate the mean change from baseline.</description>
          <population>The Modified Intent-To-Treat population (Placebo (n = 407); Cren (n = 402)) was defined as all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of study drug, with participants grouped according to the treatment assigned at randomization. Data presented below is only for participants that were included in the actual analysis.</population>

        <description>The QoL-AD (Quality of Life - Alzheimer's Disease) scale assesses QoL in participants who have dementia. The QoL-AD consists of 13 items covering aspects of participants' relationships with friends and family, physical condition, mood, concerns about finances and overall assessment of QoL. Items are rated on 4-point Likert-type scales ranging from 1 [poor] to 4 [excellent]. The score range is from 13 to 52, with higher scores indicating a better QoL. The difference in mean change from Baseline to Week 105 between Crenezumab and Placebo treated participants was estimated.

        <title>Zarit Caregiver Interview for Alzheimer's Disease (ZCI-AD) Scale Score</title>
        <description>The ZCI-AD is a modified version of the Zarit Burden Interview, which was originally designed to reflect the stresses experienced by caregivers of people with dementia. This modified version includes slight modifications in item and title wording (e.g., removal of &quot;your relative&quot; to refer directly to the patient, removal of &quot;burden&quot; from title) and the use of 11-point numerical rating scales. The ZCI-AD scale consists of a total of 30 items. Total scores will be calculated with a total score range from 0 to 300 (higher scores indicate a higher burden on the caregiver). The difference in mean change from Baseline to Week 105 between Crenezumab and Placebo treated participants was estimated. Mixed model repeated measures (MMRMs) adjusting for disease severity, APOEe4 status, geographic region, and the use or non-use of anti-dementia medications at baseline were used to estimate the mean change from baseline.</description>

        <title>EQ-5D Questionnaire Domain Score for Participants</title>
        <description>The EQ-5D is a standardized measure of health status designed to provide a simple generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal. It is broadly applicable across a wide range of health conditions and treatment. The EQ-5D assesses five domains to provide a health state index. These are anxiety/depression, pain/discomfort, usual activities, mobility, and self-care. The scores on the EQ-5D ranges from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state). The difference in mean change from Baseline to Week 105 between Crenezumab and Placebo treated participants was estimated. Mixed model repeated measures (MMRMs) adjusting for disease severity, APOEe4 status, geographic region, and the use or non-use of anti-dementia medications at baseline were used to estimate the mean change from baseline.</description>

        <description>An Adverse Event is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events.</description>

        <description>Participants were considered positive or negative for ADA based on their baseline and post-baseline sample results. The number and percentage of participants with confirmed positive ADA levels were determined for Crenezumab and Placebo groups.
