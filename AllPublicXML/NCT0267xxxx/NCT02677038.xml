  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well olaparib works in treating patients with stage IV
      pancreatic cancer. Olaparib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the
      enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the efficacy of olaparib monotherapy in stage IV pancreatic ductal
      adenocarcinoma (PDAC) with breast cancer, early onset (BRCA)ness.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To further determine the efficacy of olaparib in the study population.

      SAFETY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety and tolerability of olaparib.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To identify tissue based biomarkers of defective homologous recombination repair (HRD).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive olaparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 8
      weeks thereafter.
