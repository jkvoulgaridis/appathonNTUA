  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to compare the effectiveness and costs of a five-module
      Internet-based treatment program (including therapist support) for harmful alcohol use with
      the effectiveness and cost of the same treatment content delivered face-to-face in
      specialized addiction treatment. The hypotheses to be tested through this trial are that:

        1. The Internet-based treatment program (including therapist support) is as effective
           (reducing alcohol consumption) as the same treatment content delivered face-to-face in
           specialized addiction treatment.

        2. The Internet-based treatment program (including therapist support) is associated with
           lower cost per treated individual in relation to the achieved effects (in terms of
           reduced alcohol consumption) compared with the same treatment content delivered
           face-to-face in specialized addiction treatment.

      The design is a two-armed randomized controlled trial, and outcomes are measured in terms of
      changes in alcohol consumption, problematic alcohol use as well as alcohol dependence,
      depression, anxiety, quality of life and costs for the treatments. A minimum of 350
      participants will be recruited and randomized into two groups:

      Intervention group 1: All participants in this group will have access to the five-module
      Internet-based treatment program for harmful alcohol use and have access to a therapist with
      training in psychotherapy (CBT) who assists and counsels the participant throughout the
      program.

      Intervention group 2: All participants in this group will attend five face-to-face treatment
      sessions in specialized addiction treatment.
