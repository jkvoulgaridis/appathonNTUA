      This is a multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation, dose-exploration and dose-expansion study
      to evaluate the safety, tolerability, antitumor activity, PK, pharmacodynamics, and
      immunogenicity of Durvalumab (MEDI4736) in combination with monalizumab (IPH2201) in Adult
      Subjects with selected advanced solid tumors and the combination of durvalumab and
      monalizumab (IPH2201) standard of care systemic therapy with or without biological agent and
      monalizumab (IPH2201) with biological agent administered to subjects with recurrent or
      metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC).

      The study consists of 3 parts: dose escalation (Part 1), dose expansion (Part 2), and dose
      exploration (Part 3). Part 1 will evaluate dose escalation of durvalumab in combination with
      monalizumab in adult subjects with select advanced solid tumor malignancies. Part 2 will
      evaluate further the identified dose of durvalumab in combination with monalizumab from Part
      1 in adult subjects with select advanced solid tumor malignancies. Part 3 will evaluate dose
      exploration of durvalumab in combination with monalizumab and standard of care systemic
      therapy with or without biological agent, and monalizumab in combination with biological
      agent in adult subjects with CRC.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects must have histologic documentation of advanced recurrent or metastatic
             cancer.

          2. Subjects must be at the recurrent/metastatic setting, with selected advanced solid
             tumors.

          3. Subjects must have at least one lesion that is measurable by RECIST v1.1

          4. Part 3, Dose exploration, CRC subjects can be treatment naïve but should not have
             received more than two line of systemic therapy in the recurrent/metastatic setting.

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Prior treatment with immunotherapy agents. Prior treatment with antitumor vaccines may
             be permitted upon discussion with the medical monitor.

          2. Prior participation in clinical studies that include durvalumab alone or in
             combination, where the study has registrational intent and the analyses for the
             primary endpoint have not yet been completed

          3. Receipt of any conventional or investigational anticancer therapy within 4 weeks prior
             to the first dose of study treatment

          4. Any concurrent chemotherapy, immunotherapy, biologic or hormonal therapy for cancer
             treatment. Concurrent use of hormones for non-cancer-related conditions is acceptable.
