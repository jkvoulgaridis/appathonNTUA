      Phase I Safety and Tolerability Study in Subjects with Pancreatic Cancer or Other CA19-9
      Positive Malignancies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Open label, multi-center, nonrandomized, dose escalation/expansion trial of MVT-5873 as a
      single agent in subjects with pancreatic and other CA19-9 positive malignancies. The trial
      will define a Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of MVT-5873
      for a Q2 week schedule (Group D) and an MTD and RP2D of MVT-5873 for a Q4 week schedule
      (Group C). Both groups will utilize a conventional 3+3 study design to identify the MTD and
      RP2D. Following completion of the dose escalation phase, an expansion phase of up to 30
      additional subjects will be administered MVT-5873 at the RP2D for each group. The
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of MVT-5873 will be determined in each Group.
