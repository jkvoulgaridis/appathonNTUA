    <description>An adverse drug reaction (ADR) was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to VFEND in a participant who received VFEND. A serious ADR was an ADR resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Relatedness to VFEND was assessed by the physician.</description>

    <time_frame>Maximum 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>IFI rate, which was defined as the percentage of participants who developed invasive fungal infections over the total number of assessable effectiveness analysis population, was presented along with the corresponding 2-sided 95% CI. Presence or absence of invasive fungal infections was judged as &quot;without onset,&quot; &quot;with onset,&quot; or &quot;indeterminate&quot; by the physician. In case of &quot;with onset,&quot; it was classified as proven diagnosis, probable diagnosis, or possible case according to the diagnostic criteria of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group (EORTC/MSG). Participants judged as proven diagnosis or probable diagnosis were counted as those who developed invasive fungal infections for the calculation of IFI rate.</description>

Presence or absence of invasive fungal infections was judged as &quot;without onset,&quot; &quot;with onset,&quot; or &quot;indeterminate&quot; by the physician, and participants judged as &quot;without onset&quot; were counted as those with successful prophylaxis of invasive fungal infections for the calculation of success rate. Participants with successful prophylaxis of invasive fungal infections were counted by age (&lt;15 years, ≥15 years) to assess whether it contributes to the clinical effectiveness.</description>
          <population>The efficacy analysis set (EAS) comprised of participants in the safety analysis set for whom the presence/absence of invasive fungal infections has been evaluated, excluding those with no information on effectiveness or non-target disease. The EAS was 199 participants. Those assessed as &quot;indeterminate (n=1)&quot; was excluded from the calculation.</population>
