             The period of exclusion is 3 months after the final dose from a previous study.

             Note: Subjects consented and screened, but not randomized in this study or a previous

        <title>Area Under Concentration-time Curve From Time Zero Extrapolated to Infinity (AUC) for Part A and Part B</title>
        <description>To assess the pharmacokinetic parameter AUC of AZD5634 following single-dose inhalation administration of AZD5634 in Part A and following single-dose IV or inhalation administration of AZD5634 in Part B. AUC was estimated by AUC(0-last) + Clast/λz where Clast was the last observed quantifiable concentration. AUCs were calculated using the linear trapezoidal method when concentrations are increasing and the logarithmic trapezoidal method when concentrations are decreasing. AUC0-t is expanded as area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to time of last quantifiable concentration. Note:Due to the participant and/or data exclusion described above, there are no PK data available for the 10 μg dose cohort and very limited data for the 27 μg dose cohort. Therefore, these 2 cohorts were not included in PK results interpretation and summary statistics.</description>
        <time_frame>At predose, at 5, 15 and 30 min and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 36 and 48 h postdose (Days 1 to 3)</time_frame>
        <population>The PK analysis set for Part A consisted of participants in the safety analysis set who received AZD5634 and for Part B consisted of participants who completed both treatment periods and for whom at least one of the PK parameters Cmax, AUC0-t or AUC were calculated, with no major protocol deviations thought to impact on the analysis of the PK data.</population>
