    <textblock>
      I. Main outcome Decrease of the stress evaluated 6 months after training. Stress is defined
      as the presence of job strain as defined by Karasek.

      II. Main secondary outcomes

        -  ICU nurses stress at one year

        -  Burnout

        -  Intent-to-leave the ICU

        -  Quality of life

      III. Design

      Prospective, randomized, open study comparing 2 groups of ICU nurses:

      Simulation group and Control group

      Nurses from 9 different adult ICUs will be included. Stratification by ICU will be done (to
      take into account differences between the ICUs regarding organization, activity, patients…).

      This study is observational because nurses can participate to this training when they want.
      The fact that nurses are in control group delays their participation to this training but
      does not forbid them to particpate. The nurses from control group will participate to
      training at the end of study.

      IV. Specific measures Control group: none

      Simulation group: 5-day specific training with dedicated scenario done by an ICU expert
      simulation team

      V. Study duration 48 months

      VI. Ethical aspects - Reglementary concerns

        -  Study accepted by the Comité Consultatif sur le Traitement de l'Information en matière
           de Recherche dans le domaine de la Santé (CCTIRS) and by the Commission Nationale de
           l'Informatique et des Libertés (CNIL)

        -  Information to the participants prior inclusion

      VII. Study population Job strain evaluated in a French study was 59% . The same rate was
      observed in a survey done in our institution (Assistance Publique Hôpitaux de Marseille). We
      therefore hypothesized that the intervention (simulation) should be able to reduce the job
      strain from 59% to 45% of the participants. With a power of 80% and a risk a of 5%, this
      study needs to include 185 patients per arm. To take into account few participants who will
      not complete the study, we aimed to include a total of 400 ICU nurses.

      VIII Results An interim analysis will be performed after 200 inclusions
