  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate patients who have melanoma that has spread from the eye to the
      liver: Patients in the study will be treated with Melphalan/HDS up to 6 total treatment, and
      will be followed until death. This study will evaluate the safety and effects of the
      treatment on how long patients live and how long it takes for the cancer to advance or
      respond to the treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of 3 phases: a screening phase, treatment phase, and follow-up phase.

      Screening Phase: Screening assessments will be conducted within 28 days prior to the
      eligibility date to determine each patient's overall eligibility and baseline
      characteristics. These assessments will include medical history, physical examination,
      Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS), 12 lead electrocardiogram
      (ECG), echocardiogram (ECHO), vital signs, full hematology and biochemistry, Quality of Life
      questionnaire, radiologic assessments of baseline disease status and concomitant medications.

      For patients with a history of liver surgery or major vasculature surgery, an angiogram
      evaluation of their vasculature will be performed for compatibility for Percutaneous Hepatic
      Perfusion (PHP) prior to confirming eligibility.

      Eligibility date: This is the date on which all screening assessments have been completed and
      the patient is determined to be eligible for the trial.

      Treatment Phase: Eligible patients will be treated with Melphalan/HDS 3.0 mg/kg Ideal Body
      Weight (IBW) and must begin treatment within 14 days being eligible. Melphalan/HDS treatment,
      patients will receive up to 6 treatments. Each treatment cycle consists of 6 weeks with an
      acceptable delay for another 2 weeks before the next planned treatment to allow for recovery
      of melphalan-related toxicity, if needed. Tumor response will be assessed every 12 weeks (+ 2
      weeks) until disease progression. If the patient receives only 1 treatment, the disease
      assessment scans will be conducted 12 weeks after the date of the first treatment. The
      assessment scans will be reviewed by an Independent Review Committee (IRC), also referred to
      as Independent Central Review. At any time when progressive disease (PD) is observed, the
      patient will be removed from further study treatment and followed until death. Melphalan/HDS
      treatment will also be discontinued in the event that recovery from treatment related
      toxicity requires more than 8 weeks from last treatment. An end-of-treatment visit will be
      conducted approximately 6 to 8 weeks following the final study treatment. Ongoing treatment
      related adverse events (AEs) at the end-of-treatment visit will be followed until the
      severity is within one of the following parameters (1) Symptoms are resolved or return to
      baseline; (2) CTCAE Grade &lt; 1 or can be explained; (3) patient death. The maximum possible
      duration of the study treatment for any patient will be 12 months.

      NOTE: Active Melphalan/HDS patients (currently in treatment) on PHP-OCM-301 will continue
      treatment on PHP-OCM-301A following the re-consenting process.

      NOTE: Patients on PHP-OCM-301 that have completed treatment and are entering or are already
      in the follow-up phase will be followed-up for survival and disease progression (as
      applicable) on PHP-OCM-301A following the re-consenting process.

      Follow-up Phase: Once the patient has completed the end-of-treatment (EOT) visit in
      accordance with the schedule of events they will enter the follow-up phase. If the disease
      has not progressed at the EOT (Section 6.2), the patient will need to continue with disease
      assessment visits every 12 weeks (+ 2 weeks) until disease progression is documented. If the
      disease has progressed before or at the EOT their follow-up is to be by phone every 3 months
      for survival status until death.

      Patients will be monitored, following the completion of study treatment, for the development
      of myelodysplasia and secondary leukemia.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female patients ≥ 18 years of age.

          2. Patients must weigh ≥ 35 kg (due to possible size limitations with respect to
             percutaneous catheterization of the femoral artery and vein using the Delcath Hepatic
             Delivery System).

          3. 50% or less histologically or cytologically-proven ocular melanoma metastases in the
             parenchyma of the liver.

          4. Disease in the liver must be measurable by computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic
             resonance imaging (MRI).

          5. Evidence of limited extrahepatic disease on preoperative radiological studies is
             acceptable if the life threatening component of disease is in the liver. Limited
             extrahepatic disease is defined in this protocol as follows: metastasis in bone,
             subcutaneous, lung or lymph nodes that is amenable to resection or radiation and has a
             defined treatment plan. Patients with extra-hepatic tumor burden which does not have a
             defined treatment plan (i.e. monitor or is unable to be resected or radiated) must not
             be included in the trial.

          6. Scans used to determine eligibility (CT scan of the chest/abdomen/pelvis and MRI of
             the liver) must be performed within 28 days prior to randomization. An MRI of the
             liver is required at screening to validate that CT accurately reflects the extent of
             disease in the liver. For patients with MRI intolerance, a 3-phase liver CT is to be
             done in place of liver MRI.

          7. Patients must not have chemotherapy, radiotherapy, chemoembolization,
             radioembolization, or immunoembolization for their malignancy within 30 days prior to
             treatment and must have recovered from all side effects of therapeutic and diagnostic
             interventions except those listed in Appendix B of the study protocol.

          8. Patients receiving anti programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) immunotherapy such as
             pembrolizumab or nivolumab, or human cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 blocking
             antibody such as ipilimumab should wait 8 weeks before Melphalan/HDS treatment.

          9. Patients must have an ECOG PS of 0-1 at screening and on the day prior to treatment.

         10. Patients must have adequate hepatic function as evidenced by total serum bilirubin ≤
             1.5 x the upper limit of normal (ULN) and a prothrombin time (PT) within 2 seconds of
             the upper normal limit. Aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase (AST/ALT)
             must be ≤ 2.5 x ULN.

         11. Patients must have a platelet count &gt; 100,000/µL, hemoglobin ≥ 10.0 gm/dL, white blood
             cell count (WBC) &gt; 2,000/uL, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 109/L, and a
             serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL unless the measured creatinine clearance is &gt; 40
             mL/min/1.73 m2.

         12. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum pregnancy test
             (β-human chorionic gonadotropin) within 7 days prior to randomization.

         13. Provided signed informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with Child-Pugh Class B or C cirrhosis or with evidence of portal
             hypertension by history, endoscopy, or radiologic studies.

             significant arrhythmias and severe valvular disease must be evaluated for risks of
             undergoing general anesthesia.

          3. History or evidence of clinically significant pulmonary disease that precludes the use
             of general anesthesia.

          4. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) i.e. fertile meaning not permanently

         10. Patients with severe allergic reaction to iodine contrast, which cannot be controlled
             by premedication with antihistamines and steroids (because a hepatic angiogram is
             needed for the Delcath system procedure).
