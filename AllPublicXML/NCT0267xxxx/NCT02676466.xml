      ENRGISE Pilot Study will test the ability of anti-inflammatory interventions for preventing
      major mobility disability by improving or preserving walking ability.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Growing evidence shows that low-grade chronic inflammation, characterized by elevations in
      plasma C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and particularly Interleukin-6
      (IL-6), is an independent risk factor of disability, impaired mobility, and lower walking
      speed. Low-grade chronic inflammation is a modifiable risk factor. However, it is unknown
      whether interventions that reduce the levels of inflammatory markers per se improve mobility,
      or avert decline in mobility in older persons.

      To address this gap in evidence the investigators are conducting the randomized clinical
      trial ENRGISE (ENabling Reduction of low-Grade Inflammation in SEniors) Pilot Study to test
      the ability of anti-inflammatory interventions for preventing major mobility disability by
      improving or preserving walking ability. We have maximized the public health impact by
      selecting interventions that are safe, tolerable, acceptable, and affordable for vulnerable
      older persons. Specifically, in this trial the investigators test the efficacy verus placebo
      of the angiotensin receptor blocker losartan and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in the
      form of fish oil, alone and in combination. Both angiotensin receptor blockers and omega-3
      polyunsaturated fatty acids have shown to reduce IL-6 in clinical trials and preliminary data
      suggest that they may improve physical function.

      Recruitment will include the older persons who are at risk for, or with, mobility impairment,
      as measured by slow gait speed and self-reported mobility difficulty, and who have elevated
      levels of IL-6, the marker most consistently associated with mobility limitations.
      Preliminary data regarding feasibility need to be gathered before such a trial can be
      effectively designed and implemented. We conduct The ENRGISE Pilot Study to assess the
      effects of the interventions on several inflammatory markers, walking speed, physical
      function and strength. This allows us to refine the design, recruitment yields, target
      population, adherence, retention, tolerability, sample-size, and cost for the main ENRGISE
      trial.

    <measure>Number of Participants Experiencing Major Mobility Disability</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The 400 meter walk test at usual pace is used to evaluate major mobility disability (MMD), defined as the inability to walk ¼ mile or 400 meters.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>A low score on the SPPB based on 4 m walk, balance &amp; chair stands tests is a risk factor for disability, institutionalization, morbidity and mortality in initially non-disabled older persons. The summary score and components of the SPPB have good reliability (ICCs range from 0.88 to 0.92). Higher scores are better. Range 0-12.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Exhibiting Frailty</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Frailty will be characterized with Fried criteria developed by Fried et al. that employ self-reported exhaustion, unintentional weight loss, low energy expenditure, slow gait speed, and weak grip strength. Those with &gt;3 of the 5 factors are judged to be frail, those with 1 or 2 factors as pre-frail, and those with no factors as non-frail.</description>

    <measure>Isometric Hand Grip Strength</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The purpose of this test is to measure the maximum isometric strength of the hand and forearm muscles. Scoring will be taken from the best results of 3 trials. Males scores range from 88 pounds as very poor to 141 pounds as excellent with an average of 105-113 pounds. Females scores range from 44 pounds as very poor to 84 pounds as excellent with an average of 57-65 pounds.</description>

    <description>Peak torque was measured at a rotational speed of 60 degrees per second using a commercially-available Isokinetic Dynamometer (Biodex). Torque was measured during maximal knee extension and flexion reported in Newton Meters.</description>

    <measure>Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) - Physical Component Score</measure>
    <time_frame>month 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Short Form (36) Health Survey is a 36-item, patient-reported survey of patient health. The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Range: 0-100. A lower score indicates more disability, i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.</description>

          <title>Fish Oil Active</title>
          <description>This group will receive the Omega-3 fish oil which will be administered at a dose of 1.4 grams per day for the first six months. Based on tolerability and inflammation level, dose may either continue at 1.4 grams per day or be increased to 2.8 grams per day for the remaining six month.
Omega-3 fish oil: The Omega-3 fish oil will be provided in 700 mg gelcaps. The starting dose will be 1.4 g/day of fish oil and continue until the 6 month visit. If the average of IL-6 measured at 3- and 6-month visits does not decrease by &gt;40% vs. baseline (average of screening visits 1 and 2), we increase the dose to 2.8 g/day.</description>

Based on continued tolerability and inflammation level, dose may either continue at 25 or 50 milligrams per day or be increased to 100 milligrams per day for the remaining six months.
Losartan: The Losartan will be provided in 25 mg and 50 mg capsules. The starting dose will be 25 mg/day, if tolerated, then stepped up to 50 mg/day. If there are no safety concerns, a continuation of 50 mg/day will be provided until the 6 month visit.

          <description>Frailty will be characterized with Fried criteria developed by Fried et al. that employ self-reported exhaustion, unintentional weight loss, low energy expenditure, slow gait speed, and weak grip strength. Those with &gt;3 of the 5 factors are judged to be frail, those with 1 or 2 factors as pre-frail, and those with no factors as non-frail.</description>

        <description>The Short Form (36) Health Survey is a 36-item, patient-reported survey of patient health. The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Range: 0-100. A lower score indicates more disability, i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.</description>

          <description>The Short Form (36) Health Survey is a 36-item, patient-reported survey of patient health. The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Range: 0-100. A lower score indicates more disability, i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.</description>
