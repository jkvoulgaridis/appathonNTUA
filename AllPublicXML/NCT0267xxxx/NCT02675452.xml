  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At least one dose level of AMG 176 will achieve acceptable safety and tolerability in
      subjects with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma and subjects with relapsed or
      refractory acute myeloid leukemia

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, first-in-human, multicenter; non-randomized, open-label and
      dose-exploration study of AMG 176 administered IV in subjects with relapsed or refractory
      multiple myeloma and subjects with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia The study

In general, Amgen does not grant external requests for individual patient data for the purpose of re-evaluating safety and efficacy issues already addressed in the product labelling. Requests are reviewed by a committee of internal advisors, and if not approved, may be further arbitrated by a Data Sharing Independent Review Panel. Upon approval, information necessary to address the research question will be provided under the terms of a data sharing agreement.
