  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized control trial will determine the effect of short term high intensity interval
      training (HIIT) on physical fitness, in an elderly patient group with active cancer, prior to
      surgical resection.

      Half of the recruited patients will act as a control group and the other half will undergo a
      HIIT protocol.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      High intensity interval training (HIIT) has been shown to achieve similar and in some studies
      better improvements in aerobic fitness versus more traditional endurance based exercise over
      the same time period. HIIT has also been shown to produce these improvements over a shorter
      timescale than other methods, in the region of 2-6 weeks. One widely reported barrier to
      exercise is time availability, HIIT training may be a favorable option to increase fitness as
      the total time spent exercising is significantly less than other methods. HIIT induces
      improvements in cardiovascular parameters in healthy elderly subjects, investigators aim to
      investigate whether these improvements can be matched in patients with cancer and further
      elucidate the mechanisms behind improvements seen with this type of training.
