      This phase II/III trial studies gallium 68 Ga (68Ga)-prostate-specific membrane antigen
      (PSMA) positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI) in finding tumors in
      patients with prostate cancer undergoing surgery that tend to spread quickly
      (intermediate-risk) or is likely to come back or spread (high-risk). Diagnostic procedures,
      such as PET/MRI, may help find and diagnose prostate cancer and find out how far the disease
      has spread. Radioactive drugs, such as gallium Ga 68-PSMA, binds to tumor cells that have
      specific receptors, and may allow doctors to see smaller tumors than the standard of care
      contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) or MRI scan.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

        1. To evaluate 68Ga PSMA 11 PET/MRI for detection of regional nodal and distant metastases
           in patients with intermediate and high risk prostate cancer scheduled to undergo
           prostatectomy with lymph node dissection.

        2. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value of 68Ga PSMA 11 PET/MRI
           for the detection of regional nodal metastases compared to pathology at radical
           prostatectomy on a per patient basis using nodal regional correlation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      1. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value of 68Ga PSMA 11 PET/MRI
      for the detection of extra pelvic nodal metastases; visceral metastases; and osseous
      metastases compared to biopsy and imaging follow up.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive 68Ga-PSMA intravenously (IV). Patients then undergo PET/MRI after 45 minutes
      of administration of radiopharmaceutical injection.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 24-48 hours.

    <description>68Ga PSMA-11 PET/MRI will be used to detect regional nodal and distant metastases in patients with intermediate and high risk prostate cancer scheduled to undergo prostatectomy with lymph node dissection. The data will be analyzed by imaging interpretation and pathological analysis. Each patient will be interpreted as positive or negative for the presence of pelvic nodal disease The results will be expressed as range (mean ± SD) of number of lymph nodes identified by PET.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>All patients that undergo prostatectomy will be evaluated for the presence of nodal metastasis based on histopathology. This will be reported on a per patient basis as positive or negative. This will be expressed as range (mean ± SD) of number of lymph nodes identified by dissection during surgery plus histopathology</description>

    <description>Sites of suspected metastatic disease will be graded on a three-point scale (0=negative, 1=equivocal, 2=positive), with statistical analysis performed with equivocal score of 1 graded as positive or negative on two separate analysis, for a more sensitive or specific visual read, respectively. Point estimates and 95% confidence intervals will be calculated.</description>
