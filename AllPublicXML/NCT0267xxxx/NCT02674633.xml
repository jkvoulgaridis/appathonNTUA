      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of videogame-like digital therapies on
      attentional functioning and symptoms in children diagnosed with ADHD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a randomized, parallel group, controlled trial of two videogame-like
      (iPad-based) digital therapies. The study will consist of 3 primary phases: Screening,
      Washout/Baseline, and Treatment. During the Screening Phase (Day -28 to Day -7), participants
      will undergo screening to evaluate eligibility for the study. Screening may take place up to
      28 days before the Baseline Visit (Day 0). For those children currently on medication for
      ADHD the Washout period will begin 7 days prior to Baseline where treatment will be
      discontinued. On Day 0, the Baseline visit will occur wherein additional eligibility criteria
      will be established. The Treatment Phase (Day 1 to Day 27) will involve using the digital
      therapy at home for each participant followed by an In-Clinic assessment on Day 28 to assess
      key outcomes. Compliance with treatment/use requirements will be monitored remotely during
      this phase.

    <measure>Test of Variables of Attention-Attention Performance Index (Change From Baseline to Posttreatment)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 to Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>TOVA API is a comparison of the subject's scores based on selected measures that persons with an independent diagnosis of ADHD frequently demonstrated. The API is calculated from variability, response time, and d' (D Prime) using the following formula:
API = Response Time Z score (Half 1) + d' Z score (Half 2) + Variability Z score (Total) + 1.80 where Response Time is the average time it takes to respond correctly to a target, d' score is a response discriminability score reflecting the ratio of hits to &quot;false alarms&quot;, and Variability is a measure of consistency of speed of responding based on the standard deviation of the mean correct response times. API tells how similar the score is to the ADHD profile. A score of less than 0 indicates that the subject had similar performance to a normative ADHD population. A lower score indicates a more severe ADHD profile.
The calculation for difference in TOVA API was API at Day 28 minus API at Day 0 of this study.</description>

    <measure>ADHD-RS Total (Change From Baseline to Posttreatment)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 to Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>The ADHD-RS-IV is an 18-item, clinician-administered questionnaire for which a parent respondent rates the frequency of occurrence of ADHD symptoms and behaviors as defined by criteria outlined for ADHD in the DSM-IV. Each item is scored on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (rarely or never) to 3 (very often) with total scores ranging from 0-54. A higher score indicates more severe ADHD symptoms and behaviors. A negative change in total score indicates improvement from Day 0 to Day 28.</description>

    <measure>ADHD-RS Inattentive Subscale (Change From Baseline to Posttreatment)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 to Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>The ADHD-RS-IV is an 18-item, clinician-administered questionnaire for which a parent respondent rates the frequency of occurrence of ADHD symptoms and behaviors as defined by criteria outlined for ADHD in the DSM-IV. Each item is scored on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (rarely or never) to 3 (very often) with total scores ranging from 0-54. A higher score indicates more severe ADHD symptoms and behaviors.
The 18 items are grouped into 2 subscales: hyperactivity/impulsivity (even numbered items 2-18) and inattentiveness (odd numbered items 1-17). Each subscale produces a sub-scale score ranging from 0-27. A higher subscale score indicates more severe ADHD symptoms and behaviors.
A negative change indicated improvement on the subscale from Day 0 to Day 28.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Impairment Rating Scale, Overall Impairment (Change From Baseline to Posttreatment)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 to Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>The Impairment Rating Scale (IRS) is a parent-rated scale that assesses individualized areas of impairment for a child participant and asks parents to make a rating of how significantly these problems impact functioning across a range of domains (social, family, school, self-esteem). Parents describe the primary areas of difficulty for each child and then provide a rating (via a Visual Analog Scale) of how much the difficulties affect the different areas of functioning ranging from (1) &quot;no problem; definitely does not need treatment or special services&quot; to (7) &quot;extreme problem; definitely needs treatment or special services.&quot;
The total IRS is 8 items, the 8th rating overall impairment. A negative change indicated a decrease in overall impairment.</description>

    <measure>CGI-I (at Posttreatment)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Global Impression Scale - Improvement (CGI-I) is a clinician's comparison of the participant's overall clinical condition at follow up to the overall clinical condition at baseline. The CGI-S is a 7-point scale where 1 = Very much improved, 2=Much improved, 3=Minimally improved, 4=No change, 5=Minimally worse, 6=Much worse, and 7=Very much worse.
A score of 1, 2, or 3 would indicate overall improvement of ADHD severity.</description>

        <title>Test of Variables of Attention-Attention Performance Index (Change From Baseline to Posttreatment)</title>
        <description>TOVA API is a comparison of the subject's scores based on selected measures that persons with an independent diagnosis of ADHD frequently demonstrated. The API is calculated from variability, response time, and d' (D Prime) using the following formula:
API = Response Time Z score (Half 1) + d' Z score (Half 2) + Variability Z score (Total) + 1.80 where Response Time is the average time it takes to respond correctly to a target, d' score is a response discriminability score reflecting the ratio of hits to &quot;false alarms&quot;, and Variability is a measure of consistency of speed of responding based on the standard deviation of the mean correct response times. API tells how similar the score is to the ADHD profile. A score of less than 0 indicates that the subject had similar performance to a normative ADHD population. A lower score indicates a more severe ADHD profile.
The calculation for difference in TOVA API was API at Day 28 minus API at Day 0 of this study.</description>

Each item is scored on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (rarely or never) to 3 (very often) with total scores ranging from 0-54. A higher score indicates more severe ADHD symptoms and behaviors.
The 18 items are grouped into 2 subscales: hyperactivity/impulsivity (even numbered items 2-18) and inattentiveness (odd numbered items 1-17). Each subscale produces a sub-scale score ranging from 0-27. A higher subscale score indicates more severe ADHD symptoms and behaviors.
A negative change indicated improvement on the subscale from Day 0 to Day 28.</description>

The 18 items are grouped into 2 subscales: hyperactivity/impulsivity (even numbered items 2-18) and inattentiveness (odd numbered items 1-17). Each subscale produces a sub-scale score ranging from 0-27. A higher subscale score indicates more severe ADHD symptoms and behaviors.
A negative change indicated improvement on the subscale from Day 0 to Day 28.</description>

        <title>Impairment Rating Scale, Overall Impairment (Change From Baseline to Posttreatment)</title>
        <description>The Impairment Rating Scale (IRS) is a parent-rated scale that assesses individualized areas of impairment for a child participant and asks parents to make a rating of how significantly these problems impact functioning across a range of domains (social, family, school, self-esteem). Parents describe the primary areas of difficulty for each child and then provide a rating (via a Visual Analog Scale) of how much the difficulties affect the different areas of functioning ranging from (1) &quot;no problem; definitely does not need treatment or special services&quot; to (7) &quot;extreme problem; definitely needs treatment or special services.&quot;
The total IRS is 8 items, the 8th rating overall impairment. A negative change indicated a decrease in overall impairment.</description>
