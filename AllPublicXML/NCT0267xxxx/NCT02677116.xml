  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of different doses of olaratumab and
      to determine which dose should be used for future pediatric studies. The present study is
      open to children with advanced cancer or cancer that has spread to another part of the body.
      The study has three parts. In the first two parts, a specific dose of olaratumab will be
      given in 21 day cycles, followed by one of three standard chemotherapy regimens. In the third
      part, a specific dose of olaratumab will be given with one of three standard chemotherapy
      regimens in 21 day cycles. Participants will only enroll in one part.

    <description>A dose limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as an adverse event (AE) during the first 21 days that was possibly related to the study drug and fulfilled any of the following criteria using the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.0: CTCAE Grade 3 nonhematologic toxicity, grade 4 neutropenia that lasted longer than 2 weeks, grade ≥3 thrombocytopenia complicated by hemorrhage, and any hematologic toxicity that caused a cycle delay of &gt;14 days.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to objective progression or start of new anti-cancer therapy (Up to 7 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Objective Response Rate (ORR) is the percentage of participants achieving a confirmed best overall tumor response of CR or PR. According to RECIST v1.1, PR defined as a &gt;30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters (LD) of the target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of the LD; CR was defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions.</description>

    <measure>Progression Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to radiological disease progression or death from any cause (Up to 2 Years)</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from baseline to the first date of radiological disease progression or death due to any cause. Progressive disease (PD) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (including the baseline sum if that is the smallest). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 millimeters (mm). The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression. If participant started new treatment before PD, the participant was censored at the date of last tumor assessment prior to new therapy. If treatment was discontinued for reasons other than PD and no further assessment, censoring occurred at last tumor assessment.</description>

According to RECIST v1.1, PR defined as a &gt;30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters (LD) of the target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of the LD; CR was defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions.</description>

        <title>Progression Free Survival (PFS)</title>
        <description>Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from baseline to the first date of radiological disease progression or death due to any cause. Progressive disease (PD) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (including the baseline sum if that is the smallest). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 millimeters (mm). The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression. If participant started new treatment before PD, the participant was censored at the date of last tumor assessment prior to new therapy. If treatment was discontinued for reasons other than PD and no further assessment, censoring occurred at last tumor assessment.</description>
