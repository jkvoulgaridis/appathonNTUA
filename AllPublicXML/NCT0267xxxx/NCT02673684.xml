  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the ability of Neuro-Stim System, a
      non-pharmacologic alternative for pain management, to reduce pain and treat insomnia.
      Neuro-Stim System uses electrical current to stimulate neurovascular bundles (nerves) in the
      ear and possibly the autonomic nervous system.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pain is a complex problem that complicates recovery and rehabilitation after traumatic injury
      and surgery. The physician must balance pain management therapies against the potential for
      side effects and complications. Most of the treatment options for pain are pharmacological
      and have the potential for serious side effects and drug interactions. A non-pharmacological
      treatment would reduce the risk of adverse events and likely enhance the overall multimodal
      pain plan. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of Neuro-Stim System
      (NSS), a non-pharmacological option that uses electrical current to stimulate neurovascular
      bundles (nerves) in the ear and possibly the autonomic nervous system, to treat pain and
      improve sleep. Pain patients will be asked to participate in a study to evaluate the ability
      of Neuro-Stim System to reduce pain and to treat insomnia. NSS is a Federal Drug
      Administration (FDA) approved device intended to be used for chronic and acute pain.

    <description>The primary outcome is pain measured by the Defense and Veterans Pain Rating Scale (DVPRS) from 0-10 at baseline, 15 minutes, and daily for 5 days after application.
Rate the severity of your CURRENT pain:
0 - No Pain
- Hardly notice pain
- Notice pain, does not interfere with activities
- Sometimes distracts me
- Distracts me, can do usual activities
- Interrupts some activities
- Hard to ignore, avoid usual activities
- Focus of attention, prevents doing daily activities
- Awful, hard to do anything
- Can't bear pain, unable to do anything
- As bad as it could be, nothing else matters
Higher values represent worse outcomes</description>

Rate the severity of your CURRENT pain:
0 - No Pain

- Notice pain, does not interfere with activities
- Sometimes distracts me
- Distracts me, can do usual activities
- Interrupts some activities
- Hard to ignore, avoid usual activities
