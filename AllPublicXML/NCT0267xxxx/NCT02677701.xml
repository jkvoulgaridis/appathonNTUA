      This is a study to examine the effect of combining chronic oral azithromycin with inhaled
      tobramycin in adolescent and adult subjects with cystic fibrosis who are chronically infected
      with P. aeruginosa.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of
      azithromycin 500mg taken orally thrice weekly vs. placebo in subjects with cystic fibrosis
      and chronic airway infection with P. aeruginosa who are utilizing chronic inhaled tobramycin
      therapy. It will include approximately 120 subjects able to complete a primary 6-week study
      phase. Subjects will be at least 12 years old with a baseline forced expiratory volume at one
      second (FEV1) between 25-100% predicted. Subjects will continue to use clinically prescribed
      inhaled tobramycin cycled on/off every 4 weeks. They will be provided over-encapsulated
      azithromycin 500mg tablets or placebo during the primary study phase. An optional extension
      phase will be offered to all subjects completing the primary 6-week study. This 8-week
      extension phase will include an initial 4 weeks without use of inhaled tobramycin or other
      inhaled antibiotics, followed by a 4-week period with inhaled tobramycin use. All subjects
      participating in the extension phase of the study will be provided azithromycin 500mg tablets
      to be taken thrice weekly for the entire 8-week period.

      This study will investigate how use of chronic oral azithromycin affects some of the
      previously demonstrated benefits to health when using inhaled tobramycin. The primary
      measurements will focus on lung function. Additional measurements will focus on
      disease-related quality of life as reported by subjects in the trial. Exploratory outcomes,
      including measurements of safety, are also planned.
