    <textblock>
      Frailty is a recognized cause for disability, hospitalization, and mortality in nursing home
      residents. Testosterone treatment is among the potentially beneficial treatments in addition
      to resistance exercise for improving muscle strength and mass in frail adults. The
      investigators have demonstrated that cycled administration of testosterone improves muscle
      mass and strength in healthy adults. It is proposed that cycled testosterone administration
      may be an effective adjuvant therapy for frail older men and women during rehabilitation
      programs. The hypothesis is that testosterone treatment in addition to standard-of-care (SOC)
      rehabilitation will result in improved muscle mass and physical function when compared to
      patients receiving SOC only. Therefore, in a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled
      study, the investigators will test the effects of cycled testosterone administration (2 week
      on treatment, 2 weeks off treatment) on body composition and physical function in male and
      female nursing home residents undergoing rehabilitative care. Primary outcomes will be
      assessed before and after 10 weeks of treatment using bioelectric impedance, handgrip
      dynamometers, short physical performance battery (SPPB), and quality of life (QOL)
      questionnaires. Data from this pilot project will become the foundation for the development
      of a larger long-term project solicitation to the NIH aimed at elucidating the efficacy of
      testosterone treatment on physical function and independence in frail older adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Frailty with aging is a serious debilitating condition that can further contribute to a
      downward spiraling of health and physical function. Many long term nursing home patients
      enter into rehabilitative care programs with the intent to increase strength and physical
      independence. However, many patients have lasting functional limitations despite
      rehabilitation programs intended to improve their physical function and sarcopenia and
      frailty is common among nursing home residents. Aging in general, and frailty in particular,
      has been associated with decreases in sex hormones, and testosterone treatment has known
      anabolic effects to muscle of hypogonadal as well has eugonadal males. Effective adjuvant
      treatments that can be safely employed in conjunction with existing therapies such as
      rehabilitative care intended to improve function can have profound benefits to the long-term
      outcome of male and female patients.

      The investigators have demonstrated that administration of testosterone (100 mg/wk) starts
      showing improvements in lean body mass (LBM) as early as 4 weeks and muscle strength by 8
      weeks in healthy older community dwelling males (Sheffield-Moore et al., 2011). In this
      study, both continuous weekly treatment as well as intermittent treatment (4 weeks on
      testosterone, 4 weeks off testosterone, etc) resulted in similar benefits after 20 weeks. In
      addition, the investigators recently completed a 10-week study where the investigators showed
      both the safety and efficacy of cycled testosterone treatment (100 mg/wk for 2 weeks,
      alternated by 2 weeks of no treatment) in combination with regular exercise in healthy
      eugonadal adult men confined to continuous bed rest (see preliminary data). In that study,
      testosterone robustly increased LBM in as little as 2 weeks of bed rest and improvements in
      LBM were associated with better protection of physical function upon reambulation.

      It is proposed that a cycled testosterone paradigm may be a safe and effective adjuvant
      therapy for frail older nursing home patients undergoing physical rehabilitation. The
      investigators hypothesize that testosterone treatment in addition to standard-of-care (SOC)
      physical therapy or rehabilitation will result in improved muscle mass and physical function
      when compared to patients receiving SOC only. The long term goal is to develop effective
      treatments against the functional declines in muscle mass and strength that contribute to the
      development and progression of frailty. Therefore, the investigators will test the specific
      aims outlined below in older male and female residents engaging in rehabilitation care at
      health care centers in Texas City and Galveston. Men and women (age 60-up) will be recruited
      as they enroll into rehabilitative care programs, screened upon informed consent, and if
      eligible, block-randomized (double-blinded) to receive either testosterone enanthate (100
      mg/wk for males and 25 mg/wk for females) or placebo (saline) treatment for 10 weeks. The
      treatment will follow a 2-week cycle (2 weeks on-treatment, 2 weeks off, etc). Primary
      outcomes will be assessed using non-invasive methods at baseline and at completion of the
      study after 10 weeks. These outcomes will include body composition as determined with
      bioelectric impedance analysis (BIA), muscle strength and fatigue by handgrip dynamometry,
      physical function by a short physical performance battery (SPPB), and quality of life (QOL)
      by a short battery of questionnaires. Blood samples will be collected at screening for safety
      and will be repeated at completion of the study for secondary outcome measures (hormones,
      lipid profiles and blood chemistries).

      Specific Aim 1. Determine the effects of cycled testosterone treatment on body composition in
      male and female nursing home residents undergoing rehabilitative care.

      Specific Aim 2. Determine the effects of cycled testosterone treatment on physical function
      in male and female nursing home residents undergoing rehabilitative care.

      Data from this pilot/feasibility project will become the foundation for the development of a
      larger long-term project solicitation to the NIH aimed at elucidating the efficacy of
      testosterone treatment on physical function and independence in frail older adults.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or Female

          2. Ages: 60 years or older

          3. Starting rehabilitative care

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Inability to perform the functional tests specific to the study protocol

          2. Diagnosed with carcinomas of the breast or with known or suspected carcinomas of the
             prostate.

          3. Uncontrolled endocrine or metabolic disease (e.g. liver disease, renal disease,
             diabetes).

          4. Uncontrolled hypertension. Systolic blood pressure =/&gt; 160mm Hg or a diastolic blood
             pressure =/&gt; 100mm Hg on three consecutive measurements taken at one-week intervals.
             Testosterone, other anabolic steroids and glucocorticoids can cause fluid retention
             that could worsen uncontrolled hypertension. Subjects will be included if they are on
             two or less blood pressure medications and have a blood pressure below these criteria.

          5. History of significant liver disorders or a 3-fold elevation of liver function tests
             (Alk phos, ALT, AST). Testosterone can have hepatotoxic effects in some subjects and
             should be used with careful monitoring of LFTs (liver function), though injections of
             testosterone at a 100 mg dose is not typically sufficient to negatively affect LFTs.

          6. History of angina that occurs with exertion or at rest or a myocardial infarction
             within the last 12 months.

          7. LDL cholesterol greater than 200 mg/dL as testosterone administration may elevate LDL
             cholesterol levels further, though this is not anticipated with testosterone
             injections of 100 mg/wk.

          8. Hematocrit greater than 51%.

          9. Established chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or untreated sleep apnea.

         10. Implanted artificial pacemaker/defibrillator. BIA uses small currents and is not
             recommended for participants with a pacemaker.

         11. Diagnosed systemic fungal infections.

         12. Positive screening for HIV or active hepatitis*.

         13. Use of or history of recent anabolic steroid use (within 3 months).

         14. Alcohol or drug abuse.

         15. Any other condition or event considered exclusionary by the PI and covering faculty
             physician.

         16. Vulnerable populations including: individuals unable to consent on their own behalf,
             prisoners and pregnant women.

               -  Subjects excluded due to positive screening results, including HIV, HBV or HCV,
                  will be immediately scheduled for counseling and follow-up testing as needed, and
                  will be advised to consult their primary physician.
