  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This feasibility study is for the purpose of determining if the G-Tech Device can
      differentiate between normal return of GI activity post-operatively and the myoelectric
      activity in patients who develop a POI.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While preventing the development of a POI is most important, POIs still occur; therefore, it
      is important to definitively diagnose a POI as early as possible during the post-operative
      course for treatment to prevent patient discomfort, complications, and extended hospital
      stay. The purpose of the G-Tech study is to determine if the G-Tech Device can detect a
      difference in the myoelectric signals from patients who develop a POI compared to those
      patients who do not develop a POI. It is anticipated that up to 20% of patients enrolled in
      this study and consented preoperatively, excluding screen failures, will show evidence of a
      post-operative ileus as detected by the G-Tech GutCheck Device and differentiate the
      myoelectric signals from the patients who do not develop a POI. Patients who are known to
      have developed a POI may also be selected for the study.
