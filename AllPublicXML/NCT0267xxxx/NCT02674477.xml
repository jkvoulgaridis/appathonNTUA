  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to study whether using an Internet-based program, called the
      Therapeutic Education System (TES), would be helpful for the treatment of substance use and
      other psychiatric problems.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TES has been shown to be helpful as substance abuse treatment in certain groups of people,
      mainly in the outpatient setting by using interactive modules for education. This study will
      expose some participants to this program while participants are hospitalized on an inpatient
      unit, and give the participants access to it after participants are discharged from the
      hospital. Those participants will still receive treatment as usual, as will the control
      group.

    <description>The acceptability assessment asks about hospital satisfaction for both groups. The questionnaire is a series of questions on Qualtrics on a scale of 0-10. Higher scores signified a more positive response and a better outcome.</description>

Therapeutic Education System (TES): The TES program is made of modules about ways to prevent substance use, such as how to refuse drugs and alcohol, how to cope with thoughts about using, and how to make the best possible decisions for a person's mental health. Each module takes less than 30 minutes to complete. Modules may contain videos or other interactive media. At the end of each module, there are questions about the material.</description>
