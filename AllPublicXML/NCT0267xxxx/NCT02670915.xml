    <time_frame>Week 0, Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline (week 0) in standard deviation (SD) score of body weight was evaluated after 26 weeks of randomisation. SD-scores are defined to be able to normalise the body weight in the various age groups. To estimate the growth of children, standardised weight is calculated for each year of age and for each sex. Thus, a child with a weight equal to the mean value for its age and sex has an SD score of 0, while a child with a weight 2 SDs above the mean value for its age and sex has an SD score of +2. The SD scores are derived from the age and sex of the subjects and the body weight together with growth curves defined for a reference population. The results are based on the last on-treatment value. Number of participants analysed = number of participants contributed to the analysis.</description>

      <recruitment_details>The trial was conducted at 150 sites in 17 countries(number of sites with screened/randomised subjects)-Bulgaria: 4/4; Czech Republic: 6/6; Estonia: 2/2; Finland: 3/3; Germany: 6/6; India: 7/7; Israel: 6/6; Italy: 5/5; Japan: 34/34; Latvia: 1/1; Lithuania: 1/1; Poland: 4/4; Russia: 11/11; Serbia: 4/4; Turkey: 7/7; Ukraine: 9/9; United States: 40/39</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>12-week run-in period: Participants were switched from previous insulin treatment to insulin degludec once daily, and mealtime NovoRapid®/NovoLog®. Insulin degludec treatment was optimised on a weekly basis to the pre-breakfast glycaemic target of 4.0−8.0 mmol/L. Out of 834 participants, who started the run-in period, 57 were run-in failures.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Faster Aspart (Meal)</title>
          <description>Bolus insulin: Participants received subcutaneous (s.c., into the abdominal wall) injections of faster-acting insulin aspart at mealtime (0−2 minutes before the meal) during the 26-week treatment period. Throughout the trial, the insulin was administered at each of the three main meals (i.e. breakfast, lunch and main evening meal). The insulin was titrated to the pre-meal target of 4.0−8.0 mmol/L, and the bed-time target of 6.7–10 mmol/L in a treat-to-target fashion. Basal insulin: Participants continued insulin degludec once daily s.c. injections from the dose optimization process during the 12-week run-in period till 26-week treatment period. Dose adjustment during the treatment period at the discretion of the investigator was allowed if needed.</description>

        <description>Change from baseline (week 0) in mean post prandial glucose (PPG) over all three meals was evaluated after 26 weeks of randomisation. PPG for each meal (breakfast, lunch and main evening meal) was recorded by the participant as part of the 8-point self-measured plasma glucose (SMPG) profile. Mean PPG over all three meals was derived as the mean of all corresponding mean meal. The results are based on the last in-trial value.</description>

          <description>Change from baseline (week 0) in mean post prandial glucose (PPG) over all three meals was evaluated after 26 weeks of randomisation. PPG for each meal (breakfast, lunch and main evening meal) was recorded by the participant as part of the 8-point self-measured plasma glucose (SMPG) profile. Mean PPG over all three meals was derived as the mean of all corresponding mean meal. The results are based on the last in-trial value.</description>

          <title>Change in 8-point SMPG Profile: Mean of the 8-point Profile</title>
          <description>Change from baseline (week 0) in mean of the 8-point SMPG profile was evaluated after 26 weeks of randomisation. SMPG values were recorded at 8 time-points on two consecutive days: before and after (60 minute after the start of the meal) breakfast, lunch and main evening meal, before bedtime, and before breakfast on the next day. Mean of the 8-point profile was derived as the mean of all corresponding mean SMPG recorded at 8 different time points. The results are based on the last in-trial value.</description>

The insulin was titrated to the pre-meal target of 4.0−8.0 mmol/L, and the bed-time target of 6.7–10 mmol/L in a treat-to-target fashion. Basal insulin: Participants continued insulin degludec once daily s.c. injections from the dose optimization process during the 12-week run-in period till 26-week treatment period. Dose adjustment during the treatment period at the discretion of the investigator was allowed if needed.</description>

          <description>Change from baseline (week 0) in mean time to the IG peak after meal based on CGM was evaluated after 26 weeks of randomisation. A subgroup of subjects wore a CGM for between 11 and 13 days up to week 0 (randomisation) and up to week 26 to monitor their IG on a continuous basis. Presented values are mean of all the meals (breakfast, lunch and evening meal). The results are based on the last in-trial value.</description>

        <title>Change in 1-hour PPG</title>
        <description>Change from baseline (week 0) in 1-hour PPG based on meal test was evaluated after 26 weeks of randomisation. In connection to wearing the CGM for 11 to 13 days up to week 0 and up to week 26, the subgroup of participants had a standardised liquid meal test at the 2 visits, monitoring the PPG at 1-hour after the meal intake at the visit. The results are based on the last in-trial value.</description>

Throughout the trial, the insulin was administered at each of the three main meals (i.e. breakfast, lunch and main evening meal). The insulin was titrated to the pre-meal target of 4.0−8.0 mmol/L, and the bed-time target of 6.7–10 mmol/L in a treat-to-target fashion. Basal insulin: Participants continued insulin degludec once daily s.c. injections from the dose optimization process during the 12-week run-in period till 26-week treatment period.

        <title>Change in 2-hour PPG Increment</title>
        <description>Change from baseline (week 0) in 2-hour PPG increment based on meal test was evaluated after 26 weeks of randomisation. In connection to wearing the CGM for 11 to 13 days up to week 0 and up to week 26, the subgroup of participants had a standardised liquid meal test at the 2 visits, monitoring the pre-prandial glucose (before the meal) the PPG at 2-hour (after the meal) at the visit. PPG increment was derived as 2-hour PPG measurement minus the pre-prandial PG. The results are based on the last in-trial value.</description>

        <description>Change in area under the IG curve 0-1 hour post meal (AUCIG,0-1h) during meal test and based on CGM measurements was evaluated after 26 weeks of randomisation. IG was measured every 5 minutes. The endpoint was calculated as the area under the IG curve using the trapezoidal method and weighted by duration. A subgroup of participants wore a CGM for between 11 and 13 days up to week 0 (randomisation) and up to week 26 to monitor their IG on a continuous basis. The results are based on the last in-trial value.</description>

Classification of hypoglycaemia: 1) Severe (according to ISPAD classification). Following are according to ADA classification: 2) Documented symptomatic: episode during which typical symptoms of hypoglycaemia are accompanied by a PG level ≤3.9 mmol/L. 3) Asymptomatic: episode not accompanied by typical symptoms of hypoglycaemia, but with a PG level ≤3.9 mmol/L. 4) Probable symptomatic: an episode during which symptoms of hypoglycaemia are not accompanied by a PG determination but that was presumably caused by a PG level ≤3.9 mmol/L. 5) Pseudo-hypoglycaemia: episode during which the person with diabetes reports any of the typical symptoms of hypoglycaemia with a PG level &gt;3.9mmol/L, but approaching that level.

Throughout the trial, the insulin was administered at each of the three main meals (i.e. breakfast, lunch and main evening meal). The insulin was titrated to the pre-meal target of 4.0−8.0 mmol/L, and the bed-time target of 6.7–10 mmol/L in a treat-to-target fashion. Basal insulin: Participants continued insulin degludec once daily s.c. injections from the dose optimization process during the 12-week run-in period till 26-week treatment period.

          <title>Number of Treatment Emergent Hypoglycaemic Episodes According to American Diabetes Association (ADA)/ISPAD Classification: Total</title>
          <description>Treatment emergent: if the onset of the episode occurred on or after the first day of treatment with investigational medicinal product (IMP) after randomisation, and no later than 1 day after the last day on IMP. Classification of hypoglycaemia: 1) Severe (according to ISPAD classification). Following are according to ADA classification: 2) Documented symptomatic: episode during which typical symptoms of hypoglycaemia are accompanied by a PG level ≤3.9 mmol/L. 3) Asymptomatic: episode not accompanied by typical symptoms of hypoglycaemia, but with a PG level ≤3.9 mmol/L. 4) Probable symptomatic: an episode during which symptoms of hypoglycaemia are not accompanied by a PG determination but that was presumably caused by a PG level ≤3.9 mmol/L. 5) Pseudo-hypoglycaemia: episode during which the person with diabetes reports any of the typical symptoms of hypoglycaemia with a PG level &gt;3.9mmol/L, but approaching that level. The results are based on the on-treatment period.</description>

Throughout the trial, the insulin was administered at each of the three main meals (i.e. breakfast, lunch and main evening meal). The insulin was titrated to the pre-meal target of 4.0−8.0 mmol/L, and the bed-time target of 6.7–10 mmol/L in a treat-to-target fashion. Basal insulin: Participants continued insulin degludec once daily s.c. injections from the dose optimization process during the 12-week run-in period till 26-week treatment period. Dose adjustment during the treatment period at the discretion of the investigator was allowed if needed.</description>

        <title>Change in SD Score of Body Weight</title>
        <description>Change from baseline (week 0) in standard deviation (SD) score of body weight was evaluated after 26 weeks of randomisation. SD-scores are defined to be able to normalise the body weight in the various age groups. To estimate the growth of children, standardised weight is calculated for each year of age and for each sex. Thus, a child with a weight equal to the mean value for its age and sex has an SD score of 0, while a child with a weight 2 SDs above the mean value for its age and sex has an SD score of +2. The SD scores are derived from the age and sex of the subjects and the body weight together with growth curves defined for a reference population. The results are based on the last on-treatment value. Number of participants analysed = number of participants contributed to the analysis.</description>

Number of participants analysed = number of participants contributed to the analysis.</description>
          <population>SAS. One participant was randomised to the postmeal faster aspart group but was exposed to mealtime faster aspart throughout the study. The participant was included in the mealtime faster aspart group for the SAS. Therefore, number of participants analysed at baseline= Faster aspart (meal): 261, Faster aspart (post): 258 and NovoRapid (meal): 258.</population>
