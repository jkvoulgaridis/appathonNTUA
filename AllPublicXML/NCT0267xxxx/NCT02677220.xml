    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the clinical benefit for patients implanted with the
      Nucleus® CI532 cochlear implant.

      The Nucleus® CI532 has a pre-curved, perimodiolar array, the EA32, which is introduced into
      the cochlea through a straightening sheath.

    <description>The AzBio Sentence test was recorded at 3 months prior to subject withdraw. Not collected at endpoint. AzBio Tests consists of 15 lists of 20 sentences each. AzBio sentences are spoken by different talkers in a conversational style with limited contextual cues that the listener can use to predict or 'fill in' unintelligible words. Each list includes 5 sentences from 4 different male and female speakers. Each word in the sentence counts toward the overall score and the resulting score is presented in percent correct.</description>
