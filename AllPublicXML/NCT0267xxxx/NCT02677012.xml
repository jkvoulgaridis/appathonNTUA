  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial studies and compares 3 techniques in performing autologous fat
      grafting (AFG) in patients undergoing surgery to reshape or rebuild (reconstruct) a part of
      the body changed by previous surgery and inserted into another part of the body. AFG, also
      called fat injections or fat transplant, is a procedure in which an individual's own body fat
      (usually from abdomen or legs) is used during reconstructive surgery. Doctors want to compare
      3 techniques for processing the fat tissue collected during surgery and the length of time
      needed to complete each AFG technique and surgery. Comparing 3 AFG techniques and the time to
      complete them during surgery may help doctors determine the best technique to perform fat
      grafting in the future.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Measure and compare the rate of fat processed, defined as the volume of fat processed per
      unit time associated with the use of three aforementioned adipose tissue processing
      techniques.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To measure total fat grafting time: time from initiation of fat harvesting to the end of
      fat injection.

      II. To measure volume of fat processed: volume of fat obtained after fat processing.

      III. To measure total operation room (OR) time: time from patient entry into the OR (or when
      the patient barcode is read on entering the OR) to the time at which the patient leaves the
      OR.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 arms.

      ARM I (REVOLVE TM): Patients undergo AFG reconstructive surgery comprising washing and low
      velocity spinning using a commercially available system that washes the lipoaspirate with
      lactated Ringer's solution separates non-fat material from the fat with gentle centrifugal
      force and suction.

      ARM II (CYTORI PUREGRAT TM): Patients undergo AFG reconstructive surgery comprising gravity
      filtration using a commercially available system in which the lipoaspirate is rinsed with
      lactated Ringer's solution (RL) and the non-fat material is filtered through mesh.

      ARM III (COLEMAN TECHNIQUE): Patients undergo AFG reconstructive surgery comprising standard
      centrifugation at 3200 revolutions per minute (rpm) for 3 minutes with the resulting oil and
      aqueous layers discarded.
