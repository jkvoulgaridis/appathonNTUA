  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose for this multi-center, non-interventional study is to evaluate the
      duration of response defined as duration from first documented response of complete response
      (CR) or partial response (PR) until disease progression (as determined by the treating
      physician) for participants with laBCC.
