      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability and recommended phase 2
      dose of a new drug, known as IMP321, in combination with pembrolizumab when given to patients
      with unresectable or metastatic melanoma.

    <intervention_model_description>Study is an open label, dose finding study consisting of 2 parts. In part A, the dose is escalated following the protocol-defined safety observation period of the previous cohort. Patients will receive 9 cycles Pembrolizumab in combination with IMP321. In part B, the dose was defined based on the dose escalation. The treatment duration will be expanded to 19 cycles in the combined treatment.</intervention_model_description>
