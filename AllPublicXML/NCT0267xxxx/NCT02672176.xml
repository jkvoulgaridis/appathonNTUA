  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this proposal is to enhance the supports and resources available to
      patients with diabetes to assist them to achieve their health goals. The investigators will
      evaluate an innovative program that uses nurse health coaching, motivational interviewing
      techniques, wireless sensors and mobile health (mHealth) technology. In this program,
      patients will receive timely, tailored nurse coaching feedback to facilitate behavior change
      using mHealth technology, thus bridging bidirectional exchange of meaningful information
      among patient, nurse coach and provider. The investigators will conduct a randomized
      controlled trial among patients receiving chronic disease management at the University of
      California Davis(UC Davis) Primary Care Network. The patients who are eligible for inclusion
      in the study will be randomized to one of two arms of the trial: 1) Usual care (Care
      Coordination) administered by UC Davis Health Management and Education; or 2) the Patient and
      Provider Engagement and Empowerment through Technology (P2E2T2) Program to Improve Health in
      Diabetes. The hypothesis is that patients in the P2E2T2 arm of the study will be more engaged
      in identifying and achieving health goals related to their diabetes and will achieve better
      health outcomes compared to patients receiving usual care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a growing public health problem highly amenable to prevention and
      health promotion interventions. Over 26 million people are diagnosed with diabetes, and an
      estimated 79 million people have pre-diabetes (1). Physical inactivity, poor eating habits,
      obesity and smoking are common risk factors for multiple chronic diseases, including DM, and
      are associated with premature deaths in the United States (2). Traditional interventions for
      diabetes emphasize education and typically do not address patient-generated health data (3).
      Motivational interviewing (MI) is a counseling tool to improve self-efficacy and support
      behavioral changes that has been used successfully in treatment of addictions and chronic
      conditions including diabetes (4-6). MI focuses on enhancing goal-setting skills by
      encouraging focus on manageable steps to improve overall health, establishing reasonable
      goals, and managing barriers and obstacles to goal attainment. Mobile health (mHealth)
      technology can be used to allow bi-directional, timely communication of data and tailored
      feedback between the patient and health care team; thus mHealth has the potential to change
      an individual' health behavior and prevent factors that lead to disease (7). This proposal
      tests the effectiveness of nurse coaches and the mHealth platform as resources to patients.
      Specifically, the investigators will test a mobile technology-enabled nurse coaching
      intervention as a means to engage and empower patients to set their own personal goals to
      address lifestyle and behavioral changes to better manage their diabetes and comorbidities.
      The addition of a wireless sensing wearable device to monitor participant activities
      (physical activity, energy expenditure and sleep quality) will allow the investigators to
      perform meaningful analysis of patient-generated health data and provide tailored feedback to
      motivate the patient to reach personal goals. The investigators will achieve this project
      through the following Specific Aims:

      Specific Aim 1: To evaluate the effectiveness of the P2E2T2 program on diabetes management as
      measured by the following outcomes: 1) quality of life (QOL); 2) self-efficacy; 3) readiness
      to change; and 4) clinically relevant outcomes.

      This study is a randomized, controlled trial with two groups: 1) Usual care (Care
      Coordination); and 2) the Patient and Provider Engagement and Empowerment Through Technology
      (P2E2T2) program - nurse coaching paired with mobile sensor technology to provide targeted
      feedback of patient-generated, real-world community physical activity and sleep quality data
      to the nurse coach, participants, and primary care providers to improve self-management of
      diabetes. Participants will be recruited from the UC Davis Primary Care Clinics network.
      After enrollment in the study, those randomized to receive the intervention will interact
      with their nurse coach through mobile technologies by telephone, or by text/e-mail through
      the secure mHealth dashboard platform established for communication and transfer of data. The
      investigators expect to enroll at least 150 patients in each of the intervention and control
      arms. This sample size will be sufficient to detect differences between the two groups. Even
      under the conservative assumption that design effects and dropout rates may result in a
      reduced sample size of 100 per treatment group, the study will still have at least 80% power
      to detect the specified clinically important effect size. Based on a previous study of nurse
      coaching using MI to improve disease self-management (8), the investigators found improvement
      in self-efficacy scores significantly higher in the intervention group compared to the
      control group. Data will be collected from participants at three time points: 1) baseline
      data at time of recruitment; 2) 3 months (coinciding with the completion of the
      intervention); and 3) 9 months (selected to assess sustained effects of the intervention (6
      months after intervention ended)). At baseline, in addition to outcomes, all participants
      will complete a demographic survey which will include age, gender, race/ethnicity, education
      level, income level and insurance type and health history using the Charlson Comorbidity
      Index which includes common chronic conditions. All data for the study will be collected by
      the research coordinator and entered into the REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture)
      system housed in the servers managed by UC Davis Clinical and Translational Science Center
      (CTSC) (9).

    <measure>Diabetes Self-efficacy Measured Using the Diabetes Empowerment Scale Short Form (DES-SF)- Scores at Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Diabetes self-efficacy (Diabetes Empowerment Scale (DES)-Short Form) (http://diabetesresearch.med.umich.edu/Tools_SurveyInstruments.php). This eight-item survey instrument is derived from the 37 item DES survey, measuring diabetes-related psychosocial self-efficacy. The scale uses a 5-point Likert scale with raw scores on the scale ranging from 8 to 40. Total score is calculated as the sum of the eight questions divided by the number of items in the survey (range is 1 to 8), with higher scores indicating greater self-efficacy. The tool is a valid and reliable measure of overall diabetes-related psychosocial self-efficacy with an alpha of 0.84. Concurrent validity was established with attitudes about having diabetes, understanding diabetes and improved A1C scores. A 0.25 point difference in this score is equivalent to a shift of at least one point in two questions in the DES tool; in other words, they have improved their confidence in engaging in self-management behavior in two areas</description>

          <title>Diabetes self-efficacy</title>
          <description>Diabetes Empowerment Scale (DES)-Short Form - This eight-item instrument measures diabetes-related psychosocial self-efficacy using a 5-point Likert scale with raw scores ranging from 8 to 40. Total score is the sum of the eight questions divided by the number of items in the survey (range is 1 to 8), with higher scores indicating greater self-efficacy. A 0.25 point difference in this score is equivalent to a shift of at least one point in two questions in the DES tool; in other words, they have improved their confidence in engaging in self-management behavior in two areas.</description>

        <title>Diabetes Self-efficacy Measured Using the Diabetes Empowerment Scale Short Form (DES-SF)- Scores at Baseline</title>
        <description>Diabetes self-efficacy (Diabetes Empowerment Scale (DES)-Short Form) (http://diabetesresearch.med.umich.edu/Tools_SurveyInstruments.php). This eight-item survey instrument is derived from the 37 item DES survey, measuring diabetes-related psychosocial self-efficacy. The scale uses a 5-point Likert scale with raw scores on the scale ranging from 8 to 40. Total score is calculated as the sum of the eight questions divided by the number of items in the survey (range is 1 to 8), with higher scores indicating greater self-efficacy. The tool is a valid and reliable measure of overall diabetes-related psychosocial self-efficacy with an alpha of 0.84. Concurrent validity was established with attitudes about having diabetes, understanding diabetes and improved A1C scores. A 0.25 point difference in this score is equivalent to a shift of at least one point in two questions in the DES tool; in other words, they have improved their confidence in engaging in self-management behavior in two areas</description>

          <description>Depressive symptoms were measured with the PHQ-9. This is a 9-question instrument commonly administered to patients in a primary care setting to screen for the presence and severity of depression. The sum total of the responses ranges from 0 to 27. The total score determines the level of depressive symptoms. Higher scores indicate more depressive symptoms. In general, a score of 10 or above is suggestive of the presence of depression. This instrument has demonstrated validity and reliability with an alpha of 0.89 when evaluated in 3000 primary care patients.</description>

        <description>PROMIS Emotional Distress Anxiety (www.healthmeasures.net) The Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Measures (PROMIS) Emotional Distress Anxiety instrument measures self-reported fear, anxious misery and hyperarousal symptoms. Anxiety is best differentiated by symptoms that reflect autonomic arousal and experience of threat. The four-item instrument assesses anxiety over the past seven days using a five item Likert scale (1= not at all, 5 = very much), yielding possible raw scores of 4 to 20. The raw score is translated to a T-score using a score conversion table, with a possible range of 40.3 to 81.6. A score of 50 equals the mean. Higher scores indicate greater emotional distress anxiety. This instrument has demonstrated validity and reliability with an alpha of 0.92 when evaluated in 961 in patients with chronic hepatitis C.</description>

This instrument has demonstrated validity and reliability with an alpha of 0.91 when evaluated in 4880 patients in a diverse cohort of cancer patients in the US.</description>
