  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 2 open-label, multicenter study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and
      efficacy of BMN 190 intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration every other week (qow) for a
      period of 144 weeks, in patients with CLN2. The study is designed to assess disease
      progression in CLN2 patients treated with BMN 190 compared to natural history data from
      untreated historical controls.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BMN 190 is a recombinant form of human tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1), the enzyme deficient
      in patients with CLN2 diseases (also known as classical late-infantile CLN2, cLINCL, or
      Jansky-Bielschowsky disease), a form of Batten Disease. As an enzyme replacement therapy
      (ERT), BMN 190 is designed to restore TPP1 enzyme activity. BMN 190 is designed to reduce the
      progressive, pathologic accumulation of lysosomal storage material. 190-203 is a Phase 2
      open-label, multicenter study that will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of
      BMN 190 in pediatric patients &lt; 18 years of age with CLN2 disease. Study drug dosing will be
      determined by the patient's age and administered via intracerebroventricular (ICV) infusion
      every other week (qow), for a duration of 144 weeks.
