HRQOL response was defined as a 17-point increase from the baseline assessment on the QOL index, after the score had been linearly transformed to a 0 to 100 scale. EORTC QLQ-C30: included 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), 1 global health status, 3 symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea/vomiting) and 6 single items (dyspnoea, appetite loss, insomnia, constipation/diarrhea and financial difficulties). Most questions used 4 point scale (1 'Not at all' to 4 'Very much'; 2 questions used 7-point scale (1 'very poor' to 7 'Excellent'). Scores averaged, transformed to 0-100 scale; higher score representing better level of functioning or greater degree of symptoms.</description>

The overall objective response was defined as a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR).

Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have had reduction in short axis to &lt;10 millimetre (mm). A PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of longest diameters of non-lymph node lesions and of the short diameter(s) or short axis of lymph nodes.</description>

Pain response was defined as the occurrence of 1 of the following and confirmed by an additional assessment, at least 3 weeks but not more than 5 weeks later: A &gt;= 2 point reduction from baseline in BPI-SF worst pain score without an increase in analgesic use, or a 25% or more reduction in analgesic use from baseline without an increase in worst pain score from baseline. The analysis was performed by Kaplan-Meier method.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Health-related Quality of Life (HRQOL) Response at Week 12</title>
        <description>The global health status or quality of life (QOL) was measured as the HRQOL response rate at 12 weeks using the 2-item global health status index of the european organization for research and treatment of cancer-quality of life questionnaire-C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) instrument. HRQOL response was defined as a 17-point increase from the baseline assessment on the QOL index, after the score had been linearly transformed to a 0 to 100 scale. EORTC QLQ-C30: included 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), 1 global health status, 3 symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea/vomiting) and 6 single items (dyspnoea, appetite loss, insomnia, constipation/diarrhea and financial difficulties). Most questions used 4 point scale (1 'Not at all' to 4 'Very much'; 2 questions used 7-point scale (1 'very poor' to 7 'Excellent'). Scores averaged, transformed to 0-100 scale; higher score representing better level of functioning or greater degree of symptoms.</description>
