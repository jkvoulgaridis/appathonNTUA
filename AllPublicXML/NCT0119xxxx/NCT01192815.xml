      RATIONALE: Erlotinib hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the
      enzymes needed for cell growth. Erlotinib hydrochloride may also make tumor cells more
      sensitive to radiation therapy. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x- rays and other types of
      radiation to kill tumor cells. Giving erlotinib hydrochloride together with radiation therapy
      may be an effective treatment for patients with head and neck cancer.PURPOSE: This phase II
      trial is studying how well giving erlotinib hydrochloride together with radiation therapy
      works in treating patients with stage III-IV squamous cell cancer of the head and neck.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:I. To determine the time to progression of the combination of the EGFR
      inhibitor erlotinib and radiation therapy. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:I. To determine objective
      response rate, locoregional control rate, duration of response, patterns of failure, overall
      survival, toxicities and quality of life outcomes of the combination of erlotinib and
      concurrent radiation therapy.II. To determine the pharmacokinetic profile of erlotinib.
      Additional analyses of the pharmacokinetic data on patients receiving daily erlotinib
      treatment via their feeding tube will be conducted. III. To determine the effect of treatment
      and dose of treatment on biologic correlates in tumor tissue and/or surrounding mucosa, EGFR
      expression and phosphorylation status, serum markers of angiogenic activity VEGF, sVEGFR-2,
      sKIT, ICAM, PDGF, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for ERBB2 for gene amplification,
      DNA-sequencing of EGFR and ERBB2 genes from DNA extracted from pretreatment biopsy material
      for mutation screening, gene expression profiling on pre-treatment biopsy material to
      identify predictors of response to treatment, apoptosis (TUNEL assay), Ki67 (nuclear
      proliferation antigen)IV. To determine the utility of the comprehensive geriatric assessment,
      in predicting tolerance to treatment in patients &gt;= 65 years included in this trial. OUTLINE:
      Patients receive erlotinib hydrochloride orally or via gastrostomy tube once daily in weeks
      1-9 and then for 2 years following completion of radiation therapy. Beginning on day 1 of
      week 2, patients undergo radiation therapy once daily, 5 times a week, for 5-7 weeks.
      Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.After
      completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 months, every 3 months for 2
      years, and then every 6 months for 2 years.

    <description>The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever status is recorded first) until the first date that recurrence or PD is objectively documented, taking as reference for PD the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started. Disease progression free survival (PFS) is measured from start of treatment to the date of disease progression or protocol-designated outcome, whichever occurs first and censored at the date of last followed for those survivors without disease progression
Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions. Measured via Conventional CT and MRI</description>

        <title>Time to Disease Progression</title>
        <description>The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever status is recorded first) until the first date that recurrence or PD is objectively documented, taking as reference for PD the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started. Disease progression free survival (PFS) is measured from start of treatment to the date of disease progression or protocol-designated outcome, whichever occurs first and censored at the date of last followed for those survivors without disease progression
Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions. Measured via Conventional CT and MRI</description>
