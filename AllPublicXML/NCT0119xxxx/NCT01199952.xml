    <textblock>
      Hypothesis: Use of an effective contraceptive six weeks after abortion will be higher in the
      treatment group than in the control group.

      Primary Aim ·To determine use of an effective contraceptive method six weeks after abortion
      in women who choose combined hormonal contraception (CHC) and who receive a three-week
      educational phone call as compared to women who do not receive the intervention.

      Secondary Aims

        -  To describe the most common concerns and logistical problems women experience with
           initiating and adhering to CHC after abortion.

        -  To describe the concerns that lead to discontinuation or method change. *To assess
           feasibility of conducting a follow-up telephone call in this population This is a
           randomized, controlled trial to assess the effect of a three-week follow-up phone call
           in women who choose combined hormonal contraception on the day of their abortion at the
           San Francisco General Hospital Women's Options Center. Subjects randomized to the
           treatment group will receive an interventional phone call three weeks after their
           abortion; participants randomized to the control group will not receive the call. All
           subjects will receive a follow-up call six weeks after their abortion to assess and
           compare method use between the two groups. Calls will be made at three- and six-weeks
           post abortion in order to give subjects enough time to initiate CHC and to assess
           continuation into the second month of the method. Data will be collected at baseline,
           during the intervention for the treatment group and during the final follow-up call for
           both groups. The primary outcome is use of an effective contraceptive six weeks after
           abortion.
