      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of pomalidomide in treating
      patients with Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia that has returned after a period of improvement
      (relapsed) or does not respond to treatment (refractory). Pomalidomide may stimulate the
      immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of pomalidomide in patients with relapsed or
      refractory Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and toxicity profile of pomalidomide in patients with relapsed or
      refractory Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia.

      II. To evaluate the efficacy of pomalidomide in patients with relapsed or refractory
      Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive pomalidomide orally (PO) on days 1-28 or 1-21. Courses repeat every 21 or 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months.
