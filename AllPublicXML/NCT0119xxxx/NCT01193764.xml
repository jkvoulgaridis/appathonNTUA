  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators conducted a recent pilot study and found a strong positive correlation
      between the consumption of 100% chocolate and acne exacerbation. However, this study had
      limitations including the lack of placebo and the small sample size. Although studies have
      been conducted assessing chocolate's effect on acne, no study has been done evaluating this
      effect using chocolate with 100% cocoa content in a double blind placebo controlled fashion.
      This study will analyze the difference in the number and type of acneiform lesions per
      subject at the different time points (Day 4 and Day 7) compared to baseline in order to
      increase the validity of the investigators results. In addition, the investigators will use
      unsweetened cocoa powder,12 rather than chocolate candy, which contains higher quantities of
      additive ingredients such as sugar and milk to avoid interference with the results and the
      possibility to establish or not an association between the unsweetened cocoa and an effect on
      acne.
