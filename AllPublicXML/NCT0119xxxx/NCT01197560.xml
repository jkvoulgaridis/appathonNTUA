    <textblock>
      This research study is for patients who have been diagnosed with Diffuse Large B-cell
      Lymphoma (DLBCL) that did not respond to (refractory) or that has come back after
      chemotherapy treatment (relapsed). Lymphoma is a cancer of a type of blood cell called
      lymphocytes. DLBCL is just one type of lymphoma. Within DLBCL there are two different
      subtypes called Germinal Center B-cell (GCB) and non-GCB which can be determined by cell
      surface marker tests or by gene expression tests. Scientists can look at cells and genes in
      the laboratory and see that the two kinds are different, but they don't know yet what the
      difference means. To patients and doctors these two kinds seem the same. Right now doctors
      don't usually do tests to find out which kind a patient has because the treatment is the same
      for both.

      This study will have two stages, 1 and 2. The main purpose of Stage 1 is to separate patients
      by subtype and then test whether patients taking lenalidomide or any one of four other drugs
      have a better response. It is possible that lenalidomide will work better than one of the
      other drugs in zero, one, or both subtypes. Stage 2 will further test only the subtype(s)
      from Stage 1 that showed a good response to lenalidomide. The main purpose of Stage 2 is to
      test how long patients are disease free on lenalidomide compared to one of the four other
      drugs.

      On 29 January 2013 the enrolment goal for the Stage 1 portion of the study was met and
      enrollment was stopped. The final analysis for Stage 1 was performed as of the 04 Jul 2013
      data cutoff date. According to the Stage 1 results as assessed by the independent response
      adjudication committee (IRAC), neither subtype met the pre specified requirement to be
      further studied in Stage 2. Additionally, a suitable assay for the selection of participants
      for the Stage 2 study was not available. Therefore, on 6 January 2014, Celgene decided to not
      open Stage 2.

    <measure>Stage 1: Percentage of Participants With an Overall Response According to the International Working Group (IWG) Response Criteria for Non Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL), Cheson 1999 and Evaluated by the Independent Response Adjudication Committee (IRAC)</measure>
    <time_frame>From the date of randomization to the data cut-off of 4 July 2013; when all patients reached the scheduled 16-week assessment or had progressed/died before the scheduled 16-week assessment); the median study duration was 27.0 and 19.7 weeks, respectively.</time_frame>
    <description>An overall response is a complete response (CR), unconfirmed complete response (CRu) or partial response (PR) and was evaluated by the IRAC. A CR = complete disappearance of disease and related symptoms. Lymph nodes and nodal masses regressed on computed tomography to normal size (≤ 1.5 cm in their greatest transverse diameter for nodes &gt; 1.5 cm prior to therapy and ≤ 1.0 cm in their short axis for nodes 1.1-1.5 cm in their long axis and &gt; 1.0 cm in their short axis prior to therapy). Spleen and/or liver not palpable on exam, normal size by imaging, and absence of nodules related to lymphoma. If bone marrow was involved prior to therapy, infiltrate must have cleared on repeat biopsy. PR = ≥ 50% decrease in sum of the product of the diameters (SPD) of up to 6 of the largest dominant nodes or nodal masses. No increase in other nodes, liver, or spleen. Splenic and hepatic nodules regressed by ≥ 50% in their SPD or for single nodules, in the greatest transverse diameter;no new disease.</description>

    <description>Response was defined as having a CR, CRu or PR, based on IWG 1999 Response Criteria for NHL as evaluated by the investigators.

    <description>A TEAE was defined as an AE that begins or worsens in intensity of frequency on or after the first dose of study drug through 28 days after last dose of study drug.
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any:
Death;

Any inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;
Persistent or significant disability or incapacity;
Congenital anomaly or birth defect;
Any other important medical event The investigator determined the relationship of an AE to study drug based on the timing of the AE relative to drug administration and whether or not other drugs, therapeutic interventions, or underlying conditions could provide a sufficient explanation for the event.The severity of an AE was evaluated by the investigator according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) (Version 4.03) where Grade 1 = Mild, Grade 2 = Moderate, Grade 3 = Severe, Grade 4 = Life-threatening and Grade 5 = Death</description>

      <pre_assignment_details>Participants were stratified into Germinal center B-cell (GCB) or non-GCB subtypes and randomized 1:1 to receive lenalidomide or investigator’s choice treatment (one of the single-agent reference therapies [gemcitabine, rituximab, etoposide, or oxaliplatin)</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Participants received lenalidomide 25 mg orally once daily for 21 days in each 28-day cycle until progressive disease. For participants with creatinine clearance ≥ 30 mL/min but &lt; 60 mL/min, lenalidomide 10 mg once daily for 21 days for 2 cycles. After Cycle 2 the dose may have been increased to a maximum of 15 mg lenalidomide once daily for 21 days in each 28-day cycle. Treatment was continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or voluntary withdrawal.</description>

          <description>Participants received a single agent reference therapy (either gemcitabine, oxaliplatin, rituximab or etoposide) based on published data for up to 6 cycles or until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal. Participants with documented progressive disease had the option to receive crossover lenalidomide at the same dosage as participants randomized to lenalidomide.</description>

          <title>Creatinine Clearance (CrCl)</title>
          <description>Creatinine is a waste product from the normal breakdown of muscle tissue. As creatinine is produced, it's filtered through the kidneys and excreted in urine. Doctors measure the blood creatinine level as a test of kidney function. Participants with a CrCl (as calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault formula, utilizing actual body weight or ideal body weight, whichever was less) of ≥ 60 mL/min received a starting dose of 25 mg lenalidomide once daily. Participants with moderate renal insufficiency (ie, CrCl ≥ 30 mL/min but &lt; 60 mL/min) received a starting dose of 10 mg lenalidomide once daily.</description>

          <description>DLBCL is comprised of different pathophysiological subtypes that influence patient prognosis and response to treatment. Based on immunohistochemistry (IHC), DLBCL can be classified into germinal center B-cell (GCB) and non-GCB subtypes. Patients with non-GCB have a worse prognosis compared with the GCB subtype</description>
          <population>The Modified Intent to Treat (mITT ) population was defined as all participants randomized who had a DLBCL diagnosis and either Germinal Center B-cell subtype or non-GCB subtype confirmed by central pathology, and who received at least one dose of study drug (lenalidomide or investigator's choice).</population>

        <title>Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Events (TEAEs) in the Overall Treatment Phase by Initial Treatment Assignment</title>
        <description>A TEAE was defined as an AE that begins or worsens in intensity of frequency on or after the first dose of study drug through 28 days after last dose of study drug.
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any:
Death;
Life-threatening event;
Any inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;
Persistent or significant disability or incapacity;
Congenital anomaly or birth defect;
Any other important medical event The investigator determined the relationship of an AE to study drug based on the timing of the AE relative to drug administration and whether or not other drugs, therapeutic interventions, or underlying conditions could provide a sufficient explanation for the event.The severity of an AE was evaluated by the investigator according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) (Version 4.03) where Grade 1 = Mild, Grade 2 = Moderate, Grade 3 = Severe, Grade 4 = Life-threatening and Grade 5 = Death</description>
