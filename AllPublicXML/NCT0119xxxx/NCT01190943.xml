      This research study is studying DNA biomarkers in tissue samples from patients with
      osteosarcoma. Studying samples of tumor tissue and blood from patients with cancer in the
      laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes the occur in DNA and identify biomarkers
      related to cancer. DNA analysis of tumor tissue may also help doctors predict how well
      patients will respond to treatment.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. To comprehensively detect genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic aberrations in tissue
      samples from patients with osteosarcoma that may play a role in chemoresistance and
      metastasis using high-resolution genome-wide technologies.

      II. To identify recurrent genetic mutations involved in the pathogenesis of osteosarcoma,
      especially for the development of chemoresistance and metastatic tumors.

      III. To identify and validate these biomarkers for new therapeutic targets for patients with
      osteosarcoma, especially those with metastatic disease and whose tumors are resistant to
      standard chemotherapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Archived tumor tissue and peripheral blood DNA
      specimens are analyzed for DNA copy number profiling, gene expression profiling, DNA
      methylation profiling, microRNA profiling, and genomic resequencing. Clinical data including
      demographics; date of diagnosis, surgery, chemotherapy, recurrence, progression, and death;
      imaging; toxicity; and pathologic data elements associated with the specimens are also
      collected and analyzed.

    <description>The Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) algorithm will be used for analysis of differential expression. Pathway analysis and data integration will be performed on the differentially expressed genes using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Differentially expressed genes and miRNA targets as well as genes in the significant DNA aberrations will be mapped and integrated to identify the enriched pathways and networks.</description>

    <description>The array data will be imported to Copy Number Analyzer (CNAG) for GeneChip mapping arrays to identify copy number aberrations in the tumor samples. To identify regions with frequent CNA among different groups of patient samples, we will use the Genomic Identification of Significant Targets in Cancer (GISTIC) tool .</description>
