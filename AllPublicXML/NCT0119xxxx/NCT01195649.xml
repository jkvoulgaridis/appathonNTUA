    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this prospective, observational, post-marketing study is to evaluate
      the patient characteristics, pre-treatment and treatment duration in Renal Cell Carcinoma
      (RCC) patients who are candidates for systematic therapy and in whom a decision to treat with
      Nexavar速 has been made under real-life practice settings and approved reimbursement
      restriction in Taiwan. Therefore, the main objective of the study is to collect data on:

      Prescription pattern: to determine the factors affecting compliance and duration of treatment
      with special attention given to education status, demography, disease details, pre-treatment,
      concomitant medication and other baseline data

      Nexavar速 treatment and efficacy data
