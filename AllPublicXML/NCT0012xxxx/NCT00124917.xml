      BACKGROUND:

      -This study represents a progression from findings in four previous National Cancer Institute
      (NCI) Radiation Oncology Branch (ROB) protocols (02-C-0167A, 02-C-0207E, 03-C-0190B,
      04-C-0171). In these previous works we have begun to develop techniques to obtain magnetic
      resonance (MR) biological images and co-register tissue in prostate cancer patients.

      OBJECTIVES:

      -The scientific objective of this protocol is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
      of external beam radiation to regions of interest within the prostate based acute toxicity.

      Secondary objectives of this study are to relate patterns in gene and protein expression to
      response and toxicity and to evaluate the frequency of late term toxicity.

      ELIGIBILITY:

      -Patients with prostate cancer without evidence of metastasis will be eligible for this
      study.

      DESIGN:

        -  This phase I trial will use intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) to deliver
           escalating doses of external beam radiation to regions of histologically confirmed
           prostate cancer. The study will be conducted using a standard 3-6 dose-escalation with
           an initial 3 patients in each dose cohort and the potential expansion of the cohort to 6
           patients.

        -  Anatomic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance (MR) biological images,
           such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), will be obtained. Tissue will be acquired
           from sites of interest, with biopsy locations precisely translated (co-registered) to an
           MR image of reference. Tissue samples will be processed for complementary
           deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) microarray testing and stored for future analysis in the
           Radiation Oncology Branch, NCI. A gold seed will be left at the biopsy site as a
           fiducial marker to direct future radiation therapy. If necessary, additional fiducial
           markers will be placed for target localization during treatment.

        -  Once MR guided biopsies are obtained and fiducial markers placed, the patient will
           undergo a standard computed tomography (CT) simulation for radiation therapy treatment
           planning. The MR and CT images will be fused. Areas of pathologically confirmed
           malignancy will undergo dose escalation as described below. Areas of image abnormality
           that could not be biopsied or were without definite pathologic evidence of malignancy
           will be given intermediate doses. The remainder of the prostate gland will receive
           standard dose (7560 centigray (cGy)`).

        -  The trial will accrue 18 to 36 patients with an anticipated accrual period of 2 years.

A non-serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence. A serious adverse event is an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that results in death, a life threatening adverse drug experience, hospitalization, disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, congenital anomaly/birth defect or important medical events that jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the previous outcomes mentioned.</description>
