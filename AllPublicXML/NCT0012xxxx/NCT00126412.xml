    <description>All subjects received 123I-mIBG injection over at least 1 to 2 minutes through a cannula (or indwelling catheter in the vein). After the injection of 123I-mIBG was complete, the cannula was flushed with at least 5 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride solution over a maximum of 10 seconds.
All subjects ≥18 years of age and children with a weight of ≥70 kg were to receive an intravenous injection of 370 ±10% MBq (333 to 407 MBq [9.0 to 11 mCi] of 123I-mIBG). Doses of 123I-mIBG for children &lt;18 years of age (with a weight of 8-70 kg) were to be calculated on the basis of a reference activity for an adult scaled to body weight according to the schedule proposed by the European Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM) Paediatric Task Group; for children &lt;8 kg, a scaled activity or a fixed minimum activity of 80 ±10% MBq (72 to 88 MBq [1.9 to 2.2 mCi]) was permissible.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        For subjects recruited under Amendment 01 :

        (1) a) The subject has known or suspected neuroblastoma and is undergoing evaluation of
        disease status (for which a 123I-mIBG scintigraphic examination is clinically appropriate)
        OR b) The subject is ≥18 years of age with either: i) Known phaeochromocytoma. ii)
        Suspected phaeochromocytoma based on abnormal levels of catecholamines or metabolites in
        the urine or blood with difficult to control chronic or paroxysmal hypertension and/or
        abnormalities in the adrenal region on ultrasound, computerised tomography (CT), or
        magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). iii) A diagnosis of a familial or hereditary condition
        known to be associated with phaeochromocytoma (multiple endocrine neoplasia, von
        Hippel-Landau disease, neurofibromatosis, etc).

        For subjects recruited under Amendment 02 :

          1. a) The subject has known or suspected neuroblastoma and is undergoing evaluation of
             disease status (for which a 123I-mIBG scintigraphic examination is clinically
             appropriate) OR b) The subject has either: i) Known phaeochromocytoma, or, ii)
             Suspected phaeochromocytoma based on abnormal levels of catecholamines or metabolites
             in the urine or blood in conjunction with difficult to control chronic or paroxysmal
             hypertension and/or abnormalities in the adrenal region on ultrasound, CT, or MRI, or
             iii) A diagnosis of a familial or hereditary condition known to be associated with
             phaeochromocytoma (multiple endocrine neoplasia, von Hippel-Landau disease,
             neurofibromatosis, etc).

             All subjects: (enrolled under Amendments 01 and 02)

          2. The subject is able and willing to comply with study procedures and a signed and dated
             informed consent is obtained.

          3. The subject was male; or a female who was either pre-menarchal, surgically sterile
             (had a documented bilateral oophorectomy and/or documented hysterectomy),
             postmenopausal (cessation of menses for more than 1 year), non-lactating, or of
             childbearing potential for whom a urine pregnancy test (with the results known prior
             to investigational medicinal product (IMP) administration) was negative.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject was previously entered into this study or had participated in any other
             investigational medicinal product or medical device study within 30 days of enrolment.

          2. The subject had a history or suspicion of significant allergic reaction or anaphylaxis
             to iodide or iodinated imaging agents.

          3. The subject presented with any clinically active, serious, life-threatening disease
             other than neuroblastoma or phaeochromocytoma, with a life expectancy of less than 30
             days or where participation in the study would compromise the management of the
             subject or other reason that in the judgement of the investigator(s) made the subject
             unsuitable for participation in the study.

          4. The subject had a history of renal insufficiency (serum creatinine &gt;3.0 mg/dL [265
             μmol/L]).

          5. The subject used medications that are known to interfere with 123I-mIBG uptake and
             these medications could not be safely withheld for at least 24 hours before study
             procedures.
