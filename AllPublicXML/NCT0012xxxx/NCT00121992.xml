    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-blinded randomized phase III trial. Patients will be
      post-surgically stratified at inclusion first according to the participating institution,
      then according to menopausal status and will be randomly assigned to receive either:

        -  TAC: Docetaxel 75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour intravenous (i.v.) infusion on day 1 every 3 weeks
           (q3w) in combination with doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 as an i.v. bolus and cyclophosphamide 500
           mg/m2 as an i.v. bolus on day 1 every 3 weeks.

        -  FAC: 5-fluorouracil 500 mg/m2 as an i.v. bolus on day 1 every 3 weeks in combination
           with doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 as an i.v. bolus and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 as an i.v.
           bolus on day 1 every 3 weeks.

      Primary objective:

        -  To compare disease-free survival (DFS) after treatment with docetaxel in combination
           with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (TAC) to 5-Fluorouracil in combination with
           doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (FAC) as adjuvant treatment of high risk operable
           breast cancer patients with negative axillary lymph nodes.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To compare overall survival (OS) between the 2 above mentioned arms.

        -  To compare toxicity and quality of life between the 2 above mentioned arms.

        -  To evaluate pathologic markers for predicting efficacy (hormonal receptors and human
           epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) protein expression).
