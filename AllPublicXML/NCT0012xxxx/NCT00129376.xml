  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment consists of 4 AC cycles followed by 2 weekly docetaxel cycles (12 infusions).

      The pathological complete response rate obtained in previous studies is around 12%. The
      expected pathological complete response rate in this study is 25%. With an alpha error of
      0.05 and a beta error of 0.2, and following Simon´s 2 phase test, 19 patients are needed
      initially. With 2 pathological complete responses, patient recruitment will continue until
      approximately 61 patients are recruited. Twelve pathological complete responses are needed to
      confirm the study hypothesis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients received doxorubicin (60 mg/m2) and cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m2), both in a short
      intravenous infusion, every three weeks for four cycles (days 1, 22, 43 and 64). Three weeks
      later, docetaxel (36 mg/m2) was administered as a 30-min intravenous infusion, weekly for six
      weeks (days 85, 92, 99, 106, 113 and 120) followed by a 2-week resting period (8-week cycle).
      After that, patients received a second docetaxel cycle (infusions on days 141, 148, 155, 162,
      169 and 176). Adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy were delivered according to the protocol
      of each participating center. Hormonal treatment was started after the last chemotherapy
      infusion in all patients with positive estrogen and/or progesterone receptor tumors and was
      continued for five years.

      Semiquantitative determination of three molecular markers was carried out by
      immunocytochemical methods. Tissue samples were taken prior to initiation of chemotherapy
      from the core of the primary tumors. Specimens were sent to a central laboratory for analysis
      of Topo II, survivin and p27.

    <time_frame>Up to 29 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Pathological complete response was defined by the Miller &amp; Payne criteria. pCR was defined as no invasive cells identifiable in breast sections at surgery. Response was measured by physical exam and breast imaging before surgery and was evaluated according to the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. Pathological response after surgery, was based on the proportion of remaining tumor and postchemotherapy changes, evaluating separately the response in the breast and in the axilla lymph nodes.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 29 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>CRR measured according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions, where:
Complete Response (CR): disappearance of all target lesions
Partial Response (PR): &gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions
Progresive Disease (PD): &gt;=20% increase from smallest sum of longest diameter recorded since treatment started (best response).
Stable Disease (SD): Neither PD nor PR</description>

          <description>Stage was classified following the TNM system of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC).
Stage 0. Cancer in situ (“in place”). Still located in the place they started and have not spread to nearby tissues. This stage is highly curable, by removing the entire tumor with surgery.
Stage I. Small cancer that has not grown into nearby tissues. Also has not spread.
Stage II and Stage III. Larger cancers that have grown deeply into nearby tissue. They may have also spread to lymph nodes but not to other parts of the body.
Stage IV. Cancer has spread to other organs or parts of the body.</description>

        <description>Pathological complete response was defined by the Miller &amp; Payne criteria. pCR was defined as no invasive cells identifiable in breast sections at surgery. Response was measured by physical exam and breast imaging before surgery and was evaluated according to the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. Pathological response after surgery, was based on the proportion of remaining tumor and postchemotherapy changes, evaluating separately the response in the breast and in the axilla lymph nodes.</description>
