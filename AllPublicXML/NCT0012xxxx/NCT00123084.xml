    <textblock>
      The purpose of the research study is to determine the effects of two different kinds of
      speech treatment on certain behaviors in individuals with parkinson's disease. These
      behaviors include speech, voice, related communication behaviors, swallowing and body
      movement.

      This is a research project designed to look at various areas of function, such as speech,
      voice, swallowing, related communication behaviors and body movement of individuals with
      idiopathic Parkinson disease (PD) and to investigate how two different forms of speech
      therapy affect these areas.

      We are asking up to 620 individuals to participate in this study in several different ways.
      Specifically, there is an experimental group (ExpG), questionnaire group (QG) and
      communication partner group (CPG). The ExpG will be composed of individuals with PD and the
      healthy age and gender matched controls (HC)(Up to 140 total will be asked, 80 expected to
      complete the study). The QG will include the significant others, family members, and friends
      of the ExpG (Up to 140 will be asked, 80 expected to complete the study). The CPG will be
      made up of friends of the ExpG (Up to 340 will be asked, 240 expected to complete the
      study).Some individuals in the ExpG may not pass the initial screenings. As a result, their
      QG and CPG will no longer need to participate. Therefore, the actual number of individuals
      who will complete the study is expected to be much less.

      There are 10 PHASES of this study. The initial PHASES (1,2,3) are screening PHASES to
      determine if the individual is a good candidate for this study. PHASES 4, 6 and 10 are PHASES
      of recording data and PHASE 5 is treatment. PHASES 7, 8 and 9 are additional assessments. The
      total duration of the Subjects (Ss) participation from the time Ss sign the consent to the
      completion of the last phase (PHASE 10) is approximately10 months.

      PHASE 1: ENT/CLINICAL VOICE AND SPEECH SCREEN PHASE 2: SWALLOW SCREEN AND ASSESSMENT PHASE 3:
      THINKING SKILLS SCREEN AND ASSESSMENT After the completion of PHASES 1-3, the research team
      will look at the data collected and determine if the Ss meet the criteria to participate in
      this study. If asked to participate, Ss will be assigned to one of four groups and then
      continue with PHASE 4.

      PHASE 4: INITIAL DATA RECORDINGS All of the procedures in PHASE 4 will be done two times
      before the treatment PHASE 5. Each recording will take approximately 2-2.5 hours.

      PHASE 5: TREATMENT PHASE 6: POST TREATMENT PHASE DATA RECORDINGS PHASE 7: FOLLOW-UP ENT
      EVALUATION PHASE 8: FOLLOW-UP SWALLOW EVALUATION PHASE 9: FOLLOW-UP THINKING SKILLS
      EVALUATION PHASE 10: 6-MONTH POST TREATMENT PHASE DATA RECORDINGS
