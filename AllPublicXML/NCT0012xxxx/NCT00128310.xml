  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, prospective, Phase III study in which patients with
      advanced breast carcinoma previously treated with anthracyclines and taxanes will be randomly
      assigned to receive one of two treatment options: vinorelbine (Arm A) or gemcitabine plus
      vinorelbine (Arm B).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators assume that progression-free survival mean time for patients treated with
      vinorelbine will be 3 months, and for patients treated with gemcitabine plus vinorelbine will
      be 5 months. That implies a reduction in risk ratio of 40% (Hazard ratio = 1,67). Assuming a
      bilateral alpha error of 0.05 and beta error of 10%, and the number of events needed if 60%
      of patients have progressed after 1 year, the number of patients needed per treatment arm is
      114. Considering a 10% post-randomization drop-out, the final number of patients is 252 (126
      per arm).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival is calculated as the time from randomization to the first observation of disease progression or date of death (whichever occurs earlier). Progression-free survival time will be censored at the time of the most recent information for patients who are still alive at the time of the last visit.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Number of Participants Who Experienced Adverse Events (AE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Safety was assessed by standard clinical and laboratory tests. Adverse events grade were defined by the NCI CTCAE v2.0.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Tumor response will be assessed using RECIST criteria. The best response across all treatment will be recorded. ORR is defined as the percentage of patients with a complete or partial response out of the patients who had measurable disease at baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Response Duration (RD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>RD is defined as the time from the date when the measurement criteria are met for complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) (whichever status is recorded first) until the date of first observation of disease progression or death occurred. For responding patients not known to have died as of the data cut-off date and who do not have progression, duration of response will be censored at the date of last visit with adequate assessment. For responding patients who receive subsequent anticancer therapy (after discontinuation from the study treatment) prior to progression, duration of response will be censored at the date of last visit with adequate assessment prior to the initiation of post-discontinuation anticancer therapy.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>OS was defined as the time elapsed from first treatment until death from any cause.</description>
