      Growth failure associated with primary IGF-1 deficiency (IGFD). Primary IGFD is a term that
      has been used to describe patients with intrinsic cellular defects in growth hormone (GH)
      action. In this protocol, primary IGFD is defined as short stature (&lt;-2 standard deviations
      [SDs] below the mean for age and gender), and abnormal serum IGF-1 (&lt;-2 SDs below the mean
      for age and gender).

      The trial is an open-label, concentration-controlled trial conducted at up to 20 centers
      throughout the United States.

    <measure>Height Velocity From Pretreatment (Week 0) to Week 34</measure>
    <time_frame>Pretreatment to Week 34</time_frame>
    <description>Height was measured standing without shoes as the average of three measurements by the same observer using identical technique with a Harpenden or other wall mounted stadiometer. The subject was repositioned between each measurement. Height velocity during an interval of time is defined as the change in height during the time interval divided by the duration of the time interval. Missing Week 34 heights were imputed using the last height SD score carried forward.</description>

    <measure>Change in Height SD Score From Pretreatment to Week 34</measure>
    <time_frame>Pretreatment and Week 34</time_frame>
    <description>Height was measured standing without shoes as the average of three measurements by the same observer using identical technique with a Harpenden or other wall mounted stadiometer. The subject was repositioned between each measurement. The SD score is calculated as the subject value minus the mean divided by the standard deviation. The mean and the standard deviation vary depending on the age and sex of the child.</description>

The subject was repositioned between each measurement. Height velocity during an interval of time is defined as the change in height during the time interval divided by the duration of the time interval.

Height velocity during an interval of time is defined as the change in height during the time interval divided by the duration of the time interval.
