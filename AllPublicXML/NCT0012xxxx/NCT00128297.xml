      The study objective is to evaluate the differences, in terms of first occurrence of a
      skeletal event, in patients with breast cancer and symptomatic bone metastases, when
      pamidronate is administered during 2 years, or when it is administered during 6 months,
      followed by a six month rest period, and again a 6 month treatment period.

      Background: Pamidronate (PMT) is effective in reducing skeletal related events (SRE) in
      breast cancer (BC) patients with bone metastasis (BM). Its best way of administration and
      optimum treatment duration are still to be determined.

      Objective: evaluate the efficacy of continuous administration (arm A) vs. alternate
      administration (arm B) of PMT to delay time to first SRE in BC pt presenting with symptomatic
      BM.

      Methods: patients aged &gt;18, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≥ 2,
      adequate renal function, and BC symptomatic BM were eligible. BM was defined as presence of 3
      or more hot spots (HS) in skeletal scintigraphy (SS), or any number of HS in SS if
      osteolytic, osteoblastic or mixed bone lesions determined by radiography, or 2 or less HS in
      SS if magnetic resonance or CT scan confirmation of BM. Symptomatic BM was defined as pain
      associated to SS HS, or SRE (pathological fractures or spine cord compression or radiation
      bone treatment or tumour induced hypercalcemia), or treatment with analgesia due to bone
      pain. Patients were allowed up to 1 previous chemotherapy and 2 previous hormone therapy
      lines for metastatic disease. Antineoplastic therapy could be changed at any time during the
      study. Eligible patients were stratified (isolated bone metastasis or associated to node or
      skin lesions vs. bone metastasis associated to visceral disease) and randomized to receive 2
      hour-iv. PMT 90 mg every 3-4 weeks for 18 months (arm A) or iv. PMT 90 mg every 3-4 weeks for
      6 months, followed by a 6 months rest, and a new 6 months on-treatment period (arm B).
      Quality of Life (QoL) was measured with short form (SF)-36 questionnaire.

    <description>Quality of Life (QoL) was measured with Short Form (SF)-36 questionnaire, which is a 36 item, patient-reported survey of patient health. The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score, the more disability, and the higher the score the less disability (a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability). The eight sections are vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning and mental health. It will be completed since baseline visit and during all treatment period delivered to the patient before the start of each visit.</description>
