      The purpose of this study is to determine whether NK012 is safe and effective in the
      treatment of refractory solid tumors

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I dose-escalation study of the intravenous administration of NK012 in
      patients with refractory solid tumors. Patients will receive NK012 as an intravenous infusion
      over 30 minutes on Day 1 followed by a 20-day observation period for a total of 21 days (3
      weeks) per cycle. Two patient populations will be evaluated separately: patients with
      UGT1A1*28 genotype homozygous wild type (wt/wt) and heterozygous (wt/*28) variants as one
      group, and patients with UGT1A1*28 homozygous variant (*28/*28) as another group.

    <description>This is a Phase I dose-escalation study of the intravenous administration of NK012 in patients with refractory solid tumors. Patients will receive NK012 as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes on Day 1 followed by a 20-day observation period for a total of 21 days (3 weeks) per cycle. Two patient populations will be evaluated separately: patients with UGT1A1*28 genotype homozygous wild type (wt/wt) and heterozygous (wt/*28) variants as one group, and patients with UGT1A1*28 homozygous variant (*28/*28) as another group. Dose-escalation in each patient population will proceed according to the predefined dose level.
For UGT1A1*28 (wt/wt and wt/*28) patients, at least 3 evaluable patients will be treated at each dose level.
UGT1A1 homozygous (*28/*28) patients will be treated at 50% of the current dose level.
Patients will receive up to 6 cycles of NK012, unless they experience unacceptable toxicity or disease progression, requiring withdrawal from the study.</description>

             week

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical composition

             infection, unstable angina pectoris or psychiatric illness/social situations that
             would limit compliance with study requirements
