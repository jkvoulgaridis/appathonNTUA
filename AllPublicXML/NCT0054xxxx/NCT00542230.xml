      This study will collect representative blood samples from healthy children and adults and
      from children and adults who have unique red blood cell features that are related to sickle
      cell disease. Sickle cell disease is a blood disease that limits the ability of red blood
      cells to carry oxygen throughout the body. The purpose of the study is to collect a variety
      of blood samples that may then be used to investigate advances and potential new drug
      treatments for sickle cell disease.

      Volunteers must be at least 8 years of old. Samples will be taken both from healthy
      volunteers and from volunteers who have unique red blood cell features that are related to
      sickle cell disease. Candidates will be screened with a medical history.

      During the study, participants will undergo a one- to two-hour outpatient procedure at the
      National Institutes of Health Clinical Center. Once researchers have explained the study and
      obtained the participant s consent, participants will donate 8 cc (approximately 2 teaspoons)
      of blood.

      Because repeat testing helps researchers validate study findings, participants who have the
      unique red blood cell features mentioned above may also be asked if they are willing to
      return and donate another 2 cc to 8 cc of blood for additional studies. The amount of blood
      drawn will not exceed 50 ml with any eight-week period for adults or 7 cc within any six-week
      period for children.

    <textblock>
      The critical event leading to serious morbidity in sickle cell disease is polymerization of
      the abnormal hemoglobin to form fibers that stiffen and distort red blood cells and
      consequently, cause vaso-occlusion in the small vessels of the tissues. Currently,
      hydroxyurea is the only approved drug for treating sickle cell disease, but is only partially
      effective. This protocol seeks to identify by high sensitivity in vitro screening methods
      additional compounds that inhibit sickling. Subjects with sickle cell trait or disease and
      normal volunteers will be asked to donate blood samples for studies to verify their
      hemoglobinopathies and then periodically donate small volume samples of fresh blood for use
      in ongoing high throughput screening tests to identify potentially clinically useful
      anti-sickling drugs.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Patients with sickle cell trait

          -  Patients with known hemoglobinopathies involving one or two genes for sickle
             hemoglobin

          -  Healthy volunteers for control experiments

          -  Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding are eligible to enroll in this protocol.

               -  A pregnant or breastfeeding woman will not be enrolled of the donation of
                  research bloos samples poses any clinical risk.

               -  No pregnant minors will be enrolled.

          -  Age range: Minors greater than or equal to 8 years of age and adults greater than or
             equal to 18 years of age

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Subjects who are unable to comprehend the investigational nature of the laboratory
             research are ineligible to enroll in this protocol.

          -  As a safety precaution in handling the blood samples, patients with HIV, Hepatitis B
             or Hepatitis C will be excluded from the study. HIV, Hepatitis B or Hepatitits C
             testing will not be done under this study. Participants must be co-enrolled under
             another NIH protocol where the screening evaluation has been performed.
