  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes is a growing epidemic within the United States that disproportionately affects
      economically disadvantaged communities like East Harlem. As diabetic patients are at very
      high risk for heart disease, experts recommend an aggressive approach towards using statins
      in people with diabetes. However, statins and other helpful drugs are only effective if
      patients decide to take them. Adherence to this medication is notoriously poor and is
      aggravated by its required life-long use. This study is designed to test the effectiveness of
      a new decision aid in helping diverse, inner-city patients with diabetes understand the risks
      and benefits in taking statins and whether this enhanced decision making process improves
      their adherence to the medication.

      To compare the efficacy of usual consultations with or without the decision aid STATIN CHOICE
      in type 2 diabetic patients using or considering using statins to lower CV risk in terms of
      statin use, adherence, knowledge, beliefs and decisional conflict. The study team's primary
      hypothesis is that 3 months after the index discussion, significantly more patients
      randomized to STATIN CHOICE are using statins, are adherent to statins, are knowledgeable
      about the statin choice, and are satisfied with their decision than patients randomized to
      usual care consultation, and that these benefits will be achieved without deterioration in
      quality of life.
