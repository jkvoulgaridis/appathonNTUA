          <description>AE is untoward medical occurrence in clinical investigation participant administered product or medical device;event need not necessarily had causal relationship with treatment or usage.Treatment-emergent are events between first dose of study drug and up to 28 days after last dose of study drug (up to 25 months)that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state.AEs were classified into following on basis of severity:1)mild = did not interfere with participant's usual function;2)moderate=interfered to some extent with participant's usual function;3)severe=interfered significantly with participant's usual function;4)life threatening=AE required discontinuation of study drug,participant was at immediate risk of death.All participants in study received AF-CC.AEs were not collected separately for each intervention for participants.All participants were properly combined for analysis,regardless of regimen were following at time,regardless of OD or RP cohort.</description>
