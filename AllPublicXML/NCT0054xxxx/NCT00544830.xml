    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well hormone therapy and intensity-modulated radiation
      therapy work in treating patients with prostate cancer that has spread to other places in the
      body. Androgens can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. Anti-hormone therapy using
      goserelin, leuprolide acetate, or bicalutamide, may lessen the amount of androgens made by
      the body. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors.
      Specialized radiation therapy that delivers a high dose of radiation directly to the tumor
      may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue. Giving hormone therapy and
      intensity-modulated radiation therapy may work better in treating patients with prostate
      cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the time to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) relapse in patients with
      oligometastatic (=&lt; 5 lesions) hormone-sensitive prostate cancer treated with 36 weeks of
      androgen deprivation therapy and localized radiotherapy to all known tumor sites.

      II. To assess the prostate-specific-antigen (PSA) and objective response rate to treatment
      with 36 weeks of androgen deprivation and localized radiotherapy in patients with
      oligometastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.

      III. To assess the toxicity of 36 weeks of androgen deprivation and localized radiation
      therapy to oligometastases in patients with oligometastatic hormone-sensitive prostate
      cancer.

      IV. In appropriate situations evaluate the feasibility and toxicities of using helical
      tomotherapy image-guided intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) to treat
      oligometastatic sites.

      V. Long term followup of patients: PSA, local control of stage IV disease, progression-free
      survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), site and number of new metastases, systemic
      treatments, long term toxicity.

      OUTLINE:

      ANDROGEN DEPRIVATION THERAPY (ADT): Patients not currently on ADT receive goserelin acetate
      subcutaneously (SC) or leuprolide acetate via injection once every 4 or 12 weeks and
      bicalutamide orally (PO) once daily (QD). Treatment repeats every 12 weeks for up to 3
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients already
      receiving ADT at the time of enrollment continue treatment until they have received 36 weeks
      of therapy.

      RADIATION THERAPY: Patients achieving PSA normalization after initiation of androgen
      deprivation therapy undergo intensity-modulated radiation therapy daily for 2-7 weeks during
      or after completion of androgen deprivation therapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 4 weeks for 2 years, then
      every 3 months after year 2, and then every 6 months thereafter.
