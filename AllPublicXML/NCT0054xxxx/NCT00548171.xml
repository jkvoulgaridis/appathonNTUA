  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of repeating dTpa booster in
      adults 10 years after previous booster vaccination with dTpa in a previous clinical study
      (NCT01267058). Only subjects who received the booster vaccination in a previous clinical
      study are eligible for participation in this study. The Protocol Posting has been updated in
      order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep 2007.

      No new recruitment will be performed in this booster phase (see inclusion criteria).

        <title>Number of Subjects With Any Unsolicited Adverse Events (AEs)</title>
        <description>An unsolicited AE covers any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product and reported in addition to those solicited during the clinical study and any solicited symptom with onset outside the specified period of follow-up for solicited symptoms. Any was defined as the occurrence of any unsolicited AE regardless of intensity grade or relation to vaccination.
