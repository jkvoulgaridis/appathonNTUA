  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial studies widefield fluorescence and reflectance imaging, fluorescence
      spectroscopy, and tissue samples in regularly examining (monitoring) participants at risk for
      developing oral cancer. All tissue and cells are made of tiny particles. Some of these
      particles give off small amounts of light. This light is called fluorescence. Fluorescent
      imaging use instruments that shine different wavelengths (colors) of light in the mouth
      taking fluorescence pictures through a portable head light or by taking fluorescent and
      reflectance pictures through a dental microscope using a digital camera. Fluorescent
      spectroscopy uses a small probe placed gently against the lining of the mouth and the tissue
      is exposed to small amounts of fluorescent light that is then collected with a special camera
      and a computer to be analyzed. Checking mouth tissue samples under a microscope may also help
      detect abnormal cells. Diagnostic procedures, such as fluorescence and reflectance imaging,
      fluorescence spectroscopy imaging, and tissue samples, may help doctors detect pre-cancer or
      early cancer when it may be easier to treat.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare images of oral mucosa, obtained at various wavelength combinations including
      350 nm, 380 nm, 400 nm, and 450 nm excitation, to standard white light images, pathologic
      analysis of any biopsied tissue when available, and carcinogenic progression.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants' oral cavities are inspected by a clinician using a standard white light
      headlamp. Participants then undergo oral mucosa examination using wide-field reflectance and
      fluorescence imaging, and/or fluorescence spectroscopy imaging. Standard oral brush biopsies
      are also performed and examined microscopically. Participants may undergo repeated imaging
      procedures and biopsy during subsequent follow up visits.

    <description>Oral mucosa obtained at various wavelength combinations including 350 nm, 380 nm, 400 nm, and 450 nm excitation will be compared to standard white light images, pathologic analysis of any biopsied tissue when available, and carcinogenic progression. Diagnostic methods will be compared with each other by forming 2x2 tables and computing the chi-square statistics for the McNemar test. Kappa statistic will also be calculated for comparing the chance corrected agreement between various diagnostic methods.</description>
