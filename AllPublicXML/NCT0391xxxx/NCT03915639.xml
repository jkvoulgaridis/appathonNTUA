  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postcraniotomy headache (PCH) has been underestimated for the past decades. However, current
      treatments for PCH are either considered insufficient or accompanied by severe side-effects.
      Some studies revealed that peri-incisional injection of a mixed cocktail that contains
      ropivacaine, epinephrine, ketorolac, and methylprednisolone showed significant efficacy in
      relieving postoperative pain after total hip or knee arthroplasty. Previous literature
      reported that the cause of PCH was related to incision of the scalp and dura, which is
      considered similar to causes to postoperative pain after total hip or knee arthroplasty.
      Thus, investigators suppose that the cocktail mixture can better relieve PCH in adults.

    <description>Numeric Rating Score is a common used scale in evaluating patients' pain intensity in clinical trials.

    <description>Post-operative opioid-related side effects include post-operative opioid-induced oversedation, opioid-induced respiratory depression, pruritus, drowsiness, dizziness, blurred vision, and rash.

    <description>Wound Healing Score worksheet for assessment of outcomes in scalp clip versus artery forceps groups in patients undergoing craniotomy.
The wound healing evaluation is based on skin healing, infection and hair regrowth.
For skin healing, 1 represents fully healed, 2 represents ≤3 cm in total not healed, 3 represents &gt;3 cm not healed, 4 represents areas of necrosis ≤3 cm, and 5 represents areas of necrosis &gt;3 cm.
For infection, 1 represents none, 2 represents ≤0.5-cm margin of redness , 3 represents more redness or superficial pus, 4 represents deep infection.
For hair regrowth, 1 represents even regrowth along wound, 2 represents ≤3 cm not regrowing , 3 represents 3-6 cm not regrowing, 4 represents &gt;6 cm not regrowing.
Excellent wounds, total score of 3; Good wounds, Score 4-5; Suboptimal wounds, Score 6+</description>
