      1. To assess changes in impedance parameters in Idiopathic Inflammatory Myopathies (IIMs).

        2. To assess whether EIM parameters are reflective of disease severity, based on clinical
           outcome measures of IIMs.

      1. To assess changes in impedance parameters in Idiopathic Inflammatory Myopathies (IIMs)
           There are structural and compositional changes in muscles, such as edema, adipose
           infiltration, and/or atrophy, in IIMs. Electrical impedance myography (EIM) is sensitive
           to such changes. EIM parameters will be different when compared to healthy controls in
           IIMs.

        2. To assess whether EIM parameters are reflective of disease severity, based on clinical
           outcome measures of IIMs.

      Clinical outcome measures reflect on disease severity which is an indirect measure of muscle
      involvement in IIMs. If EIM parameters correlate with clinical outcome measure, it would
      indirectly prove that EIM can reflect disease severity in IIMs

    <measure>Manual Muscle Testing Score</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>This scale reflects on muscle strength. It is based on Medical Research Council scale for muscle power, where muscle strength can have a score of 0-5 (0 means no strength and 5 means full strength).Several muscles are examined in Manual Muscle Testing (MMT) and the total strength is reported as the sum of the Medical Research Council (MRC) muscles scale score of each muscles. Total MMT score for this study can range from 0-160, where 0 means no strength in any muscles and 160 means full strength in all the muscles examined.</description>

    <measure>IBM-Functional rating scale (IBM-FRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>This scale measure the limitations in daily life from IBM. It ask 10 questions regarding the activities of daily life and each question is scored between 0-4 (Where 4 means no difficulty and 0 means maximum difficulty). Total score can vary from 0-40, and 40 means no limitations in daily life from IBM.</description>

    <measure>Get up and go test</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Time will be measured for a participant to stand up from a chair (using arms if necessary), walk 3 meters, turn around, return to the chair, and sit down. The better of two trials will be used.</description>

    <measure>Six minute walk</measure>

    <measure>Quality of Health and Well Being</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Short Form-36 (SF-36) is a measure of the global quality of health and well-being. The SF-36 is an eight-scaled score, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their corresponding section. Each scale can be transformed into a 0-100 scale. Lower score means more disability.
SF-36 will be scored utilizing a standardized scoring manual. We will obtain a physical component summary scale and a mental component summary scale.</description>

    <measure>Myositis Intention to Treat Activities Index (MITAX)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>MITAX is a scale assessing the extra-muscular disease severity of myositis. It contains 24 questions covering 7 extra muscular organ systems. Each question is scored between 0-4, where 0 = not present, 1= improving, 2= same, 3= worse, and 4= new. This score is then converted to a final score ranging from A-E for each system based on a predefined scoring schema. Total MITAX score can range between 0 to 54.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Physician Global Assessment Score</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>This is recorded on a 10-cm visual analog scale (VAS) by the physician at the time of evaluation. The score should reflect on the individual's appearance, medical history, physical examination, laboratory testing, and prescribed medical therapy. In this scale 0 means no evidence of disease related damage and 10 means extremely severe damage.</description>
