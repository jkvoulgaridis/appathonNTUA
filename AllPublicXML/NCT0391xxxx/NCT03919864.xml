    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate a technology-based intervention, Caregiver
      Oncology Needs Evaluation Tool (CONNECT), which may increase lung cancer caregivers'
      knowledge about the benefits of supportive care resources, identify their unmet needs, and
      connect them with supportive care resources. The investigators will also determine their
      ability to recruit and keep patients and caregivers in the study.

      The long-term goal of this program of research is to improve supportive care delivery and
      lung cancer caregiver and patient well-being through a caregiver delivered intervention,
      Caregiver Oncology Needs Evaluation Tool (CONNECT). The investigators propose to evaluate a
      novel technology-based intervention, CONNECT, informed by theory with input from an advisory
      panel including a lung cancer caregiver and stakeholders. The purpose of CONNECT is to
      empower and educate caregivers about the benefits of supportive care resources and to
      systematically identify unmet needs and connect lung cancer caregivers with tailored
      supportive care resources. CONNECT is designed to be low cost and to capture the various
      resources offered in different oncology environments to support future adaptation and
      dissemination for heterogeneous healthcare settings.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        For Caregivers:

          -  Caregivers must be providing some capacity of informal (unpaid) care for a patient
             meeting patient eligibility criteria. If a patient unexpectedly becomes deceased
             during the study period, caregivers will be allowed to continue participation in the
             assigned study arm and complete study assessments if they wish to.

          -  Caregivers must be &gt; 18 years of age, as this study is focused on the experience of
             adult patient-caregiver dyads.

        For Patients:

          -  Patients must have a current diagnosis of limited stage small cell or stage 1-4
             nonsmall cell lung cancer.

          -  Patients must be currently receiving or planning to receive treatment for their cancer
             at the time of enrollment. For patients receiving surgery, the eligibility timeframe
             will include 6 weeks following the date of surgery to account for the acute recovery
             period.

          -  Patients must be ambulatory and up more than 50% of waking hours, as measured by an
             ECOG Performance Status rating of level 0, 1, or 2.

          -  Patients must be &gt; 18 years of age, as this study is focused on the experience of
             adult patient-caregiver dyads.

          -  Patients must be receiving some capacity of informal care from a caregiver meeting the
             above criteria. If the caregiver unexpectedly becomes deceased during the study
             period, the patient will be un-enrolled from this study as we are evaluating a
             caregiver-only delivered intervention.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        For Caregivers:

        • Caregivers cannot read/ communicate in English.

        For Patients:

          -  Patients who are post-treatment survivors at the time of study enrollment. For
             patients receiving surgery only, this includes the period beyond acute recovery (i.e.
             ≥ 7 weeks post-surgery).

          -  Caregivers cannot read/ communicate in English.

        Eligibility to participate in the study is conditional on participation of both the
        caregiver and patient.
