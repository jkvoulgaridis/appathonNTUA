      This is a two-part (dose-escalation, dose-expansion), multicenter, open-label Phase 1 study
      of KHK2455 in combination with avelumab in adult subjects with locally advanced or metastatic
      urothelial carcinoma (including bladder, urethra, ureters, and renal pelvis). Subjects will
      be screened for entry into this study after signing informed consent. Subjects must meet
      inclusion/exclusion criteria to participate in this study.

        -  Part 1 (dose-escalation phase) has has a 3+3 design that will evaluate the safety and
           tolerability and identify the MTD or highest protocol-defined dose, in the absence of
           exceeding the MTD.

        -  Part 2 (cohort-expansion phase) will further explore the safety, pharmacokinetics,
           pharmacodynamics, and anti-tumor activity for the combination regimen at the MTD or
           highest dose level tested.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects may be male or female and must be â‰¥ 18 years of age; have an ECOG PS of 0 or

          -  Subjects are able to understand and willing to sign the ICF, according to
             institutional standards, prior to the initiation of any study related procedures

          -  Subjects must have histological or cytological evidence of metastatic or advanced
             urothelial carcinoma (including bladder, urethra, ureters, and renal pelvis that has
             predominantly transitional cell or urothelial features); and have measurable
             neoplastic disease according to RECIST v1.1 criteria

          -  Subjects must have been previously treated with a platinum-based therapy and
             progressed during or within 12 months of treatment; and be checkpoint-inhibitor naive
             (not treated with agents targeting PD-1, PD-L1 or CTLA-4)

          -  Subjects must have a tumor accessible for fresh biopsy at the baseline visit and for
             subsequent biopsies during the study for IDO assessment. Archived tissue from previous
             biopsies (formalin fixed-paraffin embedded [FFPE] block of &lt;12 months) are permitted
             for PD-L1 analysis

          -  Subjects must be able to swallow the solid (encapsulated) dosage form of KHK2455

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who have been previously treated with avelumab or any IDO1 inhibitor or
             CTLA-4, PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors; or any investigational immunotherapy
             including but not limited to anti-cancer vaccines or oncotropic viruses

          -  Subjects with prior or current liver metastases;

          -  Subjects with a history of organ transplant or allogeneic bone marrow transplant;

          -  Subjects with pre-existing uveitis or other known clinically meaningful retinal
