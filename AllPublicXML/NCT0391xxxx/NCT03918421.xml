  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is no international consensus regarding how to assess and treat patients with
      immunoglobulin M (IgM)-anti-myelin-associated-glycoprotein (MAG) monoclonal gammopathy
      associated peripheral neuropathy. The purpose of the IMAGiNe study-Lyon is to prospectively
      collect standardized clinical data of 25 patients with IgM-anti-MAG monoclonal gammopathy
      associated peripheral neuropathy in order to participate in the international IMAGiNe Study.

      The main objective is to describe in detail the various clinical subtypes, clinical course,
      treatment responses, antibody titers of IgM-anti-MAG monoclonal gammopathy associated
      peripheral neuropathy using a variety of outcome measures. The obtained observational data
      will allow the construction of an IgM monoclonal gammopathy associated peripheral
      neuropathy-specific Rasch-built overall Disability Scale (RODS) that should fulfill all
      modern clinimetric requirements, including cross-cultural validity. The coordinating centers
      for the IgM-RODS construction will be the Maastricht University Medical Center and University
      Medical Center Utrecht, both in the Netherlands.

    <description>Preliminary Immunogloblin M (IgM)-Rasch-built Overall Disability Scale (RODS), and after its construction the finalized IgM-RODS. Rasch-built overall Disability Scale (RODS) is a disease-specific, patient-based, linearly weighted scale that captures activity and social participation limitations to detect activity limitations in patients with Immunogloblin M (IgM) anti-myelin-associated-glycoprotein peripheral neuropathy. For this study, the preliminary RODS is a 146 item patient-reported outcome instrument that assesses activity and social participation limitation. Rasch Measurement Methods examine the extent observed data (patients' actual responses to scale items) accord with predictions of those responses from a mathematical model.</description>
