    <textblock>
      This a Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial comparing two techniques for the nonsurgical
      treatment of peri-implant mucositis. The main objective of the present randomized controlled
      clinical trial is to determine whether the application of a novel treatment strategy for
      peri-implant mucositis could lead to significantly improved clinical parameters as compared
      to standard treatment. Half of the patients receives treatment with manual instruments and
      chlorhexidine gel 1%, half receives treatment with submucosal biofilm removal by erythritol
      powder.
