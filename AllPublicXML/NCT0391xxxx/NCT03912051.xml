  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Between 10 and 12% of the general population suffers from epistaxis, out of which 10% would
      need to be medically managed. Most of patients treated for epistaxis are managed through
      emergency departments. The involvement of the ENT (ear, nose and throat) surgeon might be
      required in more complex situations in order to control bleeding.

      Usually, nasal packing packing is used as a first line option after failure of digital
      compression. Epistaxis balloons are often used after failure of nasal packing Balloons are
      effective in approximately 60% of the patients with a rapid control of bleeding by
      compression followed by an absence of rebreeding after balloon removal.

      The main challenges for patients treated with this device are i) pain upon balloon
      introduction and inflation ii) discomfort upon introduction in the nasal cavity as well as
      during balloon maintenance during 24 to 72 hours of tamponade iii) blood retention between
      distal and proximal balloons that favors infection iv) limited breathing capabilities through
      the nostrils which increases general discomfort v) negative aesthetic impact for the patient
      vi) septal and alar necrosis risk in case of prolonged compression.

      Moreover, epistaxis leading to an hospitalization between 24 to 48h are not rare (&gt;11 000 in
      France in 2017 according to ATIH). Those hospitalizations are often decided in order to
      ensure an optimal patient monitoring following packing or epistaxis balloon placement.

      In order to address those adverse events while keeping the same efficacy and avoiding
      hospitalizations or reducing their duration, the use of an asymmetric, more physiological,
      easy to use and mainly intranasal (discreet proximal extremity) is studied.
