  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most frequent tumor in Western women. In Spain about 26,000 new breast
      cancers are diagnosed each year. This type of tumor is increasing worldwide with an increase
      in aggressive neoplasms in young women. There are some risk factors responsible for this
      global increase: lifestyle, diet and body weight especially in postmenopausal women.

      Some cell mutations, especially in the BRCA1, BRCA2 and p53 genes, are associated with a very
      high risk of this type of cancer. Some authors have calculated the contribution of various
      modifiable risk factors to the global burden of breast cancer, and they concluded that 21% of
      all breast cancer deaths are attributable to alcohol consumption, overweight and obesity, and
      lack of physical activity. Nowadays, there aren't specific studies in the Community of Madrid
      designed to know the risk factors related to breast cancer.

      For this reason, it is proposed to carry out an observational study that collects detailed
      information about dietary habits, genetic factors and life quality of a group of women with
      recent diagnosis in pre or post-surgical phase.

      1. Storage of biological sample at the Hospital.

        2. Patient's breast pathology characteristics.

        3. Study of concomitant pathologies.

        4. Dietary study: &quot;Frequency of Food Consumption&quot; questionnaire referring to the last year
           eating habits before having been breast cancer diagnosed.

        5. Physical activity study in the year prior to the diagnosis of breast cancer.

        6. Anthropometric study: weight, size, waist circumference and body composition (% Fat
           mass,% Lean mass,% Body water).

        7. Study of other risk factors of breast cancer: age, family history, reproductive history,
           medications consumed...

        8. Biochemical study: biochemical variables of the last blood analysis performed on the
           volunteer in the hospital center.

        9. Saliva collection to proceed with the genetic analysis.

       10. Collection of stool sample to carry out the microbiota study.
