      This study is a single-arm, open-label, phase 1/2 trial to determine the recommended phase 2
      dose of neratinib and sodium valproate when given in combination to patients with advanced
      solid tumors in 28 day cycles. The phase II portion of the study will evaluate the
      combination at the RP2D in 3 cohorts of RAS mutated tumors, KRAS mutant colorectal cancer,
      KRAS mutant pancreatic cancer, and K or N RAS mutant solid tumors.
