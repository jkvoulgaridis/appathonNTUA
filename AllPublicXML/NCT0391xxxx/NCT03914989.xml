      This study evaluates the efficacy of multi-odorant enrichment on cognitive skills, olfactory
      function, and quality of life.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore sensory stimulation as a potential means of enhancing
      cognitive abilities. In mice, multi-odorant enrichment has been shown to increase
      neurogenesis in a critical memory pathway and thereby improve memory. In this clinical study,
      we will determine if a nightly sensory enrichment regimen using scents for 6 months can
      improve cognitive skills, as measured using a series of cognitive assessments and brain
      imaging in older adults. We also will determine if mood/mental state of mind or olfactory
      functioning improve following scent stimulation.

      This study will enroll approximately 200 participants. Of the 200 participants in the study,
      50 individuals, who are interested in participating, will have a functional Magnetic
      Resonance Imaging (fMRI) scan at the beginning and end of the study, which will be used to
      examine changes in the brain.

      Participants will undergo cognitive assessments, computerized cognitive assessments, and
      olfactory function assessments. They will be randomly assigned to either an experimental or
      an active control group, and will be exposed to either a higher or lower concentration of
      essential oils nightly using a nebulizing fragrance diffuser, rotating through seven
      different scents, one per night. The exposures will continue for 6 months, after which the
      participants will return and undergo the same assessments conducted at the beginning of the
      study.
