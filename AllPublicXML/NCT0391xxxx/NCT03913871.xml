  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to test the feasibility and effectiveness of a mobile
      phone-based text messaging intervention to change the attitudes and eating behaviors of
      African American women residing in New Orleans, LA.

      Design: The proposed study is a pre/post-test design where up to 60 female adult
      black/African Americans in Orleans and Jefferson Parish, Louisiana will be recruited to
      participated (Intervention, n=30; control n=30). If a woman is interested in participating,
      she will be asked to complete an evaluation/screen to determine if they are eligible for the
      study and asked to consent to participate. If a woman consents to participate they will be
      randomized to one of 2 groups:

        1. Intervention group: Text messages to promote healthy eating: In this group, participants
           will receive personalized text messages to encourage healthy eating, specifically to
           increase consumption of fruits, vegetables and water; and a reduction in sugar sweetened
           beverages. They will receive some messages that will ask for a reply. They will receive
           an average of 1-2 messages per day for 4 weeks.

        2. Control group: Control group participants will receive non-nutrition-related physical
           activity and general health/wellbeing text message. They will receive the text messages
           an average of 1-2 messages per day for 4 weeks

      All participants will be asked to do the following tests that are not used to determine
      eligibility: Complete questionnaires about their background, nutrition habits, physical
      activity habits, health history, beliefs and opinions about health and habits. Data will be
      analyzed by comparing assessment outcomes within and across study arms (i.e., intervention,
      control).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Fruit and vegetable intake</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in fruit and vegetable intake from baseline to 4 weeks as measured by self-report via the NCI Fruit and Vegetable Intake Screener (from the Eating at America's Table Study). Scale Range: Frequency of intake (fruit, vegetable) - Never (minimum) to 5+ times per day (maximum); and Portion of fruit or vegetable (cup equivalents based on dietary guidelines). To score, 1) express each reported frequency as a daily average by standardizing the midpoint of each frequency category to the number of times per day; 2) assign fruit and vegetable servings from dietary guidelines to each portion size category; and 3) compute the average daily fruit and vegetable servings for each food group by multiplying the average daily frequency (from #1) by the number of servings for the portion size (as determined in #2). To estimate the total daily number of servings, sum across all food groups (i.e., fruit and vegetable subgroups).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Beverage intake</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in beverage intake intake from baseline to 4 weeks as measured by self-report via the (Beverage Intake Questionnaire-15 (BEVQ-15). Scale Range: Frequency of intake (of beverage option) - Never (minimum) to 3+ times per day (maximum); Consumption (of each beverage option)- Less than 6 fl. oz. (minimum) to more than 20 fl. oz (maximum). To score the instrument, frequency (&quot;How often&quot;) is converted to the unit of times per day, then multiplied by the amount consumed (&quot;How much each time&quot;) to provide average daily beverage consumption in fl oz. To quantify total SSB consumption, beverage categories containing added sugars were summed (sweetened juice beverages/drinks, regular soft drinks, sweet tea, sweetened coffee, energy drinks, mixed alcoholic drinks, meal replacement beverages).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-efficacy to improve fruit and vegetable intake</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Self-efficacy for eating fruit and vegetables as measured by self report via the Self-efficacy for fruit and vegetable survey titled Fruits and Vegetables: Pros and Cons (Norman et al., 2010). The 6-item scale is scored from Not Important (minimum) to Extremely Important (maximum). Higher scores (summed) on this scale indicated higher frequency of using change strategies for healthy eating.</description>
