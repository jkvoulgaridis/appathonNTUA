  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will assess the impact of a hearing aid self-management intervention in first time
      hearing aid users compared to standard hearing aid self-management. Namely, the C2Hear
      multimedia videos, or Reusable Learning Objects (RLOs) will be used as the self-management
      intervention. A departmental hearing aid booklet (standard clinical care) will be used as the
      control intervention.

      The study will determine the role of these RLOs in self-efficacy for hearing aid(s), hearing
      aid knowledge and readiness for action compared with standard hearing aid self-management
      education (hearing aid booklet) in groups of first time hearing aid users. Both groups will
      receive the education at the earliest audiology appointment (hearing assessment), helping to
      distinguish any impact of earlier education delivery.

      Research question: To assess the role of interactive hearing aid self-management education on
      self-efficacy for hearing aid(s), readiness for action and hearing aid knowledge in first
      time hearing aid users.

      Objectives:

      Primary research question:

      - Does the early delivery of interactive hearing aid self-management education improve
      self-efficacy for hearing aid(s) compared with standard care in first-time hearing aid users?

      Secondary research questions:

      i. Does the early delivery of interactive hearing aid self-management education improve
      readiness for hearing aids (their chosen intervention) compared with standard care in
      first-time hearing aid users?

      ii. Does the early delivery of interactive hearing aid education improve hearing aid
      knowledge compared with standard care in first-time hearing aid users?

      Study design:

      A single centre, prospective study with two randomised arms; intervention group (access to
      RLOs in DVD/ or online format, patients' preference) and control (standard hearing aid
      education booklet).

      Prospective first-time hearing aid users will be invited to take part in the study at hearing
      assessment, where they will be randomised to either the control or intervention group.
      Following 6-8 weeks of independent use prior to receiving hearing aids, study investigators
      will assess the impact of each education type on individuals self-efficacy for hearing aids,
      readiness for action and hearing aid knowledge.

      Comparisons will be made to previous evaluation of the RLOs to allow exploration of the
      impact of earlier hearing aid self-management education on self-report measures.

    <description>Self-reported self-efficacy for hearing aid(s) measured across four-subscales (Basic/advanced handling, adjustment to hearing aids and aided listening). Participants rank confidence in the tasks/behaviours described using an 11-point scale (0%=cannot do this, to 100%=certain I can do this).</description>

    <description>Self-report hearing aid self-efficacy (Ida Line Tool Question 2) determines participants perceived confidence in their ability to use hearing aid(s) using an 11-point visual analogue scale (0 = not at all confident, to 10= very much confident).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hearing Aid and Communication Knowledge (HACK: Ferguson et al., 2015)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A 20-item open-ended questionnaire that measures free recall of hearing aid knowledge relevant to practical (n = 12) and psychosocial (n = 8) issues on hearing aids and communication. One point is allocated to each correct response, resulting in a percentage correct for each score. Maximum correct scores are 54; 32 points for practical subscale and 22 points for psychosocial subscale. Higher percentage values represent better knowledge.</description>
