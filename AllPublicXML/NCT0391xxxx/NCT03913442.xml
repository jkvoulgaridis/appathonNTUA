  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized trial will enroll 120 SKOA
      subjects at the NYU Center for Musculoskeletal Care. Patients meeting entry criteria will be
      randomized 1:1 to treatment with colchicine or placebo daily for 3 months. Subjects will have
      detailed evaluation of standardized clinical pain outcomes, candidate peripheral blood
      biomarkers, baseline knee radiographs as well as MSK-US, and a subset will undergo evaluation
      of their synovial fluid.

    <measure>Difference in mean changes of VAS pain scores between treatment groups</measure>
    <time_frame>3 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The VAS scale asks patients to rate the pain that they've had in each knee during the past 30 days on a scale of 0-10, where &quot;0&quot; means &quot;No pain&quot; and &quot;10&quot; means &quot;Pain as bad as you can imagine.&quot;</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean changes and absolute differences in the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) for pain</measure>
    <time_frame>3 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The KOOS's five patient-relevant dimensions are scored separately: Pain (nine items); Symptoms (seven items); ADL Function (17 items); Sport and Recreation Function (five items); Quality of Life (four items). A Likert scale is used and all items have five possible answer options scored from 0 (No problems) to 4 (Extreme problems) and each of the five scores is calculated as the sum of the items included.</description>
