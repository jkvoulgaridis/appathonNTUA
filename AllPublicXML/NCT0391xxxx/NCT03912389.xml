  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, multicenter, double-blind placebo-controlled phase 3 study of efficacy
      and safety of BCD-100 in combination with pemetrexed+cisplatin/carboplatin compared to
      placebo in combination with pemetrexed+cisplatin/carboplatin in subjects with previously
      untreated metastatic non-squamous NSCLC. The main hypothesis of the study is that BCD-100 in
      combination with chemotherapy prolongs OS compared to placebo with chemotherapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has voluntarily agreed to participate by giving written informed consent for
             the trial;

          2. Patients ≥ 18 years of age on day of signing informed consent;

          3. Previously untreated patients with histologically-confirmed stage IV (M1a/M1b/M1c-
             AJCC 8th edition) non-squamous NSCLC;

          4. Has not received prior systemic treatment for metastatic NSCLC;

          5. The time from the completion of previous adjuvant/neoadjuvant treatment to metastatic
             disease development is no less than 12 months;

          6. Has a life expectancy of at least 12 weeks;

          7. Has Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1;

          8. Has adequate organ function as defined by hematological laboratory values (absolute
             neutrophil count ≥1.500/mcL, platelets ≥100.000/mcL, hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL ), renal
             laboratory values (serum creatinine or calculated creatinine clearance &lt;1.5xULN or ≥60
             mL/min for subjects with creatinine levels&gt;1.5x institutional ULN), and hepatic
             laboratory values (serum total bilirubin &lt;1.5xULN, AST and ALT ≤2.5xULN, alkaline
             phosphatase &lt;2.5xULN);

          9. Agreement to newly obtained core or excisional biopsy of a tumor lesion not previously
             irradiated for determination of PD-L1 status prior to randomization (if obtaining of
             new sample is contraindicated or puts subject at unacceptable risks, then archival
             tumor tissue sample must be available)

         10. Measurable disease according to CT scan (RECIST 1.1 criteria) , confirmed by the local
             assessment;

         11. For subjects of childbearing potential: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from
             heterosexual inter-course) or use a contraceptive method with a failure rate of &lt; 1%
             per year during the treatment period and for at least 6 months after administration of
             the last dose of study drug; and 6 months after the last dose of platinum-based
             chemotherapy, whichever is later. A woman is considered to be of childbearing
             potential if she is postmenarcheal, has not reached a postmenopausal state (≥ 12
             continuous months of amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause), and
             has not undergone surgical sterilization (removal of ovaries, fallopian tubes, and/or
             uterus). Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year
             include but are not limited to bilateral tubal ligation and/or occlusion, male
             sterilization, and intrauterine devices. The reliability of sexual abstinence should
             be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical study and the preferred and
             usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation,
             symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
             contraception.

          1. Has predominantly squamous cell histology NSCLC; Mixed tumors will be categorized by
             the predominant cell type; if small cell elements are present, the subject is
             ineligible.
