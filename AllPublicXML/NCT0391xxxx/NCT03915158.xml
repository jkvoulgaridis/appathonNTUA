      Bariatric surgery (BS) is the most effective treatment for severe obesity and comorbidities.
      Among varieties of BS techniques, sleeve gastrectomy (SG) has gained in popularity worldwide.
      SG is a procedure involved mainly restriction combined slightly with malabsorption
      (deficiency in intrinsic factors for vitamin B12 absorption). Considering most patients
      usually have more than one micronutrients deficiency prior the surgery, the aggravated
      nutritional status is one of post-surgical concerns. For nutrition management, individualized
      biochemical assessment for micronutrients is highly recommended in guideline, but is seldom
      been implanted. Instead, a routine supplementation for vitamins/minerals for postoperative
      patients is practiced in Taiwan. This study aimed at evaluating the nutritional status of
      vitB1, B2, B12, folate, A, D, E, Ca, Fe, Zn, Cu, and Se prior- and post- (6-Mo) the SG
      operation. Subjects (n=70-100) will be recruited from patients of Body Science &amp; Metabolic
      Disorders, International BMI Medical Center of CMUH. The inclusion criteria are Han Chinese,
      18-65 years old, and BMI&gt;30 who have arranged for SG operation. Written informed consent will
      be obtained from participants. Anthropometric data, blood samples, food (including
      supplements) records and medical history will be collected during the study period. We
      foresee this study may, not only achieve a personalized dietary plan, but also contribute to
      indigenous data regarding micronutrient status of obese patients.
