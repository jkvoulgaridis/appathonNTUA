  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm window of opportunity trial conducted in patients with early stage
      triple negative breast tumors to evaluate if treatment with a Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase
      (PARP) inhibitor will increase expression of programmed cell death-1 with ligand (PD-L1) in
      triple negative breast tumors.

      This is a single arm window of opportunity trial conducted in patients with early stage
      triple negative breast tumors. Patients who are planning to undergo surgery as part of their
      initial treatment will be eligible for this study. They will be treated with single agent
      rucaparib for 3 weeks and then proceed to surgery. Core-biopsies obtained at the time of
      diagnosis and tumor from the surgical resection will be assessed for change in expression of
      PD-L1 by Immunohistochemical assay (IHC).
