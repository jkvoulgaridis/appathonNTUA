  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical trial is to study the feasibility and efficacy of anti-MESO antigen
      receptors (CARs) T cell therapy for relapsed and refractory epithelial ovarian cancer.

      Primary Objectives

      To determine the feasibility ad safety of anti-MESO CAR-T cells in treating patients with
      MESO-positive ovarian cancer.

      Secondary Objectives

      To access the efficacy of anti-MESO CAR-T cells in patients with ovarian cancer.

      To determine in vivo dynamics and persistency of anti- MESO CAR-T cells.
