    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the influence of stress on inflammation and the symptomatology of the
      patient with back pain. Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) will be used in half of
      participants, a validated psychopedagogical intervention for stress reduction, and the
      participants assigned to the control group will follow the usual treatment, according to
      their diagnosis.

    <textblock>
      The Mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR) is a psycho-educational program of stress
      reduction based on mindfulness. It consists of a program of 30 hours of duration divided into
      9 sessions with a weekly frequency of 2.5 h and an intensive session between the week 6 and 7
      of the program with a duration of 7.5 hours. Each week, the theoretical contents that are
      necessary to understand the attention development practices will be covered. In addition,
      basic concepts of the psychobiology and psychology of stress and pain will be explained. The
      subjects will have a homework load of approximately 45 minutes per day during the
      intervention program.
