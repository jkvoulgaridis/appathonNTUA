    <textblock>
      Survival benefit and quality of life are two key elements that should be kept in mind in the
      treatment of metastatic breast cancer. In this regards, endocrine therapy (ET) is strongly
      recommended in hormone receptor (HR) positive patients unless there is visceral crisis even
      though there is no concrete evidence that it is better than chemotherapy in terms of
      survival.

      HER2 positive breast cancer is a subtype of breast cancer that showed the greatest
      improvement in terms of survival during the last decade due to trastuzumab based therapy.
      Recently, taxane and HER2 directed doublet including trastuzumab and pertuzumab (THP) is
      considered as standard of therapy based upon randomized phase 3 clinical trial (CLEOTATRA).

      HER2 positive breast cancer can be divided into HER2 enriched subgroup (HR-HER2+) and luminal
      B subgroup (HR+HER2+) in biologic viewpoint because they are distinctly different subgroups
      in gene expression analysis. Accordingly, we are currently treating biologically different
      subtypes in a same way, which is CTx and anti-HER2 combination therapy (THP).

      Luminal HER2+ subgroup has actually been tested with endocrine therapy (ET) and anti-HER2
      therapy showed better PFS than ET alone (TAnDEM trial and trial comparing lapatinib plus
      letrozole versus letrozole alone) [2],[3] confirming existence of cross talk between ER and
      HER2 pathways in clinical setting. However, the combination regimen between ET and anti-HER2
      therapy is not widely used in current practice in ER+HER2+ MBC patients because PFS seemed to
      be relatively shorter compared with chemotherapy based combination with anti-HER2 therapy
      even though several guidelines recommend it to be used as an initial treatment unless there
      is visceral crisis as they recommended ET alone first in ER+HER2- MBC (NCCN 2018).

      Recently, various CDK4/6 inhibitors including palbociclib, abemaciclib, and ribociclib were
      approved by FDA based on the clinical trial results demonstrating prolonged PFS over ET alone
      when it was combined with ET in ER+ advanced breast cancer [4]. In PALOMA 2 biomarker study,
      it was beneficial regardless of ER and Ki67 expression status.

      Reflecting quite durable PFS prolongation (10 month in PALOMA2) shown in ER+ disease (luminal
      A and luminal B subtype except HR+HER2+ patients) with CDK4/6 inhibitor on top of ET, the
      hypothesis of this trial is whether CDK4/6 inhibitor could prolong survival in luminal HER2
      breast cancer as it did in ER+HER2-patients. In preclinical study, palbociclib showed
      activity in not only ER+ cell lines but also HER2 positive cell lines [5]. Also, in phase Ib
      trial, a CDK4/6 inhibitor from Lilly, abemaciclib showed acceptable toxicity with endocrine
      therapy or trastuzumab with response rate of around 20%.

      Hence, as of today, it could be justified and warranted to conduct a prospective trial of
      ribocicib+letrozole+trastuzumab in order to take a look at its efficacy and toxicity in
      HR+HER2 + advanced breast cancer.

      This trial is performed in a multicenter, single-group, and phases IB and II clinical trial.

      This is a single-group clinical trial of the effects of ribociclib, letrozole and trastuzumab
      in postmenopausal women with HR+, HER2+ advanced breast cancer. This trial consists of two
      parts. The first part is a phase IB study of increasing the dose of ribociclib from 200mg to
      600mg in combination with letrozole 2.5mg and trastuzumab (8mg/kg followed by 6mg/kg every 3
      weeks). In phase IB study, three to six patients will be enrolled for each dose group.

      When the IB phase ends, patient enrollment will be discontinued for intermediate safety
      analysis, and after DLT analysis will determine recommended phase II phase II part will be
      started. The recommended phase II dose of ribocicib determined in phase IB part with
      ribociclib and trastuzumab (8mg/kg followed by 6mg/kg every 3 weeks) will be administered.
      Treatment is discontinued in the following cases.

        -  Progression of disease

        -  Uncontrolled toxicity

        -  Patient's death

        -  Withdrawal of consent In phase II part, 61 patients will be enrolled and the first 20
           patients will be analyzed for run-in phase to confirm the safety of the therapy.

      Regardless of treatment cycle, the disease will be evaluated in the same manner as the method
      used at the time of registration at intervals of 8 weeks for the first 18 months and at
      intervals of 12 weeks after that. If the progress of the disease is clinically suspected,
      additional tests can be performed
