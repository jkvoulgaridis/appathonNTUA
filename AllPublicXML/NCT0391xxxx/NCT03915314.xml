  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than 20% of patients over 60 years old develop postoperative delirium following
      non-cardiac surgery . Delirium increases morbidity and mortality , and may lead to long-term
      cognitive impairment . The underlying mechanisms behind delirium are not understood ,
      endothelial dysfunction and disruption of the blood brain barrier (BBB ) caused by
      perioperative systemic inflammation may play a important role in the development of delirium
      . This study intends to evaluate the relationship between neuroinflammation and postoperative
      delirium in elderly non-cardiac surgery patients . The results of the study are to identify
      risk factors and explore the biomarkers most closely linked to each step of the proposed
      pathway .

      The investigators do the neuropsychological tests , Mini-Mental score examination (MMSE ) ,
      Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI ) , Quality of Recovery Score - 40 (QoR-40 ) 1 day before the
      surgery（baseline ) . Serum of the patients was collected before operation and at POD1 , and
      then detect the concentration change of biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction , blood brain
      barrier disruption and neuronal injury . Also , the patients were interviewed once before
      discharge from PACU and twice on postoperative days 1-3 by the Confusion Assessment Method
      and then divided them into POD and non-POD groups . Meanwhile , the severity of pain
      (Numerical Rating Scale（NRS )) was evaluated at the same time and QoR-40 at 1 day after
      surgery .

    <description>Quality of recovery will be evaluated by Quality of Recovery 40 (QoR40),which assesses five dimensions of recovery (physical comfort,emotional state, physical independence , physiological support and pain ). Each item is rated on a five-point Likert scale: none of the time, some of the time, usually, most of the time, and all the time. The total score on the QoR40 ranges from 40 (poorest quality of recovery) to 200 (best quality of recovery).</description>
