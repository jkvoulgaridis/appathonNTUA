      Open Label Phase 1/2 Trial of Tisotumab Vedotin in Japanese Subjects with Advanced Solid
      Malignancies
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part 1 of this trial will determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the recommended
      Phase 2 dose (RP2D) and the safety profile of tisotumab vedotin in subjects with solid
      malignancies. Part 2 of this trial will enroll subjects with cervical cancer to provide
      further data on the safety, tolerability, PK and anti-tumor activity
