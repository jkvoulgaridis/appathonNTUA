  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-blind, placebo-controlled, telemedicine clinical trial to assess the
      efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in adult patients 18 years and older with
      familial dysautonomia (FD) and anxiety and/or depression and/or obsessive compulsive or
      related disorders. The trial will enroll 20 adult patients each with FD who have anxiety
      and/or depression and/or obsessive compulsive or related disorders by the DSM V criteria.

      Enrolled participants will be allocated to receive, in a non-randomized fashion, weekly 5-10
      min talking sessions (i.e., placebo) for 8 weeks, followed by weekly 30-60 min CBT sessions
      during 8 weeks. Although investigators will be un-blinded to the intervention, participants
      will be blinded to the expected effects of each intervention.

      Both the talking sessions (i.e., placebo) and CBT sessions will be performed via telemedicine
      either via a HIPAA secure telemedicine platform or the telephone based on the preference of
      the individual patient. If a patient specifically requests talking or CBT sessions to be
      performed in person, this will be accommodated. The use of telemedicine is to accommodate
      disability and potential physical limitations of this unique patient population. The CBT
      sessions will be supervised by Lily Armstrong, certified mental health therapist and Dr.
      Thomas Boes, NYU Clinical Assistant Professor in the Departments of Psychiatric and
      Neurology.
