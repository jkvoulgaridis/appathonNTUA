      assessing subgingival clamp in handling and retracting the gingival tissue at the cervical
      area to see its effect on the gingival health and its technique sensitivity compared to the
      most commonly used method (retraction cord), as gingival displacement for cervical
      restorations affects smile and therefore patient satisfaction with the result.

    <textblock>
      Gingival displacement for restoring cervical lesions using retraction cord or subgingival
      clamp with their technique sensitivity affects the smile as they may cause gingival bleeding,
      laceration or recession and therefore affects patient satisfaction. There are several methods
      to achieve retraction; retraction cord is the most commonly used method. It controls the soft
      tissue displacement, gingival bleeding and expose the margins which provide good
      visualization and access.

      They are effective and safe if the gingiva is healthy, also inexpensive retraction method.
      However, the use of retraction cord has some disadvantages like: it is time consuming, may
      cause gingival recession after healing and bleeding after removal, its application needs
      practice and skill as improper handling of the cord can cause traumatic injuries, gingival
      recession and marginal exposure of the restoration, it may cause postoperative discomfort and
      pain for the patient and finally leaving the retraction cord for long time or forgetting to
      remove it from the sulcus can cause permanent damage to the gingival tissue.

      Using gingival retracting clamps with rubber dam isolation prevent the gap caused around the
      teeth due to vertical and horizontal tissue displacement occurred beneath the area of
      dento-gingival attachment upon the application of the retraction cord. Also, after clamp
      stabilization in position, it prevents accidental slippage and trauma to surrounding soft
      tissue during the restorative procedure. They also provide maximum tissue retraction without
      laceration of gingival tissues. Also, their availability in different sizes and shapes
      provide a good adaptation to any tooth configuration and any inaccessible area.
