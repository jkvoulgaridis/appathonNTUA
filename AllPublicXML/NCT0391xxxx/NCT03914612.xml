      This phase III trial studies how well the combination of pembrolizumab, paclitaxel and
      carboplatin works compared with paclitaxel and carboplatin alone in treating patients with
      endometrial cancer that is stage III or IV, or has come back (recurrent). Immunotherapy with
      monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the
      cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Paclitaxel and
      carboplatin are chemotherapy drugs used as part of the usual treatment approach for this type
      of cancer. This study aims to assess if adding immunotherapy to these drugs is better or
      worse than the usual approach for treatment of this cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy of pembrolizumab in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin
      in patients with advanced stage (measurable stage III or IVA), stage IVB and recurrent
      endometrial cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the nature, frequency and degree of toxicity as assessed by Common
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) for each treatment arm.

      II. To evaluate blinded independent central review (BICR) assessed or investigator assessed
      objective response rate (ORR) as assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
      (RECIST) 1.1 by treatment arm and by mismatch repair (MMR) status in patients who enter the
      study with measurable disease.

      III. To evaluate BICR assessed or investigator assessed duration of response (DOR) by
      treatment arm and by MMR status in patients who enter the study with measurable disease.

      IV. To evaluate the effect of pembrolizumab on overall survival (OS) in patients with
      mismatch repair protein proficient (pMMR) or mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR).

      V. To determine whether the addition of pembrolizumab to standard combination chemotherapy is
      associated with improved patient reported physical function as measured with the
      Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)-physical function scale
      (short form), quality of life as measured with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy
      (FACT) - Endometrial Trial Outcome Index (En TOI) and worsened fatigue as measured with the
      PROMIS-Fatigue scale (short form) in the pMMR patients.

      VI. To determine concordance between institutional MMR immunohistochemistry (IHC) testing and
      centralized MMR IHC.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore the correlation between patient-reported physical function as measured with the
      PROMIS-physical function scale (short form) and quality of life as measure with the FACT-En
      TOI.

      II. To explore whether the addition of pembrolizumab to standard combination chemotherapy is
      associated with self-reported neurotoxicity as measured with the FACT/Gynecologic Oncology
      Group Neurotoxicity (GOG-Ntx) subscale (short) and the extent to which patients differ on
      their self-reported bother from side effects of cancer therapy in the pMMR patients.

      III. To evaluate the efficacy of pembrolizumab in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin
      in patients with advanced stage (measurable stage III or IVA), stage IVB and recurrent
      endometrial cancer by PD-L1 IHC (positive versus [vs] negative).

      IV. To assess the association between PD-L1 IHC (positive vs negative) and mismatch repair
      status (pMMR and dMMR).

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I:

      COMBINATION PHASE: Patients receive placebo intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1,
      paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1, and carboplatin IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1.
      Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable disease (SD) or partial response (PR) who still
      have measurable disease may continue treatment for up to a total 10 cycles (if deemed
      necessary by the treating physician) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      MAINTENANCE PHASE: Patients receive placebo IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats
      every 3 weeks for up to 29 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      ARM II:

      COMBINATION PHASE: Patients receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1, paclitaxel IV
      over 3 hours on day 1, and carboplatin IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats
      every 3 weeks for 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients with SD or PR who still have measurable disease may continue treatment for up to a
      total of 10 cycles (if deemed necessary by the treating physician) in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      MAINTENANCE PHASE: Patients receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment
      repeats every 3 weeks for up to 29 cycles in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.

    <description>Assessed by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). Toxicities will be screened for differences between treatments by using an exact method or a Chi-Square test. For a given adverse event, each patient will be graded according to the worse grade experienced while on therapy (and within 30 days of treatment). These toxicities will then be divided into two or three categories such as mild, moderate, and severe or mild to moderate versus severe. The rates of severe toxicities may be characterized by risk ratios or odds ratios with confidence intervals (unadjusted for multiplicity). The number of toxicities examined is usually fairly large, so these analyses will be considered exploratory and may be inspected in light of other studies.</description>

The patient's MMR status will be assessed for prognostic value by conducting stratified log-rank tests or Cox Proportional Hazards (PH) modeling when assessing the impact on PFS or OS. When assessing the impact on the probability of response, a logistic regression model will be considered and include other pertinent variables that may influence response. A Cox PH model will be used to assess predictive value of MMR status for regimen efficacy through an interaction term. A similar type of analysis may be attempted with response using logistic regression. The concordance of institutional MMR IHC testing and centralized MMR IHC will be characterized by agreement statistics such as kappa statistics (e.g. Cohen's kappa coefficient).</description>

A formal test will be conducted by examining the interaction term between pembrolizumab treatment (yes or no) with PD-L1 status. The association between PD-L1 CPS status and MMR status will be assessed with odds ratios. A test may be conducted with a Fisher's Exact Test, and confidence intervals will be provided.</description>

             for 120 days after the last dose of study medication. Should a woman become pregnant
             or suspect she is pregnant while she is participating in this study, she should inform
             her treating physician immediately. Patients will be considered of nonreproductive
             potential if they are either:

               -  Postmenopausal (defined as at least 12 months with no menses without an
                  alternative medical cause; in women &lt; 45 years of age, a high follicle
                  stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to
                  confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or
                  hormonal replacement therapy. In the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single
