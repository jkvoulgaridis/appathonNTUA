  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stress urinary incontinence affects millions of women worldwide and has a profound impact on
      the quality of life of older individuals, their subjective health status, levels of
      depression and need for care. Midurethral sling placement was introduced in 1995 and remains
      the current gold standard for surgical management of SUI. Although the advantages of
      midurethral sling surgery include its high success and minimally invasive approach,
      approximately 10-50% of women experience acute postoperative urinary retention and are
      subsequently sent home with an indwelling foley catheter or clean intermittent self
      catheterization. Urinary retention is anxiety provoking for most patients and adds morbidity,
      cost, and increased utilization of healthcare resources. Additionally, catheterization of the
      urinary tract results in increased risk of urinary tract infection and potential need for
      antibiotics.

      Several recent studies have reported varying rates of postoperative voiding trial success
      depending on the type of local anesthetic used for hydrodissection; however the data is
      sparse and invites a more thorough investigation. Furthermore, to the investigators
      knowledge, no studies have systematically explored dosage or type of agent used
      intraoperatively on postoperative voiding function. Based on the preliminary data, the
      investigators hypothesize that patients receiving normal saline compared to a local
      anesthetic (e.g., lidocaine) will have a reduction in duration of postoperative urinary
      retention following retropubic midurethral sling placement.

      Aim 1: to compare the incidence of urinary retention following retropubic midurethral sling
      placement in those women receiving normal saline vs lidocaine for retropubic hydrodissection.
      The investigators will compare rates of failed retrograde voiding trials between patients
      receiving normal saline to those receiving the same quantity of lidocaine. This will be
      completed using a standardized retrograde voiding trial 1-2 hours postoperatively (as
      outlined in &quot;Data and Statistical Methods&quot; below). The investigators hypothesize that
      patients receiving normal saline compared to a local anesthetic will have a reduction in
      postoperative urinary retention following retropubic midurethral sling placement.

      Aim 2: to assess postoperative pain in women receiving retropubic normal saline vs lidocaine
      during midurethral sling placement. Postoperatively, subjects will be asked to mark their
      pain on a VAS scale administered 2 hours and 6 hours following surgery. The initial
      assessment will be performed by nursing personnel at the time of routine vital sign
      assessment; the subsequent assessments will be completed by patients with an at-home form
      through postoperative day #7. Narcotic use will be queried through the electronic medical
      record as well as with a pain diary administered at time of discharge until postoperative day
      #7.

      Aim 3: to examine differences in patient satisfaction and quality of life following
      retropubic midurethral sling placement between women receiving retropubic normal saline vs
      lidocaine at time of midurethral sling placement. Differences in patient satisfaction will be
      compared using a Likert Scale. Patients will be asked to rate their satisfaction with surgery
      on a Likert scale (with 1 being the least satisfied and 5 being the most) at their 6 week
      postoperative follow up visit. The investigators hypothesize that women receiving normal
      saline for hydrodissection will have improved patient satisfaction as evidenced by higher
      Likert scores compared to those receiving lidocaine.

    <description>To assess postoperative pain in women receiving retropubic normal saline vs lidocaine during midurethral sling placement. Visual Analog Scale (VAS) pain scales are unidimensional measures of pain intensity that are easily completed and scored. Subjects place an &quot;X&quot; on a 10 centimeter (cm) VAS line at the point that represents their pain intensity. The score is calculated by measuring the distance in millimeters (mm) along the 10 cm line where 0 represents &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 represents &quot;worst pain.&quot; Scores range from 0-100mm. They have been widely used in diverse populations to assess pain. VAS pain scores will be used as the outcome measure in this study because they are easy to complete and because they are easily compared to prior studies. The 2 hour VAS score will be completed prior to discharge. The 6 hour VAS score will be returned via mail since patients are routine discharged a few hours after sling surgery.</description>

    <description>To examine differences in patient satisfaction with surgery between women receiving retropubic normal saline vs lidocaine at time of midurethral sling placement. The Likert Scale is the most widely used approach to scaling responses in survey research and contains five tiered responses which users quantify on a visual analogue scale. The administration of such is easily comprehended, provides an effective and clinically relevant means of assessing patient satisfaction, and can readily be used in clinical practice. To determine satisfaction, patients will be asked to rate their satisfaction with surgery on a Likert scale (with 1 being the least satisfied and 5 being the most) at their 6 week postoperative follow up visit.</description>

    <intervention_name>lidocaine with epinephrine</intervention_name>
    <description>One of the most commonly used local anesthetic agents in surgical practice is lidocaine. Lidocaine as a local anesthetic is characterized by a rapid onset of action (typically within 2-5 minutes of injection) and intermediate duration of efficacy and thus is often favored in the outpatient setting for pre-incisional injections. Of note, however, its effects general only last up to 2 hours. Epinephrine (adrenaline) vasoconstricts arteries, delaying the resorption of lidocaine, and thus almost doubles the duration of anesthesia.</description>

    <intervention_name>Normal saline with epinephrine</intervention_name>
    <description>Several mechanisms could explain the inability to void postoperatively, including nerve conduction impairment from anesthesia. Multiple studies have investigated the use of various types of anesthesia and downstream effects on postoperative urinary retention. It is postulated that denervating the regional pelvic nerves for pain control may lead to denervation of the bladder for a transient period of time, block both the afferent and efferent pathways of the voiding mechanism, affect the urethral retro-resistance pressure and impact urethral length thereby contributing to voiding dysfunction postoperatively. The use of normal saline in this setting may have a reduction in rates and duration of postoperative urinary retention following retropubic midurethral sling placement.</description>
