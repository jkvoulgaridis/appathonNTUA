  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is most prevalent among women of childbearing age. The post-partum
      (PP) period is a critical phase in MS patients, during which a recrudescence of disease
      activity is expected. Different strategies have been assessed in the prevention of
      post-partum relapse. High dose methylprednisolone was evaluated in a case control study with
      historical controls but the positive results have not been confirmed.

      In this study, the main objective will be to compare the risk of relapse in the 6 months PP
      period between patients treated systematically by high dose methylprednisolone after delivery
      compared to patients who didn't receive a systematic treatment.

      The second objective will be focused on the comparison of the disease activity and disability
      progression in patients who have resumed early a Disease Modifying Drug (DMD) after delivery
      vs patients who haven't.

      Even if two small case control studies underlined the positive effect of high dose
      methylprednisolone on the relapse risk in the PP period in MS, these data have to be
      confirmed by a larger study. The impact of such a strategy remains also uncertain concerning
      the risk of long term disability. In this project, the investigators will also analyze the
      influence of the delay of DMD reintroduction after delivery on the relapse risk but also on
      the risk of disability. The results will have an important role in the therapeutic management
      of the post-partum period in MS patients.
