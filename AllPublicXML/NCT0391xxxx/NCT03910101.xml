  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spasticity - a variety of motor over-activity and part of the upper motor neuron syndrome -
      is a common cause of impaired motor function after brain injuries of different etiologies. In
      addition, it may cause pain and impaired hygiene, contractures, deformities etc. Spasticity
      has been reported in 30 to 90% of patients with stroke, traumatic brain injury (TBI),
      incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI) and cerebral palsy (CP).

      Spasticity therapy has emerged as an important approach to alleviate related symptoms.
      Positive effects on spasticity are well recognized following systemic and intra-thecal
      pharmacological treatment, as well as after intra-muscularly injected substances; the effect
      of the latter is, however, of limited duration. While pharmacological spasticity therapy has
      been applied for decades, surgical procedures remain fairly uncommon in adults with
      spasticity, but not in pediatric patients with CP, and outcomes after surgical treatment are
      scarcely described in the literature.

      The study center is a specialized unit initially focused on reconstructive as well as
      spasticity reducing surgery in the upper extremities for SCI patients. Subsequently, patients
      with spasticity also due to various other Central nervous system diseases have been referred
      to the center for surgical treatment. Studies describing the effect of spasticity-reducing
      surgery in the upper extremities are rare and the group is heterogeneous. The aim of the
      study is therefore to evaluate the results and compare against todays golden standard
      treatment (boutuliniumtoxin injections).

    <description>for pain, patient's self-rating of general arm-hand function (usefulness), appearance of the hand and self-rating spasticity. Visual Analog Scale is a straight horizontal line of fixed length, 100 mm. The ends are defined as the extreme limits of the parameter to be measured. Orientated from the left no; pain, spasticity, problem with appearance to the right worst possible; pain, spasticity, problem with appearance. In the general hand function question the scale goes from left side no hand function to the right side best possible hand function. In the pain, spasticity and appearance question a high number indicate a worse outcome, in the general hand function question a high number represent a better outcome. Respondents specify their level of agreement to the statement by indicating a position along the line.</description>

    <description>The surgical treatment for reducing spasticity comprises lengthening of tendons, muscle release and occasionally correction of deformities. Lengthening of a tendon or releasing a muscle from its insertion, results in relaxation of the whole muscle-tendon unit. Hence, the spasticity is not gone, but reduced in strength.
The tendon lengthening procedures is performed by a stair-step incision technique followed by reattachment in the lengthened position using a side-to-side, cross-stich technique. The load to failure of the sutured tendon is approximately 200Newton, which gives a sufficient safety margin for early active mobilization of the tendons involved. This suture technique thus enables active training directly after surgery.
Postoperative rehabilitation includes wrapping and a custom-made splint, for day and night use, muscle activation and passive stretching 2-4 times per day without the splint.</description>

    <description>Botulinum toxin injections are given in spastic muscles of the upper extremity. Dosage and number of injections per muscle vary depending on the degree and extent of spasticity. For optimal effect on hand function, botulinum toxin is accompanied by the treatment of individualized exercise and splinting when needed.</description>
