      TB is an infectious disease caused by the bacillus Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It typically
      affects the lungs (pulmonary TB) but can also affect other sites (extrapulmonary TB). The
      disease is spread when people who are sick with pulmonary TB expel bacteria into the air, for
      example by coughing. Overall, a relatively small proportion (5-15%) of the estimated 1.7
      billion people infected with M. tuberculosis will develop TB disease (active disease) during
      their lifetime. However, the probability of developing TB disease is much higher among people
      infected with HIV, and also higher among people affected by risk factors such as
      under-nutrition, diabetes, smoking and alcohol consumption. Latent tuberculosis infection
      (LTBI) is defined as a state of persistent immune response to stimulation by Mycobacterium
      tuberculosis antigens with no evidence of clinically manifest active TB. As there is no &quot;gold
      standard&quot; test for LTBI, the global burden is not known with certainty; however, up to one
      third of the world's population is estimated to be infected with M. tuberculosis , and the
      vast majority have no signs or symptoms of TB disease and are not infectious, although they
      are at risk for active TB disease and for becoming infectious. Several studies have shown
      that, on average, 5-10% of those infected will develop active TB disease over the course of
      their lives, usually within the first 5 years after initial infection . The risk for active
      TB disease after infection depends on several factors, the most important being immunological
      status
