        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Male or female, 18 years or older.

          -  Chronic AD (according to American Academy of Dermatology Consensus Criteria, 2014)
             that has been present for at least 3 years before the screening visit.

          -  Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score ≥16 at the screening and baseline visits.

          -  Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score ≥3 (on the 0 to 4 IGA scale, in which 3
             is moderate and 4 is severe) at the screening and baseline visits.

          -  Patient with ≥10% body surface area (BSA) of AD involvement at the screening and
             baseline visits.

          -  Baseline Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) average score for maximum itch
             intensity ≥4.

          -  Documented recent history (within 6 months before the screening visit) of inadequate
             response to treatment with topical medications or for whom topical treatments are
             otherwise medically inadvisable (eg, because of important side effects or safety
             risks).

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Having used any of the following treatments within 4 weeks before the baseline visit,
             or any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, is likely to require such
             treatment(s) during the first 4 weeks of study treatment:

               -  Immunosuppressive/immunomodulating drugs (eg, systemic corticosteroids,
                  cyclosporine, mycophenolate-mofetil, interferon-gamma [IFN-γ], Janus kinase
                  inhibitors, azathioprine, methotrexate);

               -  Phototherapy for AD.

          -  Treatment with topical corticosteroids (TCS) or topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCI)
             within 1 week before the baseline visit.

          -  Treatment with systemic Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) within 4 weeks before the
             baseline visit or treatment with topical TCM within 1 week before the baseline visit.

          -  Treatment with biologics as follows:

               -  Any cell-depleting agents including but not limited to rituximab: within 6 months
                  before the baseline visit, or until lymphocyte count returns to normal, whichever
                  is longer;

               -  Other biologics: within 5 half-lives (if known) or 16 weeks prior to baseline
                  visit, whichever is longer.

          -  Initiation of treatment of AD with prescription moisturizers or moisturizers
             containing additives such as ceramide, hyaluronic acid, urea, or filaggrin degradation
             products during the screening period (patients may continue using stable doses of such
             moisturizers if initiated before the screening visit).

          -  Regular use (more than 2 visits per week) of a tanning booth/parlor within 4 weeks of
             the baseline visit.

          -  Treatment with a live (attenuated) vaccine within 12 weeks before the baseline visit.

          -  Active chronic or acute infection requiring treatment with systemic antibiotics,
             antivirals, antiparasitics, antiprotozoals, or antifungals within 2 weeks before the
             baseline visit, or superficial skin infections within 1 week before the baseline
             visit. NOTE: patients may be rescreened after infection resolves.

          -  Known or suspected history of immunosuppression, including history of invasive
             opportunistic infections (eg, tuberculosis [TB], histoplasmosis, listeriosis,
             coccidioidomycosis, pneumocystosis, aspergillosis) despite infection resolution: or
             unusually frequent, recurrent, or prolonged infections, per investigator judgment.

          -  Active tuberculosis (TB), latent untreated tuberculosis or a history of incompletely
             treated tuberculosis or non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection will be excluded from
             the study unless it is well documented by a specialist that the patient has been
             adequately treated and can now start treatment with a biologic agent, in the medical
             judgment of the Investigator and/or infectious disease specialist. Tuberculosis
             testing would be performed according to local guidelines if required by regulatory
             authorities or ethics committees.

        The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's
        potential participation in a clinical trial.
