  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The benefit of mechanical thrombectomy in the treatment of ischemic stroke has been
      demonstrated in several multicenter randomized trials. However, it leads to a sudden
      reperfusion of the brain parenchyma associated to an extension of the infarct volume.
      Evidence has indicated that remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) reduces final infarct size in
      animal stroke models. The main objective of the present study is to determine whether remote
      ischemic conditioning can limit the final infarct volume after recanalization of the occluded
      cerebral artery.

    <time_frame>Day 1 of thrombectomy</time_frame>
    <description>The Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) score is a tool for determining the response of thrombolytic therapy for ischemic stroke and is defined as follows: 0=no perfusion; 1= penetration, but no distal branch filling; 2a= perfusion with incomplete (&lt;50%) distal branch filling; 2b=perfusion with incomplete (&gt;50%) distal branch filling; and 3=full perfusion with filling of all distal branches. A score of 0 being the least favorable outcome for the patient (no perfusion) and a maximum score of 3 being the most favorable outcome for the patient (full perfusion).</description>

    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Arterial reperfusion according to the Arterial Occlusive Lesion (AOL) score. This score is related to recanalization of the primary arterial occlusive lesion on a scale of 0 to 3 : 0 is no recanalization of the primary occlusive lesion; 1 is incomplete or partial recanalization of the primary occlusive lesion with no distal flow; 2 is incomplete or partial recanalization of the primary lesion with any distal flow; and 3 is complete recanalization of the primary occlusive lesion with any distal flow. The most favorable outcome for the patient is a score of 3 while a score of 0 is the least favorable patient outcome.</description>

    <measure>Impact on collateral circulation assessed by the Higashida score.</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Higashida score offers a non-invasive collateral vessel and tissue perfusion assessment of ischemic tissue. This grading system subdivides the collateral flow into five grades, from grade 0 (no collaterals visible on the ischemic side) to grade 5 (complete and rapid collateral blood flow to the vascular bed in the entire ischemic territory by retrograde perfusion). A grade of 3-5 is considered good collateral formation whereas a grade of 0-2 is considered poor collateral formation after a stroke and is less favorable to the patient's outcome.</description>

The most favorable patient outcome being the first classification hemorrhagic infarction type 1 (HI1) and the least favorable patient outcome being the fourth classification parenchymal hematoma type 2 (PH2).</description>

    <time_frame>Day 90</time_frame>
    <description>NIHSS score for each ability is a number between 0 and 4 with 0 being normal functioning and 4 being completely impaired. The patient's NIHSS score is calculated by adding the number for each element of the scale; 42 is the highest score possible. The higher the score, the more impaired a stroke patient is. MRS score from 0 to 6 with 0 being normal functioning and 6 being death, the higher the score the more impaired a stroke patient is. For this study a positive response is defined by : a NIHSS &lt;7 at admission and a MRS = 0 at Day 90 ; a NIHSS between 8 and 14 at admission and a MRS = 0 or 1 at Day 90 ; a NIHSS &gt;14 at admission and a MRS = 0 to 2 at Day 90.</description>
