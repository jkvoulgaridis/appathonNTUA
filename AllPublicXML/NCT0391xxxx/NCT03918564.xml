    <description>The Laparoscopic Gastric Vest (LGV), branded the ReShape Vest™, is a long-term, silastic, implantable system that is placed around the stomach to encompass the gastroesophageal junction to the Incisura Angularis.
The main materials used to make the LGV is Implant Grade Silicone (95%) and Barium Sulfate (5%).
The LGV is indicated for weight reduction for obese people with a Body Mass Index (BMI) between ≥35 kg/m2 and ≤55 kg/m2. It is indicated for use in adult patients (≥22 to ≤65 years) who have failed one or more conservative weight reduction alternative(s), such as supervised diet, exercise, and behavior modification program(s).</description>
