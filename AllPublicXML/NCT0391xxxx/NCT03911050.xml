  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an interventional study to investigate formation and pharmacokinetics of reactive
      carbonyl species adducts of apple polyphenols in human after a single dose of apple
      consumption.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A crossover design was used. Twelve healthy volunteers were recruited and asked to avoid the
      consumption of any apple products starting 1 week before intervention and continuing
      throughout the entire study for a total of 3 weeks.

      On week 2, each of six participants received 600 g apple blends (seeds removal) in a single
      dose, and afterwards, urine and blood samples at different timepoints over 24 h, and fecal
      sample at different timepoints over 48 h were collected. Meanwhile, other six participants
      received breakfast (without any apple products) only, and urine and blood samples at
      different timepoints over 24 h, and fecal sample at different timepoints over 48 h were
      collected.

      On the contrary, on week 3, six participants who received apple blends on week 2 received
      breakfast only, and six participants who were used as control on week 2 received apple
      blends. And urine and blood samples at different timepoints over 24 h, and fecal sample at
      different timepoints over 48 h for both groups were collected.

      Samples will be analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Pharmacokinetics of conjugates will be investigated.
