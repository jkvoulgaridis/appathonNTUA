  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common autosomal recessive inherited genetic disorder in
      North America, Australia and Europe.

      CF is due to cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene mutation (CFTR) coding
      for a chloride channel located at the apical membrane of epithelial cells. The most common
      mutation is the deletion of the amino acid phenylalanine at the codon 508 (ΔF508) affecting
      70% of the patients.

      The CFTR channel participates in the regulation of the volume and composition of exocrine
      secretions. At the level of the lungs, this results in a thickening of the mucus with a
      dysfunction of the mucociliary clearance promoting colonization of pathogenic microorganisms.
      Patients with cystic fibrosis therefore have a natural susceptibility to develop acute and
      then chronic respiratory infections, gradually leading to irreversible respiratory tract
      lesions called bronchiectasis. Different germs such as Haemophilus influenzae and
      Staphylococcus aureus colonize the airways early in life. The progression of the disease
      causes furthermore a colonization by opportunistic germs such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and
      Burkholderia cepacia, which are associated with higher mortality.

      Pulmonary exacerbation is a common complication of CF requiring administration of
      antibiotics. The choice of these antibiotics depends on the germs that the patient carries in
      his respiratory tract.

      The type of sampling and the conditions under which they are taken are therefore very
      important. Sputum and oropharyngeal smear are used in adolescents and children respectively
      to collect respiratory secretions in clinical routine. The recent literature describes
      induced sputum, obtained after a physiotherapy session and a hypertonic serum aerosol, as
      superior to the oropharyngeal smear alone and equivalent to bronchoalveolar lavage for the
      evaluation of the microbiological profile of patients who cannot expectorate. However, this
      technique takes time and requires the presence of a physiotherapist.

      Bronchoalveolar lavage is reserved for complex cases that do not respond to standard
      treatments.

      Finally, the nasal flora appears to be involved in the colonization of the lower respiratory
      tract. Sinuses are described as reservoirs of germs that can induce a recolonization of the
      lungs despite eradication of the germ (for example after a pulmonary transplantation) .

      To our knowledge, no study has investigated the involvement of nasal flora in the clinical
      course of children with CF.

    <description>Pain / discomfort score induced by the set of sampling procedures measured by means of the &quot;Visual Analogue Scale&quot; (VAS) in children aged 5 or older. The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) consists of a straight line with the endpoints defining extreme limits such as 'no pain at all' (0) and 'pain as bad as it could be' (10). The patient is asked to mark his pain level on the line between the two endpoints. The distance between 'no pain at all' and the mark then defines the subject's pain.</description>

    <description>Pain / discomfort score induced by the set of sampling procedures measured by means of the FLACC scale (Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability Scale) in children less than 5 years. FLACC scale is a measurement used to assess pain for children between the ages of 2 months and 7 years or individuals that are unable to communicate their pain. The scale is scored in a range of 0-10 with 0 representing no pain. The scale has five criteria, which are each assigned a score of 0, 1 or 2. The criteria evaluated are expression of the face, position of the legs, patient activity, type of cry, consolability</description>
