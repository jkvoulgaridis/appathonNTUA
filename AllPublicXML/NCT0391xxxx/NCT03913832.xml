  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective, multinational (Italy and UK), multicenter, randomised Clinical
      Trial that compares the efficacy and performance of two drug coated balloon (DCB), the MAGIC
      TOUCH sirolimus coated balloon (Concept Medical) and SeQuent Please paclitaxel coated balloon
      (B Braun). The objective of the study is to compare angiographic outcomes of Magic TouchTM
      sirolimus coated balloon (Concept Medical) versus SeQuentTM paclitaxel coated balloon
      (Bbraun) for the treatment of de novo coronary artery lesions in small vessels (≤2.5 mm) with
      respect to Net Gain (mm) at 6 months follow-up

      A prospective, randomized, multi-centre study in subjects with small vessels, i.e. at least
      one de-novo lesion in a small vessel (≤2.5mm). Vessel size will be determined first by QCA
      on-line (screening, pre-procedure). If, based on QCA on-line the vessel size pre-procedure is
      ≤2.5mm and following a successful pre-dilatation (i.e. no angiographic dissections type CDEF
      and TIMI&gt;2), the subject will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to Magic Touch or SeQuent Please
      Neo. OCT will be performed post pre-dilatation (guidance) prior to drug coated balloon (DCB)
      treatment. The DCB balloon size will be selected based on OCT measurements.
