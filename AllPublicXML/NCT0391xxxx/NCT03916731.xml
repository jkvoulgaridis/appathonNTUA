  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a First-in-Human, single site, prospective, randomized, controlled evaluation
      of the safety and effectiveness of the Healionics STARgraft AV hemodialysis access graft. The
      STARgraft has been demonstrated in preclinical studies to have improved resistance to the
      common failure mode of venous anastomosis stenosis.

      Performance of the STARgraft AV will be compared against control implants of commercially
      available standard ePTFE grafts approved for the same use.

      The study is enrolling patients with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) requiring hemodialysis
      via a prosthetic vascular graft. The study proposes to:

        1. Demonstrate improved primary patency of the investigational STARgraft AV compared to the
           ePTFE controls over a period of 6 months, with extended results to 1 year.

        2. Verify safety of the STARgraft AV multilayer construction in extended vascular access
           use.

      It is intended to enroll 25 subjects each for the investigational devices and the controls
      respectively (50 total) with randomized device allocation at subject presentation for implant
      surgery.
