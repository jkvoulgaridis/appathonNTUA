  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The assessment consists in comparing corticoids injection versus placebo in surgery of lower
      limb fractures The aim of study is to assess (state cutaneous, efficacy, safety) corticoids
      injection on a prospective, randomized analysis

    <textblock>
      One of the major problems of below-knee fractures is edema (delaying surgery time and
      post-operative complications for healing).

      The effect corticosteroids (anti-edema and anti-inflammatory) is used in neurosurgery and
      maxillofacial surgery.

      So, it seemed judicious to evaluate the effectiveness of corticosteroids in bolus
      preoperatively in order to limit the importance of the edema before intervention to prevent
      adverse effect of the edema on the cicatrization.

      This study will aim to confirm this indication or not on the contrary to change current
      practices.
