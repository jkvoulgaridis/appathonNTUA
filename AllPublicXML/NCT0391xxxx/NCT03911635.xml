  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypospadias is a condition in which the location of the urethral meatus is on the ventral
      aspect of the penis.

      Hypospadias is the most common congenital anomaly of urogenital organs in boys, with an
      incidence of approximately 1 in 250 newborns. Recently, case selection has been advised to
      avoid possible complications and limitations [1]. The meatal advancement and glanuloplasty
      (MAGPI) procedure was first described in 1981 for the repair of distal hypospadias. An
      excellent surgical result requires careful case selection, avoiding cases with thin or rigid
      ventral para-meatal skin or a meatus too proximal or too wide. The glans wrap to support the
      advanced ventral urethral wall requires a solid tissue approximation in two layers to prevent
      regression of the meatus. Meatal stenosis can be avoided by assuring an adequate dorsal
      Heineke- Mikulicz tissue rearrangement and making an incision from within the urethral meatus
      well distally into the urethral groove. . The overall success rate with the MAGPI procedure
      suggests that it should continue to be used in the repair of distal hypospadias [2]. The
      advantage of Urethral advancement, Glanuloplasty, and Preputioplasty &amp;quot; URAGPI&amp;quot;
      versus MAGPI Is that A) Applicability to almost any type of distal hypospadias regardless of
      the severity of glanular ventriflexion.

      B) Normal appearance of the penis. C) Good functional results.
