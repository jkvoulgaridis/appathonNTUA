  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of the biomarkers to predict Hemorrhagic transformation(HT) after endovascular
      treatment in Acute Ischemic Stroke Patients.

      The study has three main parts. During the first part, the investigators propose to conduct
      an enrollment of patients after thrombectomy in acute Ischemic Stroke and healthy controls.
      Serum biomarkers levels were analyzed (before and after) endovascular treatment patients and
      controls respectively.

      During the second part, HT was evaluated and classified on cranial computed tomography and/or
      MRI post- treatment and was considered as symptomatic HT (sHT) if associated with
      neurological deterioration.

      During the third part, the investigators aim to demonstrate the level of biomarkers can
      significant predict HT and outcomes in stroke patients undergoing revascularization.

    <description>Hemorrhagic transformation was diagnosed by Computed tomographic scans usually performed 24 to 72 hours after the procedure.Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage was defined as neurologic deterioration (an increase of 4 or more points in the score on the NIHSS) and evidence of intracranial hemorrhage on imaging studies.</description>

    <measure>Modified Rankin scale</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>this scale measures functional outcome, with scores ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 6 (death).scores of the modified Rankin scale at 2 years (0 or 1 [excel- lent outcome], 0 to 2 [good outcome, indicating functional independence], and 0 to 3 [favorable outcome]).</description>
