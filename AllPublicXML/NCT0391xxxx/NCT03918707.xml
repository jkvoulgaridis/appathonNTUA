  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study involving a prospective group of 15 evaluable patients who will undergo
      rapid whole genome sequencing in addition to standard of care testing. Subjects will be drawn
      from children admitted to the NICU at OSF Health Care Children's Hospital of Illinois who
      meet inclusion criteria. The aims of this study are to evaluate the turn-around time and cost
      of performing rapid whole genome sequencing (rWGS) compared to standard of care in the
      diagnosis of genetic disorders among critically ill infants in a regional children's hospital
      and to describe management outcomes of utilizing rWGS in acutely ill patients less than four
      months of age.

    <description>If normally distributed, we will use t test for univariate analysis, and linear regression models for multivariate analysis to assess the intervention effects. Otherwise, we will use Wilcoxon two-sample t test or robust linear regression models. For other categorical variables, we will use chi-square to compare the difference between the prospective and historical control groups. Stratified analysis will be performed in order to get insight into the relationships of the data.
We will analyze data within intervention, and control group, respectively. Means and standard deviations will be reported for continuous variables, and percentage values, odds ratio, 95% confidence interval will be reported for categorical variables. The two-tailed p values are calculated for all tests, and p&lt;0.05 will be considered a statistically significant result. SAS 9.4 will be used for data management and data analysis.</description>
