      An open, single-center, randomized controlled phase II clinical trial to compare the efficacy
      and safety of conformal intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) combined with
      carboplatin and IMRT combined with carboplatin and 5-FU in elderly patients with locally

      Esophageal cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors in China.To compare the efficacy
      and safety of conformal intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) combined with
      carboplatin and IMRT combined with carboplatin and 5-FU in elderly patients with locally
      advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma at high risk of chemotherapy.This trial is an
      open, single-center, randomized controlled phase II clinical trial.
