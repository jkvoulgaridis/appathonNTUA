  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the clinical activity of neoadjuvant
      cemiplimab therapy in patients with resectable Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC),
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) lesions, as
      measured by pathological evaluations of resected tumors.

      The secondary objectives of the study are:

        -  To assess the anti-tumor activity of neoadjuvant and adjuvant cemiplimab therapy as
           defined by multiple criteria

        -  To determine the safety and tolerability of neoadjuvant and adjuvant cemiplimab therapy
           including delay to surgery

        -  To assess the change in tumor-infiltrating CD8 T-cell density and to explore the
           correlation to the pathological response to therapy

             be on hormonal therapy.

          -  Encephalitis, meningitis, or uncontrolled seizures in the year prior to informed
             consent

          -  History of interstitial lung disease (eg, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, organizing
             pneumonia) or active, noninfectious pneumonitis that required immune-suppressive doses
             of glucocorticoids to assist with management. A history of radiation pneumonitis in
             the radiation field is permitted as long as pneumonitis resolved ≥6 months prior to
             study treatment.

          -  Uncontrolled infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), HBV or hepatitis C
             infection (HCV); or diagnosis of immunodeficiency as defined in the protocol
