  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To test the hypothesis that adult individuals who are victims of gun violence will have
      decreased symptoms of post-traumatic stress after an individual-level intervention with the
      Screening and Tool for Awareness and Relief of Trauma (START).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In response to the lack of targeted mental health intervention for gunshot wound survivors,
      the Screening and Tool for Awareness and Relief of Trauma (START) was developed for patients
      that come from communities with sustained and persistent trauma. It consists of six screening
      questions adapted from the validated Primary Care PTSD Screen,[30] with input from focus
      groups, surveys and in-depth interviews with victims of violence and in particular, boys and
      young men of color. START has been shown to be effective at decreasing symptoms of PTSD in a
      one-month follow-up, but it has not been piloted on recently injured victims of gun violence
      specifically nor has it been tested in a randomized control trial design. A better
      understanding of the utility of this tool and others like it in victims of violent crime for
      relief of symptoms of post-traumatic stress and prevention of PTSD would contribute to the
      larger body of literature on PTSD prevention for victims of gun violence while simultaneously
      addressing a major need in this community.

    <description>The Screening and Tool for Awareness and Relief of Trauma (START) was developed for patients that come from communities with sustained and persistent trauma. It consists of six screening questions adapted from the validated Primary Care PTSD Screen,[30] with input from focus groups, surveys and in-depth interviews with victims of violence. The full START intervention requires 30-45 minutes of structured conversation at the end of which the participant leaves with a better understanding of trauma symptoms as well as on-the-spot instruction on a set of techniques designed to alleviate the symptoms of PTSD. Based on the results of their screening, the participant will be offered up to four techniques to alleviate their symptoms</description>
