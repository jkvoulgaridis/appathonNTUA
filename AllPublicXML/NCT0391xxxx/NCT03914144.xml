  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Catheterisation is an accepted tool in intrapartum bladder care and indwelling catheters are
      used routinely before elective caesarean sections. However, urinary catheters are associated
      with an increased rate of urinary tract infections which can lead to complications including
      increased maternal morbidity and prolonged hospital stay. A Cochrane Review (2014) concluded
      that there is insufficient evidence to assess the routine use of indwelling bladder catheters
      in women undergoing caesarean section. The incidence and causation of catheter-associated
      infection in this population is unknown. We propose to provide this data, by comparing urine
      samples from pregnant women before and after their delivery and analysing this against
      observational catheter use during the delivery. This will be vital in conducting future
      research into potential change in policy on routine catheterisation. It will also be
      beneficial to patients as it could reduce the burden of catheterisation by reducing their
      chance of developing a UTI and by reducing the associated morbidity.

      Research Question

      Is the intrapartum use of a catheter - either intermittent or indwelling - associated with an
      increased incidence of postnatal bacteriuria when compared with women who are not
      catheterised?

      Method

      Pregnant women will be recruited at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital Maternity Department from
      37 weeks gestation. Once eligibility is met, they will be asked to provide a mid-stream urine
      sample which will be tested for microscopy, culture and sensitivity (MC&amp;S). They will be
      analysed according to their mode of delivery. Their notes will be scrutinised to assess
      whether or not a catheter was sited during their labour. Postnatally, they will be asked to
      provide an MSU on day 3 and day 28, which will both be sent for MC&amp;S. A comparative analysis
      between each MSU will be performed and correlated to whether intrapartum catheterisation was
      undertaken.

      Data Collection &amp; Analysis

      The data collection phase will take approximately three months, with data analysis and
      write-up estimated to take a further one-two months.
