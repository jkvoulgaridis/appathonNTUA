  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      B7451037 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, Phase 2a study to
      investigate the mechanism of action of PF-04965842 by correlating efficacy outcomes with
      changes from baseline in key skin and blood biomarkers in adult participants at least 18
      years of age with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. Participants will be screened within
      28 days prior to the first dose of study intervention to confirm eligibility. A total of
      approximately 51 participants will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive PF-04965842 200
      mg once daily (QD), PF004965842 100 mg QD, or matching placebo QD for 12 weeks. At the end of
      the 12-week study treatment, qualified participants will have the option to enter the
      long-term extension study B7451015 (NCT03422822). Participants discontinuing early from this
      study will undergo a 4-week off-treatment follow-up period.

             coagulopathy, or platelet dysfunction

          -  Currently have active forms of other inflammatory skin diseases, i.e. not AD, or have
             evidence of skin conditions (e.g. psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis, lupus) at the time
             of Day 1 that would interfere with evaluation of AD or response to treatment

          -  Participants who have received prior treatment with any systemic JAK inhibitors

          -  Require treatment with prohibited concomitant medication(s) or have received a
             prohibited concomitant medication within specified time frames prior to the first dose
             of study medication, including topical treatments that could affect AD

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding women or sexually-active women of childbearing potential who
             are unwilling to use contraception
