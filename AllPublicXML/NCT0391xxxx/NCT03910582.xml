  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The endometrium becomes receptive as a result of a series of timed hormonal events during the
      menstrual cycle. The exposure of the endometrium to progesterone after ovulation initiates
      morphological and functional alterations that result in the change from a pre-receptive to a
      receptive endometrium. The morphological changes observed on histology for each specific day
      after ovulation were described by Noyes and his colleagues in 1950. An endometrial biopsy
      that shows a difference of more than 2 days between the histologic dating and actual day
      after ovulation is considered to be &quot;out of phase&quot; However, the clinical application of the
      Noyes criterion is relatively limited. We have verified the Noyes criterion in natural cycle
      in previous study which conducting endometrial biopsies respectively on day 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11
      of post-ovulation (PO+3/5/7/9/11)(unpublished data).

      The clinical value of the endometrial histological dating in RIF patients in natural cycle is
      still to be answered. In this study, we tried to investigate the clinical effects of pFET in
      unexplained RIF patients according to the use of classic histologic endometrial dating to
      estimate the timing of the window of implantation and to adjust embryo transfer time in
      natural cycle.
