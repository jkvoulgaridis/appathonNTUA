  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) due to perinatal asphyxia is common and often fatal.
      Therapeutic hypothermia reduces mortality and morbidity in infants with HIE. Even with the
      widespread use of therapeutic hypothermia, ~60% of infants with HIE die or have
      neurodevelopmental impairment. As a result, there is an urgent, unmet public health need to
      develop adjuvant therapies to improve survival and neurodevelopmental outcomes in this
      population.

      Caffeine may offer neuroprotection for infants with HIE by blocking adenosine receptors in
      the brain and reducing neuronal cell death. In animal models of HIE, caffeine reduces white
      matter brain injury. Drugs in the same class as caffeine (i.e., methylxanthines) have been
      shown to be protective against acute kidney injury in the setting of HIE. However, their
      safety and efficacy have not been studied in the setting of therapeutic hypothermia and their
      effect on neurological outcomes is not known. Since these drugs reduce injury to the kidney
      in infants with HIE, they may also reduce injury to the brain.

      This phase I study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety, and preliminary effectiveness
      of caffeine as an adjuvant therapy to improve neurodevelopmental outcomes in infants with
      HIE.

    <measure>Number of participants with abnormal MRI brain findings based on NICHD Neonatal Research Network score</measure>
    <time_frame>During initial hospitalization, approximately 7-14 postnatal days</time_frame>
    <description>The NICHD Neonatal Research Network developed and validated an MRI scoring system that categorizes severity of brain injury in the Trial of Hypothermia for Neonatal Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy.
Score 0: Normal T2 MRI
Score 1A: Minimal cerebral lesions only with involvement of basal ganglia, thalamus
Score 1B: Extensive cerebral lesions
Score 2A: Basal ganglia thalamic, anterior or posterior limb of internal capsule, or watershed infarction
Score 2B: 2A with cerebral lesions
Score 3: Hemispheric devastation</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participants with a Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID-III) cognitive, language, or motor composite score &lt; 85</measure>
    <time_frame>18-24 months of age</time_frame>
    <description>The BSID--III is a series of measurements to assess the motor (fine and gross), language (receptive and expressive), and cognitive development of infants and toddlers and consists of a series of developmental play tasks. The composite scores are scaled to a metric with a range of 40 to 160, a mean of 100, and a standard deviation of 15. Therefore, children with a composite score &lt; 85 are 1 standard deviation below the mean in that area.</description>
