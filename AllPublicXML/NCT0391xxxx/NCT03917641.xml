  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The post operative routine after Oculoplastic Surgery includes usage of cold compressions for
      symptomatic relief and decreasing of the edema and local hematomas in the first few days
      after the surgery. Khat (Catha edulis) is a plant that is used mainly for chewing and has a
      known stimulating effect, some patients report major improvement after including these leaves
      in the compressions they use after surgery. Khat contains the chemical ingredients Cathine
      and Cathinone, which are amphetamine-like alkaloids and probably the main contributors for
      its active effects. Our main goal is to use compressions that include the Khat leaves and
      check their effect on reducing the edema and hematomas after oculoplastic surgery.

    <description>Each participant will use one compression with Khat leaves and another standard compression and will decide on which eye to use which compression.
The compressions will be used for 10 minutes per every waking hour in the first 2 days post-op.
The patient will take pictures of both his eyes in days 1,3 and 7 post operative days.</description>
