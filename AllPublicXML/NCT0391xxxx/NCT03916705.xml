  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Thoraco-Lumbar Fascial Mobility (TLFM) study is to use ultrasound to
      measure the movement of connective tissue in the low back area of individuals with chronic
      low back pain (lasting more than 1 year). This study will compare baseline measurements,
      measurements after a single high velocity low amplitude spinal manipulation (HVLA-SM) and
      after a course of up to 16 HVLA-SM.

      The investigators will conduct a single arm pilot (proof-of-concept) clinical trial.
      Approximately 30 participants with self-reported chronic low-back pain (LBP), defined as pain
      for ≥ 1-year in duration and pain on at least ½ of the days in the past 6-months, will be
      enrolled.

      This trial will consist of two separate enrollment phases. Phase 1 consists of enrollment at
      baseline followed by 3 separate ultrasound measurements. Phase 1 ends after a 4-week no
      treatment run-in phase.

      Phase 2 begins twice-weekly HVLA-SM treatments to the thoracolumbar region for 8-weeks. Two
      ultrasound imaging evaluations will occur at visit 1 (pre and post-treatment). Pre-treatment
      ultrasound evaluations will be obtained at 4-weeks and 8-weeks.

      The primary outcome is shear strain (adjacent tissue layer mobility measured with ultrasound)
      at the level of the lumbar L2-L3 vertebrae bilaterally. Ultrasound measures will be obtained
      with a Terason t3000 system using a 12L5 linear array probe with 10 MHz setting. Because
      shear strain may differ between sexes, we will attempt to recruit equal numbers of male and
      female participants.
