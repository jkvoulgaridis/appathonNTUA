      Subjects completing participation in study PQ-110-001 (EudraCT 2017-000813-22 / NCT03140969)
      will be given the opportunity to enroll into the extension study for continued dosing if
      available data support current and/or future benefits for the subject. Study PQ-110-002 will
      provide long-term safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK), and efficacy data of QR-110.

      Subjects completing participation in study PQ-110-001 (EudraCT 2017-000813-22 / NCT03140969)
      will be given the opportunity to enroll into the extension study for continued dosing if
      available data support current and/or future benefits for the subject.

      Subjects will be given the opportunity to enroll into this extension study for continued
      dosing if available data support current and/or future benefits for the subject. The
      Investigator, in consultation and agreement with the Medical Monitor, will decide on
      enrollment of each individual subject, as well as on dosing of the first treated eye and
      treatment initiation of the contralateral eye. Continued subject treatment in this study is
      desirable, but cannot be guaranteed, since it will depend on the risks and benefit of further
      treatment on a case-by-case basis, as discussed and agreed upon with the Medical Monitor.

      The contralateral eye and the first treated eye will be injected 3 months apart. The
      injection interval of 3 months between both eyes will limit burden for the subjects, with a 3
      month-visit frequency during the course of the study. This between-eye interval could be
      adapted if safety data are supportive, and for logistic reasons, and in agreement with the
      Medical Monitor.

      The same safety monitoring protocol and efficacy assessments will apply to both eyes.

      QR-110 will be administered via intravitreal (IVT) injection.

             benefit from continued treatment with QR 110, as assessed by the Investigator, in
             consultation with the Medical Monitor

          -  Persistence of detectable outer nuclear layer (ONL) in the area of the macula in the
             opinion of the Investigator, as determined by OCT.

          -  Clear ocular media and adequate pupillary dilation to permit good quality retinal
             imaging, as assessed by the Investigator.

          -  An adult (â‰¥ 18 years) willing and able to provide informed consent for participation
             OR a minor (6 to &lt; 18 years) with a parent or legal guardian willing and able to
             provide written permission for the subject's participation prior to performing any
             study related procedures, and pediatric subjects able to provide age-appropriate
             assent for study participation.

          -  Female subjects who have reached menarche and male subjects must either practice true
             abstinence in accordance with their preferred and usual lifestyle, or agree to use
             acceptable, highly effective methods of contraception for up to 3 months following
             their last dose QR-110. Acceptable methods of contraception are defined in the
             protocol. Women of non-childbearing potential may be included without the use of
             adequate birth control, provided they meet the criteria in the protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any contraindication to IVT injection according to the Investigator's clinical
             judgment and international guidelines (Avery 2014).

          -  Safety issue during study PQ-110-001 that may compromise subject safety when continued
             dosing, as determined by the Investigator, and in consultation with the Medical
             Monitor.

          -  Any ocular or systemic disease or condition (including medications and laboratory test
             abnormalities) that could compromise subject safety or interfere with assessment of
             efficacy and safety, as determined by the Investigator and in consultation with the
             Medical Monitor.

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding female.
