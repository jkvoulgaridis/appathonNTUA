  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Master Preceptor Fellowship Pilot Study is a prospective cohort study that is being
      conducted to measure changes in participant knowledge, teaching efficacy, leadership skills,
      job satisfaction and quality of life.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Master Preceptor Fellows are physicians or physician assistants who have worked in
      primary care setting for a minimum of one year. The participants agree to participate in a
      52-week (1-year) program designed to enhance the primary care physician's knowledge and
      skills via self-directed and didactic coursework along with a transformational
      community-based project. The culmination of the mentorship, leadership, and educational
      experiences gained in the Master Preceptor Fellowship (MPF) will allow the primary care
      physician champion to apply his or her innovative response to an identified need in their
      community.
