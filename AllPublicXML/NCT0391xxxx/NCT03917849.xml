  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to investigate the efficacy of Inertial Flywheel Resistance
      program vs Heavy slow resistance in patients with chronic patellar tendinopathy.

      The investigators hypothesize that Inertial Flywheel Resistance program will yield a more
      positive clinical outcome and function in patients with patellar tendinopathy compared to
      heavy slow resistance group.

    <measure>Victorian Institute of Sports Assessment (VISA-P questionnaire)</measure>
    <time_frame>0 - 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Self-administered questionnaire. Consists of 8 items; 6 are used to evaluate pain levels or disability in daily activities and specific functional tests and 2 provide information regarding ability to play sport. Response options for each item are provided on a numeric rating scale (from 0 to 10), with higher scores indicating lower levels of pain or disability for all items other than 7 and 8, for which options have weighted scores.</description>

    <measure>Patient-Specific Functional Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>0 - 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported patient-specific outcome measure assess functional change, primarily in patients presenting with musculoskeletal disorders. Patients are asked to identify up to 3 important activities they are unable to perform or are having difficulty with as a result of their problem. In addition to identifying the activities, patients are asked to rate, on an 11-point scale, the current level of difficulty associated with each activity. Following the intervention, patients are asked again to rate the activities previously identified.</description>

    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Register patient's belief about the efficacy of treatment. PGIC is a 7 point scale depicting a patient's rating of overall improvement. Patients rate their change as &quot;very much improved,&quot; &quot;much improved,&quot; &quot;minimally improved,&quot; &quot;no change,&quot; &quot;minimally worse,&quot; &quot;much worse,&quot; or &quot;very much worse.&quot;</description>

    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To capture all adverse events and side effects that occurred after exercises protocol. Patients reported any changes or any symptoms. If a question was answered &quot;yes&quot;, we asked for further comments.</description>

    <description>The program is performed 3 times per week using resistance equipment in a fitness center. Each session consists of three 2-legged loaded quadriceps and lower limb kinetic chain exercises. The patients complete 3 or 4 sets in each exercise with a 2- to 3-minute rest between sets and a 5-minute rest period between the 3 exercises.
The number of repetitions decreases, and load gradually increases, every week. The repetitions and loads are as follows: 3 times, 15-repetition maximum (15RM ), in week 1; 3 times, 12RM , in weeks 2 to 3; 4 times, 10RM , in weeks 4 to 5; 4 times, 8RM , in weeks 6 to 8; and 4 times, 6RM , in weeks 9 to 12.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The program is performed 3 times per week using resistance equipment in a fitness center. Inertial flywheel resistance is a type of strength training; which is based on the increasing demands on eccentric action (breaking) after a concentric action (acceleration), due to the inertial load caused during the return movement. The patients complete 12 repetition máximum (RM) with moment inertia 0.05 m² from week 1-6 and 8 repetition máximum (RM) with moment inertia = 0.10 m² from week 6-12.</description>
