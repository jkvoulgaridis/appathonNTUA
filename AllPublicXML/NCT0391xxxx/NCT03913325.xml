  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Musculoskeletal pain is a leading cause of disability in the world. Although the
      majority of musculoskeletal-related pain conditions, such as low back pain, often resolves
      spontaneously, pain may recur or persist over a long time, potentially leading to disability
      and subsequent reduced work capacity and long-term sickness absence. There is a need for
      early identification of individuals in which this may occur, to prevent or reduce the risk of
      long-term musculoskeletal pain and long-term sickness absence. The aim of the trial described
      in this protocol is to evaluate a primary care rehabilitation model, PREVSAM, including early
      identification of patients at risk for long-term musculoskeletal pain and related sickness
      absence and a coordinated interdisciplinary rehabilitation programme based on individual and
      organizational resources.

      Methods: Eligible individuals will be recruited from primary care rehabilitation centres,
      health care centres, and occupational health centres, and include those who seek care for
      musculoskeletal pain and who are at risk of developing persistent pain, disability and
      sickness absence. Participants will be randomized to either treatment according to the
      PREVSAM model (intervention group) or treatment as usual (TAU) within primary care (control
      group). The PREVSAM model will comprise a person-centred rehabilitation plan, including
      coordinated measures within primary health care as well as in collaboration with
      participants' employers, and when relevant the Swedish Public Employment Agency. The primary
      outcome sickness absence will be measured at 12 months from the Swedish Social Insurance
      Agency regarding: the number and proportion of individuals who remain in full- or part-time
      work, the number of gross and net days of sickness during the follow-up period, and time to
      first sickness absence spell. Secondary outcomes are patient-reported work ability, pain,
      health-related quality of life, risk for sickness absence, anxiety/depression, disability and
      drug consumption at 1 and 3 months after inclusion (short-term follow-up), and at 6 and 12
      months (long-term follow-up).

      Discussion: This study is expected to provide new knowledge on how to best identify
      individuals at risk for long-term disability and sick leave due to musculoskeletal pain, and
      whether rehabilitation according to the PREVSAM model is effective. The study findings may
      contribute to more effective primary care rehabilitation processes of this large patient
      population, and potentially reduce sick leave and costs for healthcare and society.
