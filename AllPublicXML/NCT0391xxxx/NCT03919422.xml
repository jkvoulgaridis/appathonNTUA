    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effects of T2 paravertebral block block improving interscalene
      brachial plexus block and superficial cervical plexus block on the relief of pain intensity
      during elderly proximal humerus fracture fixation surgery. The brachial plexus and cervical
      plexus block(IC block) will be performed in half of participants, while the T2 paravertebral
      block combined with IC block will be performed in the other half.

    <description>An ultrasound-guided IC block using an ultrasound machine (Sonosite, USA), and an linear array probe with a sterile cover and a 22G(Gauge) block needle is performed. An in-plane approach, advancing the needle along the longitudinal axis of the ultrasound transducer and visualizing the entire shaft is employed. Twenty ml of 0.375% ropivacaine(naropin) is injected around brachial plexus and 10 ml of 0.25% ropivacaine around superficial cervical plexus.</description>
