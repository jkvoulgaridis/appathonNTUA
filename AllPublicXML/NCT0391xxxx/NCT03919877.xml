  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With this study the investigators want to understand the physiological differences for people
      developing pre-diabetes and diabetes. The investigators hypothesize that different
      individuals go through different paths in the development of the disease. By understanding
      the personal mechanism for developing disease, the investigators will find a personalized
      approach to prevent that development. The investigators are also hoping to be able to find a
      biomarker that will pinpoint to the particular defect and thus, diagnose the problem at an
      earlier stage and have the information to give personalized diet recommendations to prevent
      the development of diabetes more effectively.

    <description>All individuals will go through all the phases of the study.
Phase 1: Metabolic testing to determine insulin resistance status.
Phase 2: Participants follow their own diet while using the CGM (continuous glucose monitor). Participants are provided with 5-10 standardized foods to test during this phase.
Phase 3: Participants are provided with additional standardized foods and counseled to continue their own diet during this phase.
Phase 4: Participants are counseled on reducing or limiting the foods that caused glucose spikes and they are also counseled on macronutrient composition of their diet based on lipid profile. Participants use the CGM for another cycle of 2-3 weeks to assess effectiveness of the recommendations. Blood is drawn for analyses before and after this cycle.</description>
