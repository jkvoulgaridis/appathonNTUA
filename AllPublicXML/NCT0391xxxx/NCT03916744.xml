             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of
             study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient
             inappropriate for entry into this study

          -  History of allergy to GDC-9545 or any of its excipients

          -  Any condition requiring anti-coagulants, such as warfarin, heparin, or thrombolytic

             syndrome

          -  Current treatment with medications that are well known to prolong the QT interval

          -  History or presence of uncontrolled hypothyroidism

          -  Any other disease, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical
             laboratory finding that, in the investigator's opinion, gives reasonable suspicion of
             a disease or condition that contraindicates the use of an investigational drug or that
             may affect the interpretation of the results or render the patient at high risk from
