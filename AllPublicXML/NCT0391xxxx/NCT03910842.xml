  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, open-label, early phase Ⅰ study, to determine the safety and efficacy
      of CD19-TriCAR-T and CD19-TriCAR-SILK cell therapy in Children CD19+ Leukemia Non-Hodgkin
      lymphoma treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CD19-TriCAR contains an anti-CD19 scFv, a PD-L1 blocker, and a cytokine complex, enabling the
      CD19-TriCAR-T/SILK to simultaneously targeting the CD19 positive Leukemia or Non-Hodgkin
      lymphoma，blocking the inhibitory PD-L1 signal and stimulating innate T/NK cell activation and
      expansion, thus make it a tri- functional CAR (Tri-CAR). CD19-TriCAR-T is an autologous
      tri-functional CAR-T cell therapy, CD19-TriCAR-SILK is an Allogeneic tri-functional CAR- NK
      cell therapy, patients ineligible for leukapheresis or CAR-T therapy will be recommended for
      CD19-TriCAR-SILK therapy.
