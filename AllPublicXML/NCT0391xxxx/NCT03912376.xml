        Enrollment in this study will be open to all Memorial Sloan Kettering employees to act as
        healthy volunteers provided they meet eligibility criteria. Every effort will be made to
        include women and minorities in the research study. Employees who provide consent willfully
        and voluntarily may participate as a healthy volunteer once.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy volunteers, 18 to 45 years of age, inclusive. Healthy status is defined by
             absence of evidence of any active or chronic disease following a detailed medical and
             surgical history.

          -  Body mass index (BMI) between 18 to 30 kg/m2, inclusive, and with a minimum weight of
             50 kg.

          -  Able to participate and willing to give written informed consent and to comply with
             the study restrictions.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History or symptoms of any significant disease including (but not limited to),
             neurological, psychiatric, endocrine, cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal,
             hepatic, or renal disorder.

          -  Systolic blood pressure (SBP) greater than 140 or less than 90 mm Hg, and diastolic
             blood pressure (DBP) greater than 90 or less than 50 mm Hg.

          -  Use of any medications (prescription or over-the-counter [OTC]), vitamin, mineral,
             herbal, and dietary supplements within 21 days of study drug administration, or less
             than 5 half-lives (whichever is longer). Exceptions are paracetamol (up to 4 g/day).
             Other exceptions will only be made if the rationale is discussed and clearly
             documented between the Investigator and the sponsor.

          -  Concomitant disease or condition that could interfere with, or for which the treatment
             of might interfere with, the conduct of the study, or that would, in the opinion of
             the Investigator, pose an unacceptable risk to the subject in this study.

          -  Smokers as defined by any of the following criteria:

          -  Reported smoking of cigarettes within 12 months prior to screening; occasionally a
             cigarette is allowed, but not within 24 hours of the measurement.

          -  Any confirmed significant allergic reactions (urticarial or anaphylaxis) against any
             drug, or multiple drug allergies (non-active hay fever is acceptable).

          -  Unwillingness of inability to comply with the study protocol for any other reason.
