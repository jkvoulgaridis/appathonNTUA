  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: The annual incidence of ulcerative colitis (UC) amounts to 6-8 new cases per
      100.000. Patients are initially treated medically, and colitis refractory to medical
      management is treated surgically, mostly by means of an (emergency) colectomy or a
      proctocolectomy with ileal J-pouch anastomosis. Over the past 10 years evidence has been
      accumulating indicating that the appendix has an immunomodulatory role in patients with UC
      reducing the need for medication and perhaps even colectomy.

      Objective: The objective of this prospective observational cohort study is to evaluate the
      effect of appendectomy on the disease course of patients with active ulcerative colitis
      despite standard step-up treatment including biologicals. The second objective is to
      determine if histological inflammation in the appendix resection specimens can be reliably
      predicted by pre-operative endoscopic biopsies of the appendix and correlated to clinical and
      pathological response after appendectomy.

      Study design: The design of the study is a prospective observational cohort study of 80
      consecutive patients.

      Study population: Sixty patients of 18 years and older, with established diagnosis of UC and
      ongoing disease activity despite standard step-up treatment including biologicals.
      Furthermore, histological characteristics in appendix biopsies of 10 patients with non-active
      UC and 10 'healthy control' patients (e.g. patients undergoing endoscopy for polyps) will be
      evaluated and used as a reference control group.

      Intervention: Patients will undergo laparoscopic appendectomy in clinical or day care
      setting.

      Main study parameters/objectives: The primary outcome parameter is the number of patients
      achieving remission (Total Mayo score ≤2) 12 months after appendectomy. Secondary endpoints
      are reduction of medical therapy, the disease activity as measured with the Mayo score,
      colectomy rate, the health related quality of life and costs (EQ-5D, EORTC-QLQ-C30-QL and
      IBDQ), and histological appendix characteristics predictive of response.

      The study is designed as a prospective observational series including patients with active
      ulcerative colitis despite standard step-up treatment including biologicals. Sixty
      consecutive patients who are refractory to medical treatment will be recruited to evaluate
      the effect of the appendectomy on the disease course.

      Eligible patients will be counselled at the outpatient clinics. Patients with presumed
      therapy-refractory inflammation will undergo ileocolonoscopy, which is part of standard daily
      practice. When informed consent is given, the presence of a PARP will be documented, and
      additional biopsies of the appendix and coecal base will be taken, to determine histological
      inflammation grade. Active disease is required for inclusion, and is defined as a combined
      clinical and endoscopic Mayo-score of ≥5 with an endoscopic subscore of 2 or 3. After
      inclusion, a laparoscopic appendectomy will be performed within 9 weeks. Patients will be
      followed every 3 months after laparoscopic appendectomy to assess the patients' clinical
      condition and the non-invasive Mayo score. According to standard practice evaluating therapy
      change, a sigmoidoscopy will be performed within 6 months and a full ileocolonoscopy at 12
      months, including biopsies of the colon and coecal base, to assess mucosal appearance and
      complete the Mayo score.

      Postoperatively, patients will receive the similar medical treatment as given
      pre-appendectomy. If medication can be tapered post-appendectomy, this will be done according
      to the experience of the treating physician and current guidelines. Patients will complete
      health related quality of life questionnaires (EQ-5D, EORTC-QLQ-C30-QL and IBDQ) via email or
      a telemedicine application (MyIBDcoach) at inclusion and at 3, 6 and 12 months follow-up.

      The pre-operative endoscopic biopsies of the appendix will be used to determine if
      histological inflammation in the appendix resection specimens can be reliably predicted.
      Histological findings in the resection specimens will be correlated to clinical and
      pathological response after appendectomy. Furthermore, in 20 patients who are planned for
      colonoscopy (10 patients with non-active UC and 10 non-UC patients with polyps) additional
      appendix biopsies will be taken to use as a reference control group. Therefore, a total of 80
      patients will be recruited for this study.

    <description>Surgery will be performed under general anaesthesia. The laparoscopic appendectomy can be performed with the use of 3 trocars; one subumbilical, one suprapubic and one in the lower right quadrant of the abdomen. The appendix is removed using a laparoscopic endostapler enabling a safe and complete appendectomy with the cross stapling line at coecal base. Laparoscopic appendectomy will be performed by a gastrointestinal surgeon with sufficient experience in laparoscopic appendectomies (&gt;20).</description>
