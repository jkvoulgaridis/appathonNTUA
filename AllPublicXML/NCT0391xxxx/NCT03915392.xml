  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Magnetic resonance imaging of the middle ear has an increasing place in the therapeutic
      strategy in otology and especially for cholesteatoma. It is currently performed for
      complicated cholesteatomas and as part of the follow-up of operated patients to detect a
      recurrence or a cholesteatoma residue (alternative of choice to &quot;second look&quot; surgery). Some
      people take CT and MRI fusion to improve the localization of cholesteatoma. Many studies have
      investigated the diagnostic capabilities of MRI but very few have demonstrate their
      reliability in location diagnosis. The aim of the study was to propose a topographic reading
      method of the MRI of the middle ear and to evaluate the performances in the localization of
      the cholesteatoma in order to adapt the surgical management

        inclusion criteria

          -  Age: from 1 month and up

          -  Sex: man / woman

          -  Patient who had a tympanoplasty in closed technique, for the first surgical time of a
             cholesteatoma or for residual or recurrent cholesteatoma, performed by the same
             radiologist (Pr Anne Charpiot) with the following characteristics:

               -  Code of the Common Classification of Medical Acts (CCAM)

                    -  Exeresis of cholesteatoma with tympanoplasty in closed technique and
                       ossiculoplasty (CBFA002)

                    -  Exeresis of cholesteatoma with tympanoplasty in closed technique (CBFA006)

                    -  Exeresis of cholesteatoma confined to the tympanic cavity without
                       antro-attic exploration (CBFA005)

                    -  Tympanoplasty in closed technique with posterior tympanotomy (CBMD001)

                    -  Secondary tympanoplasty in closed technique (CBMD002)

               -  Diagnostic code of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD10)

                    -  Cholesteatoma of the middle ear (H71)

          -  Diagnosis of macroscopic and / or pathological cholesteatoma.

          -  Preoperative diagnosis of cholesteatoma on MRI of the middle ear performed in less
             than 6 months by the same radiologist (Pr Francis Veillon).

          -  Subject (or the holders of parental authority in the case of minors) having agreed to
             the use of medical data for the purpose of this research.

        Cholesteatoma is a very common disease in the pediatric population, with important
        functional issues, whose treatment is surgical. That's why our study includes minor
        subjects.

        Criteria of non-inclusion

          -  Refusal of the patient to participate in the study

          -  Absence of data concerning the diagnosis and / or localization of cholesteatoma on the
             operative record

          -  Subject under the protection of justice

          -  Subject under guardianship or curatorship

          -  Pregnancy (woman of childbearing age)

          -  Breastfeeding
