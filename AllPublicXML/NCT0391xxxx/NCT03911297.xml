  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects 10% of all women and usually presents with irregular
      menstrual periods and difficulties conceiving. However, PCOS is also a lifelong metabolic
      disorder and affected women have an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure,
      and heart disease. Increased blood levels of male hormones, also termed androgens, are found
      in most PCOS patients. Androgen excess appears to impair the ability of the body to respond
      to the sugar-regulating hormone insulin (=insulin resistance). The investigator has found
      that fat tissue of PCOS patients overproduces androgens and that this can result in a
      build-up of toxic fat, which increases insulin resistance and could cause liver damage. In a
      large cohort of women registered in a GP database, the study team have found that androgen
      excess increases the risk of fatty liver disease. The aim is to identify those women with
      PCOS who are at the highest risk of developing metabolic disease, which would allow for early
      detection and potentially prevention of type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, fatty liver and
      cardiovascular disease. The investigator will assess clinical presentation, androgen
      production and metabolic function in women with PCOS to use similarities and differences in
      these parameters for the identification of subsets (=clusters) of women who are at the
      highest risk of metabolic disease. The investigator will do this by using a standardised set
      of questions to scope PCOS-related signs and symptoms and the patient's medical history and
      measure body composition and blood pressure. This standardised recording of a patient's
      clinical presentation (=clinical phenotype) is called Phenome analysis. The investigator will
      collect blood and urine samples for the systematic measurement of steroid hormones including
      a very detailed androgen profile (=steroid metabolome analysis) and of thousands of
      substances produced by human metabolism (=global metabolome analysis). Phenome and metabolome
      data will then undergo integrated computational analysis for the detection of clusters
      predictive of metabolic risk.

  <detailed_description>

      The investigator propose an innovative approach to solving the clinical problem at hand, the
      lack of identified measurable parameters one can use to predict the risk of future metabolic
      disease in women diagnosed with PCOS.The chosen approach is the standardised collection of
      phenome and metabolome data and their unbiased integration by machine learning analysis.
      Utilising the detailed results of the clinical phenome and metabolome analysis in the
      DAISy-PCOS Phenome Study cohort, The study will aim to identify distinct subsets (=clusters)
      of PCOS patients that share similar characteristics. This approach has previously been used
      by the team to successfully identify distinct steroid markers that can serve as a &quot;malignant
      steroid fingerprint&quot; in urine to distinguish benign from malignant tumours in patients with
      incidentally discovered adrenal masses. Similarly, The investigator have used unbiased
      analysis of steroid metabolome data to reveal that patients with aldosterone excess also
      overproduce glucocorticoids and that the latter explains the majority of metabolic disease
      risk observed in affected patients.

      In the integrated analysis of the DAISy-PCOS phenome and metabolome data, The investigator
      will apply a variety of methods in the context of connectivity or centroid-based clustering
      and density estimation. Supervised relevance learning will give insight into markers, e.g.
      steroids, that are most decisive for the determination of cluster memberships. In addition,
      The investigator will use state-of-the-art visualisation and machine learning techniques
      based on adaptive similarity measures.the investigator will use integrative approaches,
      addressing the heterogeneous data from different sources as a whole, whilst considering
      data-driven adaptation of generative models for the underlying biological processes. The
      investigator will employ these approaches to characterise central phenotype clusters
      affecting large numbers of patients as the basis of personalised management including outcome
      prediction.
