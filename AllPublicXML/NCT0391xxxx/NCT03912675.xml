      The aim of the study is the objective assessment of the effectiveness of a micro-fragmented
      dermal extract obtained with Rigenera™ technology (patented by Human Brain Wave) in promoting
      the wound healing process in an in-vivo homogeneous experimental human acute surgical wound
      model. The study includes 20 patients with 24 acute post-surgical soft tissue loss and a
      planned sequential two-stage repair with dermal substitute and autologous split-thickness
      skin graft. Each acute post-surgical soft tissue loss is randomized to be treated either with
      Integra® dermal substitute enriched with the autologous dermal micro-grafts obtained with
      Rigenera™ technology (group A - Rigenera™ protocol) or with Integra® dermal substitute only
      (group B - Control). The re-epithelialization rate in the wounds is assessed in both groups
      at 4 weeks through digital photography with the software &quot;Image J&quot;. The dermal cell
      suspension enrichment with the Rigenera™ technology is considered effective if the
      re-epithelialized area is higher than the 25% of the total wound surface as this threshold is
      considered far beyond the expected spontaneous re-epithelialization rate.

    <intervention_model_description>The study includes 20 patients with 24 post-surgical defect in any site of the body with a size range 4-400 cm2. The acute post-surgical soft tissue loss is considered the experimental unit of the study irrespective of the number of wounds per patient. Each unit is randomized to be treated either with Integra® dermal substitute enriched with the autologous dermal micro-grafts obtained with RigeneraTM protocol (group A - RigeneraTM protocol - 12 units) or with Integra® dermal substitute only (group B - Control - 12 units). The expected endpoint is a spontaneous re-epithelialization higher than 25% of the total wound area in group A at 4 weeks. The secondary endpoint is the comparison of the re-epithelialization rate at 4 weeks after the first surgical stage between the group A and the controls. The re-epithelialization rate in the wounds is assessed through digital photography with the software &quot;Image J&quot;.</intervention_model_description>
