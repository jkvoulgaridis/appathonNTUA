  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is the most common joint replacement surgery and its incidence
      is expected to increase 673% to 3.48 million procedures annually by 2030. After more than 20
      years of follow-up data, TKA is confirmed to be an effective treatment for knee
      osteoarthritis, however, postoperative pain management continues to be a challenge despite
      advances in surgical techniques and anesthetic practice to minimize discomfort and enhance
      recovery. This acute post-surgical pain caused by extensive tissue damage and inflammation in
      TKA leads to restricted post-operative knee range of motion (ROM) and ability to mobilize.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient has concurrent painful physical condition not strictly related to the knee
             surgery that may require analgesic treatment (such as NSAIDs or opioid) that may
