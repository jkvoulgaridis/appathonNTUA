      This phase Ib/II trial studies the side effects of IRX-2, cyclophosphamide, and pembrolizumab
      work in treating participants with gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer that has come
      back or that has spread to other places in the body. Interleukins, such as those found in
      IRX-2, are proteins made by white blood cells and other cells in the body and may help
      regulate immune response. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Immunotherapy with monoclonal
      antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and
      may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving RX-2,
      cyclophosphamide, and pembrolizumab may work better in treating participants with gastric or
      gastroesophageal junction cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety profile of combination IRX‐2 regimen and pembrolizumab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the overall response rate of IRX‐2 regimen combined with pembrolizumab using
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 and immune modified RECIST
      criteria.

      II. To evaluate initial median progression‐free and overall survival in these patients
      treated with combination IRX‐2 regimen and pembrolizumab.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the circulating T cell profiles in patients before and after therapy with
      combination IRX‐2 regimen and pembrolizumab.

      II. To evaluate the baseline and post‐treatment tumor tissue immune gene expression profiling
      using the Nanostring platform.

      III. To explore identification of tumor tissue neoantigens through a multiplex proteomic
      assay (MHC‐PepSeq) paired with tumor genomic and transcriptomic sequencing.

      IV. To explore putative biomarkers (including circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA]
      and immune cell profiles) in peripheral blood to generate hypotheses for response to
      treatment with combination IRX‐2 regimen and pembrolizumab.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Participants
      also receive cyclophosphamide IV on day 1 and IRX‐2 subcutaneously (SC) for 10 days starting
      on day 4 during cycles 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29, and 33. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks
      for up to 35 cycles in the absence of disease or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up for 30 days and then up to
      1 year.
