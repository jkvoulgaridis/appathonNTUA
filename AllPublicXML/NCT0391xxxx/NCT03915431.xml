    <textblock>
      This is an initial Phase1/2 dose-finding, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center
      study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of NCS-01 in patients with acute ischemic
      stroke. All patients will be randomized within 24 hours of stroke onset. This study will be
      conducted in 2 stages.

    <description>Change from baseline in the NIHSS NIHSS is a systematic assessment tool that provides a quantitative measure of stroke-related neurologic deficit. The score for each ability is a number between 0 and 4, 0 being normal functioning and 4 being completely impaired. The patient's NIHSS score is calculated by adding the number for each element of the scale; 42 is the highest score possible. In the NIHSS, the higher the score, the more impaired a stroke patient is.</description>

    <description>Gait Velocity is a marker of functional and cognitive status in older adults. Slow gait speed has been associated with poor clinical outcomes such as cognitive decline, falls and hospitalization. Patients with gait speeds of 0.4 to 0.6 m/s, such as those with chronic stroke,20 are considered limited community ambulators.</description>

    <time_frame>multiple times for the duration of the study (baseline through Month 12)</time_frame>
    <description>The Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) is a stroke-specific, performance-based impairment index. It is designed to assess motor functioning, sensation, balance, joint range of motion and joint pain in patients with post-stroke hemiplegia (Fugl-Meyer, Jaasko, Leyman, Olsson, &amp; Steglind, 1975; Gladstone, Danells, &amp; Black, 2002). It is applied clinically and in research to determine disease severity, describe motor recovery, and to plan and assess treatment.</description>

    <description>an assessment tool to examine linguistic skills (information content, fluency, auditory comprehension, repetition, naming and word finding, reading, and writing) and main nonlinguistic skills (drawing, block design, calculation, and praxis) of adults with aphasia. The observed language behaviours facilitate diagnosis by classifying the patient as having 1 of 8 types of aphasia (Global, Broca's, Transcortical motor, Wernicke's, Transcortical sensory, Mixed transcortical, Conduction, and Anomic) according to primary aspects of language functioning (Risser &amp; Spreen, 1985). The WAB is also used to determine the location of the lesion.</description>

    <measure>Number of participants with change in Domain-specific Scales (Grip strength)</measure>
    <time_frame>multiple times for the duration of the study (baseline through Month 12)</time_frame>
    <description>Muscle strength is rated on a scale of 0/5 to 5/5 as follows:
0/5: no contraction 1/5: muscle flicker, but no movement 2/5: movement possible, but not against gravity (test the joint in its horizontal plane) 3/5: movement possible against gravity, but not against resistance by the examiner 4/5: movement possible against some resistance by the examiner (sometimes this category is subdivided further into 4-/5, 4/5, and 4+/5) 5/5: normal strength</description>
