  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will design and evaluate a computerized-delivered single-session anxiety
      sensitivity reduction program (i.e., Anxiety Sensitivity Training; AST). The AST will be
      designed to achieve three primary aims: (1) provide psycho-educational information on AS and
      its consequences, (2) present psycho-educational information on the relationship between AS
      and obesity-related health behavior correlates, and (3) offer concrete, evidence-based
      strategies to facilitate motivation to change their obesity-related lifestyle behaviors.

      The primary goal of the research study is to investigate the efficacy of a brief,
      computer-delivered transdiagnostic intervention that addresses anxiety sensitivity to reduce
      emotional eating, eating expectancies, food cravings, binge eating, perceived barriers to
      engage in physical activity, anxiety/depressive symptoms, severity of daily fatigue and
      increase perceived benefits to engage in physical activity, exercise self-efficacy,
      willingness to use adaptive coping strategies, and perceived physical health functioning. To
      address this aim, the investigator's will implement a randomized controlled trial that will
      employ a longitudinal experimental design and involve five stages: (a) phone-screener
      (pre-screener); (b) baseline appointment consisting of a pre-intervention assessment
      (eligibility) and random assignment to a one-session computer-delivered intervention (Active
      versus Control); (c) 1-week follow-up; (d) 2-week follow-up; (e) 1-month follow-up.

    <measure>Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Assess change from baseline to 1-week, 2-week and 1-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire will be used to assess emotional eating. Items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (never) to 5 (very often). For the current study, the emotional eating subscale (13 items) will be used as a measure of emotional eating. The 13 items of the subscale are summed and divided by 13 to create a mean score with a range from 1-5. Lower scores on this measure indicate better outcomes.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Eating Expectancy Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>Assess change from baseline to 1-week, 2-week and 1-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Eating Expectancy Inventory will be used to measure cognitive expectancies of eating. The Eating Expectancy Inventory subscale facets: eating helps manage negative affect; eating leads to feeling out of control; and eating alleviates boredom will be used in the current study. Respondents will be asked to rate on a 7-point Likert scale the degree to which they 1 (completely disagree) to 7 (completely agree) to each item. Responses are summed for each subscale. Lower scores on the 18-item eating helps manage negative affect subscale (possible range = 18 - 126), 4-item eating leads to feeling out of control subscale (possible range 4 - 28), and 4-item eating alleviates boredom subscale (possible range 4 - 28) indicate better outcomes.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Food Cravings Questionnaire-State Version</measure>
    <time_frame>Assess change from baseline to 1-week, 2-week and 1-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Food Cravings Questionnaire-State Version is a 15-item self-report measure used to assess the extent to which individuals experience food cravings. Participants are asked to rate on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) for each item. The Food Cravings Questionnaire-State Version assess five subscales each with 3-items including: (1) an intense desire to eat; (2) anticipation of positive reinforcement that may result from eating; (3) anticipation of relief from negative states and feelings as a result of eating; (4) obsessive preoccupation with food or lack of control over eating; and (5) craving as a physiological state. For the current study, the Food Cravings Questionnaire-State Version total score (all items summed) will be used as a measure of food cravings (possible range = 15 - 75) with lower scores indicating better outcomes.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Eating Disorder Diagnostic Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Assess change from baseline to 1-week, 2-week and 1-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Eating Disorder Diagnostic Scale is a 22-item questionnaire based on the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating disorder. For the current study, item 8 (&quot;How many times per week on average over the past 3 months have you eaten an unusually large amount of food and experienced a loss of control?&quot;) will be used to assess binge eating frequency with lower scores indicating better outcomes (possible range = 0 - 14).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Decisional Balance Measure</measure>
    <time_frame>Assess change from baseline to 1-week, 2-week and 1-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Decisional Balance Measure is a 16-item self-report measure that assesses perceived barriers/benefits to engage in exercise, in addition to the motivational and cognitive processes of behavior change for exercise. Items are rated on a 5- point Likert scale ranging from 1 (not important at all) to 5 (extremely important). The measure yields two factors, negative aspects of exercise (Cons: &quot;At the end of the day, I am too exhausted to be physically active&quot;), and positive aspects of exercise (Pros: &quot;Regular exercise would help me have a more positive outlook on life&quot;). Each subscale will be summed with lower scores on the 6-item Cons subscale indicate better outcomes (possible range = 6 -30) and higher scores on the Pros subscale indicate better outcomes (possible range = 10 -50).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Exercise Self-Efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>Assess change from baseline to 1-week, 2-week and 1-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Exercise self-efficacy will be assessed with a 5-item self-report assessment of one's confidence about their ability to engage in physical activity. Items are rated on a 9-point Likert-type scale that ranges from 0 (not at all confident) to 8 (extremely confident). A total score will be created by summing the 5-items with higher scores indicating a better outcome (possible range 0 - 40).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire Short Form</measure>
    <time_frame>Assess change from baseline to 1-week, 2-week and 1-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire-Short Form will be used to assess anxiety/depressive symptoms. Participants indicate how much they have experienced each symptom on a 5-point Likert-type scale (1 = Not at all to 5 = Extremely). Specifically, the Anxious Arousal subscale will be used to measure anxiety and the Anhedonic Depression subscale will be used to measure depression. The Anxious Arousal subscale consists of 17-items that will be summed with lower scores indicating better outcomes (range = 17 - 85). The Anhedonic Depression subscale consists of 22-items that will be summed with lower scores indicating better outcomes (range = 22 - 110).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Anxiety Sensitivity Index-3</measure>
    <time_frame>Assess change from baseline to 1-week, 2-week and 1-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Anxiety Sensitivity Index-3 is an 18-item measured that will be used to assess sensitivity to, and fear of, the potential negative consequences of anxiety-related symptoms and sensations. Items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 0 (Very Little) to 4 (Very Much). Scores will be calculated by summing all items (possible range = 0 -72), with lower scores indicating a better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Short-Form General Health Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>Assess change from baseline to 1-week, 2-week and 1-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Short-Form General Health Survey is a 20-item questionnaire in which respondents indicate on a Likert scale their health status across five domains: physical functioning, role functioning, social functioning, mental health, and health perceptions. The physical health functioning subscale will be used in the current study and consists of 6 items related to limitations in a variety of physical activities, ranging from strenuous to basic, due to health. Items range from 1 (limited for more than 3 months) to 3 (not limited at all). Items are transformed to a 0 to 100 scale and averaged to create a score for the subscale. Higher scores reflect a better outcome (possible range 0 - 100).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Fatigue Severity Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Assess change from baseline to 1-week, 2-week and 1-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) is a 9-item self-report measure of fatigue severity. Individuals are asked to indicate on a 7-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (strong disagreement) to 7 (strong agreement) which best fits each statement regarding fatigue within the last week. Items are summed for a total score with lower scores indicating a better outcome (possible range = 7-63).</description>
