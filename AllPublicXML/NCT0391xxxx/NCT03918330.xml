  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research on the human intestinal microbiota is common as there is rising evidence of its
      influence on host physiology and several diseases. Predominantly, it has been based on
      analyses of faecal samples because of their easy sampling. A minority of studies investigated
      the gut microbiota using mucosal samples. Not much is known about the spatial differences in
      microbiota composition along the large bowel. The spatial differences of the gut microbiota
      without preparation of the bowel have not been analysed yet. Furthermore, the composition of
      the microbiota of the luminal gut content has not been analysed yet.

      This study aims to gain knowledge of the microbial composition of luminal and mucosal samples
      at different segments of the lower gastrointestinal tract: ileum, caecum, ascending colon,
      transverse colon, descending colon, sigmoid colon and rectum, as well as of rectal swabs and
      faecal samples.

      The investigators aim to evaluate complete colonoscopies from 10 healthy subjects. This study
      is used as a first explorative study of how the human gut microbiota is distributed along the
      lower gastrointestinal tract. No comparable studies in an uncleansed bowel have been
      performed so far. The number of subjects is based on other studies investigating the
      microbial composition of mucosal- and faecal-associated microbiota in which a sample size of
      10 was enough to detect a difference. An equal number of men and women will be recruited.
      Drop-outs will be replaced.
