  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effects of dairy-free products consumed with a breakfast meal on food intake and
      glycaemic regulation remain unexplored. It is known that dairy products are an excellent
      source of protein, low glycaemic sugar lactose, calcium, and vitamin D. In our recent study
      the consumption of a dairy snack with high protein content resulted in reduced blood glucose
      response compared to non-dairy snack with the similar amount of available carbohydrate. The
      investigators hypothesize that the ad libitum intake of breakfast cereals served with a
      high-protein fermented dairy product will result in reduced and sustained blood glucose
      response compared to non-dairy control. The objective of this study is to investigate how
      dairy and non-dairy cultured products used as carriers for breakfast granola cereals and
      consumed ad libitum affect short-term food intake, satiety, and glycaemia within two hours.
