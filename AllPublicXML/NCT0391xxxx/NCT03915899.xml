  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Migration is common in rural Africa: in-migrants have higher HIV incidence and prevalence
      than community residents, but underutilize combined HIV prevention and care services,
      including voluntary medical male circumcision and antiretroviral therapy, increasing the
      risks of HIV acquisition and onward transmission. Uptake of combined HIV prevention (CHP) is
      critical in this vulnerable population. The investigators will conduct a community randomized
      trial to rapidly identify and link migrants to CHP in rural Uganda; if effective, the
      intervention could be widely implemented as an important strategy towards HIV epidemic
      control.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Rakai Health Sciences Program (RHSP), Uganda, proposes an implementation science
      community- randomized controlled trial (CRCT) of a novel intervention to newly in-migrated
      individuals (&quot;Welcome Incoming Neighbor&quot; [WIN]), to optimize in-migrated individuals' rapid
      linkage to combination HIV prevention (CHP) services. RHSP data show that within the first 36
      months after in-migration, compared to residents, HIV-negative in-migrants are at increased
      risk of HIV acquisition and HIV+ in-migrants underutilize antiretroviral therapy (ART)
      increasing the risk of onward transmission. The theory-based WIN intervention includes
      community sensitization and community-based WIN scouts (WINs). WINs will conduct active
      community surveillance to rapidly identify and welcome in-migrants, provide the in-migrants
      with information about the availability of CHP and high rates of use by residents (to
      &quot;normalize&quot; uptake), utilize a motivational interviewing approach to encourage CHP adoption,
      refer in-migrants to free services, and follow-up in-migrants to assess and further encourage
      engagement in CHP. Specific Aims: Aim 1: To randomize 40 individually matched communities in
      a 1:1 ratio to the WIN intervention or control arm. In-migrants aged 15-49 in each arm will
      undergo a baseline and 2 follow-up surveys at ~18-month intervals. Study end points are CHP
      coverage rates, HIV incidence in initially HIV-negative in-migrants (n ~3,800 py per arm),
      and viral load suppression in HIV+ (n ~740 per arm). Aim 2a: To use a mixed methods approach
      (in-depth interviews, process &amp; survey data) and RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption,
      Implementation, Maintenance) to (i) guide interim intervention adaptation as necessary; (ii)
      interpret trial results; and, (iii) translate the research into future action. Aim 2b: To
      conduct cost studies to provide information on affordability and sustainability. Innovation
      and Impact: This novel intervention will rapidly engage a vulnerable priority population of
      in-migrants, to optimize CHP and HIV impact in rural Uganda.

    <ipd_description>The Rakai Health Sciences Program (RHSP) has a written policy on the sharing of data and of laboratory specimens. Institutions, groups or researchers who propose to use Rakai data or specimens are required to submit a brief proposal/data request form describing the goals and methods of the proposed analyses. Based on this document and additional discussions with the party(ies) proposing the collaboration, the decision as to whether and/or how to proceed is made by consensus between senior Ugandan and US-based Investigators. The decision takes into account Uganda Ministry of Health directives regarding the maximization of research findings and safeguards regarding misuse, misappropriation or misinterpretation of data. Feasibility, availability of resources (such as Rakai Program analysts' time to help prepare and anonymize data sets to ensure no potential loss of confidentiality), and research importance/priority are also taken into consideration.</ipd_description>
