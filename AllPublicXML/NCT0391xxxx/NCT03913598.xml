      The Internet and social media bear potential in terms of heath care consumer education,
      prevention of diseases and dissemination of evidence-based information. The use of the
      internet and social media platforms both by dermatologists and patients is rapidly evolving.
      In order to improve the presence and visibility of dermatology-related evidence-based
      informations on the Internet and in social media, the use and behavior of dermatology
      patients in this context is studied in more detail.
