  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study evaluates whether lung ultrasound monitoring could lead to earlier detection of
      ventilator associated pneumonia and influence outcome. Half of the participants will be
      diagnosed with VAP using a combination of lung ultrasound and clinical features and half will
      be diagnosed using the Johanson criteria, which is a combination of clinical features and
      chest x-ray.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current guidelines recommend the use of chest x-ray or computed tomography of the chest
      to aid in the diagnosis of VAP. However many studies have shown that chest x-ray is neither
      very sensitive nor specific for pneumonia, and computed tomography, though has the highest
      diagnostic accuracy, is not routinely performed due to logistics, safety concerns, economics
      and radiation exposure.

      Emerging studies including meta-analyses have shown high sensitivity and specificity of lung
      ultrasound in diagnosing pneumonia. When combined with clinical and microbiological features
      it has shown to be helpful in early diagnosis of VAP, but a study to show whether such early
      detection improves outcome is lacking.
