  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare patients that receive hyperbaric oxygen or Trental and Vitamin E
      immediately after completion of radiation therapy to evaluate which treatment best reduces
      radiation fibrosis.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in breast fibrosis using Bakers Grade Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Administered at week 1, week 7, week 13, week 25, week 53, and week 157.</time_frame>
    <description>The Bakers Grade Assessment will be used to evaluate if lower incidence and severity of radiation fibrosis is observed in patients receiving post-operative hyperbaric oxygen treatment as compared to Trental and Vitamin E. The difference-from-baseline (DFB) score will be calculated to determine the incidence and severity of radiation fibrosis. Some patients may develop radiation fibrosis at a later time so the assessment will be done multiple throughout the three years to capture timing of fibrosis onset.</description>

    <measure>Objective measurements of tissue pliability using a Tissue Compliance Meter</measure>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patients' sense of well-being using SF-20 Quality of life survey.</measure>
    <time_frame>Administered at week 1, week 7, week 13, week 25, week 53, and week 157.</time_frame>
    <description>Short Form 20 is a survey that patients complete to indicate their overall quality of life. The SF-20 is weighted and summed to provide easily interpretable scales for physical and mental health.</description>

    <measure>Pain in radiated breasts using a Visual Analog Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Administered at week 1, week 7, week 13, week 25, week 53, and week 157.</time_frame>
    <description>Visual Analog Scale is a way for patients to assess their pain, on a scale of one to ten with ten being worst pain imaginable.</description>
