      It was difficult to obtain clinical benefits through traditional chemotherapy and
      radiotherapy for the patients who have recurrence or metastasis tumor even though they have
      received first-line chemotherapy or combined radiotherapy before, but failed.The aim of this
      study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of apatinib, an anti-angiogenesis drug, in the
      treatment of patients with advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma who had recurrence or
      metastasis after radical resection

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Esophageal cancer is a common malignant tumor in China and its prognosis is poor. Its main
      treatment methods include surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. However, the 5-year
      survival rate of esophageal cancer after operation is only about 40%. The main cause of
      treatment failure is postoperative recurrence and metastasis.The 2-year recurrence rate of
      esophageal cancer after radical operation was 50%, the median recurrence time was about 10
      months and the 2-year survival rate was less than 15% for these patients.For patients with
      local recurrence, endoscopic submucosal resection, salvage resection and radiotherapy could
      be chosen. Palliative chemotherapy is another important method for patients with recurrence
      or metastasis who are not suitable for surgery or radiotherapy.Cisplatin combined with
      fluorouracil is a usually used first-line chemotherapy regimen, but the response rate is less
      than 30% and the median survival time is only about 6~10 months.There is no standard
      second-line treatment for patients who have failed first-line treatment. Over the past
      decade, the second-line treatment for esophageal cancer is mostly phase I and II studies. The
      reported objective remission rate(ORR) ranges from 2.8% to 45%, the median progression-free
      survival (PFS) ranges from 1.2 to 5.2 months and the median overall survival (OS) ranges from
      3.7 to 11.4 months.Although some studies have shown that taxus-based second-line chemotherapy
      can bring a certain degree of remission to patients, irinotecan, gemcitabine and oxaliplatin
      can also be used as the second-line chemotherapy options for these patients, but the overall
      efficiency is low and disease progression occurs quickly.The median survival time of
      esophageal stent, nasal feeding nutrition support and gastrostomy is only 6 months, and the
      1-year survival rate is generally less than 5%.The previous treatment options are few and the
      therapeutic effect is poor for the patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer who have
      received neoadjuvant chemotherapy combined with or without radiotherapy and adjuvant
      chemotherapy combined with or without radiotherapy after radical resection and those patients
      with persistent or new occurred recurrence and metastasis. At present, there is no consensus
      on the second-line treatment strategy for recurrent and metastasis esophageal squamous cell
      carcinoma after radical resection and there are various clinical options.Therefore, it is of
      great clinical significance to explore the second-line treatment strategy for these patients.

      In recent years, with the development of molecular targeted therapy, it has been applied to
      the treatment of esophageal cancer, which is not only expected to ensure clinical efficacy,
      but also to reduce the adverse effects of amount of traditional chemotherapy and
      radiotherapy.At present, research on targeted therapy for esophageal cancer is gradually
      increasing. Targeted therapeutic drugs mainly include epidermal growth factor receptor(EGFR)
      inhibitors,vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGF) inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies,
      cyclooxygenase(COX) inhibitors and so on.Studies have confirmed that VEGF is highly expressed
      in the development of various malignant tumors including esophageal cancer, which may be
      closely related to tumor invasion and metastasis.As a VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor,
      apatinib mainly treats malignant tumors by inhibiting VEGFR to exert anti-angiogenic
      effects.Previous studies have confirmed that apatinib was safe and effective in the treatment
      of advanced gastric cancer and adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction which was
      approved by China food and drug administration(CFDA).

      In summary, it was difficult to obtain clinical benefits through traditional chemotherapy and
      radiotherapy for the patients who have recurrence or metastasis tumor even though they have
      received first-line chemotherapy or combined radiotherapy before, but failed.The aim of this
      study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of apatinib, an anti-angiogenesis drug, in the
      treatment of patients with advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma who had recurrence or
      metastasis after radical resection.
