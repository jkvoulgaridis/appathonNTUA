    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the efficacy and feasibility of an integrated,
      prescriptive, and trackable wellness intervention amongst resident physicians combining five
      wellness elements including exercise, mindfulness, sleep, social connectedness, and
      nutrition.

      Data from the initial pilot of Wild 5 Wellness data reported at the Annual US Psychiatric
      Congress Meeting demonstrated positive results with their 30-day intervention: This study
      uses compelling proof that even a non-medication, self-directed, low cost 30-day
      intervention, focusing on mental wellness offers clinically significant help with mood,
      anxiety, mindfulness, sleep, social connectivity, and emotional eating (Jain et al., 2015)

      The purpose of this study is to explore the efficacy and feasibility of an integrated,
      prescriptive, and trackable wellness intervention amongst residents at Orange Park Medical
      Center (OPMC) by combining five wellness elements including: exercise, mindfulness, sleep,
      social connectedness, and nutrition.

      Data will be collected to evaluate participants' adherence and response to a 5-pronged 30-day
      wellness intervention. It is expected that this 30-day integrated, prescriptive, and
      trackable program will be found to be an efficacious wellness intervention among residents at
      OPMC.

      To the best of our knowledge, even though there is abundant research supporting each of the
      WILD 5 Wellness elements (exercise, mindfulness, sleep, social connectedness, and nutrition)
      individually, there is no research exploring the effectiveness of an integrated,
      prescriptive, and trackable wellness intervention combining these five elements. Therefore,
      this work will be unique in that it will collect both objective and subjective data to assess
      the feasibility and effectiveness of this type of wellness intervention. It will lend support
      to the growing body of research on the efficacy of wellness interventions for a variety of
      different health conditions, as well as a residency-based population. Finally, it is hoped
      that positive results will yield increased access to and utilization of this type of
      intervention, thereby improving resident wellness.
