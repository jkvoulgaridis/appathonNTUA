      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and how well BGB-290 and temozolomide work in
      treating patients with gliomas (brain tumors) with IDH1/2 mutations that have come back.
      BGB-290 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell
      growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by
      stopping them from spreading. Giving BGB-290 and temozolomide may work better in treating
      patients with recurrent gliomas.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      (Phase I) I. Determine the safety and tolerability of the combination of PARP inhibitor
      BGB-290 (BGB-290) and temozolomide (TMZ) in patients with recurrent IDH1/2 mutant glioma,
      including the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and characterization of dose-limiting toxicities
      (DLTs) in the Phase I portion.

      (Phase II) II. Determine the overall response rate of BGB-290 with TMZ in patients with
      recurrent IDH1/2-mutant gliomas that have progressed on TMZ and another alkylator (Arm A) in
      the Phase II portion.

      III. Determine the overall response rate of BGB-290 with TMZ in patients with recurrent
      IDH1/2-mutant glioma that have failed one alkylator with &gt;= 12 months since last treatment
      (Arm B) in the Phase II portion.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the safety and tolerability of the combination of PARP inhibitor BGB-290
      (BGB-290) and temozolomide (TMZ) in patients with recurrent IDH1/2 mutant glioma, including
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and characterization of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) in
      the Phase I portion. (Phase I) II. Determine the overall response rate of BGB-290 with TMZ in
      patients with recurrent IDH1/2-mutant gliomas that have progressed on TMZ and another
      alkylator (Arm A) in the Phase II portion. (Phase II) III. Determine the overall response
      rate of BGB-290 with TMZ in patients with recurrent IDH1/2-mutant glioma that have failed one
      alkylator with &gt;= 12 months since last treatment (Arm B) in the Phase II portion. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) after treatment
      with BGB-290 and TMZ in recurrent IDH1/2-mutant gliomas in Arms A and B.

      II. Determine the duration of response to therapy in recurrent IDH1/2-mutant glioma.

      III. Confirm the safety and tolerability of BGB-290 in combination with TMZ.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess tumor response rates, PFS, and OS in patients with World Health Organization (WHO)
      grade IV glioblastoma (GBM) treated with BGB-290 and TMZ.

      II. Assess the mutational landscape via whole-exome sequencing (WES). III. Assess gene
      expression patterns using ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing (RNAseq).

      IV. Assess the methylation profiling with Infinium methylation assays. V. Quantify
      2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) in archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens via
      liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) detection and correlate with treatment
      response.

      VI. Correlate response with 2HG levels, somatic alterations, gene expression/methylation
      patterns in FFPE tumor tissue.

      VII. Assess tumor tissue BGB-290 levels, 2HG, and PolyADP-ribosylation (PARylation) in a
      patient subset treated with drug prior to re-resection.

      VIII. Evaluate changes in tumor growth rate in subjects with non-enhancing glioma based on
      fluid attenuated inverse recovery (FLAIR) tumor volume measurements of serial MRI exams.

      IX. Assess if change in tumor growth rate (based on FLAIR tumor volume) in subjects with
      non-enhancing glioma before and after treatment is associated with progression by Response
      Assessment in Neuro-Oncology for Low Grade Gliomas (RANO LGG; phase II patients only) or
      survival.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose de-escalation study of temozolomide followed by a phase II
      study.

      PHASE I: Patients receive PARP inhibitor BGB-290 orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28
      and temozolomide PO once daily (QD) on days 1-28, 1-21, 1-14, or 1-7. Courses repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      SURGICAL PORTION: 10 patients eligible for re-resection at the time of recurrence receive
      PARP inhibitor BGB-290 PO BID on days 1-6 and QD on day 7 (the morning of surgery). Within 45
      days after surgery, patients receive PARP inhibitor BGB-290 PO BID on days 1-28 and
      temozolomide on the schedule established in Phase I. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PHASE II: Patients receive PARP inhibitor BGB-290 PO BID on days 1-28 and temozolomide PO QD
      on the schedule established in Phase I. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days, every 2 months for
      2 years, then every 6 months thereafter.

               -  Arm B patients must have WHO grade II-III glioma and have experienced tumor
                  progression after TMZ or another alkylator (maximum one prior chemotherapy
                  regimen), and have gone &gt;= 12 months since last treatment (chemotherapy or RT).
                  Prior radiation therapy (RT) is allowed but not mandated.

               -  GBM Arm patients must have WHO grade IV glioblastoma following radiotherapy

             treatment on this protocol. Patients may be on non-enzyme inducing anti-epileptic
             drugs or not be taking any anti-epileptic drugs. Patients previously treated with
             EIAEDs may be enrolled if they have been off the EIAED for 10 days or more prior to
             the first dose of BGB-290.

          -  Patients who have not recovered to &lt; Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
             (CTCAE) grade 2 toxicities apart from alopecia related to prior therapy are
             ineligible.

          -  Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing
             or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, clinically significant
             cardiac disease, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements, are
             ineligible.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the effects of BGB-290 on a fetus
             are unknown. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in
             nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with BGB-290, breastfeeding
             should be discontinued if the mother is treated with BGB-290.

          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination antiretroviral
             therapy are ineligible due to potential drug-drug interactions with BGB-290.
