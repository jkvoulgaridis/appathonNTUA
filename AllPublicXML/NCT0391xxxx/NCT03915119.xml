  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop and test a VR training system that integrates GFT AI
      with virtual obstacle scenarios that, when compared to a sham-VR training system, is
      hypothesized to increase neuromechanical and perceptual-motor fitness, decrease collision
      frequency and impact forces for soccer athletes, during a single training session and also
      when assessed at approximately 1 week and 1 month following training.

    <textblock>
      Player collisions cause over 70% of concussion injuries in contact sports, in addition to 50%
      of lower extremity injuries and 40% of catastrophic knee ligament injuries. The majority of
      these collisions are unanticipated, and associated with reduced neuromechanical and
      perceptual-motor fitness underlying an athlete's adaptability to on-field conditions. Thus,
      training collision anticipation necessitates a method that taps into neuromechanical and
      perceptual-motor fitness. Virtual reality (VR) is a tool that can target these mechanisms,
      while providing a safe, well-controlled environment for assessment and training. The current
      proposal innovates on VR with the integration of genetic fuzzy tree (GFT) artificial
      intelligence (AI) to drive scenario configuration designed to target modifiable mechanisms
      and tailored to the individual athlete's performance capabilities, for the optimization of
      behavior modification and skill transfer. The current study will examine test a GFT AI-driven
      VR collision anticipation training compared to a sham-VR training system in healthy soccer
      athletes.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pro-saccades test</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Pro-saccades will be tested as participants track discrete target motion that will jump randomly by 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, or 24˚ on the screen in a horizontal and vertical direction, at intervals varying pseudo randomly between 1.0 and 2.0 s. The current fixation target will be extinguished at the same time as the next peripheral target appears. The test sequence will take 30 s/trial (2 trials) and all participants will be instructed to follow the targets as quickly and accurately as possible</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self paced saccades</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Self-paced saccades will be assessed as the participant glances back and forth as quickly and accurately as possible between two constantly visual targets at ± 15˚ horizontally from one another. This test will take 30 s per trial and the participant will perform 2 trials.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anti-saccades test</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Anti-saccades will be tested as participants are presented discrete targets that jump randomly by 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, or 24˚ on the screen in a horizontal and vertical direction, at intervals varying pseudo randomly between 1.0 and 2.0 s while a cross-hairs is present in the center of the screen. The athletes will be instructed to fixate on the cross-hairs and at the moment each object appears, to saccade in the opposite direction and then return their gaze back to the cross-hairs for the start of the next trial.</description>

    <description>Initial Visit: navigates a cluttered array of fixed and moving virtual obstacles to reach a way-point (goal) as fast and efficiently (avoiding obstacles) as possible. In each block, task difficulty (i.e., complexity) will increase linearly, regardless of success or failure (≥ 1 collision before reaching the goal).

    <description>navigates a cluttered environment of stationary and moving/pursuing virtual obstacles to reach a way-point as quickly and efficiently as possible. Block order and difficulty, as well as the behavior of the obstacles in each block, will be driven by the AI and statistically weighted to specifically target the perceptual-motor and neuromechanical mechanisms based on each athlete's visit 1 performance</description>
