  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, multiple-dose trial conducted at a single center. The
      treatment period will consist of three 6 g doses (18 g) of ZTI-01 as a 1-hour intravenous
      (IV) infusion (+10 minute window). A total of 30 enrolled subjects will be randomized to
      undergo a single standardized bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) at one of five
      sampling times. A total of 6 subjects will be assigned to each BAL-sampling time. Up to ten
      additional enrolled subjects will act as alternates to obtain 30 evaluable subjects. An
      evaluable subject is defined as a subject who receives all doses of ZTI-01, undergoes BAL at
      the randomized sampling timepoint with BAL return volume adequate for testing, and undergoes
      at least the one blood sampling timepoint that is concurrent with the assigned BAL sampling
      timepoint, with blood sampling volume that is adequate for testing. The objectives of the
      study are to assess safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) for a multiple dose regimen of
      IV-infused ZTI-01.
