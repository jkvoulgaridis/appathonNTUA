    <description>By taken children whose mother infected ,how many of them infected by this microbe by taken these child and done the following investigastion as stool antigen test and biobsy if they are postive by test and then follow up by treatment</description>

    <measure>Asse the effect of Helicobacter pylori infection in children with anemia</measure>
    <time_frame>Period from April 2019 to April 2020</time_frame>
    <description>By knowing effect of this microbe on growth development of children by measure weigt /height through body mass index and measure heamoglbin level
By taken children whose positive H pylori follow effect of this microbe on heamoglbin level and do investigation as complete blood count By following test such as complete blood count and heamoglbin level and if this microbe increase level of anemia or not</description>
