      Liver resection is the only curative treatment option for primary and secondary liver tumors.
      For some primary or secondary malignancies (HCC, NET) liver transplantation is a possible
      treatment option. Unfortunately, the majority of patients show a high hepatic tumor load or
      adverse intrahepatic distribution, that resection or transplantation at the time of initial
      diagnosis is not possible. In that case different treatment approaches are possible. For
      those patients that are very unlikely to ever become resectable, palliative systemic therapy
      is the preferred treatment option. For those patients that may become resectable after
      downsizing of the tumors or increase of volume of the future liver remnant secondary
      resection after induction therapy may be a possibility. Then, an induction treatment that has
      the most likelihood of causing physical shrinkage of the tumors is usually preferred. One of
      the approaches to create contralateral hypertrophy to increase future liver remnant is portal
      vein embolization. However, tumor growth might be stimulated during the phase of hypertrophy.
      Selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) with SIR-Spheres Y-90 resin microspheres is an
      endovascular interventional radio-oncologic procedure treating primary and secondary liver
      tumors1-3. It offers radiation therapy with yttrium-90, a high-energy beta-emitting isotope,
      directly in the vascular system of liver tumors. It treats the tumor locally, saves healthy
      liver tissue and could lead to hypertrophy of this residual healthy liver tissue due to the
      embolization effect. Therefore secondary liver resection after SIRT might become possible4,5.
      SIRT could also be an option as bridging-, downsizing- or downstaging-therapy before liver
      transplantation.

      Liver resection with local tumor treatment and hypertrophy induction after SIRT seems to be a
      promising therapy option. Previous reports have shown the feasibility, safety and efficacy of
      this therapeutic strategy.

      Aim of the European SIR-Spheres Surgical Registry - ESSURE - is now to further improve the
      understanding and optimize the process and patient selection of this therapy strategy in its
      true clinical setting. This registry enables data collection on the real-life clinical
      application of liver resection/liver transplantation after SIRT.

    <description>The ESSURE registry is a prospective observational study. Patients are only asked to be enrolled when they are treated with SIR-Spheres microspheres followed by liver resection/liver transplantation or when SIRT has been performed with the intention to downsize/ downstage the tumor, to induce hypertrophy of the contralateral lobe, making the patient eligible for a future liver resection/transplantation. In no way will participation in the registry influence the way in which the patient is treated according to the treating clinician, or will it influence the quality of the treatment. If a patient is included in the registry, a documented decision of a multidisciplinary tumour board for the treatment algorithm including SIRT must be available. The follow-up periods depend on the treating clinician and local practice and guidelines. Typically, the follow ups are done every three months. So data of a single patient will be included over two years after the treatment.</description>
