  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Weekly electronic reporting of patient-reported outcomes will be tested in a national trial
      in participants undergoing radiotherapy for head and neck cancer.

      The study is a national study under the Danish Head and Neck Cancer Group (DAHANCA) and all 6
      centers in Denmark will participate.

      The clinical endpoints will be:

        -  Quality of life

        -  Objective toxicity score (DAHANCA)

        -  Opioid treatment

        -  Tube feeding

        -  Weight loss

        -  Hospitalization

        -  Compliance to treatment
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a high level of evidence for improved disease control in head and neck cancer (HNC)
      using regimens with accelerated radiotherapy and concomitant chemotherapy. These intense
      regimens can result in severe acute and late side effect. The standard approach for
      documenting symptomatic adverse events (AEs) in cancer clinical trials involves investigator
      reporting using the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) Common Terminology Criteria for
      Adverse Events (CTCAE). In Denmark, the Danish Head and Neck Cancer Group (DAHANCA) toxicity
      score has been used as an instrument in assessing objective treatment induced toxicity. New
      research in other cancer treatments indicate, that systematic patient assessment of side
      effects may improve treatment outcome. Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) can be used for
      symptom monitoring. Interactive use of PRO may secure early recognition of specific symptoms
      in the individual patient and timely management of side effects.

      This trial it is a prospective nationwide, single armed sequential cohort study will
      investigate the effects of active use of PROs in clinical counselling and decision making
      during primary or post-operative curative radiotherapy for squamous-cell carcinoma of the
      head and neck (HNSCC). It will investigate quality of life and the management of side effects
      in standard clinical counselling (control group) versus standard clinical counselling plus
      the PRO (PRO group). The EORTC QLQ-C30 (quality of life questionnaire) and EQ-D5-L5 will be
      answered in both groups. In the PRO group the participants will be asked to complete the
      electronic PRO (PRO CTCAEâ„¢ HNC relevant items supplemented by HNC specific items fra the
      EORTC library) weekly. The electronic PRO questionnaire is designed to give feedback to
      treating physician and nurses at visits during and shortly after radiotherapy.

    <description>EQ-5D-5L measures individual generic health status using 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression, and each dimension has 5 levels depending on severity of symptoms (1 no problems, 5 extreme problems) and a VAS (visual analogue scale). The scores can then be converted into a single index number. The index value will be used for calculation of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for a health economic analysis of the intervention. The scores will be presented graphically in separate figures. Differences between the groups will be tested using t-test and analysis of covariance.</description>
