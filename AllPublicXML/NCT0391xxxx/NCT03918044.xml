  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous research has suggested that cesarean section may be associated with an increased
      risk of developing obesity in childhood, adolescence and adulthood. Yet, previous studies
      have been small or unable to differentiate between elective and non-elective cesarean
      section. Therefore, using a population-based cohort the purpose is to examine the
      associations between vaginal delivery, elective and non-elective cesarean section on the risk
      of developing obesity in young adulthood among Swedish young singleton males. Using the
      Swedish medical birth registry, the recorded mode of delivery and indication of delivery
      which will be matched to those males who perform military conscription, where their body mass
      index is recorded. The investigators hypothesize that there will be an elevated risk of
      obesity in those born with non-elective cesarean section, as a function of confounding, while
      those born with elective cesarean section will not have a higher risk of obesity than those
      born with vaginal delivery.
