  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the randomized, double-blind clinical trial with placebo is to answer the clinical
      question , or in children with diagnosed childhood early caries the use of L.salivarius and
      cranberry contained in NutroPharma lozenges will reduce new carious lesions and reduce the
      titre of the carcinogenic bacteria Streptococcus mutans, compared to the control group in
      which the placebo will be administered? The main end point will be to reduce the titre of
      cariogenic bacteria.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Probiotic bacteria are used in the prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal diseases and
      infections, including the treatment of oral diseases. Probiotic bacteria can be found in
      saliva, plaque and adhering directly to the mucous membrane. They compete with cariogenic
      bacteria and pathogens of periodontal disease. Increased interest in probiotics means that
      attempts are being made to find new solutions regarding the methods of their administration.
      The use of probiotic bacteria brings beneficial health effects. Lactobacillus salivarius is a
      strain isolated from human milk. It is inactive (heat treatment) and therefore does not
      produce metabolites that can promote the formation of carious lesions in the mouth by
      lowering the mouth potential of hydrogen.
