  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed as a lead-in adherence study evaluating feasibility followed by full
      pilot evaluating the prehabiliation and ERAS protocols. This study will first assess a
      5-patient lead-in cohort to determine if patients adequately adhere to the prehabilitation
      protocol. If successful, the study will proceed with a full pilot of the multimodal
      prehabiliation protocol.

      Prehabilitation is not well studied in the STS population. As such, a secondary goal of this
      study will be to determine the effects of the multi-modal prehabilitation and ERAS protocols
      on physical function and quality of life outcomes.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of prescribed dietary and physical therapy visits completed during the prehabilitation period</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 90 days following surgery</time_frame>
    <description>-This will be quantified as the proportion of prescribed visits within the prehabilitation protocol that are attended by the patient. If a patient participates in any portion of a prescribed visit, it will be counted as attended.</description>
  </primary_outcome>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life as measured by the PROMIS Global total score</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline through 90 day follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>-PROMIS scales to be used: Physical Function-10, Ability to Participate in Social Roles, Pain Interference, Anxiety and Depression, and Activities-4 and Global Health assessments. These are validated instruments with items ranked on a 5-point Likert scale. PROMIS is scored using T scores, which are standardized to the U.S. general population and have a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. Scores above or below 50 are above or below the population average in the U.S. general population, respectively. The total T score will be calculated for this outcome measure</description>

    <measure>Patient cardiovascular capacity as measured by the 6-minute walk test</measure>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient general physical health status as measured by 30-second sit to stand test</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline through 90 day follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>-The 30 second chair stand test is used to measure functional lower extremity strength and overall endurance. Participants are asked to go from a sitting position to standing from a chair as many times as they can within 30 seconds. Higher numbers of sit to stand correlate with increased physical function and lower body strength</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient fall risk as measured by Timed Up and Go test</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline through 90 day follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>-The Timed Up and Go is a performance test of physical mobility and fall risk. The TUG measures how long it takes the patient, in seconds, to stand up from a standard arm chair, walk a distance of 3 meters (approximately 10 feet), turn, walk back to the chair, and sit down again. Scores of 11 or below are predictive of fall risk</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient general physical health status as measured hand grip strength</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline through 90 day follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>-Hand grip strength is measured with the Jamar hydraulic handgrip dynamometer. Measurement is completed with participant in seated position, holding arm at side, elbow at 90 degrees, and with dynamometer at either second or third position (based on size of hands, smaller hands position 2, larger hands position 3) and participants are encouraged to squeeze as much as possible, 3 times with a minute in between each trial. Number of pounds strength is recorded along with hand dominance. This measure is used to record upper body strength</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life as measured by the Work Ability Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline through 90 day follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>-This patient-reported outcome measure asks ability to work on a scale of 0-10 with 0 being unable, and 10 fully able. It follows with two items asking about reduction in physical and mental work ability due to cancer and its treatment. Lastly, it asks how many days the participant has been off work. For this assessment higher scores indicate better levels of work ability</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life as measured by the history of previous falls</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline through 90 day follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>-Asking patients to report the number of times they've fallen in the last 6 months. Patients who respond they have fallen in the past is correlated to risk of treatment toxicity and risk of future falls</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Acute wound complication rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Within first 90 days following surgery</time_frame>
    <description>-Wound complications include secondary procedures, deep wound packing, readmission to the hospital, wet dressings &gt;4 weeks, or extended dressings &gt;6 weeks.</description>
