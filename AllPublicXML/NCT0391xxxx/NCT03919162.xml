  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a seamless phase 2A-B multi-center, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled,
      parallel group study of PQ912, an inhibitor of the glutaminyl cyclase enzyme. Phase 2A
      includes adaptive dosing evaluation of three dose levels with exposure at full dose for 8
      weeks, and phase 2B assesses efficacy and longer-term safety through 72 weeks of treatment.
      An interim futility analysis is planned when half the study sample (n=230) has completed the
      week 48 visit or dropped out.

    <measure>2A Primary safety: proportion of participants who experience any drug-related adverse event of interest (DAE-I).</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The primary objective in phase 2A is to determine the highest safe and well-tolerated dose over the safety period (8 weeks at full dose) which will include the proportion of participants who experience any drug-related adverse event of interest (DAE-I).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>2A Primary PK</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The pharmacokinetics (PK) objectives in Phase 2A are to assess PQ912 levels in plasma after 8 weeks at full dose and calculate the target occupancy (TO) in CSF as 'go-no-go' criteria for the dose decision.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>2B Primary efficacy: CDR-SoB scale, a measure of cognition and function</measure>
    <time_frame>72 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint in phase 2B is the within-participant change from baseline to week 72 in Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes score, compared between active arm and placebo. The CDR-SoB scale is a five point score, with the following 5 possible scores:0 = Normal
0.5 = Very Mild Dementia
= Mild Dementia
= Moderate Dementia
= Severe Dementia</description>

    <measure>Key secondary efficacy: CFC2, a cognitive-functional composite</measure>
    <time_frame>72 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The key secondary objective in phase 2B is to evaluate the efficacy of PQ912 as measured by CFC2, a cognitive-functional composite, over a 72-week treatment period.</description>
