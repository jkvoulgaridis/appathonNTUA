  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      CGD causes infections and inflammation. The only cure currently is a bone marrow transplant.
      Most often a perfectly matched bone marrow donor is used. Researchers want to see if they can
      lower the risks of using a mismatched donor.

      Objectives:

      To see if it is safe to use a related bone marrow donor who is only a partial match to a
      person with CGD. To see how well drugs given to a person before and after transplant help the
      body accept the transplant.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 4-65 with CGD for whom stem cell transplant may be a cure and who do not have a
      perfectly matched donor, related or unrelated.

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with:

      Medical history

      Physical exam

      Blood tests

      Participants will be admitted to the hospital about 2 weeks before the transplant. They will
      have blood, urine, breathing, and heart tests. They may have CT and/or MRI scans. They will
      have a needle inserted into their hipbone to remove marrow. They will have dental,
      neurologic, and psychologic tests. They will have a central catheter placed: A line will be
      placed into a vein in their upper chest. They will get drugs, chemotherapy, and radiation to
      prepare for the transplant.

      Participants will receive the donated cells through their catheter. The cells will be from
      one of their relatives.

      Participants will stay in the hospital about 6 weeks after the transplant.

      After they leave the hospital, participants will have to stay in the area with visits about 2
      times a week for approximately 100 days post transplant. Then visits will be every 3 to 6
      months for 2 years. Then visits will be once a year.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Allogeneic transplant using human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched donors, both related and
      unrelated, has proven curative for patients with various immunodeficiencies, including those
      with ongoing infections. However, donor availability remains a limiting factor in the
      application of this treatment modality. For this protocol, a haploidentical donor is a
      related donor with more than 1 HLA antigen mismatch. The use of haploidentical related donors
      has in the past been fraught with a greater rate of complications related to both higher
      rates of graft versus host disease (GvHD) and delayed immunorecovery. Newer transplant
      regimens appear to have diminished these risks and improved outcomes. We propose using a
      reduced intensity novel conditioning regimen using alemtuzumab, targeted busulfan, and low
      dose total body irradiation (see schema below) followed by post-transplant cyclophosphamide
      for patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) who do not have an HLA matched donor
      but whose circumstances necessitate the use of a potentially curative, albeit high-risk
      treatment modality. However, patients with CGD have high rates of Crohn's Disease-like
      inflammatory bowel disease, predominantly colitis, where uncontrolled severe IBD may increase
      risk of GvHD. For this reason, the first 10 patients enrolled will exclude those deemed to
      have intestinal inflammation in the severe category.

      As part of the study design, the protocol will enroll patients sequentially.

      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Must have sufficient complications from underlying disease to warrant undergoing
             transplantation. (History of one or more life threatening infection. Ongoing
             inflammation. Oxidase level of quartile 1 or 2)

          -  Patients who are deemed to have colitis in the severe category (severe colitis) as
             defined below in the Subject Exclusion Criteria, who are at high risk for GvHD, will
             be included in enrollment to the protocol after 10 patients have completed the
             protocol regimen successfully. Patients among the first 10 may have colitis that is
             not deemed in the severe category. The success of the regimen will be determined as
             engraftment with a maximum GvHD of grade 2 (See the exclusion criteria for patients
             with severe colitis).

          -  Patients who are 4 65 years of age.

          -  HLA mismatched related (more than 1 mismatch) donor graft available.

          -  Ability to comprehend and willingness to sign the informed consent or have a
             parent/guardian consent if the donor is a minor; assent being obtained from minors as
             appropriate.

          -  Must be HIV negative.

          -  Must be able to stay within one hour s travel of the NIH for the first 3 months after
             transplantation and have a family member or other designated companion to stay with
             during the post-transplant period.

          -  Must provide a durable power of attorney for health care decisions to an appropriate
             adult relative or guardian in accordance to NIH Form-200 NIH Durable Power of Attorney
             for Health Care Decision Making.

          -  Where appropriate, subjects must agree to use contraception for 3 months
             post-transplant.

        NOTE: Alemtuzumab (IV formulation) is no longer distributed commercially. In order to
        receive product, the physician must contact the program for the patient. If the subject is
        not willing to consent to submit their info (address, date of birth and gender) to the
        program such that we can obtain the drug, then we cannot proceed with conditioning
        therefore no transplant will occur on this protocol.

        Participation of Women:

        Contraception: The effects of the combination of conditioning medications (alemtuzumab,
        busulfan and cyclophosphamide) and total body irradiation on the developing human fetus are
        unknown. For this reason, men and women of childbearing potential must agree to use
        adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to
        study entry and for at least one year post transplant. Females of childbearing-age must
        have a negative pregnancy test result prior to receiving any chemotherapy or conditioning
        agents. During the course of the study, if a woman becomes pregnant or suspects she is
        pregnant, she should inform the study staff and her primary care physician immediately.

        Participation of Children:

        Children greater than or equal to 4 years of age may participate in this study.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  The subject cannot have a 9/10 or 10/10 HLA matched related or unrelated donor.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) or equivalent performance status greater
             than or equal to 3

          -  Patients with inflammatory bowel disease deemed in the severe category (severe
             colitis), because they are at higher risk for GvHD, will be excluded from the protocol
             until there are 10 patients without severe colitis that have successfully completed a
             regimen, as determined by engraftment and acute GvHD of a maximum of grade 2. Severity
             of colitis will be determined in consultation with a gastroenterologist specialist.
             However, severe colitis will be evaluated within 4 months of transplant and defined as
             any of the following (where this screening may be performed on a natural history or
             screening protocol):

               -  The consultant gastroenterologist clinically determines that the patient has
                  severe colitis.

               -  Patient adult CDAI score is in the 350-450 range and Pediatric CDAI score is
                  greater than 30 within the month before initiation of conditioning Crohn s
                  Disease Activity Index (CDAI) for transplant.

               -  The patient has been requiring 1 mg/kg/day or more of prednisone or equivalent
                  steroid for control of colitis within 1 month of the CDAI scoring used to
                  determine eligibility.

               -  The patient requires continuing treatment with a biologic that consists of
                  anti-TNF alpha (e.g. infliximab, Humira, certolizumab and others of this family),
                  anti-interleukin 12 (e.g. Ustekinumab) or anti-integrin (e.g. Vedolizumab) for
                  control of colitis within 2 months of the CDAI scoring used to determine
                  eligibility.

               -  If the patient had a colonoscopy within 6 months of transplant which revealed
                  findings of a simplified endoscopic score of Crohn s Disease (SES-CD) greater
                  than 15.

          -  Left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 40%.

          -  Transaminases &gt; 5x upper limit of normal based on the participant s clinical situation
             and at the discretion of the investigator.

          -  Psychiatric disorder or mental deficiency severe enough as to make compliance with the
             HSCT treatment unlikely, and/or making regulatorily and legally effective informed
             consent impossible.

          -  Major anticipated illness or organ failure incompatible with survival from AlloPBSC
             transplant.

          -  Pregnant or lactating.

          -  HIV positive.

          -  Uncontrolled seizure disorder.

          -  Participants older than 65 are excluded. It is known from standard transplantation
             that these participants have a higher risk of morbidity and mortality related to
             transplantation. Given the investigational nature of this protocol, the risk benefit
             ratio is not warranted to include these participants at this time.

          -  Participants who are not willing to submit their information as part of the
             alemtuzumab (Campath ) Distribution Program application or participants whom the
             Distribution Program committee has determined are not qualified to receive
             alemtuzumab.

          -  Any condition or circumstance, which the Principal Investigator (PI) feels, would
             create difficulty in maintaining compliance with the requirements of this protocol.

          -  Any active infectious disease, whether CGD-related or not, that is deemed, in
             consultation with an Infectious Diseases specialist, to be incompatible with
             successful tolerance to the rigors of transplantation.

          -  C-reactive protein of greater than 100 Units within 6 weeks of anticipated transplant.
