  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic Parkinson's syndrome (IPS) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases.
      The prevalence and significance of this disease is continuously increasing in the course of
      demographic change. For many decades, the focus of diagnostics and therapy was on the motor
      symptoms of IPS. Only in recent years, it has been recognized that Parkinson's patients also
      suffer from a variety of non-motor symptoms. These have a decisive influence on the patient's
      quality of life. As one of the most common non-motor symptoms, 55 to 80% of IPS patients
      suffer from urinary dysfunction. This is associated with a very high impairment of quality of
      life due to a high degree of stigmatization and impairment of social participation. In
      clinical everyday life, Parkinson's patients regularly report the occurrence of a strong
      imperative urge to urinate, which occurs suddenly and is usually triggered by a certain
      external stimuli. Specific cognitive processing and reflection of these external stimuli
      seems to help overcome the imperative urge to urinate. From this clinical observation, it can
      be assumed that the imperative urge to urinate is subject to a certain cognitive control in
      the sense of targeted inhibition.

      The pharmacological therapy of urinary dysfunction in IPS patients is severely restricted and
      characterized by insufficient proof of efficacy as well as a high potential for side effects.
      In clinical practice, alpha-blockers and anticholinergics are frequently used, but the
      evidence base for IPS is inadequate. In addition, there is a highly relevant risk for
      Parkinson's patients of specific side effects such as orthostatic dysregulation or
      deterioration of cognition up to psychoses and hallucinations. This greatly limits their use
      especially in older IPS patients. While the use of dopaminergic medication is essential for
      the treatment of motor symptoms in Parkinson's patients, a large number of studies have not
      confirmed sufficient evidence for the efficacy of dopaminergic medication in urinary
      dysfunction. In addition, non-pharmacological therapy options, in particular pelvic floor
      training, are used to treat bladder dysfunction. Due to the lack of risk of side effects,
      pelvic floor training is currently recommended as a first-line therapy option for IPS
      patients. Initial studies have shown positive effects, but due to the lack of randomized
      controlled trials, a sufficient evidence base for this has not yet been established.

      The aim of the study is to examine whether a purely cognitive therapy approach is suitable to
      improve subjective and objective symptoms of urinary dysfunction in IPS patients. This
      therapeutic approach will be compared with the gold standard of pelvic floor training in
      terms of efficacy.

    <measure>Change in the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire Overactive Bladder Module (ICIQ-OAB)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks before beginning and 4 weeks after completion of the training</time_frame>
    <description>The ICIQ-OAB is a questionnaire for evaluating overactive bladder and related impact on quality of life (QoL) and outcome of treatment in men and women in research and clinical practice across the world. The ICIQ-OAB is derived from the fully validated ICSmale and BFLUTS questionnaires and provides a measure to assess the impact of urinary frequency, urgency, urge incontinence and nocturia symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Change in the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Quality of Life Module (ICIQ-LUTSqol)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks before beginning and 4 weeks after completion of the training</time_frame>
    <description>The ICIQ-LUTSqol is a psychometrically robust patient-completed questionnaire evaluating quality of life (QoL) in urinary incontinent patients for use in research and clinical practice across the world. The ICIQ-LUTSqol is the King's Health Questionnaire (KHQ) adapted for use within the ICIQ structure and provides a measure to assess the impact of urinary incontinence on quality of life with particular reference to social effects. It is an ideal research tool as it explores in detail the impact on patients' lives of urinary incontinence and can be used as an outcome measure to assess impact of different treatment modalities.</description>

    <measure>Change in the International Prostate Symptom Score (I-PSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks before beginning and 4 weeks after completion of the training</time_frame>
    <description>The International Prostate Symptom Score (I-PSS) is based on the answers to seven questions concerning urinary symptoms and one question concerning quality of life. Each question concerning urinary symptoms allows the patient to choose one out of six answers indicating increasing severity of the particular symptom. The answers are assigned points from 0 to 5. The total score can therefore range from 0 to 35 (asymptomatic to very symptomatic).</description>

    <measure>Change in the Uroflowmetric</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks before beginning and 4 weeks after completion of the training</time_frame>
    <description>Uroflowmetry measures the flow of urine. It tracks how fast urine flows, how much flows out, and how long it takes. It's a diagnostic test to assess how well the urinary tract functions.</description>

    <measure>Change in the Verbal memory function through the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks before beginning and 4 weeks after completion of the training</time_frame>
    <description>Participants are given a list of 15 unrelated words repeated over five different trials and are asked to repeat. Another list of 15 unrelated words are given and the client must again repeat the original list of 15 words and then again after 30 minutes.</description>

    <time_frame>4 weeks before beginning and 4 weeks after completion of the training</time_frame>
    <description>The Rey-Osterrieth complex figure test (ROCF) is a neuropsychological assessment in which patients are asked to reproduce a complicated line drawing, first by copying it freehand (recognition; measures visuomotor abilities), and then drawing from memory (recall; measures nonverbal memory).</description>

    <measure>Change in the Verbal short term memory functions through the Digit Span test</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks before beginning and 4 weeks after completion of the training</time_frame>
    <description>Verbal short term memory span measures the number of discrete units over which the patient can successively distribute his attention and still organize them into a working unit. To generalize, it refers to the ability of the patient to reproduce immediately, after one presentation, a series of discrete stimuli in their original order.</description>

    <measure>Change in the Response inhibition through the Stroop test</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks before beginning and 4 weeks after completion of the training</time_frame>

    <description>The cognitive training the investigators are planning consists of three modules which, in their entirety, are intended to help improve bladder dysfunction, which leads to psychological distress in patients: psychoeducation, training of cognitive functions and training in behavioural therapeutic techniques.
The training will take place over six weeks, with two sessions per week in the first three weeks. In the following three weeks the frequency will be reduced to once a week so that there will be 9 sessions. The duration of each training session is 90 minutes.</description>

    <arm_group_label>pelvic floor training</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>At the beginning of the training, perception of the pelvic floor is the most important factor. The patients should learn the motor skills to consciously perceive and feel the pelvic floor muscles. This requires a lot of concentration and movement control. After this perception phase, the learned movements are internalized. The fine coordination of the pelvic floor muscles is more harmonious and the tensing and relaxing of the muscles becomes easier over time. In the last phase of the training, the movements and muscle activations should be internalised in such a way that they are anchored as automated movement patterns.
The training will take place over six weeks, with two sessions per week in the first three weeks. In the following three weeks the frequency will be reduced to once a week so that there will be 9 sessions. The duration of each training session is 90 minutes.</description>
