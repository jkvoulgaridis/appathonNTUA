        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male subjects aged 18 to 45 years

          2. Body mass index (BMI) between 19 and 26 kg/m2

          3. Normal or clinically acceptable physical examination, clinical laboratory values, ECG,
             chest X-ray and vital signs at screening and baseline.

          4. Signed and dated written informed consent prior to admission to the study in
             accordance with GCP and the local legislation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History or evidence of a clinically significant disorder, condition, or disease that
             would have posed a risk to subject safety or would have interfered with the study
             evaluation, procedures, or study completion in the opinion of the investigator.

          2. Evidence of any bacterial, viral, parasitic, systemic fungal infections, or infections
             due to other opportunistic pathogens within the 30 days prior to investigational
             product administration.

          3. History of tuberculosis,positive test for Interferon-gamma-release assay,or suffering
             from active tuberculosis or latent tuberculosis infection.

          4. History of malignancy of any type, other than surgically excised nonmelanomatous skin
             cancers, within 5 years prior to investigational product administration.

          5. Positive test for HIV antibodies, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), or hepatitis C
             virus (HCV) antibodies at screening.

          6. History of relevant allergy/hypersensitivity (including allergy to drug or its
             excipients).

          7. Quantification of Hepatitis B virus DNA is greater than the upper limit of normal
             value.

          8. Received biologics or live vaccines ≤3 months prior to investigational product
             administration.

          9. Intake of an investigational drug in another trial within three months prior to
             investigational product administration.
