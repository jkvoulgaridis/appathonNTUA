  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, there has been an increasing prevalence of bacterial infections caused by
      multiresistant and extremely resistant organisms in patients with cirrhosis. These infections
      are associated with a worse prognosis, generate difficulties in the management of the patient
      during hospitalization and increase health costs.

      The main objective of this project is to estimate the prevalence of infections by
      multiresistant bacteria in patients with cirrhosis. Additionally, the prevalence of other
      antibiotic resistance patterns and morbi-mortality in the study population will be evaluated.

      For these purposes, a multicenter prospective cohort study will be carried out, including
      patients with cirrhosis who present bacterial infections at the time of admission, or during
      hospitalization.

      Performing a study in Argentina on the clinical and microbiological characteristics of
      bacterial infections in patients with cirrhosis could be very useful to develop new
      strategies for prevention and treatment of this severe complication.
