  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to prospectively assess the role of mpMRI as a non invasive method
      for assessment of possible residual tumor after initial resection of non muscle invasive
      bladder tumor.

      Comprehensive multiparametric (mp) MRI which includes T2 weighted imaging, dynamic contrast
      enhanced (DCE) imaging and DWI, was proven to be efficient tool in differentiating benign and
      malignant bladder lesion. morphological characterization of malignant bladder lesion
      (mapping/size/morphology/stalk), T stage differentiation and histological grade
      discrimination.

      The application of mpMRI in NMIBC with its added value as non invasive tool for initial
      staging and after primary resection could be a new helpful method for better diagnosis, risk
      categorization, refining the indications of second resection and proper determination of
      adjuvant treatment.
