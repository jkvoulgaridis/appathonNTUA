      Hyponatremic hypovolemia is a frequent complication of transurethral resection of the
      prostate gland (TURP). Copeptin has been established as is a surrogate marker of vasopressin
      and is measured useful for thea clinical assessment of various sodium and water disturbances.
      The aim of our the study was to assess the utility of serum concentration of copeptin (CPP)
      and brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) for the prediction of postoperative alterations of
      serum sodium concentration. Study population comprised 43 patients with benign prostatic
      hyperplasia (BPH) undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate gland. In a forward
      stepwise multiple regression only serum copeptin before the surgery and the duration of TURP
      significantly explained the variation of sodium concentration for 12 hours from the start of
      the surgery. Serum NT-proBNP before the surgery did not predict hyponatremia 12 hours after
      TURP.Conclusion Serum copeptin before TURP surgery but not NT-proBNP may be a clinically
      useful marker of a decrease of serum sodium after TURP surgery.

      Introduction.Hyponatremic hypovolemia is a frequent complication of transurethral resection
      of the prostate gland (TURP). Copeptin has been established as is a surrogate marker of
      vasopressin and is measured useful for thea clinical assessment of various sodium and water
      disturbances. The aim of our the study was to assess the utility of serum concentration of
      copeptin (CPP) and brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) for the prediction of postoperative
      alterations of serum sodium concentration.

      Methods. Study population comprised 43 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)
      undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate gland (TURP) Serum sodium and copeptin
      (CPP) were measured before the procedure and 12 hours after its completion. and sSerum
      NT-proBNP was assessment at baseline. Total amount of fluids and sodium administered
      intravenously and to flush the bladder during TURP was calculated in each patient. Receiver
      operator characteristics (ROC) curve analysis was used to determine the value of of copeptin
      (CPP) and NT-proBNP for that could prediction of the decrease of serum sodium after TURP
