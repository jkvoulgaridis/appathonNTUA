  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to compare the accuracy of two products at detecting amblyopia
      and strabismus in children. The devices will be Rebiscan's &quot;blinq&quot; (Pediatric Vision Scanner;
      PVS) and Rebiscan's RBI (Retinal Birefringence Imager).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rebiscan is proposing a two-cohort study. The first cohort will include a population enriched
      for pathology in amblyopia to best assess device sensitivity, while a second cohort will be
      based in a primary care setting to best assess device specificity. The study will be
      conducted in busy, ethnically and economically diverse cites affiliated with the Retina
      Foundation of the Southwest (RFSW) in greater Dallas, TX area. Each child will be screened
      with Rebiscan's RBI device and it's PVS device in sequence, with results compared to the PVS
      as well as a comprehensive ophthalmic examination performed by a certified pediatric
      ophthalmologist in a statistically appropriate subset of screened subjects. Testing times
      will be assessed to compare the efficiency of the PVS and the RBI screening experiences. The
      percentage of children successfully completing the screening process will also be measured.

      The RBI is expected to identify children with amblyopia and strabismus, without referring
      children who will not benefit from early treatment

    <description>Children between the ages of 2-8 who present to an eye clinic. Eligible and recruited children will be scanned with a PVS device and an RBI device, and then be provided with a full, gold standard eye exam by a pediatric ophthalmologist. All scans and exam should be performed within a single visit. Scans should take no longer than 20 seconds each, and ophthalmic exam should take approximately 30 minutes.</description>

    <description>Children between the ages of 2-8 who present to a general pediatric clinic, with no history of eye disorders or amblyopia. Eligible and recruited children will be scanned with a PVS device and an RBI device, and then be provided with a full, gold standard eye exam by a pediatric ophthalmologist. All scans will be performed at a single visit, but the exam may require a follow up visit, depending on the availability of a pediatric ophthalmologist at the clinic at the time of study enrollment. Scans should take no longer than 20 seconds each, and ophthalmic exam should take approximately 30 minutes.</description>

    <intervention_type>Device</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Retinal Birefringence Imager</intervention_name>
    <description>Device is a hand-help object approximately the size of a brick, and is held, by the user, 30cm away from the patient/subject. The subject peers in to an aperture that includes a fixation target that is in the shape of a smiley face. During this time, a ring of LED lights illuminates the eye and captures an image of the retina in approximately 3 seconds. The results instantaneously identify the presence of amblyopia / strabismus.</description>
