    <textblock>
      Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA; Wegener's) is a multi-organ autoimmune disease
      characterized by necrotizing granulomatous inflammation and vasculitis. Upper respiratory
      involvement occurs in up to 90% of patients with GPA and is often the first manifestation of
      the disease. Patients with upper respiratory tract disease are more at risk of local and
      systemic relapse. Microbial organisms may be involved in inducing disease activity in GPA.
      Previous culture-dependent studies found that patients with GPA were more likely to be
      chronic nasal carriers of Staphylococcus aureus compared to non-GPA chronic rhinosinusitis
      and healthy controls; additionally, GPA patients with S. aureus colonization are more likely
      to experience a future relapse. This led to a randomized placebo-controlled trial of
      trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) which showed this antibiotic/antifungal was effective
      in preventing relapse in GPA. Whether the benefits of TMP-SMX are related to its
      antimicrobial properties versus anti-inflammatory effects is still unknown. The objective of
      this study is to prospectively evaluate the changes in the nasal microbiome, mycobiome, and
      host immunity in patients with GPA before, during, and after receipt of TMP-SMX for 4 weeks.
      The target enrollment number is 30 participants, and the investigators will include patients
      seen at the Penn Vasculitis Center with GPA (diagnosed according to the American College of
      Rheumatology Classification Criteria or based on investigator's judgment). To analyze nasal
      microbiome and host immunity, participants will be swabbed with nasal swab and cytobrush for
      DNA sequencing and other studies. An optional research blood draw is also included. The
      investigators and coordinators will follow each patient longitudinally over a 6-month period.
