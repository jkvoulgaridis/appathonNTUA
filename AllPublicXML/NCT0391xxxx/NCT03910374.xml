  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective investigation of the effectivity of L-PRF membranes for skull base reconstruction
      after endoscopic endonasal skull base surgery (transsphenoidal) versus classical closure
      techniques.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators want to demonstrate in a prospective, randomized trial including 220
      patients undergoing endoscopic endonasal skull base surgery that the use of L-PRF is
      non-inferior to classical fibrin sealants.

      Approximately 220 patients undergoing cranial surgery will be enrolled in this randomized,
      controlled, single-blinded multicenter study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of
      autologous blood-derived products (L-PRF and fibrinogen) compared to the fibrin sealants as
      an adjunct for dural repair.

    <description>The primary aim of this study is identifying the role of L-PRF in the endoscopic endonasal closure of skull base defects. More specific, we want to demonstrate in a prospective, randomized trial that the use of L-PRF is non-inferior to classical closure techniques regarding prevalence of CSF-leaks The number of patients with a CSF-leak will be compared between both treatment groups.</description>

    <description>potential interference of the L-PRF membranes with post-operative imaging (MRI) will be evaluated. 3 months after surgery, when the L-PRF membrane is still visible, the MRI images will be evaluated to see if there is tumor residue present or not. After 1 year the presence of tumor residue will be reevaluated. The outcomes will be compared between both evaluation timepoints to asses if L-PRF has interference with the imaging.</description>
