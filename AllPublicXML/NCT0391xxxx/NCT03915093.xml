  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) is a new approach used in cardio thoracic surgery
      department instead of thoracotomy to treat several diseases.patients underwent thoracoscopic
      surgery without organized educational protocol either before or after the procedure.
      Therefore, this study will be the first clinical research which will increase patients'
      knowledge about thoracoscopy and decrease its complications.

      The role of thoracic nursing specialty is to support and educate patients, who are suffering
      from thoracic diseases, to achieve the best outcome in terms of physical, psychological,
      social and spiritual well beings. The care provided not only focuses on in-hospital
      treatments that patient received, but also encompasses the whole patient journey including
      lifestyle modification, health concept promotion, self-empowerment and secondary prevention.
      Preoperative prophylactic physiotherapy has been shown to be an important and effective
      approach in preventing or reducing postoperative complications, in addition to optimizing
      treatment by familiarizing the patient with the physiotherapeutic procedures. Quasi
      experimental research design was utilized to conduct this study.Sixty adult patients
      undergoing thoracoscopic surgery included and had the following criteria, the age ranged from
      18-65 years old, both male and female. The patients divided into two equal groups (study and
      control groups), 30 patients for each. The study group received educational nursing protocol
      while the control group received the routine hospital care.

    <description>WHOQOL developed by WHO (2004). It contains 5 broad domains of QOL within which 18 facets are covered to determine the quality of life. These 5 domains include physical, social, psychological, environmental and perceived QOL. Within each domain several sub domains (facets) of QOL Summarize that particular domain of QOL.The scoring of these variables, a 3-point lickert scale on tables was adopted for the answer low QOL=0-3, moderate QOL=4-6, and high QOL =7-9.</description>
