      This study observes the efficacy and side effects of CT-guided radioactive iodine-125 seed
      brachytherapy in inoperable early stage non-small cell lung cancer retrospectively, and
      analyzes the influence of clinical and dosimetric factors on the outcomes.

      Radioactive Iodine-125 seed brachytherapy is a conventional treatment in Peking University
      Third Hospital. Radioactive Iodine-125 seed brachytherapy is the implantation of Iodine-125
      seed into tumors.The radioactive Iodine-125 seed can release low dose of irradiation
      persistently which kills tumors cell and causes less damage to normal tissue at the same
      time. This study collects the data of patients with early stage (stage I-II, N0) non-small
      cell lung cancer who underwent CT-guided radioactive Iodine-125 seed implantation from 2010
      to 2018. The investigators evaluate the dose that covers 90% target volume(D90) and other
      parameters after the implantation. The efficacy and adverse effects were observed. Local
      control(LC) time and overall survival(OS) time are evaluated.
