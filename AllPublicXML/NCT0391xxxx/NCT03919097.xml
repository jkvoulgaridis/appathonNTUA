  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial flutter is a common condition that is effectively treated by ablation using
      radiofrequency. Due to its feasibility, effectiveness and low procedural risk, radiofrequency
      ablation is a first-line treatment of atrial flutter.

      Several studies have been published concerning the factors associated with the occurrence of
      atrial fibrillation during or after flutter ablation, in patients with and without clinical
      history of atrial fibrillation. 26 to 46% of patients are likely to develop it, according to
      ECG or Holter diagnoses. The figure rises to more than 50% with a diagnosis with an
      implantable loop recorder.

      In patients without a prior history of atrial fibrillation before ablation, anticoagulants
      are routinely administered 4-6 weeks after flutter removal by most cardiologists.

      Although there are no specific guidelines for anticoagulation after flutter ablation, it is
      currently recommended to treat the patient as for atrial fibrillation. It is therefore
      crucial to identify in advance patients at high risk of atrial fibrillation after flutter
      ablation, in order to assess the appropriateness of maintaining oral anticoagulant therapy.

      The objectives of this study are:

        -  to evaluate the frequency and identify the factors predicting the occurrence of atrial
           fibrillation after flutter ablation

        -  to determine the risk of a stroke occurring in patients with atrial fibrillation after
           flutter ablation.

      The database consists in patients of the CHU Brugmann Hospital treated between 1996 and 2018.
