  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Concussion in sports (&quot;Sports-Related Concussion&quot; or &quot;SRC&quot;) are a public health issue. The
      management of these injuries is evolving rapidly and decisions to return to play are based on
      clinical judgment. It is now recognized that the assessment of cognitive function must be one
      of the components of the assessment, in particular, in the protocol used to decide if a
      patient can resume practice. The available scales include only a brief cognitive assessment
      but do not provide an understanding of the level of deficit treatment. The use of
      computerized TAP (Test of Attentionnal Performance) tests, including finer measures of
      reaction time and apprehending the different attention and executive components (alertnes,
      orientation, flexibility, inhibition, updating), would allow a better understanding of the
      nature of the disorder and link it to subjective symptoms, and recovery.
