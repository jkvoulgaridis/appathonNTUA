    <textblock>
      The interprofessional practice &amp; education curriculum for the students to be employed in this
      study will include five modalities in a scaffolded structure progressing from low- to
      high-fidelity experiences over a two-year period: (1) classroom didactic sessions; (2)
      simulation laboratory sessions; (3) standardized patient sessions; (4) community-based
      clinical case conferences; and, (5) community-based interprofessional rotations. Clinicians
      will experience many of the same learning experiences as the students, but will differ in the
      level of education and its focus. Clinicians and faculty will be taught the concepts of
      interprofessional practice &amp; education, the same as the students, but they will also be
      taught how to educate students using interprofessional practice &amp; education.

      The purpose of this prospective cohort study, which will utilize anonymous data, is to
      describe the impact of the interprofessional practice &amp; education project in four categories:

        1. Change in student knowledge, skill, and attitudes regarding interprofessional practice &amp;
           education.

        2. Student selection and entrance into primary care in rural settings and/or with
           underserved populations.

        3. Patient and family members' perceptions of interprofessional practice &amp; education
           encounters.

        4. Clinicians' experiences with interprofessional practice &amp; education and perceptions of
           it.

      Research Questions:

        1. How do students' knowledge, skill, and attitudes change regarding interprofessional
           practice &amp; education as measured by pre/post electronic surveys?

        2. What is the difference in the rate of entrance of graduates into primary care
           disciplines, settings that serve rural patients, and settings that serve underserved
           patients?

        3. What are patients' and their families' perceptions of interprofessional practice &amp;
           education encounters as measured by anonymous paper surveys.

        4. What prior experiences and education do clinicians have with interprofessional practice
           &amp; education?

        5. How do clinicians' knowledge, skill, and attitudes change regarding interprofessional
           practice &amp; education as measured by pre/post electronic surveys?

    <description>For patients and their families, those who receive care from an Interprofessional team will receive the usual health care they normally receive at the participating clinics. In many cases patients already receive this care, but are unaware of it. Most of what occurs in Interprofessional practice happens outside of the patient encounter. For patients the process is generally invisible, but its affects are felt in terms of better communications with the patient. In this study, patients will be informed as usual about the presence of students as learners and will have the opportunity to decline student involvement in their care. The only difference for the patients and their families will be a request to fill out a survey form on paper indicating their perception of the experience in terms of quality of care and its potential impact on their access to care.</description>
