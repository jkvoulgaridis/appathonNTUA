  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a management gap in China. This study aims to establish a tiered management system
      of osteoporosis for Chinese patients. Including:

        1. Developing a national hierarchical health management network platform for middle-aged
           and elderly osteoporosis patients. With this platform, the data of medical records,
           laboratory results would be shared between medical institutions. And primary hospitals
           can refer the patients to the nearest medical centre for advanced auxiliary examinations
           and diagnosis.

        2. Establishing a muti-level hospital collaboration, doctor-patient interaction management
           model of osteoporosis.

        3. To explore and establish a early warning and screening pathways for osteoporosis.
