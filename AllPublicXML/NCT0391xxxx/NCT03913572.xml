  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare healing and surgical outcomes in patients with chronic perianal
      disease treated with Adipose-derived Stem Cells (ASCs) to outcomes in patients treated in
      traditional surgical techniques without ASCs. The study will perform retrospective medical
      record analysis to clinically characterize patients that have undergone these surgical
      procedures and compare follow-up data and disease status to determine efficacy of treatment
      with ASCs compared to similar treatments without the use of ASCs. This will help determine
      overall efficacy of the treatment as well as determine patient characteristics that may
      predict treatment success. The study will also prospectively recruit patients with perianal
      disease that are planning to receive treatment with ASCs, and analyze their outcomes in the
      same way. Medical record review of outcomes in patients with perianal disease that received
      treatment with ASCs compared to those that did not will determine efficacy of this procedure.

      Specific Aims:

        1. Conduct a retrospective review of health information data from patients who have
           undergone surgery with a colorectal surgery attending at the University of California
           San Diego, including surgical treatment of perianal fistulas or other chronic perianal
           diseases, with or without injection of lipoaspirate containing adipose-derived stem
           cells. Patient data from December 2013 to April 1, 2018, will be obtained, with
           parameters including date of birth, sex, date of surgery, medical history, surgical
           history, laboratory values, perioperative data such as blood loss, length of surgery,
           operative complications, readmissions, and long-term complications and status of
           disease.

        2. Conduct an observational study comparing outcomes of patients that plan to undergo
           treatment of perianal disease using ASCs compared to those that do not use ASCs.
           Patients identified as candidates for the procedure by the colorectal surgeons and are
           planning to undergo the procedure will give informed consent and be recruited into the
           study. Participants will undergo isolation of ASCs using the REVOLVE â„¢ System and
           injection of ASCs into perianal wounds. Clinical data will be analyzed to determine
           efficacy of the procedure as a means of treating perianal disease.

        3. Use the above data to clinically characterize patients that undergo this surgical
           procedure and what patient characteristics may determine outcomes. Comparing follow-up
           data and disease status will determine efficacy of treatment with adipose-derived stem
           cells compared to similar treatments without the use of stem cells.

    <measure>Improvement in perianal disease after the procedure</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will have routine post-operative follow up in with a colorectal surgeon and/or their clinical Nurse Practitioner 2-4 weeks following the procedure in colorectal surgery clinic. At that appointment, the timing of additional postoperative appointments or procedures will be determined. Clinical data and status of the disease will be documented by the attending surgeon and subsequently collected from the medical record. Fistula healing will be assessed clinically 3 months after the procedure has been performed. The patient will be asked to complete the Perianal Disease Activity Index (PDAI)questionnaire both prior to intervention as well as at a post-operative appointment 3 months following the procedure to asses for improvement of symptoms. The PDAI is a validated instrument to assess the severity of perianal disease . We will also perform MRIs prior to repair and after to confirm resolution of abscess cavities and fistulae.</description>

    <description>The plastic surgery team will perform fat graft harvest. Tumescent solution will be infiltrated into the area of liposuction, generally the abdomen, flanks, or thighs. Approximately a00ml of liposuction aspirate will be retrieved. It will be washed and condensed down to about 5-25 ml of good-quality fat graft using the REVOLVE System by Acelity. This will then be loaded into a syringe fitted with an injection cannula. The colorectal surgeon will perform an exam under anesthesia and determine if any additional procedure such as ligation of fistula tract, fistulotomy, endorectal advancement flap, or seton placement/exchange is needed. Severity of disease at time of surgery will be recorded by the attending surgeon. Following any indicated procedure, the lipoaspirate will be injected into the soft tissues around the fistula tract.</description>

        Patient's will be identified by colorectal surgeons as those with perianal disease that may
        benefit from the procedure above. The patients must be able to give consent for the study
        and complete the Perianal Crohn's Disease Activity Index in English, qualify medically for
        the surgical procedure, and agree to undergo treatment of perianal disease with injection
        of lipoaspirate.
