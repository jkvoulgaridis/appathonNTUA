  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project proposes a pilot intervention in Burera District to train rural Rwandan
      community health workers (CHWs) in breast awareness, and to train primary care nurses at
      rural health centers in the assessment and management of breast complaints, with a focus on
      when patients must be urgently referred for more advanced evaluation. The project will
      randomize health centers to receive the intervention and will evaluate the impact of these
      trainings on nurse and CHW knowledge and skills. In order to help Rwanda prepare for national
      early detection efforts, the investigators will also assess the impact of these trainings on
      patient volume at the health center level, and visits and further diagnostic testing at the
      district hospital level. The investigators will also examine the impact on the length of
      diagnostic delays experienced by patients with a breast problem. Among those patients
      diagnosed with breast cancer, the investigators will also assess their stage at diagnosis.
