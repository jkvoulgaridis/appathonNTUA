    <textblock>
      To investigate the ability of tofacitinib, a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, to treat patients
      with cutaneous sarcoidosis and granuloma annulare during 6 months of therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An open-label clinical trial of tofacitinib in cutaneous sarcoidosis and GA. The hypothesis
      is that Janus Kinase (JAK) 1/3 inhibition with tofacitinib will be effective for the
      treatment these two diseases. Tofacitinib will be administered at a dose of 5 mg twice daily
      and response to therapy will be assessed at months 1, 3, and 6 of therapy. The primary
      outcomes will be improvement in the Cutaneous Sarcoidosis Activity and Morphology Instrument
      (CSAMI) and Granuloma Activity Scoring Index (GASI) after 6 months of tofacitinib therapy.
      Secondary outcomes will include improvement in internal organ sarcoidosis (i.e. lung,
      cardiac) and skin related quality of life. Pre- and on treatment PET-CT scans will be
      performed in patients with sarcoidosis with internal organ involvement. Pre- and on treatment
      blood collection and skin biopsies will be performed for correlative scientific studies using
      RNA sequencing, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and cytokine profiling.

    <time_frame>6 - 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>For patients with sarcoidosis: change in CSAMI score after 6 months of treatment with tofacitinib compared to baseline.
The activity portion of the CSAMI score will be utilized. The range of scores is from 0 to 165. Higher scores correspond with higher cutaneous disease burden.
The percentage change in CSAMI score will be calculated as follows:
change in CSAMI score = [baseline CSAMI - final CSAMI] / baseline CSAMI
Higher percentage change corresponds to more improvement on therapy (0% = no change, 100% = complete disease resolution) Negative percentage change corresponds to disease worsening (-25% = 25% worsening of disease)</description>

    <description>For patients with GA: change in BSA involvement after 6 months of treatment with tofacitinib compared to baseline.
The range of BSA involvement for this study is from 5% to 100%. Higher BSA involvement corresponds with higher cutaneous disease burden.
The percentage change in BSA will be calculated as follows:
Change in BSA = [baseline BSA- final BSA] / baseline BSA Higher percentage change corresponds to more improvement on therapy (0% = no change, 100% = complete disease resolution) Negative percentage change corresponds to disease worsening (-25% = 25% worsening of disease).</description>

          -  Women of childbearing potential who are unable or unwilling to use birth control while
             taking the medication

          -  Women who are pregnant or nursing. If a woman becomes pregnant during the study, she
             will stop study medication and be removed from the study. She will be urged to follow
             up with her Primary Care Physician or OB/GYN. The study doctors will ask to follow the
