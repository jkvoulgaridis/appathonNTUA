  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators want to investigate whether saline injections in the neck
      and head muscles can reduce symptoms of chronic migraine. In existing studies, saline
      injections (used as placebo treatment) have given patients with chronic migraine an average
      of 7 headache-free days per month.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who meet the diagnostic criteria for chronic migraine will be invited to participate
      in the study. All participants will undergo a medical examination. The participants will fill
      out an electronic headache diary for one month. This will give a picture of the current
      headache pattern and establish a baseline. The participants will then be randomized into two
      groups: saline injections or needle sticks without injection. They will not be aware of which
      group they belong to. The treatment will be repeated on two occasions three months apart. The
      headache diary will continue during the treatment period and up to three months after the
      second treatment. The effect will be analyzed by comparing baseline data from the headache
      diary to data after treatment. The primary outcome of the study is the number of days with
      headache, during a 28-day period.

    <description>A headache day is defined as: 1) a day with headache ≥ 4 hours or 2) a day with headache of any duration, where the headache is relieved with acute headache medication (AHM)
By AHM is meant a drug that is taken when needed for the purpose of relieving headaches, including any of the following:
Paracetamol
Aspirin
NSAID
Triptan
Opioid
Ergotamine
Dihydroergotamine
The primary efficacy measure is the change between the baseline 28-day period (4 weeks prior injection 1) and the corresponding period during follow-up, i.e. the 28-day period ending the study. a secondary efficacy measure is the change between the baseline and the 28-day period preceding the second injection.</description>

          -  Participants must not be pregnant or plan pregnancy during the course of the study.

          -  Participants must not breastfeed or plan to do so during the study.

             with increased bleeding tendency or treatment with certain types of blood thinners).

          -  Participants must have no difficulty understanding or making themselves understood in
             Swedish.

          -  Participants must be able to fill out the headache diary and questionnaires.
