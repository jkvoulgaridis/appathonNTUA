  <brief_summary>

      This is a clinical trial that intend to determine the effects of S-ketamine on event-related
      potentials associated with semantic affective pain-processing

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ketamine is a unique anesthetic with neural effects that are distinct from more commonly-used
      γ-aminobutyric acid agonists. Evidence suggest that analgesic effect of ketamine is primarily
      related to the affective than the sensorial aspects of pain interpretation. The investigators
      investigated whether ketamine, a noncompetitive NMDA antagonist, would modify the perceived
      emotional valence of pain-related words when compared to non-pain-related ones in healthy
      volunteers. Using a single session double-blind parallel placebo-controlled design, 24
      healthy volunteers were randomized to receive intravenous S-ketamine (n=12) or placebo
      (n=12). During infusion (plasmatic target of 60 ng/ml), the effects of ketamine were recorded
      using EEG and oddball behavioral data was monitored. Evoked potentials (N200 and P300
      components) were recorded during performance of a semantic written word oddball task
      containing pain-related (targets) and non-pain-related words (standards). Expected results:
      The findings of this study can help in the understanding of neurophysiologic mechanisms
      involved in ketamine's effects both in psychiatric diseases as in the treatment of
      postoperative acute and chronic pain.

    <description>EEG will be recorded during all task time. The main outcome will be the area under de curve (AUC) of the grand averaged mean differences between event-related potencials (ERPs) elicited by target and non-target words at 100-200, 300-500 and 800-900 ms after stimulus presentation for parietal electrophysiological signal (Pz). The ERPs represent the averaged voltage of several trials.</description>
