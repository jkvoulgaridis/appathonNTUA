  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first in human study to determine the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics of ONO-7684 in healthy adult volunteers. This study will be conducted in 2
      parts: Part A is a single-ascending dose and Part B is a multiple-ascending dose.

    <textblock>
      This study aims to obtain safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data when
      ONO-7684 is administered orally as single doses and as multiple doses to healthy subjects.
      The study will consist of 2 parts: A single ascending dose (SAD) phase (Part A); a multiple
      ascending dose (MAD) phase (Part B). One cohort of Part A will receive ONO-7684 under both
      fasted and fed conditions to investigate the effect of food.
