  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiotherapy and combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy are used to treat most tumours in the
      head and neck region. Unfortunately, these treatments often result in hearing loss and
      tinnitus that has a negative impact on quality of life. This study will use a battery of
      sensitive tests, including measures of hair cell and neural function, before and after
      treatment, to measure the effects of these treatments on auditory function. The results will
      be compared with the individual radiotherapy dose characteristics, using state-of-the-art
      data mining technology, to identify the auditory substructures that are most sensitive to
      radiation with respect to the effects on auditory function. The data will provide the basis
      for new dose constraints to limit radiation doses to any identified substructures and to
      minimise loss in hearing ability for patients undergoing treatment for head and neck cancer.

  <detailed_description>

      The overall aim is to provide the data that will define radiotherapy dose constraints for
      individual substructures of the auditory pathway such that a better balance can be made
      between hearing loss and tumour control during radiotherapy for head and neck cancer. In
      particular the study aims to:

        1. Determine the impact of radiotherapy to the head and neck region on auditory function,
           including measures of hair cell and neural function

        2. Determine the interaction between radiation and cisplatin chemotherapy on auditory
           function

        3. Determine relations between different functional effects and radiation dose to
           substructures within the ear using advanced voxel-based data mining techniques

        4. Determine the auditory substructure that is most associated with speech-in-noise
           deficits

        5. Identify and validate a test which is most predictive of damage to that substructure,
           and could be the basis for future diagnosis

        6. Validate the importance of the localised sensitive substructure in an independent cohort
