             start

          5. Tumors less than 2cm clinically on physical exam, as well as on breast ultrasound

          6. No clinical evidence of nodal disease (i.e. cN0), on physical examination done ≤ 12
             weeks from treatment start, as well as on breast ultrasound

          7. Estrogen receptor status (ER) positive on biopsy

          8. Her2 negative on biopsy

          9. Grade 1 or 2 on biopsy

         10. Planned surgery is a partial mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy

         11. Localisation markers placed before treatment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Age less than 65 years

          2. A known deleterious mutation in BRCA 1 and/or BRCA 2

          3. Clinical tumor size &gt; 2.0 cm in greatest diameter on staging ultrasound

          4. Tumor histology limited to lobular carcinoma only

          5. Clinically positive axillary nodes (cN+)

          6. Lymphovascular invasion on biopsy

          7. Pure ductal or lobular carcinoma in situ on biopsy

          8. Extensive intraductal component on biopsy

          9. Neoadjuvant hormonal manipulation or chemotherapy

         10. Prior history of cancer (Patients with prior or concurrent basal cell or squamous cell
             skin cancers are eligible for the trial)

         11. More than one primary tumor in different quadrants of the same breast

         16. Serious non-malignant disease (e.g. cardiovascular, pulmonary, systemic lupus
             erythematosus (SLE), scleroderma) which would preclude definitive radiation treatment

         18. Currently pregnant or lactating

         19. Psychiatric or addictive disorders which would preclude obtaining informed consent or
