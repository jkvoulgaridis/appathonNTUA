      This study was designed to determine if walking with a healthy individual during the 6 minute
      walk test significantly influenced the outcome of the test.

      Introduction: The American Thoracic Society recommends not walking with the patient or client
      during the Six Minute Walk Test (6MWT). However, this recommendation raises safety concerns
      for individuals at increased risk of falls. Given the recommendations and concerns, the
      effects of guarding during the 6MWT has not been investigated. Purpose: The purpose of this
      study was to determine if guarding during the 6MWT affected gait speed and distance walked.
      Methods: Participants were randomized into a 'guarded first' vs 'guarded second' condition.
      Data were analyzed using a one-sample t-test, Pearson Correlation Coefficients, Intraclass
      Correlation Coefficients (ICC), and Bland Altman plots to assess differences and
      relationships for gait speed and distance walked between the guarded and unguarded trials.

    <description>The patients walked as far as possible for 6 minutes--over two separate trials. In one trial, an examiner walked with the participant. In the second trial, the participant walked independently. A paired T test was performed to see if there was a significant difference in the distance walked or gait speed between the trials.</description>

        The study population was average age of 24 in the younger group and 71.2 in the older
        group. The population was 134 female to 69 males. The sample population was primarily
        Caucasian (89%). Mean BMI of the younger group was 24.1 and the older group 26.4.
