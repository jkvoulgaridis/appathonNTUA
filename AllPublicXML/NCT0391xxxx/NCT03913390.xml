  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All clinical practice includes decision making, and sometimes you are ethically challenging
      because of the consequences it will bring to the patient, the health professional or society
      in general. Ethics seeks the best solution to a better treatment and seeks to increase the
      quality of life of the patient with correct decision making. Ethical / bioethical
      considerations are of a generic nature, and do not apply to specific situations. Therefore,
      it is suggested that there should be guidelines or recommendations in the field of palliative
      care in Mexico that may be an adjunct to decision making. The relevance of knowledge,
      application and management of ethical / bioethical recommendations is unknown as part of
      decision-making by professionals dedicated to palliative care in our country, taking into
      consideration the principles of autonomy, beneficence, non-malfeasance and Justice. It is
      necessary to consider the participation of patients, caregivers and health personnel in this
      decision making process of decisions. This study intends to identify the current situation of
      this issue in Mexico.

      To assess the impact of knowledge of ethical / bioethical recommendations in decision making
      with ethical / bioethical involvement in palliative care in Mexico.

        -  Diagnose the current situation in decision making with ethical / bioethical involvement
           in palliative care in Mexico.

        -  Identify if the personnel dedicated to palliative care know guidelines or
           recommendations related to the decision making in palliative care and the current legal
           framework.

        -  Know the strategies that palliative care personnel follow in situations in which the
           decision to make is difficult or problematic.

        -  Analyze the strategies used by professionals that result in an improvement in the
           quality (impact) of decision making in palliative care.

      Descriptive, prospective, through surveys, with quantitative and qualitative analysis. The
      questionnaire proposal is elaborated, which was designed by the authors, based partially on
      the literature. This questionnaire was sent to palliative care experts for validation. The
      questionnaire will be sent through google forms (www.google.com/forms) to health personnel
      who work in palliative care such as doctors, nurses, social workers and psychologists in
      Mexico. It consists of 20 questions with four conceptual categories, demographic data,
      professional training, ethics / bioethics training and experience with clinical situations
      involving ethics / bioethics. The questionnaire will focus on the analysis they carry out to
      make decisions that they consider to have ethical / bioethical implications. The form will be
      sent up to 2 times to the selected group of health professionals
