    <textblock>
      This trial is a limited multi-center, Phase II study to evaluate inotuzumab ozogamicin
      (Besponsa) in pediatric patients with MRD positive CD22-positive B-lymphoblastic leukemia
      (B-ALL).

      Some patients with newly diagnosed ALL maintain low levels of MRD, despite achieving complete
      remission with less than 5% blasts in the bone marrow. Others experience re-emergence of low
      level MRD or increasing levels of MRD on therapy or post-transplant. New approaches are
      needed to achieve undetectable MRD in these high-risk patients.

      Inotuzumab ozogamicin is an antibody-drug conjugate composed of a humanized IgG subtype 4
      monoclonal CD22-targeted antibody linked to calicheamicin, a potent anti-tumor antibiotic.
      CD22 is expressed in more than 90% of patients with B-cell ALL, making it an attractive
      target in this patient population. Inotuzumab ozogamicin has demonstrated exceptional
      activity in adults with relapsed or refractory B-ALL.

      Primary Objective

        -  Assess the efficacy of inotuzumab ozogamicin in patients with MRD positive CD22+ B-ALL
           with 0.1 - 4.99% blasts in bone marrow.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  Study the safety of inotuzumab ozogamicin when used in patients with MRD - positive
           CD22+ B-ALL with &lt; 5 % blasts in bone marrow.

        -  Estimate the incidence, severity, and outcome of hepatotoxicity and sinusoidal
           obstruction syndrome/veno-occlusive disease (SOS/VOD) in patients during inotuzumab
           ozogamicin and following subsequent treatment, including hematopoietic stem cell
           transplant (HSCT).

      The drug will be administered intravenously on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle.
      Patients who do not meet the definition of treatment failure after the first cycle may
      receive up to five additional cycles of therapy. .

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 1 year.
