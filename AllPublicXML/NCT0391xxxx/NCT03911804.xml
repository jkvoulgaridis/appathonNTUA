  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ultrasonography of optic nerve sheath diameter shows a good level of diagnostic accuracy for
      detecting intracranial hypertension. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of
      continuous epidural block on intracranial pressure in pediatric patients undergoing osteotomy
      of lower extremity. Forty patients, aged 4 years to 13 years, receiving epidural analgesia
      before osteotomy will be divided into bolus group (n=30) and infusion group (n=30). Randomly
      selected patients of the bolus group are given 0.3 ml/kg bolus/hr of 0.15% ropivacaine for
      epidural analgesia. In contrast, patients in the infusion group are administered 0.3 ml/kg/hr
      0.15% ropivacaine at a constant rate for epidural analgesia. The primary endpoint is the
      difference in the optic nerve sheath diameter after epidural analgesia measured by optic
      nerve ultrasonography between groups.
