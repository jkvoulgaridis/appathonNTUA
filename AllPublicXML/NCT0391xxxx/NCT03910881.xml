  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to refine and test a technology-enabled patient support system
      (PSS) as a tool for self-management of pediatric CF. The PSS includes two components: 1)
      patient-facing: an app with customizable dashboards for tracking patient-generated outcome
      measures and providing personally relevant decision-making support; and 2) clinic-based:
      clinical patient management and technical support. Using a one-group pretest-posttest design,
      we will evaluate the effect of the adapted technology-assisted PSS on patient-reported
      outcomes (PROs). Study hypothesis: Among pediatric CF patients treated at the UAB CF Center,
      the use of technology-aided PSS over 6 months will improve health-related quality of life
      (primary outcome) as well as patient satisfaction, patient activation, and shared
      decision-making (secondary outcomes).

    <measure>Health-related quality of life (CFQ-R scores)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome is difference in CFQ-R scores between pre/post intervention. The CFQ-R consists of 9 QOL domains (physical, role/school, vitality, emotion, social, body image, eating, treatment burden, health perceptions) and 3 symptom scales (weight, respiratory, and digestion). Items for each CFQ-R domain are summed to generate a domain score ranging from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better QOL.</description>

    <intervention_name>Open-platform patient support system (PSS) app</intervention_name>
    <description>The PSS app enables tracking and visualization of patient-selected health outcomes and sharing of select outcomes with family and providers. The CF clinical team and the family jointly decide which aspects of daily life to track, how often, and the content and frequency of patient-generated reports. Examples of daily care that can be tracked include symptoms (respiratory, gastrointestinal, pain), energy level, appetite, sleep, exercise, mood, medications, therapies, school/work attendance. Prior to a clinic visit, the patient/family generates a report of the outcomes they have been tracking, to help prepare for the visit and identify successes and areas of struggle. This information facilitates meaningful conversations during the visit and promotes shared decision-making. Patients/families can view their progress at any time and share selected outcomes with family and friends as often as desired.</description>
