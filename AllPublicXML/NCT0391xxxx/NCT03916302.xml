    <textblock>
      Initiated in January 2008, The PE-aWARE (Pulmonary Embolism WArsaw REgistry) is an on-going
      single-centre prospective observational study of patients with confirmed acute pulmonary
      embolism (APE). Extensive data on consecutive patients with pulmonary embolism is collected
      and stored. The main objective is to collect and provide information on patients'
      characteristics, management, and outcome with the purpose of decreasing mortality in APE, the
      occurrence of bleeding, and the frequency of thromboembolic recurrences. Moreover, the
      PE-aWARE registry serves as a basis for creating predictive scores for clinicians which aid
      patient management. The study endpoints comprise clinically recognized (and objectively
      confirmed) recurrences of PE, major and minor bleeding complications classified according to
      the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis classification, need for
      cardiopulmonary resuscitation or catecholamines, and death.

      The Pulmonary Embolism WArsaw REgistry (PE-aWARE) is an on-going prospective observational
      study of patients with confirmed acute pulmonary embolism (APE). Carried out since January
      2008, the registry includes consecutive patients hospitalized at a single centre. The primary
      data recorded include details of each patient's clinical status, co-morbidities, the
      prescribed treatment, the results of additional studies (ie EKG, imaging studies), and the
      outcome. The study endpoints comprise clinically recognized (and objectively confirmed)
      recurrences of PE, major and minor bleeding complications classified according to the
      International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis classification, need for cardiopulmonary
      resuscitation or catecholamines, and death.

      Collecting the fore mentioned data allows for clinicians to better manage the diagnostic
      workup and treatment and thus facilitates the prevention of possible future complications in
      APE patients.
