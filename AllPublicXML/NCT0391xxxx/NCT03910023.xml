  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The working hypothesis is that spa therapy in addition to usual care including home exercises
      (UCHE) will result in greater improvements in pain reduction, associated disability and
      quality of life for chronic low back pain patients. It follows that health resource
      consumption and linked costs should also be reduced. The primary objective of this study is
      therefore to compare the therapeutic effect of UCHE alone versus spa therapy in addition to
      UCHE for chronic low back pain.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Secondarily, the study will also (i) evaluate the therapeutic effects specific to each
      spa-centre, (ii) specifically describe effects among subjects who are currently engaged in a
      professional activity, (iii) evaluate treatment tolerance as well as (iv) per-patient health
      resource use and associated costs.

             and does not go past the knee.

          -  Patient presenting with a current pain intensity on a visual analogue scale (VAS) &gt; or
             = 40 mm.

          -  The patient has signed the informed consent

          -  The patient is a beneficiary of a social security programme [national health
             insurance]

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with secondary low back pain

          -  Patients with severe depression, psychosis

          -  Patients who have already had a spa treatment in the previous 6 months

          -  Patients with a contraindication for spa treatment

          -  Patients with a professional activity related to hydrotherapy (to avoid any conflict
             of interest)

          -  Patients with sciatic pain beyond the knee (sciatica being a non-indication for spa
             treatment)

          -  Other treatments that may interact according to the judgment of the investigator

          -  Patients who live more than 30 km away from the spa

    <ipd_description>The general goal is to, in as much as possible, make the study data available to interested researchers as well as to provide proof of transparency for the study. Data (and an accompanying data dictionary) will be de-identified and potentially further cleaned or aggregated as the investigators deem necessary to protect participant anonymity.
Due to conditions imposed by French law, data will be made available to the public upon request to the AFRETH scientific committee (Association Française pour la Recherche Thermale, 1 rue Cels 75014 Paris, France; http://www.afreth.org).</ipd_description>
