  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and efficacy of Stem cells from human exfoliated teeth transplantation
      in patients with Islet function decreased significantly to provides scientific basis for
      further clinical studies to verify the safety and efficacy. On the basis of maintaining the
      original treatment, intravenous drip of dental pulp mesenchymal stem cells.

      Basic treatment:

      The original treatment regimen was maintained. During the study period, insulin dose could be
      adjusted with the change of blood glucose, while the type and dose of oral hypoglycemic drugs
      remained unchanged (except when side effects of drugs or insulin preparations were stopped or
      patients still had frequent hypoglycemia).

      Stem cell therapy:

      Dosage: Stem cells from human exfoliated teeth were calculated at 0.11IU/kg body weight .

      Course of treatment: 3 times, Injections were administered at enrollment, 2 weeks after
      enrollment, and 6 weeks after enrollment.

      Note: at 1 month follow-up (V5) after the last transplantation of several cells, the subjects
      were still unable to discontinue insulin, and then began the second course of stem cell
      therapy.After the second course of treatment, the follow-up plan was resumed.
