  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project seeks to identify the how walking impairments in stroke survivors contribute to
      mobility deficits through the use of behavioral observations and computational models. The
      chosen approach integrates biomechanical analyses, physiological assessments and machine
      learning algorithms to explain how asymmetries during walking influence balance and the
      effort required to walk. Ultimately, the results of this work may lead to more personalized
      rehabilitation strategies to improve walking capacity and efficiency, and ultimately reduce
      fall risk in stroke survivors.

    <description>The investigators will use a metabolic cart to measure the rate of oxygen consumption (VO2) while participants walk at a fixed speed on a treadmill. VO2 will be measured in five trials where participants walk with different levels of step length asymmetry. This outcome will capture the relationship between measures of VO2 and step length asymmetry.</description>

    <description>Participants will complete five trials at different levels of step length asymmetry. During these trials, motion capture will be used to measure the kinematics of the body when participants respond to accelerations of the treadmill. This outcome measure will use data from all trials to determine the relationship between angular momentum and step length asymmetry.</description>

    <description>The investigators will determine how asymmetric walking constraints influence spatiotemporal coordination, energetic cost, and dynamic balance in healthy individuals. The investigators will manipulate spatiotemporal coordination using a special treadmill. Energetic cost will be quantified using expired gas analysis and inverse dynamic approaches. Stability will be evaluated by characterizing participants' ability to recover from unexpected perturbations.</description>
