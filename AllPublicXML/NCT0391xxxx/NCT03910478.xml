  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized clinical trial to assess whether a subject centered, self-collection of
      Dried blood spots (DBS) samples will improve compliance with the clinical recommendation of
      weekly Cytomegalovirus (CMV) testing of Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) recipients
      who are at high risk for late CMV disease. In this study, mobile devices will be used to
      remind HCT survivors to perform CMV monitoring using finger-stick collected DBS testing in
      their home setting or to visit their doctor's office to perform the test. 150 allogeneic HCT
      recipients &gt; /= 15 years of age will be randomized (2:1) to DBS monitoring or standard of
      care (per local institution) monitoring. Duration of study participation is anticipated to be
      within a range of 26 weeks to 43 weeks. The primary objective is to evaluate adherence to
      recommended CMV monitoring duration and interval during the first year after HCT upon
      enrollment using subject collected dried blood spot testing.

      recommended CMV monitoring duration and interval during the first year after HCT upon
      enrollment using subject collected dried blood spot testing. The secondary objectives are 1)
      To evaluate the mean difference between the recommended monitoring that each subject
      completes between the DBS and the control arm. 2) To Compare the incidence of CMV disease
      between the DBS monitoring and standard of care arm; 3) To evaluate the safety of DBS
      monitoring.
