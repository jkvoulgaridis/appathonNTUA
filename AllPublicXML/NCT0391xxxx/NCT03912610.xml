  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      By the method of multi-mode Magnetic Resonance Imaging, 5 patients with knee osteoarthritis
      are selected in this trial to observe the possible differences in the brain structure and
      function from the 5 healthy volunteers.

      In this study, 5 patients with knee osteoarthritis and 5 healthy volunteers were selected.
      The degree of pain is evaluated via visual analogue pain scale (VAS). The emotional state is
      evaluated by Hamilton anxiety scale (HAMA) or Hamilton depression scale (HAMD). The patients
      and healthy volunteers who meet the include criteria are include in the research. Then the
      spontaneous brain electrical activity is collected by multimodal brain magnetic resonance
      imaging technology. The spontaneous brain electrical activity is analyzed to find the
      differences between knee osteoarthritis patients and healthy volunteers. Further analysis of
      resting brain functional connectivity and information exchange changes in multifunctional
      areas, in order to elaborate the central mechanism of pain and emotion modulation.

        This study is a single-center randomized controlled clinical trial. It is expected to
        enroll 5 patients with knee osteoarthritis in the third affiliated hospital of zhejiang
        university of traditional Chinese medicine and recruit 5 healthy volunteers at the same
        time.
