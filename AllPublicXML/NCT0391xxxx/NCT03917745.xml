  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During pregnancy, women are at risk for mental health problems: up to 20% present with
      distress symptoms (depression and/or anxiety). Apart from the adverse effects on the woman
      herself, pregnancy distress negatively affects pregnancy outcome, infant health, postpartum
      mother-child interaction and child development.

      Mindfulness-based interventions are a type of intervention that is increasingly being used to
      treat symptoms of stress, anxiety and depression. They are cheap and accessible to the whole
      population.

      Current study aims to examine the effectiveness of a mindfulness training to reduce distress
      during pregnancy. Women who score above cut off on the Edinburgh Depression Scale (EDS) and
      Tilburg Pregnancy Distress Scale (TPDS) at 12 weeks of gestation, will be randomly allocated
      to the intervention or control group. Women in the intervention group will be contacted and
      invited to participate in the mindfulness-based intervention, which consists of 8 weeks of
      internet mindfulness training. The control group will receive care as usual.

      The primary outcome of the study is: Does the mindfulness internet training &quot;Ontspannen
      zwanger&quot;, offered during pregnancy, reduce pregnancy distress, compared to care as usual? The
      secondary outcome is: Does the mindfulness internet training result in better mindfulness
      skills?

    <intervention_model_description>The study is part of a large longitudinal cohort study among pregnant women. The study targets a specific subgroup of pregnant women with symptoms of psychological distress (depression and anxiety). Women who score above cut off on the Edinburgh Depression Scale (EDS) and Tilburg Pregnancy Distress Scale (TPDS) at 12 weeks of gestation, will be randomly allocated to the intervention or control group. Women in the intervention group will be contacted and invited to participate in the mindfulness-based intervention, which consists of 8 weeks of internet mindfulness training. The control group will receive care as usual.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Depressive symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Difference between the intervention group en the control group, measured at 28 weeks (after the intervention).</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by the 10-item Edinburgh Depression Scale (EDS). The EDS is the most widely used self-rating scale to assess depressive symptoms in the perinatal period. It consists of ten items and three sub-scales: anhedonia, anxiety and depression. The questionnaire has been validated in Dutch pregnant women. The EDS total score ranges from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating more depressive symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Negative Affect</measure>
    <time_frame>Difference between the intervention group en the control group, measured at 28 weeks (after the intervention).</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by a subscale of the Tilburg Pregnancy Distress Scale (TPDS): Negative Affect, which consists of 10 items. The TPDS has been validated among Dutch pregnant women and it is a reliable measure to assess pregnancy-related emotional distress. The total score ranges from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating more emotional distress symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Mindfulness skills</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured in the intervention group, the difference between 16 weeks (before the intervention) and 28 weeks (after the intervention).</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by three facets of the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire Short Form (FFMQ-3-SF): acting with awareness, non-judging and non-reacting, which consists of 15 items. The validity of the measure is established and indices of internal reliability were found to be adequate. The total score ranges from 0 to 60, with higher scores indicating better mindfulness skills.</description>

    <measure>Rumination</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured in the intervention group, the difference between 16 weeks (before the intervention) and 28 weeks (after the intervention).</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by the Rumination-Reflection Questionnaire (RRQ), which consists of 12 items and is a validated and reliable instrument. The score ranges from 0 to 48, with higher scores indicating more rumination.</description>

    <description>The web-based intervention consists of eight sessions including psycho-education about the mechanisms of stress, coping and relaxation, especially related to pregnancy, practicing mindfulness skills (i.e. mindful breathing, mindful moving, observing and letting-go of thoughts and emotions with a non-judgmental attitude), sharing experiences, and doing home assignments. The sessions have been developed specifically for pregnant women and acknowledge pregnancy-related distress. An online coach will review questions and home assignments of the participants. Women will start the training at 16 weeks gestation.</description>
