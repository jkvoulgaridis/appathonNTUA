  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MyPKFiT is a web-based application recently developed by Baxalta for the use in patients
      treated with Advate. MyPkFit has its basis in Bayesian forecasting, which allows estimation
      of individual PK parameters by a sparse sampling schedule, where only 2-3 samples are taken
      between 4 and 48 hours post infusion. With myPKFiT, it will, therefore, be possible to define
      an individual PK curve for each patient based on just a few sampling points and hence, taking
      the bleeding phenotype and the life style into account, potentially adjust the prophylactic
      treatment accordingly to optimize cost-effectiveness.

      As detailed in brief summary patients will, after accurate information verbally and written
      according to ethics approval, report bleeding events during previous 6 months. Blood samples
      are taken, FVIII analyzed (Advate patients) and the individual PK curve determined using
      MyPKFit. The curve will be discussed together with the patient and levels related to bleed
      events determined. If needed dose adjustment is done based on the curve. After a further 6
      month follow-up bleeds will again be evaluated as well as factor consumption. In this way a
      better personalized treatment based on PK and clinical phenotype will hopefully be achieved.
