  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fisherfolk are a high risk population for HIV and are prioritized to receive antiretroviral
      treatment (ART) in Uganda, but risky alcohol use among fisherfolk is a barrier to HIV care
      engagement; multilevel factors influence alcohol use and poor access to HIV care in fishing
      villages, including a lack of motivation, social support, access to savings accounts, and
      access to HIV clinics. This project aims to address these barriers, and subsequently reduce
      heavy alcohol use and increase engagement in HIV care, through an intervention in which
      counselors provide individual and group counseling to increase motivation, while also
      addressing structural barriers to care through increased opportunities for savings and
      increased social support. This may be a feasible approach to help this hard-to-reach
      population reduce drinking and increase access care, which could ultimately reduce mortality
      rates, improve treatment outcomes, and through its effect on HIV viral load, decrease the
      likelihood of transmitting HIV to others.

      The investigators propose to develop and pilot a brief combination intervention which
      addresses the key drivers of alcohol use and barriers to HIV care engagement and ART
      adherence in this population. This study addresses these multi-level factors in an
      intervention which combines a structural component of changing the mode of work payments from
      cash to mobile money, to reduce &quot;cash in the pocket,&quot; and increase the accessibility of
      savings through mobile phone-based banking services, with behavioral components to change
      behavior. For the behavioral components, the study combines and adapt two efficacious
      Motivational Interviewing (MI)-based alcohol interventions to the cultural and situational
      context of this population: a brief intervention tested in Kenya and an intervention rooted
      in behavioral economics which focuses on increasing the extent to which individuals' behavior
      is motivated by and consistent with their long-term goals such as saving money for the
      future—in which the structural component of the intervention is interwoven. The aims of the
      project are to: 1) Combine a promising structural (e.g., reducing &quot;cash in the pocket&quot;) and
      behavioral intervention to promote reductions in heavy alcohol use, engagement in HIV care,
      and ART adherence among HIV+ male fisherfolk. These interventions will be adapted and
      tailored to the population to create the proposed KISOBOKA (&quot;It is possible!&quot;) intervention.
      The investigators will refine the combination intervention through qualitative research with
      HIV+ male fisherfolk and community stakeholders and an initial pilot test with 15
      participants examining acceptability and feasibility; 2) Pilot the intervention, randomizing
      to the KISOBOKA intervention arm (n=80) or to the control arm (n=80, alcohol screening and
      referral). The investigators will assess feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary
      estimates of the potential for the intervention, as compared to control, to decrease heavy
      drinking frequency and improve HIV care engagement and ART adherence through 6 month follow
      up.

    <description>The KISOBOKA intervention adapts and combines a behavioral intervention with a structural component. The behavioral intervention component includes, alcohol screening, financial literacy training, and counseling and goal setting related to savings, alcohol use, and HIV care engagement. The structural intervention component changes the mode of work payment from cash to mobile money.</description>
