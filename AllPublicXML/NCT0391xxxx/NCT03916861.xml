    <textblock>
      This study was designed to compare the efficacy of BIA and physician adjustment to prevent
      intradialytic hypotension in patients with acute kidney injury who received renal replacement
      therapy. The investigators randomized 9 patients with acute kidney injury and volume
      overloaded who underwent acute hemodialysis for 45 sessions in Vajira hospital between
      October 2017 and February 2018. In physician adjust-group (control) estimate by physical
      examination and fluid balance record. Primary outcome was intradialytic hypotensive episode
      and secondary outcome was hemodialysis-related adverse events and other clinical outcome.

      Background

      Volume overload and intradialytic hypotension are significant complications with increasing
      mortality rate in hemodialysis patients. Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA) has been used
      to estimate the optimum weight in chronic hemodialysis patient to prevent intradialytic
      hypotension.Volume assessment in acute kidney injury is also of great importance , however,
      there are currently few methods to obtain an accurate assessment of hydration status in this
      scenario. This study was designed to compare the efficacy of BIA and physician adjustment to
      prevent intradialytic hypotension in patients with acute kidney injury who received renal
      replacement therapy.

      Methods

      The investigators randomized 9 patients with acute kidney injury and volume overloaded who
      underwent acute hemodialysis for 45 sessions in Vajira hospital between October 2017 and
      February 2018. Volume overload was defined by BIA with value more than&gt;0.4. In physician
      adjust-group (control) estimate by physical examination and fluid balance record. Primary
      outcome was intradialytic hypotensive episode and secondary outcome was hemodialysis-related
      adverse events and other clinical outcome.
