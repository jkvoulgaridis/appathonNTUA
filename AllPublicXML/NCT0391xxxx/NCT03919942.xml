    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the clinical effect and the impact on the quality
      of life of the coadjuvant treatment with Oxyflower® gel in cases of pericoronitis in lower
      third molar, compared to chlorhexidine gel and placebo gel.

      This study consist of 51 participants diagnosed with pericoronitis who received coadjuvant
      treatment with gel. The participants were submitted to emergency treatment, with local
      debridement and irrigation with saline solution followed by topical application of the
      randomized gel: oxyflower®, chlorhexidine, or placebo gel. In cases of pericoronitis with
      systemic signs / symptoms, such as fever, malaise and lymphadenopathy, systemic antibiotic
      therapy was prescribed one hour before debridement, lasting seven days. All participants
      received oral hygiene guidelines and were instructed to apply the same gel twice daily for
      one week . After 30 days, it was performed tooth removal for cases in which there is not
      enough space for dental eruption; or distal wedge surgery when there is space for dental
      eruption with excessive gingiva in the distal. It was evaluated as outcomes: pain, quality of
      life, depth of probing, level of bone crest in the distal of second molar, buccal opening and
      extent of edema / erythema. A comparative analysis was performed between the groups, before
      and after treatment.

    <description>Post-operative pain measured by visual analogic scale (VAS). The VAS comprises a 10cm horizontal line, with no marks. When responding to a VAS, subjects specify their level of pain by indicating a position along a continuous line between two end-points. Higher values represent a worse outcome.</description>
