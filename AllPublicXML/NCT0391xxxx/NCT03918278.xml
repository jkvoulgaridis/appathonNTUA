    <textblock>
      This is a dose escalation study to determine the safety and pharmacokinetics of MK-0482 as
      monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in participants with advanced
      solid tumors for which there is no available therapy which may convey clinical benefit.
