    <textblock>
      Predicting the risk of allergenic sensitizations and asthma development in the first year of
      life is difficult.

      Investigator decided to follow prospectively two cohorts of infants with acute bronchiolitis,
      hospitalized or treated at home, from the epidemic seasons of 2011-2012 and 2015-2017 to know
      their respiratory evolution, especially if they developed allergen sensitization and / or
      asthma.

      Follow-up consultation 6 years after an episode of acute bronchiolitis at Clermont-Ferrand
      hospital with:

        -  Consultation with a pneumopediatrician: collection of respiratory symptoms, respiratory
           treatments, evaluation of the atopic site and environmental risk factors for bronchial
           aggression, especially passive smoking;

        -  Physical examination ;

        -  Evaluation of precariousness during the same interview with the EPICES questionnaire;

        -  Prick tests with positive control (histamine) and negative (physiological saline) and
           prick for the main pneumallergens (mites, alternaria, grasses, cat and dog) and
           trophallergens (egg, milk, fish, soy, wheat, peanut);

        -  Blood test with blood count, determination of specific IgE (5 pneumallergens and 5
           trophallergens), dosage of sRAGE;

        -  Fonctionnal respiratory test with reversibility test

The diagnosis of asthma is established during a consultation by a pneumopediatrician on the following criteria:
≥3 documented respiratory symptoms ≥ 2 times;
Or an episode lasting ≥ 4 weeks;
With symptoms: tachypnea, wheezing, expiratory stridor, signs of chest retraction or wheezing diagnosed by a doctor.</description>
