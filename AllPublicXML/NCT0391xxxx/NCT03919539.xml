  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      hMe-Seal is a low-input whole-genome cell-free 5hmC sequencing method based on selective
      chemical labeling. It uses β-glucosyltransferase (βGT) to selectively label 5hmC with a
      biotin via an azide-modified glucose for pull-down of 5hmC-containing DNA fragments for
      sequencing. After selectively constructing 5hmC library, highthroughput-sequencing will be
      performed on an Illumina Nextseq-500 instrument. By ways of Rawdata processing, differential
      loci between Osteosarcoma group and control group will be detected to indentify specific
      epigenetic biomarkers of Osteosarcoma. From our previous trials, we identify geno sequencing
      related to beta-catenin pathways might have some relationship with osteosaroma primary or
      secondary drug resistance. Thus in this trial we try to further explore the drug resistance
      mechanism for advaced osteosarcoma second resistance to the combination therapy of Famitinib
      and Camrelizumab.

      cfDNA samples were prepared from peripheral blood collected from patients. Briefly, 8 ml of
      peripheral blood was collected from each subject using EDTA anticoagulant tubes, and the
      plasma sample was prepared within 6 h by centrifuging twice at 1 350× g for 12 min, and then
      centrifuging at 13500× g for 12 min. The prepared plasma samples (about 2 ml/subject) were
      immediately stored at -80 °C. The plasma cfDNA was isolated using the QIAamp Circulating
      Nucleic Acid Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol.

        Results of previous study showed high objective response but short-term activity of
        famitinib in advanced osteosarcoma. Given the recent success of immunotherapies,
        combinations of antiangiogenics with immune checkpoint blockers have become an attractive
        strategy. We aimed to investigate the activity of famitinib in combination with
        camrelizumab in patients with inoperable high-grade osteosarcoma progressing after
        chemotherapy.
