  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical treatment is still gold standard for pilonidal sinus disease. Several surgical
      techniques have been proposed to treat this disease in the last two decades. A new method -
      midline excision of pilonidal sinus and wound closure using gluteus maximus fascia plasty
      flap (GMFF) - was proposed recently as a new method of treatment that results in low
      reccurence rate and good cosmetic results.

      The aim of this study is to compare a new method (GMFF) with a traditional method (midline
      excision and primary closure) in terms of recurrence rate, complications and patient
      satisfaction with results.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pilonidal sinus disease (PSD) is a rather rare benign condition (about 26 cases per 100,000
      population) that affects primarily young adults. Because of purulent nature it is treated
      with surgery only.

      Traditional surgical techniques encompass midline excision of the purulent cyst and either
      leaving the wound &quot;lay open&quot; for secondary closure or midline primary closure. The latter
      method has a major drawback of high recurrence rate and very long healing and patient
      disability periods. Therefore alternative techniques to close the wound after pilonidal sinus
      excision were proposed. In some a muscular-cutaneous flaps are created and the wound is
      closed in a Z- or Y- or other shape manner. The recurrence rate of these techniques is
      significantly lower than with a traditional midline closure, but healing time and final
      cosmetic results are far from ideal in patient view.

      Recently a new method of wound closure was developed independently by a few groups that
      includes bilateral mobilisation of gluteus maximus muscles fascia and midline closure of the
      wound. Preliminary results demonstrated that this method leads to lower recurrence rate and
      better cosmetic results because the natal cleft is saved.
