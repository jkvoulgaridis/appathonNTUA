      Aim: The study was carried out in randomized control to determine the effect of two different
      distractions on pain and anxiety during blood collection.

      Methods: The population of the study consisted of children between ages of 4-10 years who
      applied for venipuncture to a training and research hospital in Turkey between July and
      December 2018. A total of 139 children were included in the study, 46 of them with virtual
      reality goggles and 43 of them with control group. Information Form, Child Anxiety Scale,
      Visual Analogue Scale and Wong Baker Pain Scale were used in the collection of data.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Children Fear Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>1 minute</time_frame>
    <description>The Children Fear Scale was used to evaluate the children's fear and anxiety. Children Fear Scale is a 0-4 scale, showing five faces that range from a neutral expression (0 = no anxiety) to a frightened face (4 = severe anxiety). Preprocedural and procedural pain, and anxiety were evaluated</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analogue Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>1 minute</time_frame>
    <description>The visual analogue scale has been used for evaluating pain levels. Children were asked to mark the level of their pain on a l00 mm., Visual Analogue scale marked at one end as &quot;no pain&quot; and at the other as &quot;worst pain imaginable.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Wong Baker Face Pain Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>1 minute</time_frame>
    <description>The Wong Baker Faces scale is a 0-10 scale. Six faces on the cards show a range of emotions from a smiling face (0 very happy/no pain) to a crying face (10 'hurts worst').</description>
