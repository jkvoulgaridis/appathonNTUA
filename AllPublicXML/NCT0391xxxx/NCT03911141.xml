  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to use a randomized, controlled trial to test the
      effectiveness of using gamification, financial incentives, or both to increase physical
      activity among patients with elevated risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease
      (ASCVD). ASCVD is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Regular
      physical activity has been shown to reduce the risk of ASCVD, but less than 50% of US adults
      achieve enough physical activity to obtain these benefits.

    <textblock>
      Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and
      mortality in the United States (US). Regular physical activity has been demonstrated to
      reduce the risk of ASCVD and is associated with a number of other health benefits. Yet, less
      than 50% of adults in the US achieve enough physical activity to actually obtain these
      benefits. Insights from behavioral economics have been shown to both better reflect the
      'predictable irrationality' of humans and to be effective in designing interventions that
      achieve sustained improvements in health behavior. Our prior work has demonstrated that
      interventions using financial incentives and gamification can leverage principles from
      behavioral economics to increase physical activity during 3-month interventions and sustain
      effects in 3-month follow-up periods. These findings warrant further investigation of
      longer-term effects. In this study, we conduct a four-arm randomized, controlled trial to
      evaluate the effectiveness of using behavioral economic approaches including gamification,
      financial incentives, or both to increase physical activity among patients with elevated risk
      for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease during a 12-month intervention with a 6-month
      follow-up.

    <description>Participants receive a daily text message stating whether or not they achieved their step goal on the prior day during the 12 months of intervention and 6 months of follow-up.</description>

    <description>Participants have an 8-week ramp-up period where daily goals increase from baseline to the step target, and sign a pledge agreeing to try their best to meet their goals.
Participants are entered into a game. Each week they receive 70 points. Each day they're told their step count and points. If the step goal was met they keep their points, but if not, they lose 10 points. At the end of the week if they have at least 40 points they move up a level, but if not, they drop a level. Participants start in the middle of 5 levels.
Participants choose a support partner who gets a weekly email with the participant's progress. We hold a 3-way phone call with the participant and supportive sponsor to discuss ways they can help the participant meet their goal. Every 8 weeks, have a follow up call if the participant is stuck in a lower level and restart them back at the middle level.
In the follow-up period, participants continue to get a daily text stating if they met their step goal.</description>

    <description>Participants are informed that each week that money is placed in a virtual account for them. Each day the participant is informed of their step count on the prior day. If the step goal was achieved, the balance remains. Each day the goal is not achieved, the participant is informed that some of the money was taken away. We will use an 8-week ramp-up period in which daily goals are increased gradually from baseline to targets.
During the follow-up period, participants in this arm will continue to receive a daily text message stating whether or not they achieved their step goal on the prior day.</description>
