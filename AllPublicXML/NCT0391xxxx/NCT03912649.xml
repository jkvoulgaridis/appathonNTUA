  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The safety and efficacy of a subdermal implant retrieval device (RemovAid) is investigated in
      a population of 25 women seeking removal of their palpable contraceptive implants.

      The primary endpoint of the device is to evaluate the performance of the device, specifically
      its success rate in removing palpable contraceptive implants. The device shall be able to
      fixate at least 80% of palpable implants, and successfully remove at least 90% of these
      implants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Similar to the REVALID and REVALID02 investigations, the REVALID03 investigation aims to
      recruit a total of 25 women with a palpable contraceptive implant due for removal, in order
      to obtain at least 20 successful fixations.

      The implant retrieval device aims to standardize and simplify the implant removal procedure.
      There is no comparator in the investigation. Descriptive data will be recorded, all recruited
      subjects will be exposed to the investigational medical device (IMD) The primary endpoint is
      the percentage of fixated implants that are successfully removed without the use of
      additional tools.
