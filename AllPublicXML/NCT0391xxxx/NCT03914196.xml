  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fontan-associated liver disease (FALD), including the development of cardiac cirrhosis and
      liver neoplasms (benign and malignant), occurs in a majority of patients with congenital
      heart disease palliated with the Fontan operation. However, the specific phenotype (fibrosis
      only, fibrosis + lesions, etc.) of disease and severity/timing of onset are variable. Chronic
      passive congestion of the liver due to the absence of a functional sub-pulmonary ventricle
      and resultant chronic central venous hypertension is suspected to be one of the chief drivers
      of FALD and recent work has demonstrated that ultrasound shear wave elastography can be used
      to noninvasively detect and measure the degree of liver congestion. Chronic passive
      congestion of the liver may also be a predictor of other Fontan-related complications, such
      as protein losing enteropathy, plastic bronchitis, and intractable ascites.

          1. Single ventricle physiology congenital heart disease undergoing Fontan operation;

          2. â‰¤5 years of age at the time of stage 3 Fontan operation;
