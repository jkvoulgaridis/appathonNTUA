  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT) was conducted to determine the effects of two neuromuscular
      electrical stimulation protocols with different stimulation frequencies on motor recovery in
      older adults with spastic hemiparesis after a stroke.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Impairment of the upper limb is one of the most frequent consequences of stroke and directly
      impacts on the patient's functional status and quality of life. It is estimated that less
      than 50% of stroke survivors will recover arm function, which will exert a great economic,
      social and personal toll.

      Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) is one of the techniques suggested for upper limb
      recovery in stroke patients. However, after considering the bibliographic background, more
      studies are required in order to test its effectiveness, to establish the most efficient NMES
      protocols and to assess the characteristics of the patients who can benefit the most from
      this treatment. With this regard, the parameters of the stimulation are currently subject to
      debate, and more data are needed to optimize the application of this treatment. The aim of
      this study was to evaluate and compare the effects of two neuromuscular electrical
      stimulation protocols with different stimulation frequencies on motor impairment,
      kinaesthetic sensation, functional motor ability, activities of daily living, and quality of
      life in older adults with spastic hemiparesis suffering a stroke.

      To cope with the objective of the present study, RCT was conducted. Subjects who met
      inclusion criteria were recruited from a hospital rehabilitation unit. After the screening
      and signed consent, participants were randomly allocated to the control group or one of both
      experimental groups. NMES was applied on wrist and finger extensors for 30 minutes, 3
      sessions per week for 8 weeks. The electrostimulation protocols were only differentiated in
      the parameter of the stimulation frequency, 35 Hz or 50 Hz, depending on the experimental
      group to which the patient belonged to. Outcome measures were collected at the beginning,
      after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment, and after a follow-up period (4 weeks).

    <measure>Change in range of motion</measure>
    <time_frame>The groups were assessed at baseline and 12 weeks post-intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>A universal goniometer was used to measure the resting angle, active extension and passive extension of the wrist. A special JAMAR finger goniometer was used to evaluate the resting angle and active extension of the metacarpophalangeal joints of the fingers.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in dynamometric strength</measure>
    <time_frame>The groups were assessed at baseline and 12 weeks post-intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>The grip strength was assessed by means of a JAMAR hydraulic hand dynamometer and the pinch strength using the JAMAR hydraulic pinch gauge. Unit of measurement was kgf. Three repetitions were done in both evaluations, taking the highest value and leaving a resting period of 1 minute between them.</description>

    <measure>Change in muscle tone</measure>
    <time_frame>The groups were assessed at baseline and 12 weeks post-intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Hypertonia of the finger and wrist flexors was measured using the modified Ashworth scale (MAS). MAS was used to categorize the severity of muscle tone by judging resistance to passive movement. It is a 6-point scale (0, 1, 1+ 2, 3, and 4) that ranges from 1 (=no increase in tone) to 4 (=limb rigid in flexion or extension). The assessment was started 5 minutes after laying the subject down in the supine position and using a single passive movement to evaluate each muscle group.</description>

    <measure>Change in the mean electromyographic (EMG) amplitude</measure>
    <time_frame>The groups were assessed at baseline and 12 weeks post-intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>The Muscle Trainer model METR-0 (Mega Electronics Ltd, Kuopio, Finland) surface electromyograph was used. Circular adhesive surface bipolar electrodes (Ambú® Blue Sensor) were used and placed parallel to the muscle fibers. The mean amplitude of the EMG signal (in µV) of the muscle was recorded in the radial extensor and the radial flexor of the carpus. The patient was asked to perform maximum voluntary isometric contractions of both the flexors and extensors of the wrist for five seconds against manual resistance and the electrical activity of both the agonist and antagonist muscles was recorded simultaneously.</description>

    <time_frame>The groups were assessed at baseline and 12 weeks post-intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>The Muscle Trainer model METR-0 (Mega Electronics Ltd, Kuopio, Finland) surface electromyograph was used. The antagonist co-activation ratio, both for the flexors and extensors of the wrist, was calculated using the following formula (antagonist activity/ [agonist activity + antagonist activity] x100%) (Reference: J Electromyogr Kinesiol. 2014;24:731-738) which provides an estimate of the relative activation of the agonist-antagonist muscle pair and also of the magnitude of the co-activation of the antagonist.</description>

    <measure>Change in kinaesthetic sensation</measure>
    <time_frame>The groups were assessed at baseline and 12 weeks post-intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Hand kinaesthesia was assessed by the Revised Nottingham Sensory Assessment (RNSA) subscale. The RNSA includes three subscales: tactile sensation, kinesthetic sensation, and stereognosis. For kinesthetic sensation, all three aspects of the movement were tested: appreciation of movement, its direction, and accurate joint position sense. The limb on the affected side of the body was supported and moved by the examiner in various directions but the movement is only at one joint at a time. The patients were asked to mirror the change of movement with the other limb. This subscale ranges from 0 to 3. Higher scores indicate better kinaesthetic sensation.</description>

    <measure>Change in activities of daily living</measure>
    <time_frame>The groups were assessed at baseline and 12 weeks post-intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>A score of the Barthel Index ranging from 0 to 100 was collected where 0 is the minimum (worst outcome) and 100 is the maximum (best outcome).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in health-related quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>The groups were assessed at baseline and 12 weeks post-intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>COOP/WONCA charts were used. This instrument is a generic health status questionnaire which comprises nine single-item scales: physical fitness, feelings (mental well-being), daily activities, social activities, change in health and overall health, pain, social support, and quality of life. Each chart is rated on a five-point Likert scale with accompanying pictorial representations. Lower scores indicate better health-related quality of life.</description>
