  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic resistance training has been shown to increase muscle cross-sectional area, volume
      and strength. Individuals participating in a resistance training program may wish to consume
      protein supplements to aid recovery and maximise adaptation. Furthermore, antioxidants have
      been shown to aid recovery from acute bouts of exercise. However, the effect of antioxidants
      combined with protein on long term-training adaptation is not fully understood.

      This study will combine measures of muscle size, muscle strength and function, and the
      underlying changes in muscle metabolism in order to assess the effect of consuming a combined
      protein-antioxidant supplement during a 30 session resistance training program.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Supplemental protein ingestion is an established method for augmenting gains in fat free
      mass, muscle strength and muscle cross sectional area following a period of resistance
      exercise training. In addition to protein, supplements high in polyphenols such as berry and
      pomegranate extract are believed to be an effective method of reducing soreness and
      facilitating recovery following a single bout of resistance exercise.

      However, whilst polyphenols are shown to facilitate recovery from a single session of
      resistance exercise, their effect on adaptations to repeated bouts of resistance exercise are
      unknown. Asking this question will allow a detailed investigation of the mechanisms by which
      protein-polyphenol ingestion may affect adaptations to resistance exercise training when
      compared to a non protein or polyphenol containing placebo, which is an important yet
      underexplored area

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and Female

          -  18 - 40 years of age

          -  Recreationally active

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any diagnosed metabolic impairment (e.g. type 1 or 2 Diabetes). Such impairments can
             affect skeletal muscle metabolism

          -  Any diagnosed cardiovascular disease or hypertension

          -  Use of nutritional supplements (e.g. protein, polyphenols, vitamins, antioxidants) as
             use of nutritional supplements during the study period may interfere with the
             physiological responses to the supplements of interest administered in this study.

          -  Habitual dietary protein intake &lt;0.8 g/kg/day or &gt;1.6 g/kg/day as calculated with a
             three day diet diary. Habitually low protein may impair adaptations to resistance
             exercise training and a habitually excessive protein intake may negate the benefit of
             protein supplementation.

          -  Current musculoskeletal injury that may impair exercise performance or may be
             exacerbated due to this studies exercise protocol.

          -  Resistance trained (participating in structured resistance exercise 3 or more times
             per week for &gt;6 months), endurance trained (participating in structured endurance
             exercise for &gt;6h per week for &gt;6 months), or sedentary participants as these are not
             the populations of interest.

          -  Chronic use of anti-inflammatory medicines prior to the study and unwillingness to
             refrain from taking anti-inflammatory medications during the study as these
             medications may affect skeletal muscle metabolism and/or adaptation to exercise.

          -  Individuals who carry an epi-pen, or those with a diagnosed allergy or who believe
             that they have an allergy to milk or milk products, crustacean shellfish, tree nuts,
             or peanuts

          -  Individuals with a severe allergy to egg, fish, wheat or soy ingredients as the
             product is manufactured in a facility that contains these ingredients

          -  Individuals with non removable metallic implants (including heart pacemaker, cochlea
             implants, medication pumps, surgical clips, plates or screws) or claustrophobia
