  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigation of how a single session of an attentional filter exercise of distractor
      inhibition combined with tDCS modulates cognitive functions like working memory, decision
      making and attentional control.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as a between subject design with two groups defined by real or sham
      tDCS. The distractor inhibition exercise is conducted under either sham or real tDCS.
      Cognitive performance is assessed pre and post tDCS application, complemented by a
      short-termed follow-up on a consecutive day. Interindividual working memory capacity at
      baseline is taken into consideration.
