  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Centra nervous system (CNF) damage in multiple sclerosis (MS), are mainly attributed to
      myelin destruction, axonal abnormalities and subsequent degeneration, and are responsible for
      serious deficiencies. Current therapies are focused on the treatment of inflammation with
      several types of anti-inflammatory agents. However, there is an urgent need for innovative
      therapies promoting neuroregeneration and particularly myelin repair.

      It has been demonstrated that testosterone can act through neural androgen receptors to
      promote proliferation and differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursors into mature
      oligodendrocytes in a cuprizone-induced animal model of demyelination. The rare clinical
      trials on testosterone are mainly exploratory. Here, we sought to demonstrate an effect of
      testosterone supplementation in testosterone-deficient patients in a multicenter, randomized,
      parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial.

      The main objective will be to determine the neuroprotective and remyelinating effects of
      testosterone using tensor diffusion imaging techniques and thalamic atrophy analyzes.

      As secondary objectives, we would like to study the impact of testosterone supplementation on
      other conventional and unconventional MRI parameters and on clinical outcomes (cognition,
      fatigue, quality of life, impact on work / activity and anxiety / depression).
