  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical feasibility of the angiographic Flat
      Detector CT perfusion imaging (6s PBV) technique. The investigators will examine the specific
      vessel distribution of patients with steno-occlusive disease, treated with a surgical
      extracranial-intracranial bypass and assess the cerebral perfusion during test occlusion upon
      a neurovascular treatment and in intracranial tumor patients referred for potential
      pre-operative embolization.

      This study encompasses three scientific objectives:

        1. What is the selective contribution of an individual bypass artery to the brain
           perfusion?

        2. Is a selective intra-arterial angiographic perfusion examination useful in the
           decision-making of performing pre-operative embolization of intracranial tumors?

        3. What is the usefulness of performing additive 6s PBV images compared to classical 2D
           angiography and/or clinical neurological evaluation in case of test occlusion in the
           evaluation of possible mother vessel occlusion in treatment of complex neurovascular
           diseases?
