  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nutrition is a key component of burn care. The primary goal of nutrition is to provide
      adequate supply in macro and micronutrients that are necessary to maintain organ function but
      also to wound healing, infection control and muscle preservation.

      Studies about nutrition and burn care are mainly focused on severe burn patients. There is a
      few or no data regarding nutrition in minor burns. Those patients rarely receive a
      multidisciplinary approach, at least in Belgium.

      The present study aimed to describe the nutritional condition of less severe burn patients
      treated as outpatients in a Belgian burn center. The ultimate goal was to determine whether
      this population needs specific dietetics follow-up or not.

    <description>Using a standardized food questionnaire, mean daily nutritional intakes were calculated for each patient (macronutrients and micronutrients). Food questionnaire is a questionnaire created by our dietetics unit, aiming to quantify the amount of food eaten at each meal. Quantities of macronutrients and micronutrients at each meal were then calculated using tables of food content (Nubel for all nutrients, excepting vitamin E calculated according Ciqual table).</description>
