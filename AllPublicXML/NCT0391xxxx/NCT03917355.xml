  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The quality of the therapeutic intervention in a first psychotic episode is a major challenge
      for quality and effectiveness of treatment. This project aims to better understand the
      mechanisms underlying the quality of communication between patient and psychiatrist,
      especially those related to non-verbal communication. Psychiatrist/patient interpersonal
      motor synchronization is a reliable index of therapeutic alliance and a predictor of
      psychotherapy effectiveness. This project aims to show a link between psychiatrist and
      patient motor synchrony and treatment adherence. This link could be explained by an
      association between therapeutic alliance and motor synchronization.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several studies have highlighted the utmost importance of initial medical and psychosocial
      support during a first psychotic episode. Recent research has shown that non-verbal
      communication and particularly interpersonal motor synchronization between the patient and
      his psychiatrist is a key factor in therapeutic alliance. However, such hypothesis have never
      been tested in terms of treatment adherence neither in a first psychotic episode, nor during
      a 6-month follow-up. By measuring the interpersonal motor synchronization between the patient
      and psychiatrist during a video recorded interview at inclusion, month-3 and month-6, the
      project aims to validate the hypothesis that a high level of interpersonal synchronization
      should be associated with a high level of therapeutic alliance. This therapeutic alliance
      being hypothesized as a mediator between synchronization and treatment adherence, the project
      should show for the first time in a first psychotic episode that the use of reliable and
      objective variables extracted from the analysis of the synchronization between psychiatrist
      and patient allows to predict the outcome of therapeutic and treatment alliance.

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>It is a self-administered questionnaire with 11 items that measures the alliance perceived by a patient towards his or her doctor. The scale is a 4-point ordinal scale (&quot;Yes, it is true&quot; to &quot;No, it is totally false&quot;). It has been validated in French (Misdrahi et al., 2009) and is a valid tool for measuring therapeutic alliance in schizophrenia. It concerns the patient's feelings about the therapeutic alliance. The 4 Ordinal Point Alliance Scale consists of eleven clearly stated items and easy to understand.</description>

    <measure>Functioning Remission of General Schizophrenia</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The FROGS scale will be used to assess patient functioning. This questionnaire was developed, in French, according to the method of a consensus of experts, following a search in the main databases. This questionnaire has a good internal consistency (α=0.909) and good external validity (GFE score, r=0.56). The factor analysis identified 3 areas: &quot;social functioning&quot;, &quot;daily life&quot;, &quot;treatment&quot;. The stability of the questionnaire was validated with a new evaluation at 1.5 years of patients and shows a good correlation of FROGS scores with other functioning evaluation scales. This questionnaire therefore has solid psychometric qualities. A total score is computed based on the sum of its 19 items ranging each from 1 (do not do) to 5 (do perfectly). The lower the score, the lower the functioning.</description>

    <description>The experimenter reads a list of 16 words. The patient must then return as many words as possible (immediate free recall), repeated 5 times. The experimenter reads a new list of 16 words, this new list serves as an interference. The patient is asked to return as many words as possible from the second list (immediate free recall). Then the patient is instructed to try to return as many words as possible from first list (free short term recall), then comes an indication phase. 20 minutes break without verbal tests. The patient is instructed again to return as many words as possible from first list (free long-term recall) and arrives to complete a new phase of indication (long-term indexed recall). This test highlights long-term memory recovery processes as well as long-term memory consolidation processes. The standard score is the Total Recall Responses (160).</description>

    <description>Motion Energy Analysis is a valid, robust and objective measure of the degree of Motor Synchrony between two people.It is captured using two cameras oriented respectively towards the patient and the clinician. This video analysis consists in extracting the amount of movement present between two successive images (Number of pixels that differs between two successive video frames) and thus automatically extracting the activity of the patient and that of the clinician during an interview. The comparison between these two time series by cross-correlation gives a single measure r representing the quantity of Motor Synchrony present in the exchange between the patient and the clinician. Therefore MS ranges from 0 (no synchrony) to 1 (perfect synchrony).The higher the value, the higher the synchronisation.</description>
