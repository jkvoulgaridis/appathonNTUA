  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the efficacy and acceptability of a guided internet delivered transdiagnostic
      intervention, targeting mild to moderate clinical symptoms of anxiety and depression and
      emphasizing the changes taking place at the level of the structures of the self.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The effectiveness of a Transdiagnostic Cognitive-Behavioral Treatment will be compared with
      an improved version of it, in which new intervention techniques were added, pointing out the
      importance of improving some self-concept dimensions in reducing symptoms of anxiety and
      depression. In order to prove this, the study design will include two active intervention
      groups; a standard transdiagnostic intervention protocol will be delivered to one group and
      an improved version of the same transdiagnostic protocol will be delivered to the other
      group. The new added techniques targets some self-concepts, namely self-compassion,
      unconditional self-acceptance and self-esteem. The main goal of the study is to concurrently
      test effectiveness of these two transdiagnostic approaches in reducing symptoms of anxiety
      and depression and improving the above-mentioned self-concepts. This non-inferiority trial
      has the power to detect an effect size larger than Cohen's d = .40 (including 20% attrition
      at post-test and 6 month follow-up)

    <description>A longitudinal study conducted before has shown that self-compassion, unconditional self-acceptance, self-esteem and self concept clarity could be considered risk factors for the severity of the clinical symptoms in anxiety and depression. This is the main reason why this arm consists of the Transdiagnostic intervention program for emotional disorders plus a number of intervention techniques targeting the self-concepts mentioned before. The intervention, based on the Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) principles, is designed to encourage participants to confront and experience uncomfortable emotions, and use adaptive coping mechanisms. Moreover, additional intervention techniques targeting self-concepts will be used to improve participants' self.</description>

    <description>This transdiagnostic program is based on the general Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) principles and targets core higher order factors such as negative affectivity and emotion dysregulation, using common intervention techniques applicable across disorders. The program was designed to directly address the aversive emotional experiences often reported by clients, hoping to reverse participants' maladaptive thinking style and dysfunctional behaviors. In addition, specific intervention designed to improve self-compassion, unconditional self-acceptance, self-esteem and self concept clarity were added.</description>
