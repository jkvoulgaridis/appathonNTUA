      The Cedars-Sinai SHI Takotsubo Registry and Proteomic Study is an observational registry that
      will collect retrospective and prospective demographic, clinical, hemodynamic, laboratory and
      other diagnostic parameters, therapy and outcome data from individuals who meet the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria of Takotsubo Registry protocol. Subjects will also be invited to
      provide a blood sample utilizing a Mitra kit sent to their homes. Researchers from the Barbra
      Streisand Women's Heart Center will analyze Registry data to identify Takotsubo phenotypes,
      improve diagnostic capabilities, better predict recurrence rates, and develop targeted
      Takotsubo treatments.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Registry outreach will begin with an informational and inspirational website and will utilize
      social media and patient-driven activism through Facebook, blogs and Twitter modalities that
      have demonstrated efficiencies in other patient-centered research efforts. Subjects will
      upload specific clinical materials into Cedar-Sinai's web-enabled cloud storage and which
      will be screened by trained Smidt Heart Institute physicians. The Registry utilizes on-line,
      e-consent and enrollment connected to a REDCap database that will allow efficient data input
      for analysis. All potential subjects who have been diagnosed with Takotsubo or have been
      informed by their physician that they meet diagnosis criteria, will need to provide
      information for review that includes: hospitalization records, from the time of Takotsubo
      event, with laboratory data (particularly -- troponin level), ECG and CTA. Registrants will
      be asked to respond to annual update surveys.

      The goal is to accurately understand the prevalence, recurrence and prospective status of the
      Takotsubo, to determine which individuals are at risk of reoccurrence or subsequent adverse
      event and to determine potential treatment targets to develop therapeutic strategies

      Primary:

        -  To establish a large USA-based database for patients with Takotsubo with a convenient
           and easy to use on-line patient-advocate registry using digital media marketing, Box
           cloud data access and storage, accurate case adjudication, and automated follow-up.

        -  Participants will also be offered the option of participating in the Takotsubo Proteomic
           Registry by providing remote ambulatory Mitra blood samples.

      Secondary:

      â€¢ To establish a clinical trial platform for patient-centered point-of-care trials to improve
      diagnostics, clinical care and outcomes.
