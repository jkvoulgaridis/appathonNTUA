  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase III randomized, multicenter study with two different arm:

        -  experimental: prophylactic surgery plus HIPEC CO2 performed with mitomycin and cisplatin

        -  comparator: standard surgery

      Adjuvant treatment after surgery is mandatory except for documented cases of non-eligibility
      in both arms.

      Patient will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio. Randomization will be performed during surgery if
      the total resection of tumor will be reached according to center and neoadjuvant chemotherapy
      as stratification variables.

      This is a phase III randomized, multicenter study with two different arm:

        -  experimental: prophylactic surgery plus HIPEC CO2 performed with mitomycin and cisplatin

        -  comparator: standard surgery Adjuvant treatment after surgery is mandatory except for
           documented cases of non-eligibility.

      Patient will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio. Randomization will be performed during surgery if
      the total resection of tumor will be reached according to center and neoadjuvant chemotherapy
      as stratification variables.

      The primary objective of the study is to compare the efficacy of prophylactic surgery
      (radical gastric resection, appendectomy, round ligament of the liver resection and bilateral
      adnexectomy) plus HIPEC CO2 versus standard surgery in terms of disease free survival (DFS).

      Patients affected by gastric carcinoma at high risk of developing peritoneal carcinomatosis
      will be randomized in this study.

             cervix).

          5. Psychological, family or social conditions which may negatively affect the treatment
             and follow-up protocol.

          6. Poor general conditions (ECOG &gt; 2).

          7. Impaired cardiac function (history of congestive heart failure or FE &lt;40%). Clinically
             significant cardiovascular disease: cerebral vascular accident/stroke (&lt; 6 months

             Association Classification Class &gt; II) or serious uncontrolled cardiac Arrhythmia

          8. Impaired renal function (creatinine&gt; 1.5 upper limit of normal or creatinine clearance
             &lt;60 mL / min).

          9. Impaired hepatic function (AST, ALT &gt;2.5 upper limit of normal, bilirubin &gt; 1.5 upper
             limit of normal).

         10. Impaired hematopoietic function (leucocytes &lt;4000 / mm3, neutrophils &lt;1500 / mm 3,
             platelets &lt;100000 / mm3).

         11. Impaired pulmonary function (presence of COPD or other pulmonary restrictive
             conditions with FEV1 &lt;50% or DLCO &lt;40% of normal age value).

         12. History or presence of other disease, metabolic dysfunction, or clinical laboratory
             finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that contraindicates use
             of HIPEC or chemotherapy or patient at high risk from treatment complications.

         13. Pregnancy.

         14. Krukenberg tumor
