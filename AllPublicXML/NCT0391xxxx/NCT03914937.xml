  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is looking at whether wearing a virtual reality device will help reduce pain and
      anxiety during minor procedures
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who are undergoing minor plastic surgery procedures will be assigned to either wear
      a virtual reality device or to listen to music of their choice. Patients will still get the
      standard lidocaine/novocaine numbing agent. Patients will be asked questions about their
      anxiety level and pain level. Heart rate and blood pressure will be monitored as measures of
      anxiety and pain.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective pain measured using the 11-point Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), which is widely employed and is a validated measure of pain (17) at the half way point and 1 minute after the procedure.The scale name is Pain Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) it is a validated scale for graphically measuring pain. The scale range is 0-10 (11 point scale). 0 is no pain. 10 is intolerable pain. The values on this scale will be averaged for each cohort.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Blood pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>Systolic and diastolic blood pressures (mmHg) at the half way point of the procedure as well as 1 minute after completion of the procedure. Blood pressure will be measured as a surrogate measure for objective pain. Blood pressures will be averaged for each cohort. The data will be collected by Dynamap automated Blood pressure monitor.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Heart rate</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>Heart rate at the half way point of the procedure as well as 1 minute after completion of the procedure will be measured in beats per minute using pulse oximetry. Heart rate will be measured as a surrogate measure for objective pain. Heart rates will be averaged for each cohort.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>Anxiety using an 11-point Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) at the half way point and 1 minute after completion of the procedure.The scale name for subjective anxiety measurement will be the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) it is a validated scale for graphically measuring anxiety. The scale range is 0-10 (11 point scale). 0 is no pain. 10 is intolerable pain. The values on this scale will be averaged for each cohort.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>Patient satisfaction determined by the Global Rating Scale measured as 1-5 with 1 being unsatisfied and 5 being extremely satisfied. The Global Rating Scale (GRS) for patient satisfaction is a validated scale. These values will be averaged in each cohort.</description>
