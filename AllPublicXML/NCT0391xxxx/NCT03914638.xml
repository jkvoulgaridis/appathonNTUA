    <textblock>
      This study examines the effect of adjuvant therapy with the oral beta-agonist Salbutamol in
      patients with generalized myasthenia gravis on stable standard of care having residual
      symptoms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Myasthenia Gravis (MG) causes various degrees of increased muscular fatigue and ocular,
      bulbar, respiratory and extremity symptoms.

      Residual symptoms often remain despite treatment with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and
      immunosuppressive agents. Escalation of immunosuppressive treatment may provide additional
      benefit but is associated with potentially severe side effects, and high economic costs.

      Treatment with beta-agonists has been investigated in animal models of MG, and in small,
      randomized pilot studies of generalized MG. Adjuvant therapy with oral beta-agonists in MG
      may be safe and cheap and may improve symptoms.

      The trial will examine the tolerability and efficacy of adjuvant therapy with the oral
      beta-agonist Salbutamol in patients with generalized myasthenia gravis on stable standard of
      care having residual symptoms.

      Present study is an investigator-initiated, randomized, placebo-controlled, rater and
      subject-blinded crossover study.

      Study consists of Screening Period (4 weeks), Treatment Period 1 (8 weeks), Washout Period (4
      weeks), Treatment Period 2 (8 weeks).
