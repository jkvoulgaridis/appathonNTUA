  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching aim of the study is to determine the role of insulin signaling on the
      neurobiological substrates subserving anhedonia within individuals with mood disorders (i.e.,
      Bipolar Disorder (BD) and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)).

      Specific aims include:

        1. Molecular: Assessment of components of the insulin cascade, as well as of anhedonia and
           reward-related processes, using a proteomics and gene expression approach;

        2. Physiology: Measurement of peripheral sensitivity to insulin and metabolic correlates,
           including body mass index and dyslipidemia;

        3. Neural Circuits: Evaluation of the insulin sensitivity of prefrontal (e.g. prefrontal
           cortex) and striatal (e.g. nucleus accumbens, ventral tegmental area) networks in the
           resting-state and during an effort-based decision making test, using acutely
           administered intranasal insulin and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI);

        4. Behavioral: Measurement of willingness to make effort for rewards, as well as of other
           components of reward response and anhedonia, using validated behavioral tasks and
           clinical scales (e.g. Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale - SHPS).

      This initiative represents a proof-of-concept study that insulin is important to anhedonia,
      neurocognitive functioning, and behavioural deficits in MDD, representing a novel and safe
      therapeutic avenue.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twenty-five adults between the ages of 18 to 50 years with DSM-5 defined MDD or BDI/II, in a
      depressive episode will be enrolled. Enrollment into the study is voluntary. Eligible
      participants will provide written informed consent. Participants will be enrolled from the
      outpatient Mood Disorders Psychopharmacology Unit (MDPU), University Health Network (UHN),
      University of Toronto.

      The MDPU case report form will gather information on the participant's course of illness
      variables. Conventional pharmacological treatments for MDD and BD will be permitted.

      Participants will be excluded if they are receiving insulin and/or oral hypoglycemiants; have
      been diagnosed with possible or probable Alzheimer's Disease, Mild Cognitive Impairment, or
      any other dementia; have a history of neurological disorder, or evidence of neurologic or
      other physical illness that could produce cognitive deterioration; have substance use
      disorder within 3 months before screening or a positive baseline toxicology screen; have a
      clinically unstable general medical illness; are pregnant or breastfeeding; have MRI
      contraindications.

      The ongoing provision of care is not contingent on enrollment and/or completion of the study
      protocol. Furthermore, there will be ongoing communication with the participant's primary
      care provider in regards to their participation in this study.

      This is a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. The initial visit
      entails the provision of detailed study information to the patient and obtainment of written
      informed consent from the participant. The participant will then meet a research team member
      at a later date for a screening visit. This study requires a total of 2 visits.

      Screening and Baseline Assessment: Subjects will first meet with a staff psychiatrist for a
      clinical consultation. After obtaining consent and if inclusion criteria are met, a medical
      comorbidity questionnaire will be administered to screen for concurrent and lifetime medical
      conditions. Participant's demographic characteristics and current medications, as well as
      lifetime psychotropic medications received will be recorded. The investigators will also
      assess dietary intake with the short food frequency questionnaire (SFFQ); smoking, by
      questioning number of cigarettes smoked per day, age when smoking stated, and quit date, if
      applicable, to calculate a smoking pack-year history; physical activity using the
      International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ); and alcohol and/or substance abuse with
      the Addiction Severity Index (ASI). In addition, the investigators will assess demographics,
      socioeconomic status, medical history, and family psychiatric history; childhood trauma
      history with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) will also be assessed. Participants
      will also be asked to complete an MRI screening questionnaire to ensure that they have no
      contraindications. The following self-reported measures will be carried out: Perceived
      Deficits Questionnaire-Depression (PDQ-D), Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS), UCLA life Stress
      (Episodic), DeJong Gierveld Loneliness Scale, Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Social
      and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale (SOFAS). Participants will be required to
      complete a urine drug screen. Female participants will be asked to do blood work to confirm
      they are not pregnant.

      Physiological Assessment: Anthropometric (i.e. BMI, waist-hip ratio) and metabolic
      measurements (i.e. fasting glucose, fasting insulin, glycated hemoglobin, lipids and HOMA-IR)
      will be completed at each study visit.

      Behavioral assessment: These tasks are simple, user-friendly tools that provide an
      opportunity, when used in conjunction with the most widely used questionnaires, to gain novel
      insights on reward behaviors in mood disorders.

        1. The primary behavioral measurement will be effort-based decision-making, assessed using
           the Effort-Expenditure for Rewards Task (EEfRT), which will be done in a fMRI paradigm.

        2. Assessments will include the validated anhedonia scale Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale
           (SHPS), and the mood questionnaires Montgomery-Ã…sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS),
           and Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) during each study visit.

      Neural Circuits Assessment: A promising tool to study the effect of insulin on CNS is
      intranasal insulin, which is delivered directly into the brain, without relevant effects on
      peripheral glucose. A single dose of intranasal insulin has been shown to influence brain
      activation, increasing regional perfusion and functional connectivity between the hippocampus
      and the PFC. Acute administration of intranasal in randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over
      designs has been previously used to determine regional responses to insulin in the
      resting-state or during tasks.

      After screening and baseline assessment, participants will receive a crossover treatment
      assignment of either insulin or diluent followed by an MRI scan, with a washout period of 1
      week. Therefore, participants will receive a total of 2 MRI scans throughout the course of
      the study- one following the first treatment, and one following the second treatment. The
      subsample will be enriched for the presence of self-reported anhedonia, using a score of
      greater than 2 on the SHPS as a cut-off, which provides the best discrimination between
      &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;abnormal&quot; level of hedonic tone. This subsample will also have equal
      representation of normal weight and obese participants. Imaging procedures will be done in
      collaboration with the Toronto Neuroimaging Facility (ToNI). ToNI is a shared research
      center, dedicated to research and teaching in human neuroimaging at the University of
      Toronto, run by the Department of Psychology.

      To proxy insulin activity within pre-selected brain regions, the investigators will use a
      provocation paradigm, involving the administration of exogenous intranasal insulin, based on
      the published work of other research groups. Activation of brain regions will be assessed
      during the resting state and task-based reward paradigm (i.e. EEfRT), following an intranasal
      administration of either 160 units of intranasal insulin or diluent (insulin and placebo will
      be prepared as nasal sprays), in a randomized, double-blinded, cross-over design. A
      hypothesis-driven region of interest approach will be used to investigate initially the
      striatum and the medial PFC (mPFC). Willingness to make effort for rewards will be measured
      with the EEfRT.

      Imaging procedures will be started with a safety monitoring for glucose and cardiovascular
      vital signs. An insulin/placebo spray will be administered intranasally and, within 30 min,
      fMRI measurement will be performed. Venous blood samples, for determination of plasma glucose
      and insulin concentrations, will be obtained at the time of the insulin/placebo spray
      administration and immediately after the scan. The 2 scans for each individuals will be
      acquired on the same scanner. Subjects will be scanned using a 3.0-Tesla Signa HDx scanner
      with an 8-channel phased-array receiver coil (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, Wisconsin) consisting
      of a structural and functional neuroimaging, comprising:

        1. Whole-brain 3-D T1-weighted Inversion-Recovery prepared Fast Spoiled Gradient-Echo
           (IR-FSPGR) anatomical scan with the following parameters: (TI/TR/TE = 450/8/3 ms, matrix
           size 256 Ã— 256, field of view 22 Ã— 22 cm, slice thickness = 1 mm, and flip angle = 15Â°)

        2. Whole-brain, T2*-weighted BOLD echo planar imaging (EPI) during awake resting state with
           the following parameters: (TR/TE = 2000/30 ms, 3.5 x 3.5 x 3.5 mm voxel size, field of
           view 24x24 cm, 39 slices, slice thickness 3.5 mm, matrix size 64x64, number of frames =
           405, flip angle = 70Â°)),

        3. Three runs of whole-brain, T2*-weighted BOLD EPI series during task-based reward
           paradigm with the same parameters as in ii.

    <measure>Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Scale that assesses manic symptoms. The scale has 11 items and is based on the patient's subjective report of his/her clinical condition over the previous 48 hours. Additional information is based upon clinical observations made during the course of the clinical interview. Each item assesses a severity rating. There are four items that are graded on a 0 to 8 scale (irritability, speech, thought content, and disruptive/aggressive behavior), while the remaining seven items are graded on a 0 to 4 scale. Typical YMRS baseline scores can vary a lot and they depend on the patients' clinical features such as mania (YMRS = 12), depression (YMRS = 3), or euthymia (YMRS = 2). A higher total score is indicative of worse outcome.</description>

    <description>The SHAPS is a 14-item scale that measures anhedonia, the inability to experience pleasure. The items cover the domains of: social interaction, food and drink, sensory experience, and interest/pastimes. A score of 2 or less constitutes a &quot;normal&quot; score, while an &quot;abnormal&quot; score is defined as 3 or more. Each item has four possible responses: strongly disagree, disagree, agree, or strongly agree. Either of the &quot;disagree&quot; responses score one point, and either of the &quot;agree&quot; responses score 0 points. Thus, the final score ranges from 0 to 14 and higher scores are indicative of greater anhedonia.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived Deficits Questionnaire-Depression (PDQ-D)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PDQ-D is a 20-item, patient-reported questionnaire with a 7-day recall period. Scores for four subscales of the PDQ-D (attention/concentration, retrospective memory, prospective memory, and planning/organization) are computed based on responses to five items in each subscale. All 20 items use the same 5-point ordinal categorical response scale to reflect the frequency of experiencing a specific cognitive problem. Scores for each of the four measured subscales are calculated by assigning a value of 0 (&quot;never in the past 7 days&quot;), 1 (&quot;rarely - once or twice&quot;), 2 (&quot;sometimes - 3-5 times&quot;), 3 (&quot;often - about once a day&quot;), or 4 (&quot;very often - more than once a day&quot;) to each item, then summing the five items of that subscale, to produce a score ranging from 0 to 20. A total global score for overall cognitive dysfunction (range 0-80) is calculated by summing the four subscale scores. Higher scores for each subscale and for the total score indicate greater perceived cognitive dysfunction.</description>

    <measure>The DeJong Gierveld Loneliness Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The DeJong Gierveld Loneliness Scale is a 6-item scale, wherein three statements are made about 'emotional loneliness' and three about 'social loneliness'. There are negatively (items 1-3) and positively (items 4-6) worded items. On the negatively worded items, the neutral and positive answers are scored as &quot;1&quot;. Therefore, on questions 1-3 score Yes=1, More or less=1, and No=0. On the positively worded items, the neutral and negative answers are scored as &quot;1&quot;. Therefore, on questions 4-6, score Yes=0, More or less=1, and No=1. This gives a possible range of scores from 0 to 6, which can be read as follows: 0= least lonely; 6= most lonely.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale (SOFAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The SOFAS is a scale that focuses exclusively on the individual's level of social and occupational functioning and is not directly influenced by the overall severity of the individual's psychological symptoms. The SOFAS is used to rate functioning for the current period (i.e., the level of functioning at the time of the evaluation) on a scale from 1-100. A higher score is indicative of greater social and occupational functioning.
The interviewer must consider social and occupational functioning on a continuum from excellent functioning to grossly impaired functioning, including impairments in functioning due to physical limitations, as well as those due to mental impairments. To be counted, impairment must be a direct consequence of mental and physical health problems; the effects of lack of opportunity and other environmental limitations are not to be considered.</description>

    <description>The UCLA Episodic Life Stress Interview is the assessment of episodic stressors over the past 6 months. Interviewers obtain detailed information regarding the nature and date of each event, and the circumstances in which each event occurred (e.g., whether the event was expected or unexpected, how long it continued, whether the person had previous experience with the event, and consequences of the event). Based on this information, the interviewer makes am objective rating of how much impact the event would have on a typical person under similar circumstances. Objective ratings of event severity range from 1 (no impact) to 5 (extremely severe impact). The interviewer also rates the extent to which each event was dependent on the participant's behavior, using a 1 (entirely independent) to 5 (entirely dependent) scale. In both ratings, higher scores are indicative of greater stress.</description>

    <measure>Addiction Severity Index (ASI)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The ASI is a semi-structured interview designed to address seven potential problem areas in substance-abusing patients: medical status, employment and support, drug use, alcohol use, legal status, family/social status, and psychiatric status. A skilled interviewer will gather information on recent (past 30 days) and lifetime problems in all of the problem areas. The ASI provides an overview of problems related to substance, rather than focusing on any single area.
The severity ratings are interviewer estimates of the patient's need for additional treatment in each area. The scales range from 0 (no treatment necessary) to 9 (treatment needed to intervene in life-threatening situation). Each rating is based upon the patient's history of problem symptoms, present condition and subjective assessment of his/her treatment needs in a given area.</description>
