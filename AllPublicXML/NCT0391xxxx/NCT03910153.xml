  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to investigate the impact of daily consumption of MSPrebiotic
      at a dosage level of 30 g per day for 12 weeks on gastrointestinal microbiota in the elderly
      (&gt; 70 years age) and another age group (30 to 50 years). In addition, impact of MSPrebiotic
      on short chain fatty acids, glucose and insulin levels as well as metabolomic changes will
      also be studied. A randomized, double-blinded study will be conducted to assess the health
      benefits of MSPrebiotic and compared with a placebo. This study will provide substantiation
      for a beneficial effect of MSPrebiotic resistant starch on gut microbiome.

    <description>Number of bowel movements will be measured using questionnaire. Stool consistency will be measured using questionnaires recording Bristol score. Bristol stool chart indicates the following types: Type 1-Separate hard lumps, like nuts; Type 2-Sausage-shaped but lumpy; Type 3-Like a sausage but with cracks on its surface; Type 4-Like a sausage or snake, smooth and soft; Type 5-Soft blobs with clear-cut edges (passed easily); Type 6-Fluffy pieces with ragged edges, a mushy stool; Type 7-Watery, no solid pieces. Entirely liquid.</description>
