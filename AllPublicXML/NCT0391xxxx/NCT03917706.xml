  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The mortality due to congenital heart diseases has decreased in recent decades, even for
      infants with the most complex lesions.Therapeutic advances have prolonged the lifespan of
      people with these diseases. However, there are specific social and psychological troubles
      that appear later in life and can compromise employability, insurability and social
      integration.

      There are different types of congenital heart disease: those not operated in adulthood, and
      those operated for curative or palliative purposes. It is estimated that about 10 out of 1000
      babies are born with a congenital cardiac malformation. One-third of these have a critical
      diagnosis requiring a surgical intervention.

      Data from the literature show that there is an unusually high prevalence of psychosocial,
      neurological, developmental and psychiatric disabilities among survivors, as they enter
      formal education.There are many factors that influence developmental outcomes at school age.
      Early intervention is an essential element in controlling these comorbidities. The continuous
      monitoring of the development by a multidisciplinary team would make it possible to identify
      a developmental disorder as soon as it appears and respond to it as quickly as possible.For
      many children and their families, the burden of the developmental consequences is higher than
      the daily impact of the heart disease.

      Most studies and measures of quality of life in congenital heart patients require
      methodological improvements.They contribute little to the scientific basis of the quality of
      life in these patients. Future quality of life studies must invest in rigorous
      conceptualization, adequate operational definition and a good measure of quality of life.

      The investigators propose to develop a reproducible and reliable quality of life measurement
      tool, suitable for adult patients suffering from congenital heart disease and having had
      surgery during childhood.
