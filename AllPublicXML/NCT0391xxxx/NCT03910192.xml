  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a 16 week mindfulness-based
      coaching program compared to a cardiovascular risk reduction education program.

      Both groups will undergo 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, along with assessments
      of psychological measures (see bellow) at study baseline, midpoint (8 weeks), and conclusion
      (16 weeks).

      In addition, both groups will also undergo 24-hour Holter monitoring assessments at study
      beginning and conclusion to assess possible episodes of atrial tachyarrhythmia during the
      assessed interval.
