  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The airway management is essential in the Critical Care setting, both normal and difficult
      airway patients. Intubation is a risk procedure in which a great number of complications may
      occur, including death. The poor physiological reserve of critical patients may suppose an
      additional handicap to carry out successfully intubation.

      The purpose of this study is to analyze the prevalence and risk factors for major
      complications in the intubation process in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). In addition, the
      investigators will assess the impact of preoxygenation and the use of videolaryngoscope on
      the occurrence of major and minor complications. Finally, this study will review the drug
      protocols used in each participant ICU during intubation process.

      The correct airway and difficult airway management are essential in the Critical Care
      setting.

      Intubation is a procedure frequently carried out by intensivist and a great number of
      complications have been related. Serious complications can occur, including the development
      of severe hypoxemia, arrhythmias, cardiac arrest with permanent anoxic brain damage or death.
      Additionally the poor physiological reserve of critically ill patients and the variable
      operator experience, means that this technique must be considered a risk event in critical
      patients.

      In recent years, it has been taken more and more importance of preoxygenation as a strategy
      that can avoid major complications in the intubation process.

      Similarly, the use of devices that facilitate intubation such as videolaryngoscopy, has been
      included in difficult airway management protocols. If the use of videolaryngoscopy compared
      with traditional laryngoscopy is associated with a higher success rate and a lower incidence
      of complications, still remains controversial.

      The investigators want to know the prevalence and risk factors for major complications in the
      intubation process of patients admitted to Intensive Care Unit (ICU). In addition, this study
      will try to assess the use and impact of both preoxygenation and videolaryngoscope in the
      intubation process.

    <description>Pre-oxygenation is considered a strategy that can avoid complications in the intubation process. The investigators will define the frequency of use in each participant unit and its association with the development of major and minor complications. The study will describe the different pre-oxygenation options: conventional ambu mask, non invasive ventilation, high flow oxygenation.</description>

    <description>Nowadays the videolaryngoscopy is an useful tool included in difficult airway management protocols. Despite of this, the benefit associated to the videolaryngoscopy employment compared with traditional laryngoscopy is controversial.
The investigators will analyze its role in the intubation protocols and the factors that determine its use. The difficult airway predictors scales used in the participant units are: Cormack-Lehane, MACOCHA.</description>

The investigator will analyze (adjusting for confounding variables) if the use of videolaryngoscope is associated with a lower incidence of major and minor complications compared with conventional laryngoscopy.</description>
