    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study are to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose(s) (RP2D),
      schedule and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in Part 1 and to determine the safety and
      tolerability of JNJ-67571244 at the RP2D regimen(s) and to evaluate the preliminary clinical
      activity of JNJ-67571244 in Part 2.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is first-in-human (FIH) Phase 1, open-label, multicenter, dose escalation study with
      dose expansion to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary antitumor activity of
      JNJ-67571244 in adult participants with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
      or Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) who are ineligible for or have exhausted standard
      therapeutic options. The study is divided into 3 periods: a Screening Phase (within 28 days
      before the first dose of study drug), a Treatment Phase (first dose of study drug until the
      last dose of study drug) and a Post-treatment Follow-up Phase (up to the end of study
      participation or end of study). Duration of study is 2.3 years.

          -  For Part 1 only, prior Grade 3 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) related to any T-cell
             redirection (for example, CD-3 redirection technology or CAR-T cell therapy)

             investigational anticancer agent, an investigational drug (including investigational

             is less, or currently receiving investigational therapy in a clinical trial.
             Hydroxyurea may be used

          -  Toxicities (except for alopecia, peripheral neuropathy, thrombocytopenia) from
