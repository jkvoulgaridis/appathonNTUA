  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 6-part first-in-human study in up to approximately 184 participants. Parts 1 to 5
      is in health volunteers and part 6 is in subjects with atopic dermatitis.

      The purpose of this first-in-human study is to assess the safety and tolerability and
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of single and multiple doses of LOU064 both as once and twice daily
      oral administration in healthy volunteers and those with atopic diathesis or atopic
      dermatitis. This study will also explore the effect of food intake and different drug
      substance particle sizes on the in vivo disposition of LOU064 in healthy volunteers to guide
      dosing and formulation development for future clinical trials.

      The study is registered on CT.Gov with the initiation of part 6 in patients (FPFV in April
      2019).

      The study is composed of the following parts:

      Part 1 is a double-blind, placebo-controlled single ascending dose (SAD) escalation study of
      up to 10 cohorts (N = approximately 80) in healthy volunteers Part 2 is a double-blind,
      placebo-controlled multiple ascending dose (MAD) escalation study in up to 6 cohorts in
      healthy volunteers with asymptomatic atopic diathesis with a 12-day treatment period (daily
      dosing) and 4-day follow-up period (N = approximately 48) Part 3 is a single cohort, single
      dose, open-label crossover food effect study (N = approximately 12) in healthy volunteers
      Part 4 is a double-blind, placebo-controlled multiple dose study in up to 2 cohorts of
      healthy volunteers with asymptomatic atopic diathesis with a 12-day treatment period (twice
      daily dosing) and 4-day follow-up period (N = approximately 16) Part 5 is a double-blind,
      single dose, crossover formulation effect study (N = approximately 12) in healthy volunteers
      Part 6 is a double-blind, placebo-controlled multiple dose study in subjects with atopic
      dermatitis with a 4-week treatment period (twice daily dosing of LOU064) and 3-week follow-up
      period in approximately 16 subjects

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Written informed consent must be obtained before any assessment is performed.

          2. Male and female healthy subjects with an age range between 18 and 65 years
             (inclusive), and in good general health as determined by past medical history,
             physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiogram, and laboratory tests at
             screening. Healthy subjects to participate in Part 2 or Part 4 must additionally have
             an atopic diathesis to be eligible for these specific study portions. Atopic healthy
             volunteers must have a positive skin prick test to a known allergen at screening
             (atopic diathesis) but must be clinically asymptomatic and not requiring any systemic
             medication. To participate in Part 6, subjects must additionally have chronic atopic
             dermatitis (AD) according to American Academy of Dermatology Consensus Criteria
             (Eichenfield et al 2014), that has been present for at least 1 year before the
             baseline visit and defined as:

               -  Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) ≥ 12 at screening and baseline

               -  IGA (Investigator's Global Assessment) ≥ 3 on a 5-point scale at screening and
                  baseline

               -  BSA (Body Surface Area) involvement ≥ 8% at screening and baseline

               -  Subjects have applied a stable dose of bland topical emollient at least twice
                  daily for at least 7 consecutive days immediately before the baseline visit

          3. Able to communicate well with the Investigator, to understand and comply with the
             requirements of the study.

          4. Subjects must weigh at least 50 kg and must have a body mass index (BMI) within the
             range of 18 -30 kg/m2 (inclusive) (parts 1-5) / 18-35 kg/m2 inclusive (part 6). BMI =
             body weight (kg) / [Height (m)]2.

          5. At screening, and first baseline, vital signs (body temperature, systolic and
             diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate) will be assessed in the sitting position
             after the subject has rested for at least three minutes and again (when required)

             while taking study treatment and for 7 days after stopping LOU064. Highly effective
             contraception methods include:

             - Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the
             subject.

             Periodic abstinence (e.g. calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods)
             and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.

               -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without
                  hysterectomy), total hysterectomy, or tubal ligation at least six weeks before
                  taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive
                  status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment.

               -  Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). For female subjects on
                  the study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that
                  subject.

               -  Use of oral (estrogen and progesterone), injected, or implanted hormonal methods
                  of contraception or placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine
                  system (IUS), or other forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable
                  efficacy (failure rate &lt;1%), for example, hormone vaginal ring or transdermal
                  hormone contraception. In case of use of oral contraception, women should have
                  been stable on the same pill for a minimum of 3 months before taking study
                  treatment. Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing
                  potential if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an
                  appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate history of vasomotor symptoms)
                  or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy), total
                  hysterectomy, or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago. In the case of
                  oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been
                  confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of
                  child-bearing potential.

         11. Hemoglobin levels below 12.0 g/dL at screening or first baseline.

         15. Recent (within the last three years (parts 1-5)/ within the last year (part 6)) and/or
             recurrent history of acute or chronic bronchospastic disease (including asthma and
             chronic obstructive pulmonary disease requiring moderate to high dose systemic steroid
             medication (oral or parenteral).

         16. Any surgical or medical condition which might significantly alter the absorption,
             distribution, metabolism, or excretion of drugs, or which may jeopardize the subject
             in case of participation in the study. The Investigator should make this determination
             in consideration of the subject's medical history and/or clinical or laboratory
