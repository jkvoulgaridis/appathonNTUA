    <textblock>
      A double-blind, randomised controlled trial in participants with COPD to assess the efficacy
      of proactive treatment of cardiac risk in people with COPD. We hypothesise that treating
      known and undiagnosed CVD in COPD participants will improve both cardiac and respiratory
      outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of global
      health-related morbidity and mortality. Heart disease in COPD is a known but neglected
      comorbidity and cardiovascular disease (CVD) accounts for 30-50% of deaths in COPD
      participants. Studies repeatedly show that CVD in COPD participants is under-recognised and
      under-treated yet participants with COPD are frequently excluded from clinical trials of
      drugs which reduce cardiac morbidity and mortality. This has led to under-treatment of CVD in
      COPD participants. A particular concern is low use of β-blockers. These have previously been
      considered to be contra-indicated in COPD and no RCTs have been conducted in this population.
      There is now observational evidence that cardioselective β-blockers are safe and may improve
      mortality, but this data is limited to retrospective analyses of cohorts of COPD
      participants. Contrary to previous concerns, retrospective analyses also suggest that
      cardioselective β-blockers may reduce the risk of COPD exacerbations. The proposed study will
      focus on treating CVD in COPD participants to reduce mortality and morbidity.

      The study will be conducted in approximately 20 sites in Australia and New Zealand, and
      possibly 1-2 international sites. Participants with COPD will be randomised to one of two
      treatment arms in addition to receiving usual care for their COPD over the study duration of
      24 months.

    <description>The SGRQ is a 50-item questionnaire developed to measure health status (quality of life) in patients with diseases of airways obstruction.
Scores are calculated for three domains:
Symptoms, Activity and Impacts (Psycho-social) as well as a total score.
Psychometric testing has demonstrated its repeatability, reliability and validity. Sensitivity has been demonstrated in clinical trials.
A minimum change in score of 4 units was established as clinically relevant after patient and clinician testing. The SGRQ has been used in a range of disease groups including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and bronchiectasis, and in a range of settings such as randomised controlled therapy trials and population surveys.</description>

    <measure>EuroQoL Group 5-5 Dimension self-report questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) to assess health state utilities</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D-5L consists of 2pg: the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS).
Five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression.
Each dimension 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, extreme problems.
Patient indicates their health state by ticking most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions.
This decision results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state.
EQ VAS records patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale. Endpoints are labelled 'The best health you can imagine' and 'The worst health you can imagine'. The VAS can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome that reflect the patient's own judgement.</description>

Costs will be ascertained from participants and study records. Health care utilisation will be on the basis of self-reported GP and hospital attendances and changes in concomitant medication. Health state utilities will be estimated via the EQ-5D-5L and will be used to weight survival up to 24 months to determine Quality Adjusted Life Years.</description>
