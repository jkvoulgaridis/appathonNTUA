  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overweight and obesity is a growing problem in the world. Today more than 50 % of all people
      over 18 years in Sweden are overweight or obese. Main reasons for this are changes in
      lifestyle habits regarding diet and physical exercise. Overweight and obesity increases risk
      of different diseases such as type 2 diabetes, arthrosis and cancer; it also affects quality
      of life. Losing 5-10 % of your body weight improves metabolic health and quality of life.
      Lifestyle changes are very important in order to lose weight but it can be challenging to
      carry through with these changes on your own without support. In the primary care in Region
      Orebro län a group treatment, &quot;Step by step&quot;, has been in use since 2010. It comprises of six
      group sessions over 6-8 months with different themes such as diet, physical exercise and
      stress. Between the group sessions there are home assignments, such as writing a diet or
      exercise diary. This observational study will evaluate &quot;Step by step&quot; and the effect the
      group treatment has on the participants' weight, dietary habits, physical activity, quality
      of life, eating habits and metabolic health.

    <description>The intervention is a group treatment of overweight and obesity in primary care inspired by cognitive behavioural therapy. The main goal of the group treatment is for the participants to obtain and maintain healthy lifestyle habits, with emphasis on diet and physical activity. Every group has 8-12 participants and is led by two persons; the main group leader is either a primary care nurse or a physiotherapist with special training. The groups meet six times (2 hours every time) once a month over a 6-8 month period. Every group session has a set agenda with different topics, for example a healthy diet, recommended physical activity or how to deal with setbacks. Between group sessions there are home assignments. The home assignments are followed-up at the next session and participants are encouraged to share experiences with each other in order to inspire, challenge and help fellow group participants. Data is collected prior to the start of group treatment, after 6-8 and 12 months.</description>
