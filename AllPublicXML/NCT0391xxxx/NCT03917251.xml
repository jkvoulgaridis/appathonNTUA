  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To study the role of transvenous pacing on the coronary microcirculation. This will be
      accomplished by gathering data from invasive Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR) and Coronary Flow
      Reserve (CFR) with and without ventricular pacing.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        All patients 19 years of age or older with clinical evidence of coronary ischemia
        undergoing coronary angiogram, and who have a pacemaker.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Acute ST segment myocardial infarction

          -  Known sensitivity or contraindication to the agents planned for administration during
             coronary angiography

          -  Pacemaker dependent patients

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Hypotension (a systolic blood pressure lower than 90mmHg) that would preclude the
             administration of adenosine

          -  Severe renal dysfunction, defined as a estimated glomerular filtration (eGFR) less
             than 30ml/min, confirmed by recent testing

          -  Study subject has any underlying disorder that, in the opinion of the investigator,
             precludes them from giving informed consent at the time of enrollment
