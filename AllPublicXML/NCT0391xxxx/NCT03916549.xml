      Acupuncture has it's role in treating patients with fecal incontinence and
      diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome. There is no trial or case-report assessing
      it's role in treatment of Low anterior resection syndrome.

      Colorectal cancer is common in Western countries. For thirty years rectal cancer treatment is
      standardized: patients are undergoing low anterior resection with mesorectal excision +/-
      (chemo)radiotherapy. Unfortunately around 80% of patients undergoing low anterior resection
      will experience complex bowel dysfunction including fecal incontinence, soiling, urgency,
      incomplete evacuation, fragmented defecation and impaired rectal sensation known as low
      anterior resection syndrome (LARS) causing a &quot;toilet dependence&quot; which severely affects
      quality of life.

      Still there is no standardized treatment for LARS.

    <description>Bowel function assessment using Low anterior resection syndrome questionnaire Bowel function following low anterior resection surgery for rectal cancer will be assessed using Low anterior resection syndrome score (LARS score - simple 5 question questionnaire). LARS score is a tool consisting of five items, which are as follows: incontinence due to flatus (score range from 0 to 7), incontinence due to liquid stools (score range from 0 to 3), frequency of bowel movements (score range from 0 to 5), clustering (score range from 0 to 11) and urgency (score range from 0 to 16). The severity of each item is calculated on a scale ranging from 0 to 42, with a score of 0-20 (no LARS), 21-29 (minor LARS) and 30-42 (major LARS).</description>

    <description>The patients with bowel dysfunction following low anterior resection performed at least 1 year ago will undergo acupuncture. The acupuncture procedure is performed by one well trained person, 1 time per week in total of 10 weeks on the same day time. Sterile, disposable, stainless steel acupuncture needles (40x0.25 mm diameter) were inserted to corporal acupoints, with initial gentle stimulation by quick rotation of 1080°, after then leaving needle in located place for twenty minutes. Needling deep - 0.5-1 cm. If the intent was to invigorate - the needle was inserted to the flow of energy; if harmonization needed - the needle was placed perpendicular to the point flow of energy; if sedation was needed, needles were placed against to the flow of energy on channel. The selection of acupoints was based according by traditional Chinese medicine, literature findings.</description>
