  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of combining robotic-assisted training
      and mirror therapy on upper extremity motor and physiological function, daily functions,
      quality of life and self-efficacy in stroke patients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Based on trigger theory, this study designed a combining robotic-assisted training and mirror
      therapy. Before robotic-assisted training, a mirror therapy is performed to double the
      healing effect of robotic-assisted training.

      This study hypothesized that combining robotic-assisted training and mirror therapy can
      improve the performance of hand function in stroke patients and promote daily life function,
      quality of life, and self-efficacy compared to single machine-assisted therapy.

    <description>The WMFT is a reliable method to evaluate the UE motor ability in patients after stroke. The WMFT contains 15 function-based tasks and 2 strength-based tasks. The time (WMFT-time) and the functional ability (WMFT-quality) for an individual to complete the tasks will be recorded. A shorter WMFT-time and a larger WMFT-quality score indicate a faster movement and better quality of movement, respectively.</description>
