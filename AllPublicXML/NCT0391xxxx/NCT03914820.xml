  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase III randomized, multicenter study with two different arm:

        -  experimental: prophylactic surgery plus HIPEC CO2 performed with mitomycin

        -  comparator: standard surgery Adjuvant treatment after surgery is mandatory except for
           documented cases of non-eligibility.

      Patient will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio. Randomization will be done during surgery if the
      total resection of tumour will be reached and will use a stratification procedure based on
      center

      This is a phase III randomized, multicenter study with two different arm:

        -  experimental: prophylactic surgery plus HIPEC CO2 performed with mitomycin

        -  comparator: standard surgery Adjuvant treatment after surgery is mandatory except for
           documented cases of non-eligibility.

      Patient will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio. Randomization will be done during surgery if the
      total resection of tumour will be reached and will use a stratification procedure based on
      center

      The HIPEC CO2 regimen will be as reported below:

      mitomycin: (total dose of 35 mg/mq, physiologic solution 0.9%) administrated 50% at time 0
      from start of HIPEC CO2 treatment (17.5 mg/mq), 25% (8.8 mg/mq) after 30 minutes and the last
      dose 25% after 60 minutes. Recommended temperature for HIPEC treatment is 41-42 °C for 90
      minutes.

      Adjuvant treatment consists of a 6 months chemotherapy after surgery. It is possible to
      choose between Oxaliplatin, Capecitabine (XELOX) or Oxaliplatin, Fluorouracil, Leucovorin
      (FOLFOX-4) Patients affected by CRC at high risk of developing peritoneal carcinomatosis will
      be randomized in the study.

             conditions with FEV1 &lt;50% or DLCO &lt;40% of normal age value).

         10. Pregnancy

         11. History or presence of other diseases, metabolic dysfunction, or clinical laboratory
             finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that contraindicates use
             of HIPEC or chemotherapy or patient at high risk from treatment complications.
