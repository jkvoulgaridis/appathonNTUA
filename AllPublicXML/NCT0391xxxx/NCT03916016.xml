    <textblock>
      This study evaluated whether uninsured patients living at or below 200% of the federal
      poverty level who received enhanced, culturally-relevant, integrated behavioral health
      services were more likely to improve health outcomes after 12 months compared to similar
      patients receiving usual care from Hope Family Health Center (HFHC), a charitable community
      clinic. The study employed a randomized control trial (RCT) design where intervention
      participants receiving integrated care at HFHC were compared to control participants
      receiving usual care at HFHC. Patients were placed in each group using simple random
      assignment. Demographic and health outcome data were collected from intervention and control
      participants at baseline. Health outcome data were subsequently collected at 6-month and
      12-month follow-up points.

      This study evaluated whether uninsured patients living at or below 200% of the federal
      poverty level who received enhanced, culturally-relevant, integrated behavioral health
      services were more likely to improve health outcomes after 12 months compared to similar
      patients receiving usual care from Hope Family Health Center (HFHC), a charitable community
      clinic. The study employed a randomized control trial (RCT) design where intervention
      participants receiving integrated care at HFHC were compared to control participants
      receiving usual care at HFHC. Patients were placed in each group using simple random
      assignment. Demographic and health outcome data were collected from intervention and control
      participants at baseline. Health outcome data were subsequently collected at 6-month and
      12-month follow-up points. The primary outcomes of interest were systolic and diastolic blood
      pressure and depressive symptoms. Additional secondary outcomes of interest were HbA1c and
      BMI. These outcomes were analyzed as continuous variables using linear regression with
      backward model selection. Longitudinal analyses were also conducted using a likelihood-based
      approach to general linear mixed models. The participants (1) resided in Cameron, Hidalgo,
      Willacy, or Starr County, (2) were eligible to receive behavioral health services from HFHC
      (e.g., uninsured, living at or below 200% of the federal poverty level, residence in HFHC's
      service area), and (3) had a diagnosis of hypertension (blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg or
      higher) and/or obesity (body mass index of 30.0 or higher) and/or poorly controlled diabetes
      (HbA1c over 6.8) and/or moderate depression (score of 10 or above on PHQ-9).

    <description>The intervention involved moving from HFHC's previous collaborative model, where medical and behavioral providers worked with each other episodically, to a more fully integrated collaborative care model with care coordination, shared treatment plans, shared service provision, and shared record keeping. To achieve this enhanced level of integration, HFHC changed its current primary care workflow to include a behavioral health specialist who conducted assessments, provided initial counseling (individual or group), and coordinated referrals to care management and/or community-based health services.</description>
