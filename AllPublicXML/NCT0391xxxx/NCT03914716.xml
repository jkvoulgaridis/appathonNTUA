  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemophilia is a genetic condition characterized by marked phenotypic heterogeneity. Bleeding
      into a joint is the single most important risk factor for the development of hemophilic
      arthropathy (HA). It is thought that clinical and imaging manifestations of HA are at least
      partially attributable to genetic polymorphisms unrelated to the hemophilia genotype.
      Identifying and characterizing biologic factors that could explain differences in
      susceptibility to joint degeneration of patients with hemophilia would help stratify patients
      according to the risk of degeneration of their joints and develop personalized therapeutic
      and prophylactic strategies. This study is conducted in China.

      This will be a 3-year prospective cohort study conducted in a single centre (Beijing
      Children's Hospital, BCH, China) with a 2-year follow-up of patients Index joints (ankles,
      elbows and knees) of young Chinese boys with hemophilia A will be evaluated as follows:
      physical examination every 6 months using the Hemophilia Joint Health Score [HJHS],
      ultrasound imaging (gray-scale and color Doppler ultrasound [US]), and by laboratory (serum)
      at baseline, at 6, and 24 months. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of index joints will
      be obtained at baseline, and 24 months. Features that will be captured either quantitatively
      or semantically in the imaging scans will be aggregated to generate &quot;imaging phenotypes&quot;
      which will be associated with clusters of co-expressed genes (metagenes) and clinical data.
