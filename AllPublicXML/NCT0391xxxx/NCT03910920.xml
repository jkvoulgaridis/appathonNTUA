  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis is the most common hereditary autosomal recessive disease in the Caucasian
      population. The diseases is caused by a mutation of the gene coding for the CFTR protein
      (Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator), an ion channel present at the apical
      pole of the epithelial cells. The channel dysfunction induces a deficit in hydration and a
      hyperviscosity of different exocrine secretions.

      Clinically, Cystic fibrosis is a multi-systemic disease. Pulmonary and pancreatic involvement
      are classically in the foreground. Degradation of respiratory function, associated with acute
      and chronic infections, represents the major cause of morbidity and mortality.

      Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a ubiquitous gram-negative bacillus found primarily in stagnant
      water. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is capable of colonizing the digestive, pulmonary and urinary
      mucosa and the skin. This bacterium is incriminated in many opportunistic infections
      including respiratory infections in patients with cystic fibrosis. Pseudomonas aeruginosa
      infection is the most common parenchymal lung infection in the Cystic fibrosis community.

      Pseudomonas aeruginosa chronic carriage represents a factor of poor prognosis associated with
      an increase in morbidity and mortality. Complications related to chronic carriage of
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa justify the implementation of strategies of eviction, screening and
      eradication of acute Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection.

      In addition to Pseudomonas aeruginosa contamination of patients via the environment, hand and
      airborne infections between patients with Cystic fibrosis have been reported. Measures to
      eliminate cross-transmissions have therefore been implemented in a majority of hospitals.

      The aim of the study is firstly to identify the number of Pseudomonas aeruginosa
      cross-transmissions between patients with Cystic fibrosis followed-up in Cystic fibrosis
      center of HUDERF. Investigator will use the Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis to assess the
      possibility of cross-infection.

      Depending on the results, Investigator will implement new strategies to avoid future
      cross-contamination in our different places of care (consultation, hospitalization,
      physiotherapy…).
