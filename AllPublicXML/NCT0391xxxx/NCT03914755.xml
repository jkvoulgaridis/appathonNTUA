  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to compare the pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety/tolerability of
      tucatinib in healthy Japanese and Caucasian participants.

      Three cohorts of healthy Japanese and Caucasian men and women will be admitted to the
      Clinical Research Unit (CRU) and receive multiple oral doses of tucatinib over 14 days with
      and without food.

      Subjects will be in the study for up to 45 days, including the screening period.

      Due to practical considerations, each cohort will be dosed sequentially (this is not a dose
      escalation study).
