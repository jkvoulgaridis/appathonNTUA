  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Exposure therapy is one of the most potent techniques available for treating anxiety-related
      disorders, including specific phobia. However, estimates suggest that 10-48% of anxiety
      patients do not fully respond to exposure therapy. Meta-analyses demonstrate that virtual
      reality exposure therapy (VRET) is equally effective as traditional, in vivo ('in life')
      exposure therapy. Furthermore, individuals with anxiety disorders report greater preference
      (and lower likelihood of treatment refusal) for VR, rather than in vivo, exposure therapy.
      Although VRET has well-established efficacy and is rapidly growing in popularity, there has
      been very little research evaluating how specific elements of VR game design might be used to
      improve outcomes from VRET. This study evaluates two game design elements that we hypothesize
      will improve VRET outcomes: tactile feedback and a point-based reward system. Tactile
      feedback (TF; i.e., touching a real object that matches an element in the VR environment)
      enhances sense of presence in VR. Higher presence activates anxiety during VRET, which is
      essential for promoting the active mechanisms of exposure therapy and may also improve
      treatment retention. On the other hand, point-based rewards (PR) in games enhance sense of
      competence (i.e., sense of progress and achievement), and increase both enjoyment and
      likelihood of future use of games. Furthermore, several studies demonstrate that PR improves
      traditionally difficult-to-change health behaviors, such as increasing exercise frequency and
      reducing misuse of pain medications. Although this research is promising, the impact of PR on
      VRET is unknown. To test the influence of TF and PR on VRET outcomes, we will randomize
      participants with acrophobia to receive (a) standard virtual reality exposure therapy, (b)
      VRET with tactile feedback, (c) VRET with a point-based reward system, or (d) VRET with
      tactile feedback and a point-based reward system. Participants' fear reactivity will be
      assessed with behavioral, physiological, and subjective/self-report measures at baseline,
      post-treatment, and follow-up.

    <description>Participants will walk up a staircase until they reach the highest level they can complete.

    <description>Participants will stand on a plank in virtual reality and raise the plank until they reach the highest level they can complete. During each BAT, we will assess fear response behaviorally (highest step reached up to 70 steps), physiologically (heart rate and electrodermal activity), and subjectively (self reported levels of anticipated and peak fear).</description>

    <measure>Acrophobia Questionnaire (AQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to one-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete the AQ, a 40-item questionnaire that assesses self-reported anxiety and avoidance related to acrophobia. Scores for each subscale are summed, and totals range from 0 to 120 for each subscale, with higher scores indicating greater anxiety or avoidance.</description>

    <measure>Heights Interpretation Questionnaire (HIQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to one-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete the HIQ, a 16-item questionnaire that assesses self-reported interpretations of an imagined experience of heights. Items are summed scored, and totals ranged from 16 to 80, with higher scores indicating greater height fear-relevant interpretation bias.</description>

    <time_frame>Post-treatment (about 1 week)</time_frame>
    <description>Experimenters will record whether or not participants drop out of treatment. This will be operationalized as beginning virtual reality exposure therapy, but discontinuing the study before the two-session treatment is complete.</description>
