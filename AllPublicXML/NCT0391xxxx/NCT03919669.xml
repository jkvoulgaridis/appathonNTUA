    <textblock>
      This is a longitudinal, observational study evaluating the imaging characteristics of the tau
      PET radioligand [18F]MK-6240 in Alzheimer's disease (AD), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and
      Healthy Volunteer (HV) subjects. Up to 42 subjects, including approximately 28 MCI/mild AD
      subjects, up to 5 moderate AD subjects, and 9 similarly aged HV subjects will be consented
      and screened. Imaging procedures include [11C]PiB to evaluate amyloid deposition,
      [18F]MK-6240 PET, and structural MRI. All subjects complete an evaluable baseline
      [18F]MK-6240 PET scan, as well as scans at 6, 12 and 24 months post-baseline.

    <measure>Correlate the changes in [18F]MK-6240 uptake and changes in clinical cognitive assessments by Mini-Mental Status Exam (MMSE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The MMSE is a sensitive, valid and reliable 30-point questionnaire that is used extensively in clinical and research settings to measure cognitive impairment. It is commonly used as screening tool for dementia. It is also used to estimate the severity and progression of cognitive impairment and to follow the course of cognitive changes in an individual over time; thus, making it an effective way to document an individual's response to treatment.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Correlate the changes in [18F]MK-6240 uptake and changes in clinical cognitive assessments by Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR).</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>CDR was developed primarily for use in persons with dementia of the Alzheimer type. The six domains of CDR are: Memory, Orientation, Judgment and Problem-solving, Community Affairs, Home and Hobbies, and Personal Care.
Each domain is rated on a 5-point scale of functioning as follows: 0, no impairment; 0.5, questionable impairment; 1, mild impairment; 2, moderate impairment; and 3, severe impairment (personal care is scored on a 4-point scale without a 0.5 rating available). Each domain is rated on a 5-point scale of functioning as follows: 0, no impairment; 0.5, questionable impairment; 1, mild impairment; 2, moderate impairment; and 3, severe impairment (personal care is scored on a 4-point scale without a 0.5 rating available).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Correlate the changes in [18F]MK-6240 uptake and changes in clinical cognitive assessments by Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-cog)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The ADAS-Cog is one of the most frequently used tests to measure cognition in clinical trials in AD. The ADAS-Cog is a more thorough battery than the Mini Mental State Exam, and primarily measures language and verbal episodic memory. The ADAS-Cog consists of 13 items and takes approximately 25 minutes to administer. The ADAS was developed as a two-part scale: one that measured cognitive functions and one that measured non-cognitive functions such as mood and behavior. Most current research, including this study, uses the ADAS-Cog, which is the sub-scale that measures cognitive ability.</description>
