  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antibacterial drugs are facing increasing limitations in terms of effectiveness due to
      emergence resistance. Improved antibacterial drug monitoring approaches are particularly
      needed in nosocomial infections occurring in ICU patients, including ventilator-associated
      pneumonia and ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis, where decreased susceptibility of the
      etiological organisms is observed worldwide and pharmacokinetic alterations frequently
      observed.

      No routine drug monitoring is available for betalactams at the point of care in a useful time
      frame (i.e., within a few hours after having collected the blood specimens).

      The purpose of this study is to compare MON4STRAT approach for reaching and maintaining a
      meropenem pre-determined PK-PD target when compared to conventional meropenem dose.
