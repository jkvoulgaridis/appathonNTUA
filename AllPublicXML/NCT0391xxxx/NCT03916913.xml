  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this phase II trial with single arm, we aim to investigate the clinical efficacy and
      toxicity profile of local radiotherapy on all disease sites for EGFR-mutant oligo-metastatic
      NSCLC (no more than 3 metastatic lesions) who did not experience disease progression after at
      least 3 months of TKI therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) has been widely accepted as the first-line therapy for stage
      IV NSCLC with active mutation of EGFR. Olio-metastasis is a disease status between localized
      and extended status of disease, namely with the limited number of lesions, which is generally
      defined as ≤ 5. A couple of phase II studies have shown that consolidation local management
      was able to prolong the local-regional tumor control and might further improve overall
      survival (OS) for oligo-metastatic NSCLC who have gained disease control from systemic
      therapy. However, there is lack of data regarding whether local radiotherapy (RT) could
      improve progression free survival (PFS) and OS for NSCLC with active EGFR mutation who have
      benefited from TKI. In this phase II trial with single arm, we aim to investigate the
      clinical efficacy and toxicity profile of local radiotherapy on all disease sites for
      EGFR-mutant oligo-metastatic NSCLC (no more than 3 metastatic lesions) who did not experience
      disease progression after at least 3 months of TKI therapy.
