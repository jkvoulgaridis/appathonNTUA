      Background:

      Musculoskeletal (MSK) pain and injuries are common in endurance sports where athletes are
      required to perform at high intensity for long periods of time. In the short term, MSK pain
      may significantly impair the athletes' performance, which can lead to unwanted time-off from
      practice and competitive tournaments. Previous studies found an association between training
      load, MSK pain and performance. These results indicate that an athlete may experience MSK
      pain or get injured from both too low and to high training loads.

      Electronic sports (E-sports), also known as competitive gaming, is defined by Hamari and
      Sjöblom as &quot;a form of sports where the primary aspects of the sport is facilitated by
      electronic systems; the input of players and teams as well as the output of the E-sports
      system are mediated by human-computer interference&quot;.

      There are only few data on MSK pain in E-sports, however a small study with 65 participants
      found that 41% suffered from back or neck pain and more than 1 in 3 had pain related to the
      wrist. E-sports athletes have to perform for an extended period of time, similar to athletes
      from traditional endurance sport. As such, MSK pain in E-sports may be associated with
      training load like it is seen in other sports. Therefore, MSK pain in E-sports could be an
      unrecognised issue. To provide health professionals with and optimal starting point for
      managing these issues, there is a need for well-conducted studies on the prevalence of MSK
      pain among E-sports athletes. In addition, it is highly relevant to investigate if training
      loads related to E-sports and physical activity levels are different among athletes with MSK
      pain compared to athletes without MSK pain.

      Aims:

      The aims of this questionnaire-based cross-sectional study are to; I) investigate the
      prevalence of MSK pain in E-sports athletes, II) assess if training loads among athletes with
      MSK pain are different from athletes without MSK pain, III) investigate if physical activity
      levels among athletes with MSK pain are different from athletes without MSK pain and IIII)
      descriptively present data on participant characteristics, sleep patterns, physical activity
      levels and utilization of health professionals and pain medication in the study population.

      Data analysis:

      The prevalence of MSK pain within the study population will be presented in absolute numbers
      and as percentage values. To investigate if E-sport related training loads differ among
      athletes with and without MSK pain we will use total E-sport related training load (N hours
      spend on structured E-sport + N hours spend on unstructured E-sport). An independent sample
      t-test will be applied for this comparison if data are normally distributed. To assess if
      physical activity levels are different among athletes with and without MSK pain we will use
      the responses from the IPAQ short form. For this comparison we will use an independent sample
      t-test or the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Participant characteristics, distribution and number of
      MSK pain sites, utilization of health professionals and pain medicine, physical activity
      levels, training loads and sleep patterns will be presented descriptively. The data will be
      presented with means, standard deviations and 95% confidence intervals. Non-parametric data
      will be presented with absolute numbers and as percentage values, medians and range.
