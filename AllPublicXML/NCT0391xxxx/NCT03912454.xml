  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single-institution prospective case series (single arm) study will assess the clinical
      outcomes of patients diagnosed with single level discogenic low back pain following an
      intradiscal injection of bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      BMAC is a cellular rich fraction of bone marrow aspirate that can be readily prepared at the
      point of care without additional processing steps to manipulate or isolate cells. In
      addition, BMAC contains growth factors from the peripheral blood which may promote disc
      healing.

      Study Summary:

      The study population will consist of up to 20 patients aged 18- 60 with unresolved low back
      pain attributable to single level intervertebral disc degeneration. Clinical exam will
      indicate the intervertebral disc as the source of pain with features such as midline pain,
      pain upon rising from a seated position, or positive responses to centralization maneuvers.
      Moderate single level lumbar disc (L1-S1) degeneration (&lt;50% disc height) will be confirmed
      on MRI. Other low back pain generators must be eliminated prior to study enrollment. Subjects
      must meet minimum score criteria on baseline PROs (VAS&gt;=40 and ODI&gt;=30). Subjects that meet
      all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be invited to participate in the
      study.

      Enrolled subjects will undergo bone marrow aspiration and intradiscal injection by an
      experienced orthopedic spine surgeon. Subjects will be followed for 1 year to evaluate the
      effects of the disc injection.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Ages 18 to 60 years

          -  Symptomatic discogenic low back pain, clinically demonstrated by a loss of lumbar
             range of motion and pain to deep palpation over the symptomatic disc.

          -  MRI confirmed single level lumbar disc height loss &lt;50% (Modified Pfirrman grade &lt;=7).

          -  MRI confirmed isolated lumbar disc degeneration OR
