    <textblock>
      Kerry Group Kuok Foundation Limited (KGKF) has initiated the Trekkers Family Project that
      aims to enable low-income families to develop their full potentials by providing support and
      opportunities in education, employment, environmental harmony and health. Health is an
      essential component to enable a person to develop his/her full potential. This study looks
      into one of the key elements, health, of members of low-income families and the effect of
      health education, health enablement and mutual health support on health and social outcomes.
      It is a cohort study of around 800 subjects from 200 families of the Trekkers Family Project,
      and around 800 subjects not included in the Trekkers Family Project in Hong Kong, recruited
      base on pre-defined inclusion criteria. Health empowerment interventions consisting of three
      inter-related programmes, namely, the Health Literacy, the Self-care Enablement, and the
      Health Ambassador Programmes.

      The Health Literacy Programme aims to improve the knowledge on health and health services in
      order to promote health, prevent disease, and the proper use of services. It consists of four
      seminars per year on common health problems, mental health and cognitive health, etc.

      The Self-Care Enablement Programme is to enable participants to keep themselves healthy, to
      build up self-efficacy and proper help-seeking skills, and to generate a spirit of mutual
      support among families. Two programmes will be delivered yearly, each with six 2.5 hour
      workshops facilitated by professional and lay leaders.

      The Health Ambassador Programme aims to train up a group of adults recruited from the
      Trekkers families to act as a lay-advisor to other families on health issues. Participants
      who have completed the Health Literacy and Self-care Enablement programme will be given
      priority to take part in the Health Ambassador training programme.

      The outcome measures are health enablement, health status, health-related quality of life,
      life style, cardiovascular risk factors, illnesses rates, and health service utilization
      pattern. All subjects in the cohort study will be surveyed on enrolment, and then yearly for
      5 years. An age-gender appropriate health assessment will be carried out at baseline and at
      the end of five years for each subject. Changes in the outcomes will be evaluated and
      compared between groups. The impact of the health intervention programmes will be assessed.
