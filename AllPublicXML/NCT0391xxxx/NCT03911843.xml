      Sixty-four participants (29 M, F 35, mean age 9.8+4.2) with T1D from January, the 1st 2017
      were consecutively enrolled in a one year lasting series. Vitamin D supplement and
      Mediterranean diet were introduced since the onset of T1D (T0). Beginning in 2017, 42/67
      subjects (20 within 6 months from onset in 2017, 6 within 7-12 months, plus 6 within 13-18
      months from onset in 2016, and 10 within 19-36 months from onset in 2015) received an
      additional Ω-3 supplementation [(Ω-3)0] with eicosapentenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic
      acid (DHA) intake (50-60mg/kg/day), to achieve an Arachidonic Acid (AA)/EPA ratio of 1.5-3.
      Vitamin D [25(OH)D] blood levels and AA/EPA ratios were determined before Vitamin D and Ω-3
      supplementations, and are repeated after three [(Ω-3)3] and twelve months [(Ω-3)12]. At
      (Ω-3)0 and (Ω-3)12, fasting C-peptide (FC-P) levels, daily insulin dose (IU/Kg/day) and
      glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C%) both in supplemented and not supplemented patients (CONTR)
      are assessed and compared.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A cohort study was performed at the Division of Pediatrics in 2017, University of East
      Piedmont (Novara, Piedmont, Italy). Seventy-eight children, 1-18 years, corresponding to all
      T1D patients with onset in the years 2014-2017, were eligible for the study: 8 were excluded
      because onset in another center, 2 already supplemented with Ω-3 before 2017, and one met an
      exclusion criteria. Finally 67 patients were consecutively recruited. Supplementation with
      Ω-3 was proposed to all subjects with onset between 2015-2017. Patients with onset in 2014
      were enrolled only as control subjects. Of eligible subjects, 45/67 started an intervention
      program with Ω-3 (CASES), 2/45 CASES were excluded as drop-out (discontinued Ω-3 because
      taste), and one for side effects (diarrhea). Others 22/67 subjects joined to the study as
      data contributors, and were entered as controls (CONTR).

      Finally, 64 subjects (M 29/F 35, mean 9,8 + 4.2 years at onset, Italians 53, Immigrants 11,
      East Europe 3, North Africa 7, Central Africa 2) with onset of T1D in 2014, 2015, 2016 and
      2017 are going to be evaluated. Metabolic parameters (insulin requirement IU/Kg/day, HbA1c%)
      will be compared in two groups (CASES and CONTR) each 3-6 months from the onset. The work was
      performed on retrospectively collected data from medical records of patients with start of
      the disease in 2014-2016. Patients enrolled since 2017 (n=20) have been studied
      prospectively.

      Moreover, a group of 30 health children were recruited as healthy controls (HC) (12.1 years
      old + 3.9, M19:F11, Caucasian 30, Immigrants 2) for AA, EPA, DHA values and AA/EPA ratio.
      They referred to the Pediatric Surgery or Orthopedic Clinics for minor surgery or mild
      trauma, recruited as voluntary.

      The intervention consisted in supplementation with highly purified Ω-3, eicosapentaenoic acid
      (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) at a dose of 50-60 mg/kg/day for 12 months (n. 42). It
      is reported as (Ω3)0 the start if intervention for the each patient. The intervention with
      Ω-3 is considered concluded after one-year of Ω-3 supplementation (CASES) [(Ω-3)12]. Cases
      were divided into four sub-groups according to the time of overt disease onset (T0), n.20
      within 6 months from onset in 2017, n.6 within 7-12 months from onset in 2016, n.6 within
      13-18 months from onset in 2016 and n.10 within 19-36 months from onset in 2015.

      Moreover a dietitian counseling was provided as educational intervention for selecting a diet
      that could provide a natural source of Ω-3 (blue fish, nuts, walnuts, poultry, eggs,
      vegetable oils, flax seeds and leafy vegetable). The goal of supplement and dietary advice
      was to target AA/EPA ratio between 1.5-3.

      Cholecalciferol 1000 IU/day (25 mcg/day) supplementation for the management of Vitamin D
      deficiency/insufficiency was systematically added at onset in all T1D patients (n. 78).

      The Vitamin D dosage was adjusted to target 25(OH)D level in the normal range according to
      Endocrine Society, 30-100 ng/ml (75-249 nmol/l) for all patients. Before supplementation of
      Vitamin D, at clinical onset of T1D, 25(OH)D level, and before of Ω-3 administration, AA/EPA
      ratio and fatty acids percentages were performed, and repeated after 3 and 12 months of
      supplementation.

      At (Ω-3)0 and (Ω-3)12, fasting C-peptide (FC-P) levels, daily insulin dose (IU/Kg/day) and
      glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C%) both in supplemented and not supplemented patients (CONTR)
      will be compared.
