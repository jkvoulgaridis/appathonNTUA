  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To provide a framework for successful clinical trials testing novel targets for therapy in
      liver disease.

      To identify molecular and cellular drivers of liver disease to provide a molecular
      classification and study the determinants or key drivers of disease progression.

      Consecutive patients admitted with steatohepatitis (alcoholic or non-alcoholic) will be
      enrolled in this study where liver tissue, blood and stool will be collected to discover and
      validate factors associated with diagnosis, severity, histological characteristics,
      development of decompensations, progression of disease and survival.

    <description>Generation of consistent non-invasive molecular footprints of disease severity and prognosis: plasma and peripheral blood cells from groups of patients with different disease prognosis will be analyzed by means of high throughput proteomics (Mass Spectrometry and aptamer mediated identification) and single cell RNA sequencing, respectively. Data will be integrated with liver RNA-sequencing to detect relevant liver fingerprints in plasma.
Mechanisms of ductular reaction and hepatocyte de-differentiation will be studied by micro-dissection and region-specific RNA-sequencing.
Mechanisms of hepatocyte dedifferentiation will be evaluated using methylation bead chip and chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq) of histone marks related with activation, enhancement, poisoning and repression of gene expression.</description>
