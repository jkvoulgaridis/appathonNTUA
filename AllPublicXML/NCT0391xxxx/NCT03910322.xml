  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to investigate if a daily dose of minimum 50 billion
      CFU of Bif195 reduces the risk of small-intestinal tissue damage in an acetylsalicylic acid
      challenge model as assessed by video capsule endoscopy in a healthy US population aged 40 -
      60 years.

      This trial is a single-site, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-armed,
      parallel-group trial in healthy volunteers aged 40 - 60 years. The trial will investigate the
      effect of daily intake of the probiotic strain Bif195 in two different doses or placebo when
      co-administered to daily intake of 300mg of Acetylsalicylic Acid (ASA).

      The trial includes a run-in period of two weeks duration followed by a six weeks intervention
      period where Bif195/placebo and ASA is co-administered.

      Subjects will participate in the trial for a total duration of 8 weeks including the run-in
      phase. Besides the screening visit, the trial will consist of 5 visits.

      After having given their written informed consent, subjects will complete the screening
      procedures to evaluate their eligibility for participation in the trial and complete a run-in
      period of two weeks duration to washout possible pre-trial probiotics and/or use of
      medication. After baseline assessments at Visit 2, subjects will start daily intake of 300mg
      ASA and also be randomly assigned to 6-weeks daily intake of low or high-dose active (Bif195)
      or placebo product in a ratio of 1:1:1.
