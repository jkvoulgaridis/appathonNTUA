      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of a 6-week Inspiratory
      Muscle Training and cardiovascular exercise training program in children and adolescents with
      asthma.

      To also determine the efficacy of inspiratory muscle training and exercise in increasing
      respiratory muscle strength and endurance, and to explore relationships between fitness
      interventions (inspiratory muscle training and exercise), exercise tolerance, airway closure
      and dyspnea scores.
