  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators are testing the accuracy of a wrist-worn measurement device
      by comparing its blood pressure measurement to arterial line (A-line) blood pressure
      monitors. The device is similar in style and fit to popular activity bands, but it is unique
      in that it measures blood pressure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      LiveMetric has developed a wrist-worn measurement device intended for use as a standalone
      device, designed for measurement of intermittent blood pressure for individuals suffering
      from hypertension or other conditions where monitoring of blood pressure is of importance.

      The wrist-worn measurement device is intended to be worn on the wrist for intermittent
      measurements of Blood pressure.

      The use does not require any special action from the user apart from wearing the band on
      either their left or right wrist. The device applies no inflatable mechanics or moving parts.
      The wristband is watertight and can be worn as any type of bracelet all the time or most of
      the time.

      The study will include subjects that are hospitalized in the ICU and/or any of the cardiology
      departments or affiliating units such as Cath lab, heart transplant unit, etc..) and are
      continually monitored by an intra-arterial blood pressure line (A-line). A medical
      professional will measure simultaneous non-invasive auscultatory readings to determine the
      lateral difference for later adjustment of calculation. A medical professional or a company
      representative accompanied by a medical professional will place the device on the opposite
      limb than the one having the A-line, providing the location of the placement has intact skin.
      During the measurement stage, BP values are simultaneously recorded from the reference
      invasive A-line and the wrist worn device.
