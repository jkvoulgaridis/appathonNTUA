  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The alcohol withdrawal syndrome has a hierarchical symptomatology depending on the severity
      (minor, moderate or severe). These signs express a state of psychic, behavioral and physical
      deprivation.

      The management of withdrawal syndrome involves the establishment of pharmacological and
      psychosocial interventions.

      Osteopathy is an exclusively manual practice whose purpose is to overcome the dysfunction of
      mobility of tissues of the human body. It can be used as a complementary treatment when a
      specific support is put in place. The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness
      of osteopathy in reducing alcohol withdrawal symptoms in adult patients.
