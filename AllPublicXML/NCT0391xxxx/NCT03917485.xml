  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to update the pulmonary retention values of non-fibrous
      mineral particles in the general population.

      This study will provide reference values for the interpretation and diagnosis of the cause of
      certain respiratory diseases potentially related to mineral particles.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Some non-fibrous mineral particles are responsible for respiratory or systemic diseases, most
      often of occupational origin. Their use concerns multiple professional sectors.

      The bio metrology of these particles, namely their quantification in a biological medium
      requires reference values. These are essential for clinicians to interpret pulmonary
      retention in patients who may have been exposed professionally or environmentally to
      non-fibrous mineral particles.

      A comparative study conducted in 2015 by lafp showed an increase in the particulate load of
      nonfibrous mineral particles, including titanium, in lung parenchyma samples over time.

      Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid is typically considered to be representative of the lung for the
      analysis of nonfibrous mineral particles. The thresholds currently used for the bio metrology
      of nonfibrous mineral particles in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples are based on
      reference values established more than 20 years ago. It is therefore appropriate to update
      these reference values by establishing a new control population from the analysis of
      bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from subjects not exposed to the non-fibrous mineral particles
      in a professional or environmental manner.
