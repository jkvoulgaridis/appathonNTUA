  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blinded randomized controlled trial, to evaluate the effectiveness of daily
      supplementation of 3.2 g CLA on body fat reduction and lipid profile in overweight or obese
      Chinese adults, during a lifestyle counselling-based weight loss.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a parallel randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial. Sixty-six
      overweight or obese men and women aged from 18 to 45 years with elevated body fat percentage,
      who also meet our inclusion and exclusion criteria, will be randomly assigned to: the
      treatment group, daily supplementation of 3.2 g CLA (Cis-9, trans-11 isomers and trans-10,
      cis-12 isomers) plus lifestyle counselling weight loss program; or the control group, daily
      supplementation of sunflower oil. The intervention will include a 3-day run-in phase and
      12-week interventional phase. At baseline and the end of the intervention, physical
      examination including questionnaires, anthropometric measurement, body composition by Dual
      Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA), biological sample collection will be undertaken. During
      the invention, regular lifestyle counselling sessions will be delivered, and detailed record
      will be tracked for all participants to monitor and improve the adherence and safety.
