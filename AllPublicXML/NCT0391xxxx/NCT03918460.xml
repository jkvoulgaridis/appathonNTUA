  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is non-randomized, multicenter international safety, performance and clinical
      benefit outcome assessment of ANEUFIX to treat patients with isolated type II endoleak in the
      presence of a growing AAA-sac following an EVAR procedure more than 6 months ago.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigational device is called ANEUFIX, which is a product treating the endoleak by
      blockage of backflowing blood vessels, i.e. by filling the endoleak void and nidus of feeding
      artery and exit of existing draining arteries.

      ANEUFIX is a polymer that cures rapidly (7 min at 37Â°C) after injection into the AAA-sac
      close to the nidus.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Persistent type II endoleak (more than 6 months post-EVAR or post-embolization
             procedure); AND

          2. Volume of the 'endoleak void' can be estimated upfront; AND

          3. An EVAR without circulatory complications (including the absence of an open AMI as
             judged on existing CT-scan); AND

          4. An endoleak confirmed by CT scan in preceding 90 days demonstrating the high
             likelihood of the isolated nature of the endoleak; AND

          5. An aneurysm sac growing in contours after EVAR (per European Guidelines) as documented
             in the preceding 90 days by means of Echo Doppler (or alternative visualization
             technique) and based upon sac diameter measurements; AND

          6. An aneurysm sac that can be punctured via a translumbar approach; AND

          7. Possibility to withhold anti-thrombogenic medication temporarily; AND

          8. Ability and willingness to undergo the translumbar procedure under local anesthaesia
             in a CT scanner; AND

          9. Being older than 18 years.

          3. Patient with traumatic vascular injury; OR

          4. Patients with an untreated open endoleak connected AMI (patients can be included if
             the AMI is or is technically not possible to be coiled prior the Aneufix application);
             OR

          5. Patient with haemostatic disorder (including bleeding disorders) or who is clinically
             unstable; OR

          6. Patient with a too high risk of abdominal sac rupture to allow safe radiological and
             scanographic assessments; OR

          7. Patient who is allergic to contrast media or anticoagulants; OR

          8. Patient with renal impairment (eGFR &lt; 30 ml/min); OR

          9. Patient with a contra-indication for temporal positioning of a translumbar
             needle/catheter; OR

         10. Patient who is participating in another trial with an investigational drug or medical
             device, or where a medical device/drug is used outside its labelling and its approved
             intended use; OR

         11. Women of child-bearing potential, OR
