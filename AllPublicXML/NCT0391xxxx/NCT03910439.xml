      Background:

      Multiple myeloma is a cancer that forms from plasma cells which normally produce important
      immune response antibodies. It cannot be cured. Researchers hope the combination of radiation
      combined with the drug avelumab causes the immune system to kill myeloma cells more
      effectively.

      Objective:

      To see if avelumab given with radiation treatment helps treat multiple myeloma. Also to see
      if giving the treatments together is safe.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 18 and older with multiple myeloma that has come back after treatment and has
      spread to other parts of the body

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with:

      Medical history

      Physical exam

      Blood, urine, and heart tests

      Possible tumor biopsy

      Bone marrow testing: A needle will be stuck into the participant s hipbone to take out a
      small amount of marrow.

      PET/CT scan and MRI: Participants will lie in a machine that takes pictures of the body.

      Participants will get avelumab through an IV. An IV is a small plastic tube put into an arm
      vein. They will get avelumab every 2 weeks for 2 doses. Then they will get radiation each day
      for 5 days. They will continue to get avelumab every 2 weeks as long as they do not have bad
      side effects and the treatment is helping their disease.

      Participants will have blood and urine tests, bone marrow biopsies, scans, and X-rays
      repeated during the study.

      Participants will have a follow-up visit 30 days after their last treatment dose. Then they
      will have visits every 3 6 months for up to 5 years....

      Background:

        -  Multiple Myeloma (MM) is a hematologic neoplasm of the plasma cells defined by an M-
           protein greater than or equal to 3.0 g/dL or bone marrow plasma cells greater than or
           equal to 10% and presence of end-organ disease.

        -  Although significant advances in treatment have been made in the past decade, MM remains
           incurable with median survivals of 5-8 years.

        -  While therapeutic strides have been made with approvals of immunomodulatory drugs
           (IMiDs), proteasome inhibitors, and monoclonal antibodies, treatment of relapsed
           refractory MM (RRMM) remains an unmet need for patients who have exhausted available
           therapies.

        -  Extramedullary plasmacytomas arising either from focal bone involvement or from
           hematogenous spread occur in 7-18% of newly diagnosed MM (NDMM) with an additional 6-20%
           in RRMM.

        -  Immune checkpoint inhibitors are being evaluated in combination regimens and evidence
           exists that radiation therapy (XRT) may synergize with immune checkpoint inhibitors.

      Objectives:

      - To assess the response rate of avelumab in combination with XRT (BavXRT) in RRMM patients
      with plasmacytomas or lytic lesions

      Eligibility:

        -  Patients must have previously treated RRMM refractory to, ineligible for, or intolerant
           of available therapeutic regimens known to provide clinical benefit (e.g,
           immunomodulatory [IMiD], proteasome inhibitor, and anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody-based
           treatments).

        -  Presence of greater than or equal to 1 extramedullary plasmacytoma and/or lytic lesion
           amenable to XRT

        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years

        -  Adequate organ function, and without serious comorbidity or disease (e.g., autoimmune
           disease), that would preclude concurrent systemic treatment or radiotherapy.

      Design:

        -  Treatment will consist of a 4-week lead-in with avelumab, followed by concurrent XRT 5Gy
           x 5 days). Monotherapy avelumab will continue indefinitely until progressive disease
           (PD) or unacceptable toxicity; 28-day cycles.

        -  Routine safety and MM-specific clinical labs will be assessed. Additional research
           bloods will be collected for evaluating immune-subsets, endosomes, and peripheral blood
           T cell repertoire prior to and following treatment (lead-in and prior to XRT, at disease
           re- evalutions at at time of response [i.e., CR/PD]).

        -  Bone marrow biopsies will be evaluated for PD-1/L1 expression, and B and T cell subsets
           using IHC. Flow cytometry will also be used to evaluate stimulatory and inhibitory
           immune subsets along with endosomes. Standard clinical histopathology and flow cytometry
           will also be evaluated.

        -  Single arm, Simon minimax two-stage phase II trial design. The first stage will enroll
           13 patients; if futility is not met, second stage will enroll another 14 patients to
           define the response rate to BavXRT in this population. Early stopping rules for safety
           will also be applied.

               -  Relapsed: disease that progresses and requires the initiation of salvage therapy
                  but does not meet criteria for either primary refractory or relapsed and
                  refractory MM categories

          -  Patients must have been previously treated for MM and be refractory to, not a
             candidate for (ineligible), or intolerant of available therapeutic regimens known to

               -  The effects of avelumab on the developing human fetus are unknown, however, given
                  the known role of PD-1/PD-L1 in maintaining the maternal/fetal tolerance,
                  avelumab can be expected to have an adverse effect on pregnancy, including
                  embryo-lethality. Women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) and men must agree to
                  use highly effective contraception (such as implants, injectables, combined oral
                  contraceptives, IUDs, sexual abstinence or vasectomised partner) prior to study
                  entry and for the duration of study treatment, and for at least 30 days after the
                  last dose of avelumab. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant
                  while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her
                  treating physician immediately.

          -  Patients with clinically unstable lesions (e.g., impending cord compression) where a
             delay in receiving XRT would be detrimental are not eligible

          -  Current or prior anti-cancer treatment prior to the first dose of avelumab as defined
             below:

                  the discretion of the investigator)

               -  Known mental or physical illness that would interfere with cooperation with the
                  requirements of the trial or confound the results or interpretation of the
                  results of the trial and, in the opinion of the treating investigator, would make
                  the patient inappropriate for entry into the study.

             constituting a safety risk based on investigator s judgment are acceptable.

          -  Vaccination with live vaccines within 4 weeks of the first dose of avelumab and while
             on study is prohibited (inactivated vaccines may be administered).

          -  Pregnant or lactating females. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for
             adverse events in nursing infants, on-study breastfeeding is not allowed.

          -  History of allergic reactions or hypersensitivity to avelumab or any component in its
             formulations, including known severe hypersensitivity reactions to monoclonal
             antibodies (Grade greater than or equal to 3) unless felt to be in the best interests
             of the patient at the discretion of the investigator.

          -  Known additional malignancy that is symptomatic or requires active systemic treatment
             (at the discretion of the PI, exceptions may be made if in the best interest of the
             patient).

          -  Other severe acute or chronic medical conditions including immune colitis,
             inflammatory bowel disease, immune pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis or psychiatric
             conditions including recent (within the past year) or active suicidal ideation or
             behavior; or laboratory abnormalities that may increase the risk associated with study
             participation or study treatment administration or may interfere with the
             interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make
             the patient inappropriate for entry into this study.
