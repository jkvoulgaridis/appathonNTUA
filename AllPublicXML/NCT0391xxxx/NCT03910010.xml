  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Drugs used for managing Fibromyalgia pain have not proven to be effective and pain continues
      to cost Canadians $60 billion a year without truly helping those who suffer. The study
      proposes to investigate the factors related to a person that can enhance or reduce the
      effectiveness of pain treatments in people suffering with Fibromyalgia pain. Treatment
      response to painkillers in a person may be related to their brain, social, and psychological
      makeup. The investigators aim to study these factors to identify and develop feasible and
      robust indicators based on a person's biological makeup (also called biomarkers). These
      biomarkers will allow doctors and researchers to predict more accurately which treatment and
      prevention strategies for a particular disease will work in which groups of people. These
      measures will offer new opportunities for improving treatment such as by tailoring treatment
      to meet the specific needs of each patient based on his/her biological and psychological
      makeup. Towards the specific aim, data will first be collected in several experimental
      domains for studying treatment expectations (cognitive, psychosocial, brain-related). These
      'experimental' data will be compared between Fibromyalgia (FM) and healthy participants to
      yield new understanding of the factors that govern treatment response. At the end of
      experimental data collection, the investigators will collect data in the 'clinical' domain.
      Hence, at the end of the experimental sessions, a subset of FM participants will receive a
      mock drug (placebo disguised as an approved pain treatment) and another subset will provide
      pain ratings only and hence serve as a waiting list control for the placebo trial. Data will
      be studied in steps to understand factors that mediate treatment outcomes and finally the
      investigators will use advanced computational tools used for big data analysis and aim to
      identify factors that can be used as biomarkers and precision medicine tools.

    <description>Fibromyalgia participants will enter in an optional placebo trial. This phase of the study will test the clinical usefulness of the biomarkers. We will measure how expectation of starting a new treatment reduces 'clinical back pain' in each participant. Positive treatment expectations will be induced by giving them capsules containing inert material and telling them that the capsules contain an effective drug that has been approved for treating Chronic Back Pain. They will be requested to take two capsules four times a day and report their pain on paper forms organized as a calendar or on REDCap.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Chronic pain participant inclusion criteria:

               3. Meet the classification criteria of chronic low back pain (having low back pain
                  for more than 6 months).

                  the two weeks prior to enrollment

             language instructions

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Chronic pain participant exclusion criteria:

             example: asthma or claustrophobia

          2. History of cardiac, respiratory, or nervous system disease that, in the investigator's
             judgment and by asking the participant about their comfort level and ability,
