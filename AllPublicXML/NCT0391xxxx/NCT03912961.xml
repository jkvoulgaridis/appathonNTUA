  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this clinical trial, we plan to evaluate the usefulness of artificial intelligence (AI)
      software paired with a handheld retinal camera to compare diabetic retinopathy status in
      Bolivian patients as read by retina specialists versus the AI software.

        Patients who are known diabetics in the hospital, or seeking help from the eye clinics or
        from associated specialties, e.g. endocrinology, will be included in the study as subjects.
        The Investigators will also recruit subjects who are evaluated in organized outreach visits
        in the community.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female subjects who are at least 18 years old who have full legal capacity to
             volunteer on the date the informed consent is signed;

          2. Subjects who can follow the instructions by the clinical staff at the clinical site,
             and can attend examinations on the scheduled examination dates;

          3. Subjects who have been diagnosed with Type I or Type II diabetes mellitus.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects unable to tolerate ophthalmic imaging;

          2. Subjects who have been scheduled for but have not yet undergone the following
             surgeries: Cataract Surgery (including any related follow-up procedures) or
             Vitrectomy.

          3. Subject blind in one eye due to any cause

          4. Subjects who have a condition or a situation, which in the investigator's opinion, may
             put the subject at increased risk, confound study data, or interfere significantly
             with the subject's study participation.
