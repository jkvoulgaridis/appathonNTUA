  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A total of 40 patients with CP (20 smokers (S+CP) and 20 nonsmokers (S-CP)) and 40
      periodontally healthy subjects (20 smokers (S+PH) and 20 nonsmokers (S-PH)), comprising 80
      subjects, were included in this study. Baseline GCF samples were obtained from all subjects
      and clinical periodontal measurements, including probing depth (PD), clinical attachment
      level (CAL), plaque index (PI), and gingival index (GI), were recorded. In patients who had
      received initial periodontal therapy, GCF samples were obtained and all clinical periodontal
      measurements were recorded again during the 6th-8th weeks. GCF PGRP-1 levels were analyzed by
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs) are one of the antimicrobial peptides that play a
      role in innate immunity and act against the bacterial cell wall. Smoking is the most
      important environmental risk factor for periodontitis. This study determined the effect of
      smoking on PGRP-1 levels in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) in smokers and nonsmokers with
      chronic periodontitis (CP) following initial periodontal therapy.
