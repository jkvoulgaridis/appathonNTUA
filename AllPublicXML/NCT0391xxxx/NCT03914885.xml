  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol for compassionate use combines 2 different ways of fighting disease: antibodies
      and T cells. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with cancers, and
      both have shown promise, but neither alone has been sufficient to cure most patients. This
      protocol combines both T cells and antibodies to create a more effective treatment. The
      investigational treatment is called autologous T lymphocyte chimeric antigen receptor cells
      targeted against the CD30 antigen (ATLCAR.CD30) administration.

      Prior studies have shown that a new gene can be put into T cells and will increase their
      ability to recognize and kill cancer cells. The new gene that is put in the T cells in this
      study makes a piece of an antibody called anti-CD30. This antibody sticks to leukemia cells
      because they have a substance on the outside of the cells called CD30. For this protocol, the
      anti-CD30 antibody has been changed so that instead of floating free in the blood part of it
      is now joined to the T cells. When an antibody is joined to a T cell in this way it is called
      a chimeric receptor. These CD30 chimeric (combination) receptor-activated T cells seem to
      kill some of the tumor, but they do not last very long in the body and so their chances of
      fighting the cancer are unknown.

      The primary purpose of this protocol is to treat a single patient with a second dose of
      ATLCAR.CD30 T cells.

      Lymphodepleting Chemotherapy:

      The patient will receive a lymphodepleting regimen of bendamustine 70mg/m2/day over 3
      consecutive days and fludarabine 30mg/m2/day over 2 consecutive days. Bendamustine and
      fludarabine will be administered concomitantly. Dose reduction of bendamustine may occur per
      treating physician discretion based on prior toxicities and the clinical status of the
      patient.

      Administration of ATLCAR.CD30 T cells:

      Post lymphodepletion, if the patient meets eligibility criteria for cellular therapy, then
      will receive ATLCAR.CD30 T cells within 2-14 days after completing the pre-conditioning
      chemotherapy regimen. We will administer ATLCAR.CD30 T cells post lymphodepletion at a dose
      of 2 x 10^8 cells/m2.

      Duration of Therapy:

      Therapy under this compassionate use protocol involves 1 infusion of ATLCAR.CD30 cells.

      Duration of Follow-up:

      The patient will be followed for up to 15 years for replication-competent retrovirus
      evaluation or until death, whichever occurs first.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Karnofsky or Lansky score of &gt;60%.

          -  WOCBP must be willing to use 2 methods of birth control or be surgically sterile , or
             abstain from heterosexual activity for the course of the study, or for 6 months after
             the study is concluded. WOCBP are those who have not been surgically sterilized or
             have not been free from menses for &gt; 1 year. The two birth control methods can be
             composed of: two barrier methods or a barrier method plus a hormonal method to prevent
             pregnancy. WOCBP subjects will also be instructed to tell their male partners to use a
             condom.

          -  Must not be pregnant or lactating.

          -  Must not have tumor in a location where enlargement could cause airway obstruction.

          -  Must not have current use of systemic corticosteroids at doses ≥10 mg prednisone daily
             or its equivalent; those receiving &lt;10mg daily may be enrolled at discretion of the
             Investigator

          -  Evidence of adequate organ function as defined by:

               -  ANC&gt;1.0 × 109/L

               -  Pulse oximetry of &gt;90% on room air Note: Patient may receive a second infusion
                  without prior lymphodepletion if they meet the eligibility criteria in this
                  Sections 3.1 and 3.2 at the time of infusion, but do not meet the eligibility
                  requirements for adequate bone marrow function and platelet counts

          -  Negative serum pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to lymphodepletion or
             documentation that the patient is post-menopausal. Post-menopausal status must be

             bendamustine)

          -  Patient is a good candidate for treatment with ATLCAR.CD30 per the investigator's
             discretion.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  No evidence of uncontrolled infection or sepsis.

          -  Evidence of adequate organ function as defined by:

               -  Total bilirubin ≤2 × ULN, unless attributed to Gilbert's syndrome

               -  AST ≤3 × ULN

          -  Patient has no clinical indication of rapidly progressing disease in the opinion of
             the treating physician

          -  Patient is a good candidate for treatment with ATLCAR.CD30 per the investigator's
             discretion.

          -  If Patient has had positive hepatitis B core antibody testing while on the LCCC
             1532-ATL clinical trial, they must not have had re-activation of the Hepatitis B virus
             since baseline testing (i.e., they will be excluded if any of their hepatitis B viral
             load testing is positive up until the point of eligibility determination for
             re-infusion).
