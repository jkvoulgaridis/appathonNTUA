             other hepatitis, cirrhosis, fatty liver and inherited liver disease, ,

         17. History of intra-abdominal inflammatory process within the last 12 months such as, but
             not limited to, diverticulitis, peptic ulcer disease or colitis.

         18. History of autoimmune disease including, but not limited to systemic lupus
             erythematosus (SLE), Sjögren's syndrome, glomerulonephritis, multiple sclerosis,
             rheumatoid arthritis, vasculitis, systemic immune activation, inflammatory bowel
             disease, vascular thrombosis associated with antiphospholipid syndrome, Wegener's
             granulomatosis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, Bell's palsy.

               -  Participants with a history of autoimmune-related hypothyroidism on a stable dose
                  of thyroid replacement hormone are eligible,

               -  Participants with controlled Type I diabetes mellitus on a stable insulin regimen
                  are eligible,

               -  Participants with eczema, psoriasis, lichen simplex chronicus, or vitiligo with
                  only dermatologic manifestations &lt;10% of the skin (e.g, participants with
                  psoriatic arthritis would be excluded) are eligible.

         19. History of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, organizing pneumonia (e.g. bronchiolitis
             obliterans), drug-induced pneumonitis, idiopathic pneumonitis, or evidence of active
             pneumonitis on screening chest CT scan. History of radiation pneumonitis in the
             radiation field (fibrosis) is permitted.

         20. Poorly controlled Type II diabetes mellitus defined as a screening fasting plasma
             glucose ≥160 mg/dL (or 8.8 mmol/L).

         21. Severe infections within 2 weeks prior to inclusion, including but not limited to
             hospitalization for complications of infection, bacteremia, or severe pneumonia.

         22. Received therapeutic oral or IV antibiotics within 2 weeks prior to inclusion.
             Participants receiving prophylactic antibiotics (e.g, for prevention of a urinary
             tract infection or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) are eligible.

         23. Participants with oral anticoagulation therapy of the potential of bleeding. For ASA
             and anti-platelet agents, we follow the recommendations for injection from consensus
             guidelines. Based on the consensus guidelines from the Cardiovascular and
             Interventional Radiology Society of Europe, if a patient is to have a superficial
             lymph node or subcutaneous mass injected, NSAIDs, aspirin, or clopidogrel may be used
             and do not have to be withheld. For procedures with moderate or significant risk of
             bleeding, long-acting agents such as aspirin or clopidogrel should be discussed with
             the Sponsor and may need to be discontinued before beginning G100 therapy. (Higher
             risk would include deeper lesions or those within organs or with the potential for
             bleeding without the possibility of simple compression to help stop the bleeding).

         24. Participant has spinal cord compression not definitively treated with surgery and/or
             radiation or previously diagnosed and treated spinal cord compression without evidence
             that disease has been clinically stable for &gt;2 weeks prior to inclusion.

         25. Administration of a live, attenuated vaccine within 4 weeks before the start of study
             medication or anticipation that such a live attenuated vaccine will be required during
             the study. Influenza vaccination should be given during influenza season only
             (approximatively October to March). Patients must not receive live, attenuated
             influenza vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the start of study medication or at any time
             during the study or within 5 months after the last dose of atezoluzumab.

         26. Has known active hepatitis B or hepatitis C,

         27. Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV1/2 antibodies) or known
             acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS),

         28. Has a known history of tuberculosis.
