  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain is a leading cause of disability worldwide. The lumbar zygapophyseal joints
      (z-joints) are estimated to be the source of low back pain between 10% and 40% of the time.
      Observational studies have shown that lumbar medial branch radiofrequency neurotomy (LMBRFN)
      can be an effective treatment for z-joint low back pain. Nonetheless, other publications such
      as the Cochrane collaboration systematic review and the &quot;Minimal Interventional Treatments
      for Participants with Chronic Low Back Pain&quot; or &quot;MINT&quot; randomized controlled trial conclude
      that LMBRFN is not efficacious. These discrepancies in the literature may be due to
      differences in patient selection and procedural technique. This study aims to employ patient
      selection via dual medial branch block resulting in at least 80% relief on both occasions.
      Using this rather strict enrollment criteria, the aim of the study is to then compare LMBRFN
      utilizing 16 gauge needles via the &quot;parallel&quot; approach as endorsed by Spine Intervention
      Society guidelines to LMBRFN performed with 22 gauge needles and another commonly employed
      &quot;perpendicular&quot; technique similar to that approach used for medial branch blocks. The primary
      outcome of the study will be to determine if there is a difference in the percentage of
      patients with lumbar facet pain who achieve moderate or good response (improvement of Numeric
      Pain Rating Scale of at least 50% or 80%) or in the duration of effect (median duration of
      moderate or good response in those with positive outcome) between these two groups.

    <description>Categorical Outcome; ideal would be that patients no longer require other care for the condition for which they were treated. So, the scoring is simply absolute. The instrument is neither designed nor intended for more granular analysis, on the grounds that partial reduction in doses required, but nevertheless continuation of other treatment, falls short of indicating a worthwhile, successful outcome (PubMed Identifier: 25312899).</description>

    <description>Categorical outcome; it is very relevant if return to work is achieved. Failure to return to work is too vexatious an issue, with so many determinants that it is neither efficient nor effective to bother trying to record them (Reference PMID: 25312899).</description>

    <description>The questionnaire is designed to give information on how pain is affecting the ability to manage everyday life. The range of scores is 0-100%.
0-20%: &quot;minimal disability&quot;: The patient can cope with most living activities. Usually no treatment is indicated apart from advice on lifting sitting and exercise.
21-40%: &quot;moderate disability&quot;: The patient experiences more pain and difficulty with sitting, lifting and standing. Travel and social life are more difficult and they may be disabled from work. Personal care, sexual activity and sleeping are not grossly affected and the patient can usually be managed by conservative means.
41-60%: &quot;severe disability&quot;: Pain remains the main problem in this group but activities of daily living are affected.
61-80%: &quot;crippled&quot;: Back pain impinges on all aspects of the patient's life. 81-100%: These patients are either bed-bound or exaggerating their symptoms.</description>
