  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatic resection is the most effective curative treatment for resectable HCC, whereas
      frequent recurrence usually impaired the efficacy of hepatic resection and contributed poor
      survivals. PVTT has been certified as an independent risk of early recurrence.

      Although TACE has been used to decrease the intraheptic recurrence. However, the intraheptic
      recurrence rate remains high and meanwhile it is uncapable to suppress extrahepatic
      recurrence. In addition, systematic therapy the small molecular target antiangiogenesis
      medicine sorafenib were used to prevent recurrence. Unfortunately, the STORM trial shows that
      postoperative antiangiogenesis therapy was failed to suppress recurrence and prolong survival
      period for HCC patients. Thus, novel effective systematic therapy to suppress postoperative
      recurrence is in urgent need.

      At present, the PD-1 antibody has presented a promising and safe therapeutic result of
      unresectable HCC and provided good survival benefit for advanced HCC patients. Consistent
      with this, we proposed a hypothesis that a novel immunetherapy using the PD-1 antibody could
      suppress postoperative recurrence and prolong HCC patients survival period effectively.

      Hepatic resection is the most effective curative treatment for resectable hepatocellular
      carcinoma (HCC), whereas frequent recurrence usually impaired the efficacy of hepatic
      resection and contributed poor survivals. Portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) has been
      certified as an independent risk of early recurrence (â‰¤2years after hepatic resection).

      Although Transarterial Chemoembolization (TACE) has been used as an effective local adjuvant
      treatment to decrease the intraheptic recurrence. However, the intraheptic recurrence rate
      remains high and meanwhile it is uncapable to suppress extrahepatic recurrence. In addition,
      systematic therapy the small molecular target antiangiogenesis medicine sorafenib were used
      to prevent recurrence. Unfortunately, the double blind randomized STORM trial shows a
      negative result that postoperative antiangiogenesis therapy was failed to suppress recurrence
      and prolong survival period for HCC patients. Thus, novel effective systematic therapy to
      suppress postoperative recurrence is in urgent need.

      At present, the PD-1 antibody has presented a promising and safe therapeutic result of
      unresectable HCC and provided good survival benefit for advanced HCC patients. Consistent
      with this, we proposed a hypothesis that a novel immunetherapy using the PD-1 antibody could
      suppress postoperative recurrence and prolong HCC patients survival period effectively.
