  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To validate the tumor response rate: in the previous study, the investigators showed that
      TILA-TACE achieved 100% tumor response rate. However, as the study sample size was 40, the
      investigators need to validate the tumor response rate using a larger sample size; To
      validate the overall survival: in the previous study, the investigators showed that TILA-TACE
      significantly prolonged the overall survival of the patients with large and massive tumor.
      Again, the sample size was small, the investigators need to validate the data using a large
      sample size.

    <description>Viable tumors were assessed by MRI according to EASL criteria. The enhanced and non-enhanced areas represent viable and necrotic tumors. At least 2 radiologists evaluate the approximate viable tumor residues (%) of total tumor volume (Total tumor volume was the sum of viable and necrotic volume).
The response to treatment is defined by the Viable Tumor Residues (%) as below: complete response (CR), no obvious viable residuals; near complete response (NCR), viable residuals ＜10%; partial response (PR), viable residuals &gt;10% but &lt; 50%; stable disease (SD), viable tumor residuals between &gt;50% but ≤100%; and progressive disease (PD), viable tumors ＞ 100%.</description>

    <description>TACE was performed through the transfemoral route using a 5-Fr catheter (Shepherd-hook modified Angiographic Catheter, HANACO Medical, Tian Jin, China ) that was advanced from celiac artery to common hepatic artery, proper hepatic artery, hepatic artery and ultimately to tumor feeding arteries which are defined by angiography. Then, a coaxial microcatheter (2.8 Fr Marguerite II, ASAHI INTECC GMA CO., LTD, Nagoya, Japan) was selectively inserted through a 5-Fr catheter into the tumor feeding artery, into which, 5% sodium bicarbonate was infused alternatively with doxorubicin-lipiodol emulsion. Finally, the artery was embolized with PVA (Embosphere®, BioSphere Medical, Paris, France) and microcoil ( Tornado ®, COOK Medical, USA).</description>
