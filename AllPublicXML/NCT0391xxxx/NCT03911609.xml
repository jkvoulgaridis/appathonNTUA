  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study has three aims:

        1. To investigate the influence of cardiovascular autonomic function on pain sensitivity at
           rest in patients with fibromyalgia and age- and sex-matched controls

        2. To investigate the influence of cardiovascular autonomic function at baseline and during
           exercise on the pain response following submaximal isometric exercise

        3. To study the relation between the pain response following physical and cognitive tasks
           (exercise and mental math, respectively).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia (FM) affects 2 -8% of the population with a higher prevalence in women than men.
      People with FM report widespread pain that impacts their quality of life. Patients may also
      experience other symptoms besides pain such as depression, anxiety, fatigue, sleep
      difficulties and others. Exercise is one of the interventions that have been shown to reduce
      pain in chronic pain populations. The phenomenon by which exercise reduces pain sensitivity
      is known as exercise-induced hypoalgesia (EIH). Although exercise is strongly recommended by
      American Pain Society guideline for the treatment of FM, some patients with FM report an
      increase in pain and worsening symptoms following acute exercise. The worsening of symptoms
      may impact adherence to exercise training. Why some people with FM report pain exacerbation
      while others report pain relief following exercise is not known.

      This study aims at assessing the influence of the cardiovascular autonomic nervous system on
      pain sensitivity at rest and following exercise in patients with fibromyalgia and pain-free
      individuals.

    <measure>Change in Heart Rate during Deep Breathing Test</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, session 1 which is day 1 of data collection</time_frame>
    <description>The test is done by asking the participant to perform six breathing cycles with each cycle consists of a five seconds inhalation and 5 seconds exhalation (10 second-cycle). Subjects will perform practice trials until they perform respiratory cycles without sudden inhalation or exhalation or holding the breath. Continuous electrocardiogram data will be collected. The change of heart rate during deep breathing test reflects the cardiovascular parasympathetic function. Reduced heart rate variability during deep breathing test indicates reduced parasympathetic tone.</description>

Continuous blood pressure will be collected during the test. The recovery time of blood pressure to baseline after Valsalva reflects the cardiovascular sympathetic tone. Greater recovery time indicates reduced sympathetic tone.</description>

    <time_frame>samples will be collected at home at any day between day 1 and day 7 of data collection</time_frame>
    <description>CAR represents the increase of cortisol levels after awakening particularly in the first 30-45 minutes post-awakening. CAR is normal circadian phenomenon and the increase of cortisol levels post-awakening can range from 50 -150% in healthy adults. CAR can be assessed by taking three samples following awakening (immediately post-awakening, 30 minutes and 45 post-awakening). Reduced CAR indicates a dysfunction in the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis and reduction in the ability to respond to acute or chronic physiological or psychological stress.</description>

The DASS21 has been validated in chronic pain patients and non-clinical sample. In patients with FM, DASS21 is associated with the severity of symptoms measured with FIQR, and it mediates the relation between pain intensity and disability in patients with chronic low back pain. The scale has three subscales which are depression, anxiety and stress. The score of depression subscale ranges from 0 - 27. The score of anxiety ranges from 0 - 21. The score of stress ranges from 0 - 42. The greater the score in all subscales the worse the outcome.</description>
