  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction: Hemophilic ankle arthropathy is manifested by degenerative functional
      alterations (deficit of muscle strength, mobility and proprioception) (intra-articular
      alterations) and chronic pain. Myofascial release techniques are used to treat soft tissue
      adhesions, relieve pain and reduce tissue sensitivity.

      Design. A randomized clinical trial. Aimed: To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a
      protocol by self-myofascial release with Foam Roller applied in patients with hemophilic
      ankle arthropathy.

      Patients: 70 patients with ankle arthropathy will be recruited for inclusion in the study.
      Patients will be recruited in 5 centers, from different regions of Spain.

      Intervention: Each session will last approximately 15 minutes, with five physiotherapy
      sessions per week for a period of 3 months. Patients will be evaluated at baseline, after the
      intervention, and after a follow-up period of 3 months. The treatment program includes 11
      exercises that must be administered bilaterally. A mobile application will be developed where
      each patient will be able to observe the exercises to be carried out.

      Measuring instruments and study variables: digital goniometer (ankle range of motion); visual
      analog scale and pressure algometer (joint pain); Haemophilia Joint Health Score (joint
      status); dynamometer assess (muscle strength); 6-Minute Walking test (functionality of lower
      limbs); Mobile device (Activity record); Finger-floor test (muscle flexibility). At the same
      time, the study will allow to determine joint bleeding caused by applied physiotherapy
      treatment.

      Expected results: To demonstrate the safety of this Physiotherapy technique in patients with
      hemophilia. Likewise, an improvement in ankle pain, functionality and joint motion is
      expected.

    <description>Visual analogic scale (VAS). This scale will be used to evaluate the perception of joint pain, where ankle joint pain ranges from 0 to 10 points (no pain to maximum perceived pain).</description>

    <description>Pressure algometer. Measuring instrument used to evaluate pressure joint pain. The instrument shall consist of a measuring device attached to a hard rubber tip 1.1 cm in diameter. Its sphere shall be calibrated in kg/cm2 with divisions of 0.1 kg/cm2. The pressure algometry methodology applied was based mainly on the study by Hogeweg. Before taking the measurements, patients will be instructed to say &quot;yes&quot; as soon as pressure exerted by the algometer becomes slightly unpleasant. The pressure algometer shall be kept perpendicular to the surface of the skin with the right hand, stabilizing the axis of the instrument using the thumb and index finger of the left hand. The pressure shall be increased at a uniform rate of approximately 1 kg/cm2 per second. As soon as the subject, according to the instructions, says &quot;yes&quot;, the pressure will be stopped and the score will be noted.</description>

    <time_frame>Screening visit, within the first seven days after treatment and after three months follow-up visit</time_frame>
    <description>Hemophilia Joint Health Score (HJHS). This measuring instrument will be used to evaluate the joint condition of knees, ankles, and elbows. It includes 8 items (inflammation and its duration, pain, atrophy and muscle strength, crepitus, and reduced flexion and extension) ranging from 0 to 20 points per joint (the higher the score, the greater the joint deterioration).</description>

    <time_frame>Screening visit, within the first seven days after treatment and after three months follow-up visit</time_frame>
    <description>Digital Goniometry Ankle ROM shall be measured using a digital goniometer. The assessment can be made with the patient standing. This measuring instrument allows more accurate measurements than those obtained with a universal plastic goniometer.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline muscle strength after treatment and at 3 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening visit, within the first seven days after treatment and after three months follow-up visit</time_frame>
    <description>Dynamometry. The maximum isometric strength of the flexor and extensor muscles of the main joints affected in hemophilia (knees and ankles) will be evaluated on both limbs with a manual dynamometer using a mark test. For this test, the rater needs to keep the dynamometer stationary while the patient exerts maximum force against it.</description>

    <time_frame>Screening visit, within the first seven days after treatment and after three months follow-up visit</time_frame>
    <description>Fingertip-to-Floor Test. This test is used to assess the degree of flexibility of the posterior muscles of the lower limbs. This value is calculated as the distance between the fingertip and the floor when maximum hip flexion with knee extension is performed.</description>
