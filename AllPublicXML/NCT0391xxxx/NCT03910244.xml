  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II placebo-controlled double-blind study of pomalidomide in patients with
      hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) with moderate to severe epistaxis who require
      parenteral iron infusions or blood transfusions. A total of 159 patients will be randomized
      2:1 to treatment with oral pomalidomide or matching placebo for 24 weeks. Mean change from
      baseline to 24 weeks in the Epistaxis Severity Score (ESS) will be compared between treatment
      groups to determine pomalidomide efficacy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HHT is associated with substantial morbidity, leading to a reduced quality of life, decreased
      rate of employment and a high incidence of depression. There currently exists no medical
      therapy recognized as consistently efficacious in HHT. Reports of the efficacy of thalidomide
      in HHT, as well as interim results of a pilot trial of pomalidomide in HHT provide evidence
      of efficacy with minimal toxicity. The favorable efficacy:toxicity ratio of pomalidomide
      suggest that it may benefit patients with HHT.

      This study is designed as a Phase II placebo-controlled double-blind study of pomalidomide in
      HHT patients with moderate to severe epistaxis who require parenteral iron infusions or blood
      transfusions. A total of 159 patients will be randomized 2:1 to treatment with oral
      pomalidomide or matching placebo for 24 weeks.

      Primary Objective: To determine efficacy of pomalidomide compared to placebo for the
      reduction in severity of epistaxis after 24 weeks of treatment.

      Secondary Objectives: To determine the safety and tolerability of pomalidomide for the
      treatment of HHT; to determine if pomalidomide treatment improves quality of life in HHT; to
      determine whether a continued response to pomalidomide is evident 12 weeks after treatment
      discontinuation; to develop a biorepository for future studies to define biomarkers
      predictive of pomalidomide response and allow investigations into the biology of HHT and
      mechanisms of pomalidomide.
