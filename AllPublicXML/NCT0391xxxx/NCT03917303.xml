  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic disease with a heterogeneous clinical presentation, relapse
      rate and treatment response. Insufficient control of mucosal inflammation results in
      irreversible bowel damage and complications and at present no markers are available to
      predict such a complicated disease course at diagnosis. Therefore, to prevent overtreatment
      of low risk patients, step-up treatment with subsequent introduction of corticosteroids,
      thiopurines maintenance and TNF-blockers if a previous category fails is standard care.
      Combination treatment with thiopurines and a TNF-blocker is more effective than monotherapy
      but associated with a higher risk for infectious complications. Landmark studies convincingly
      showed an improved long-term outcome if the TNF-blocker infliximab is introduced early after
      diagnosis. The standard step-care approach thus prolongs steroid exposure and delays start of
      disease modifying biologicals in high risks patients. Given the higher efficacy of
      combination therapy with a thiopurine of infliximab and potential allergic reactions and
      lower response rates after re-initiation of this chimeric biological, temporary monotherapy
      with this TNF-blocker has not been studied as first line treatment before. Adalimumab is a
      humanised monoclonal antibody and subsequently, combination therapy of adalimumab +
      thiopurines has only a marginal effect on anti-drug anti-body formation. Furthermore,
      combination therapy with adalimumab does not enhance the clinical response. Therefore,
      periodic treatment with adalimumab in combination with close monitoring after
      drug-discontinuation, in newly diagnosed CD might improve outcome, reduce drug-related side
      effects while still preventing overtreatment.

      The aim of this study is to compare the long-term efficacy and safety of periodic adalimumab
      as initial treatment in newly diagnosed CD patients compared to standard step-care with
      corticosteroid/budesonide as the initial treatment

    <description>Disease progression on MRI-enterography based on the Lémann score (Crohn's Disease Digestive Damage Score); the Lémann score is an instrument to measure cumulative structural bowel damage in Crohn's disease. The score takes into account the damage location (upper digestive tract, small bowel, colon/rectum and anal/perianal), extent and severity.
Grades 0 (normal) to 3 (maximal) are given to each segment of the digestive tract, with grade 3 representing the most damage, or resection/bypass.</description>
