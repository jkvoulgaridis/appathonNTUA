      This study aims to evaluate the prognosis in patients with spontaneous isolated dissection of
      the superior mesenteric artery (SIDSMA) who have been treated with stents.

      This study is a prospective, observational study. Patients who have been diagnosed as
      spontaneous isolated dissection of the superior mesenteric artery (SIDSMA) and treated with
      stents are enrolled in the study. We will evaluate the patency of stent, remodeling of the
      dissection and the relief of the symptoms in the next 2 years after patients have received
      stents.

    <time_frame>24 months post-procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Complete remodeling was defined as the absence of residual arterial dissection and stenosis via follow-up computed tomographic angiography. Incomplete remodeling was defined as improved luminal patency of the superior mesenteric artery but worse than complete remodeling.</description>

    <description>Most of patients with SIDSMA are symptomatic. The symptoms mainly include abdominal pain, hematochezia, nausea and vomiting.After the procedure, the time delay between the stent implantation and disappearance of these symptoms are documented.</description>
