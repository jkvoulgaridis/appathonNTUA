      Currently, paracetamol, ibuprofen and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs are widely used by
      emergency physicians in Turkey for the treatment of fever . The objective of the study is
      compare the efficacy of intravenous ibuprofen and paracetamol in the treatment of patients
      with upper respiratory tract infections presenting with fever in the emergency department

      This is the randomized double blinded clinical trial to compare the efficacy of these two
      drugs in this clinical setting. A randomized clinical trial was conducted in the Emergency
      Department (ED) of Pamukkale University Medical Faculty Hospital Study personnel (emergency
      physicians and emergency service nurses) were trained before the study. When intravenous
      drugs (Paracetamol and İbuprofen) was being recommended, an eligibility checklist was
      completed by the attending physician. patients who presented to the emergency department with
      upper respiratory tract infection and had a temperature above 38.0 ° C were measured by a
      fever gauge included into the study First Group: 1000 mg of paracetamol ( parol 10mg/ml
      solution Mefar, Turkey) intravenous (IV) was given 100 patients

      Second Group:

      Ibuprofen 400 mg ( intrafen 400mg/4ml solution -Gen ilaç san., Turkey) intravenous (IV) was
      given 100 patients which determined to be applied as a group. Drug packs prepared in 150 ml
      serum physiology were numbered by an independent nurse, who not involved in the study
      Randomization was achieved by using computer software to generate random numbers. During the
      intervention, participants were monitored by an oxygen saturation (SpO2) monitor, an
      automatic sphygmomanometer (blood pressure), and a rhythm monitor (heart rate and rhythms).
      Patients in both groups received two types of medication in a similarmanner, thus ensuring
      double blind.
