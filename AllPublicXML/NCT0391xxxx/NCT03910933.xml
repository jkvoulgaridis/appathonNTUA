  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Effective patient education improves health literacy and engagement thus improving long-term
      health outcomes. Health literacy is imperative to make informed health decisions and relies
      on the ability to obtain, process and understand health information; and is the cornerstone
      of safe health management. It is necessary to evaluate educational initiatives to determine
      their effectiveness in knowledge translation.

      A more effective way to provide patient education is to utilize media technology. Current
      education styles do not teach patients in the best way as they are not consistent with how
      people of all ages currently learn (through technology). In addition, patient teaching most
      commonly occurs during highly stressful times like hospital visits with new diagnoses.
      Current patient educational methods are costly given the amount of health provider time
      required.

      Electronic KITE teaching modules are infographic visual representations that present
      information quickly and clearly, integrating words and graphics to tell a story to reveal
      information. Infographic presentations are tools which facilitate self-directed learning with
      understandable, accessible information presented in an engaging way with an aim to enhance
      learning for children and their families. Patients are able to learn at a pace consistent
      with their learning style to facilitate knowledge development and health literacy.

      A more effective way to provide patient education is to utilize media technology. Current
      education styles do not teach patients in the best way as they are not consistent with how
      people of all ages currently learn (through technology). In addition, patienteaching most
      commonly occurs during highly stressful times like hospital visits with new diagnoses.
      Current patient educational methods are costly given the amount of health provider time
      required.

      Electronic KITE teaching modules are infographic visual representations that have been
      developed to provide patient teaching related to warfarin and its management.

      How much patients have learned will be assessed using the KIDCLOT validated knowledge
      quizzes. Children 8 years and older to have cognitive capacity will complete the quizzes if
      able. Caregivers will complete all quizzes linked with the modules they have completed.

      Patients may be enrolled into the appropriate cohort based on the health provider decision
      for management.

        1. Warfarin international normalized ratio (INR) testing

        2. Warfarin with home INR testing

        3. Warfarin transition from home INR testing to warfarin self management.
