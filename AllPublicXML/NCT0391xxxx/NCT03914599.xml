  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      NIH Precision Medicine Initiative, started in May 2018, will enroll one million people
      through an online portal. It hopes to identify genetic variants affecting a variety of human
      phenotypic outcomes. A giant set of data like this may enable an association of genetic
      variants with a certain phenotype. However, the association is often compromised due to the
      collection of phenotypic data that is not well controlled or standardized creating &quot;noisy&quot;
      data. These phenotypic &quot;noises&quot; can be largely eliminated in clinical studies with stringent
      criteria and standardization of outcome measurements.

      In this study, by looking mainly at genetic information and nerve conduction speed, we hope
      to eliminate the extra &quot;noises&quot; in the data set. Eliminating the extra &quot;noises&quot; should allow
      us to be able to determine if there are genetic differences between neurological disorders
      and healthy controls, and if these genetic differences can be attributed to the speed of the
      nerve conduction.

    <description>For all neurological disorder participants an electromyography (EMG) study will be done to determine nerve conduction speed, and a blood draw will be completed for genetic (DNA) testing. Motor measures, cognitive measures and surveys will be completed to assess walking and brain processing speed. Four optional assessments will be offered and only completed if the participant consents to them and include: optical coherence tomography (pictures of the back of the eye), visual evoked potential (to evaluate the nerve pathways of the eye), brain MRI, and skin biopsy. For participants with a diagnosis of Charcot Marie Tooth (CMT) disease, they will have an additional Neuropathy Score to assess disease severity.</description>

      All research participants, including healthy control volunteers, will be asked to give their
      blood samples once they are enrolled into the study. Their DNA will be extracted from the
      blood samples and stored in the freezers at the Integrative Biosciences Center in Detroit,
      MI. All samples stored in the Biobank at iBIO will be frozen and kept for an indefinite
      amount of time. The participant cannot obtain or access the stored samples in the future nor
      will participants have access to information or test results obtained from their personal
      samples because personal identifiers will be removed from the samples.
