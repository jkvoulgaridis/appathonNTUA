  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study will investigate the difference in ocular characteristics between contact
      lens wear and spectacle wear among habitual contact lens wearers, using a 2-treatment by
      2-period cross-over design. There will be a 1-week washout between the two study periods to
      eliminate any potential carryover effect.

    <measure>Non-invasive break up time (NIBUT)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 4-week follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Using a corneal topographer, NIBUT will be measured as the time interval in seconds after the final blink to the first appearance of distortion in the reflected rings; or to the time that the participant has to blink due to discomfort.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Meibomian Gland Expressibility</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 4-week follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Meibomian gland expressiblity is assessed in three regions of the lower eyelid: temporal, central, and nasal. Approximately five glands are expressed per region and evaluated using a four-grade scale: 0 = No Secretion, 1 = Inspissated, 2 = Colored/Cloudy Liquid, and 3 = Clear Liquid Oil. The total score is calculated as the sum of all grades across the three regions and ranges from 0 to 45.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Conjunctival Staining</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 4-week follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Conjunctival staining is graded and recorded by quadrant (Superior, Inferior, Nasal, and Temporal) using the following grading scale: Grade 0 = None, Grade 1 = Trace, Grade 2 = Mild, Grade 3 = Moderate, and Grade 4 = Severe. Average grade can be calculated based on grades of the four quadrants.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Lid Wiper Epitheliopathy</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 4-week follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Horizontal lid margin staining and sagittal lid margin staining are graded for each eyelid separately. The horizontal and sagittal grades are then averaged for each eyelid to obtain the upper lid average grade and lower lid average grade. The final grade is the average of the upper and lower lid average grades. Subjects can be classified according to their final grades for each eye. The classification is defined as follows: &quot;None&quot; for final grades of 0, &quot;Mild&quot; for final grades between 0.25 and 1.00, &quot;Moderate&quot; for final grades between 1.25 and 2.00, and &quot;Severe&quot; for final graded between 2.25 and 3.00.</description>

               6. Be a current soft contact lens wearer in both eyes with a minimum of 5 days/week
                  wear time over the last 1 month by self-report OR be a full-time spectacle wearer

               7. Subjects must be willing to adhere to spectacle-only refractive correction for
                  approximately 1 week.

               8. Subjects must possess a functional / usable pair of spectacles with which they
                  can achieve 20/20 Snellen visual acuity or better at distance and near, and bring
                  them to the visit
