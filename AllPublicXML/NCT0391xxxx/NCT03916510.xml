    <textblock>
      The use of chemoradiotherapy (CRT), in combination with surgery is the standard of care in
      the treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer. However some patients don't respond well to
      radiation.

      More advanced radiotherapy techniques, that result in fewer toxicities, means that we are now
      able to combine new anti-cancer agents into standard treatment. Targeting the tumour early in
      this way has the potential to improve response rates.

      Enadenotucirev is a specific type of anti-cancer virus that only targets cancer cells. It
      acts in the same way as any virus and can only survive by replicating inside cancer cells and
      not normal, non-cancerous cells. This means that it can selectively target and destroy
      tumours, without directly affecting normal cells. It also has the ability to attract cells
      from the body's immune system to help fight the cancer.

      The addition of enadenotucirev to standard chemoradiotherapy treatment may have a combined
      effect on the cancer cells with potentially few, additional side effects.

      This trial aims to determine the optimal dose and frequency of the virus to give by gradually
      increasing the number of doses each successive patient receives, and then increasing the dose
      of the virus itself. Each patient will receive a minimum of 3 doses, up to a maximum of 8,
      spread over the course of their 5 week standard chemoradiotherapy treatment. Patients will be
      closely monitored at all times to ensure that with each dosing group, there aren't excessive
      side effects.

      Patients will then undergo surgery as part of their standard of care and be followed up for
      up to 24 months to determine the long term effects of this treatment.

      This trial aims to determine the optimal dose and frequency that can then be used in future
      studies with the possibility of exploring the addition of Enadenotucirev to other
      chemoradiotherapy treatments.

    <textblock>
      At present identifying novel radiosensitising agents in colorectal cancer is an area of high
      need for patients considering sphincter preserving surgery or needing down staging to
      facilitate surgery.

      Although the combination of Enadenotucirev with chemoradiation is novel, there is a wealth of
      evidence to support the rationale for combining this class of agent with radiation and
      chemotherapy.

      Enadenotucirev is a group B oncolytic virus under development for the systemic treatment of
      metastatic or advanced epithelial tumours. Enadenotucirev is a chimeric adenovirus type 11p
      (Adp/adenovirus type 3 (Ad3) virus, discovered through a process of bio-selection from a
      library of chimeric viruses produced from a pool of adenoviruses from seven different
      serotypes utilizing human HT-29 colorectal cancer (CRC) cells.

      Enadenotucirev shows selective and potent toxicity in humans carcinoma cells with only very
      limited or no toxicity to normal (non-cancerous) human cells. Other than humans, there is no
      known permissive species for Enadenotucirev. The principle advantage of oncolytic therapy is
      that the virus replicates only in diseased cells meaning that the concentration of drug is
      amplified at the site of pathology so that it is higher in the tumour than in healthy tissue.
      Virus particles spread from cell to cell within a tumour nodule until they reach
      non-permissive normal tissues, in principle destroying all viable tumour cells they
      encounter.

      While the overall understanding of the mechanism of action of Enadenotucirev in humans is
      still under investigation, it is now well established from non-clinical and clinical studies
      that the mechanism of anti-cancer efficacy of oncolytic viruses not only involves direct
      infection and lysis of tumour cells, but that immune responses stimulated via an increased
      release of tumour-associated antigens and immune-inflammatory activation signals play a key
      role.

      CEDAR is dual endpoint, dose escalation phase 1 trial using a time to event continual
      reassessment method (TiTECRM). Response and Toxicity endpoints will be combined in dose
      escalation models to identify the optimal dose schedule. Dose decisions are made using the
      statistical model instead of just using the data from that particular dose, as in the case of
      3+3 model, meaning it uses all available data to make a dose decision.

      This primary objective is to determine the optimal dose and frequency of the virus by firstly
      gradually increasing the number of doses each successive patient receives, and then
      increasing the dose of the virus itself. All participants will receive 3 loading doses in
      weeks 1-2, prior to initiation of standard chemoradiotherapy. Further doses of Enadenotucirev
      will either be given after or during and after standard chemoradiotherapy and this is
      dependent on which of the 6 different dose groups they are assigned to. The dose given will
      vary between either 1x1012 Viral Particles (VP) or 3x1012vp.

      Each patient will receive a minimum of 3 doses, up to a maximum of 8, spread over the course
      of 9 weeks. Patients will be closely monitored at all times to ensure that with each dosing
      group, there aren't excessive side effects.

      Patients will then undergo surgery as part of their standard of care and be followed up for
      up to 24 months to determine the long term effects of this treatment.

      Data on progression free survival and loco-regional failure will be requested from the
      routine clinical care team at 12 and 24 months.
