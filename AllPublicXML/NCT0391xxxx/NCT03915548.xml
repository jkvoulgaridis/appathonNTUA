  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test the efficacy of a Behavioral
      Activation and Problem Solving (BA/PS) approach to improving activity participation over time
      as compared to an attention control condition within a sample of 300 breast cancer survivors
      reporting reduced activity participation after completing cancer treatment.

    <textblock>
      Assessments will be administered via telephone by a research assistant blind to group
      assignment. Participants will complete outcome assessments upon enrollment (T1) and at 8
      weeks (T2), 20 weeks (T3) and 44 weeks (T4) later. The T2 assessment captures the short-term
      outcomes of the most intensive part of the intervention (i.e., after six weekly sessions).
      The T3 assessment will capture the short-term outcomes at the end of the full intervention.
      The T4 assessment explores the sustained effect of BA/PS (six months after BA/PS ends). The
      study aim is to test whether the BA/PS intervention affects the &quot;slope&quot; of functional
      recovery over time. With the longitudinal data, the investigators will also be able to
      explore the pace of improvement and whether the two groups differ at these clinically
      relevant time points.

    <intervention_model_description>The investigators will recruit 300 women over the age of 18 reporting participation restrictions after completing curative treatment for Stage 1-3 breast cancer within the past year. Half of the participants will be randomized to the 4-month BA/PS intervention which consists of 6 weekly telephone calls followed by 3 monthly telephone calls. BA/PS is designed to teach problem-solving and action planning to promote functional recovery. The other half of participants will be assigned to an attention control condition providing education about survivorship topics. This control condition will allow us to account for the effect of time and history, and the non-specific effects of attention</intervention_model_description>

    <description>BA/PS teaches survivors to a) systematically examine the reasons an activity is challenging, b) set achievable short-term goals that have the potential to improve participation, c) brainstorm solutions including activity adaptations and environmental modifications, d) construct and implement a detailed action plan, and e) evaluate the results and level of goal attainment. The structured process gives participants repeated practice in goal reengagement that leads them progressively closer to their long-term functional goals. The BA/PS framework integrates the cognitive-behavioral therapies of Behavioral Activation and Problem-solving Treatment and incorporates concepts from an occupational therapy theory called the Person-Environment-Occupational Performance Model.</description>

    <description>Investigators provide education regarding nine cancer survivorship topics (i.e., healthy diets, physical activity, lymphedema management, smoking cessation, stress management, communication with providers, body image and sexuality, communication with social supports, work accommodations) during the control telephone contacts. The control condition will match the intervention in terms of the number of sessions, the delivery by telephone, use of an occupational therapist, and the use of &quot;homework&quot; between sessions (i.e., reading the education materials for the control condition versus executing the action plan for the BA/PS condition).</description>

    <description>The interventionist presents the rationale for BA/PS, promotes a positive problem orientation, and educates about the framework for problem-solving and action planning. The interventionist then administers the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure to elicit participant priorities, motivation, and long-term goals. The interventionist then guides the participant in using the BA/PS framework to set a goal, brainstorm solutions to challenges, and create a detailed action plan for the coming week.</description>
