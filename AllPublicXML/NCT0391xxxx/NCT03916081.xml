  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will assess the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and efficacy of different doses of
      ARQ-151 cream (0.05% and 0.15%) vs placebo applied once a day for 28 days by adolescents and
      adults with atopic dermatitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a parallel group, double blind, vehicle-controlled study in which ARQ-151 cream 0.05%
      or ARQ-151 cream 0.15% or vehicle is applied QD x 4 weeks to adolescent and adult subjects
      with atopic dermatitis. A subset of subjects will have serial PK testing, which will include
      the first few adolescents and adults enrolled in the study.

    <description>Change from baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) Total Score at week 4. EASI combines the assessment of the severity of lesions and the area affected into a single total score in the range 0 (no disease) to 72 (maximal disease). To calculate the EASI, the sum of the severity rating (0 to 3 with 3 being the most severe) for four clinical signs are multiplied with the numerical value of the area affected and with the percentage of the four body areas.</description>
