  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Orotracheal extubation consists in the removal of the endotracheal tube (ETT) when it is no
      longer required. This procedure may carry a considerable risk of complications and extubation
      failure. The literature points out two methods of extubation: the traditional method and the
      positive pressure method.

      In a noninferiority clinical trial it was demonstrated that EOT with positive pressure and
      without endotracheal suction was a safe technique and could be better than traditional
      extubation. Although some studies have reported better clinical results with this technique,
      the superiority of it has not been well studied.

      The aim of this study is to determine if positive pressure extubation technique is better
      than traditional extubation technique in terms of the incidence of major complications and
      extubation failure in critically ill adult patients.

      Design: Multicenter randomized controlled clinical trial Methods: Critically ill adult
      subjects on invasive mechanical ventilation who met extubation criteria will be included.
      Will be randomly assigned to positive-pressure extubation (n=389) or to traditional
      extubation (n=389).

      The main variable will be incidence of major complications.

    <description>Positive-pressure extubation is performed by only one operator. Ventilator parameters are set to pressure support ventilation mode, with an inspiratory pressure of 15 cm H2O and PEEP of 10 cm H2O. Then, the cuff is deflated, and the ETT is removed without endotracheal suction. Once the ETT is removed, a suction catheter is introduced through the mouth to suction secretions drawn to the oropharynx by the air flow from the ventilator passing between the ETT and the larynx.</description>

    <intervention_name>Traditional Extubation Technique</intervention_name>
    <description>Traditional extubation is performed by 2 operators. Without reconnection to the ventilator, the closed suction system catheter is introduced by one of the operators into the ETT and suctioning is initiated. The cuff is immediately deflated by the other operator, and the ETT is removed with continuous endotracheal suction during the whole procedure by the first operator.</description>
