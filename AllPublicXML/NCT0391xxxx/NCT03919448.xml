      The aim of the Clinical study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetic and safety profile of a new
      formulation of Bevacizumab (Zutrab®) when compared to two already marketed formulations
      Avastin® and Cizumab®, to establish similarity.

      Three-way bridge phase 1 trial. It is conducted in healthy, male adult subjects, it is
      single-dose, double-blind, parallel groups, randomized and balanced.

      Blood samples are collected up to 90 days, to dermine serum drug concentration and anti-drug
      antibodies. Safety and tolerabilty is also evaluated.

          -  Subjects of study, volunteers, adults, healthy.

          -  Study subjects whose safety and complementary laboratory tests are within normal
             values or which, in the Investigator's opinion, do not have clinical relevance: blood
             count, erythrosedimentation, hepatogram, urea, creatinine, glucose, coagulogram,
             serology for HIV, hepatitis B , hepatitis C, immunogenicity, complete urinalysis,
             detection of drugs of abuse in urine and electrocardiogram.

          -  Body mass index between 19 and 27 kg / m2 at the screening visit.

             contraceptive method or intrauterine device (which should be established before the
             start of the study) and the use of a spermicide as a barrier method. The use of a
             barrier method alone or sexual abstinence is not considered adequate.

             clopidogrel

          -  The study subjects must have suspended any pharmacological treatments at least 2 weeks

          -  Non-cooperative study subjects

          -  Study subjects employed by the Researcher or the Clinical-Pharmacokinetic Research
             Unit, with direct participation in the Clinical Research Protocol or other clinical
             protocols under the Direction of the Researcher or the Clinical-Pharmacokinetic
             Research Unit

          -  Physical findings and laboratory analyses:
