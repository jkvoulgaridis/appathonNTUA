    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective, observational multicenter study. All implants will be placed in
      the anterior maxilla or mandible and immediately loaded with a provisional prosthesis out of
      occlusion. Final restorations insertion will take place no later than 6 months following
      implant placement surgery. All implants will be restored with a single crown or splinted to a
      pre-existing implant if in the pre-molar region (no 2 adjacent edentulous sites).

  <detailed_description>

      This will be a prospective, observational study in which patients in need of dental implants
      in the anterior regions of the maxilla or mandible will be treated with the Eztetic dental
      implant(s). Qualified patients will be those with one or more edentulous area in the anterior
      maxilla or mandible needing a single (restored as a single crown; if in the pre-molar region,
      it is recommended implant be splinted to another tooth or implant; no 2 adjacent edentulous
      sites). Qualified patients should have presence of posterior teeth or a stable posterior
      occlusion. All implants will be placed in a single-stage manner. A provisional abutment will
      be placed and a temporary crown will be placed (cemented or screw-retained) out of occlusion
      at implant placement surgery visit. Impressions for permanent prosthesis fabrication will
      take place at 6 weeks and prosthesis placement will take place at 2 months. Final prosthesis
      insertion will take place no later than 6 months following implant placement surgery.
      Resonance frequency assessment procedures will be done at implant placement surgery and at
      prosthesis insertion. Implant survival will be the primary study endpoint. Crestal bone
      regression will be the secondary study endpoint. Enrollment will continue until 20 patients
      have completed final prosthetic treatment at study center.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients of either sex and at least 18 years of age

          2. Patients for whom a decision has already been made to use a dental implant for the
             restoration of existing partial edentulism in the anterior (central and lateral
             incisors), canine or pre-molar regions in the mandible or maxilla. Placing implant in
             canine region should be in a healed site (not for immediate extraction)

          3. Immediate extraction or a prior extracted site

          4. Intact buccal table as verified by Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) or radiography
             during surgery. If absent, patient should be excluded from enrollment in the study.

          5. Patients must be physically able to tolerate conventional surgical and restorative
             procedures.

          6. Patients with a facial lingual width of at least 5.1mm and inner tooth width of at
             least 6mm.

          7. Patients having a thick gingival biotype (based on the lack of transparency of the
             periodontal probe through the gingival margin while probing the buccal sulcus) will be
             preferred but lack of this characteristic will not disqualify a patient from inclusion
             in this study.

          8. Presence of opposing dentition with a functional occlusion that permits the
             restoration with a non-occluding provisional prosthesis.

          9. Patients who provide a signed informed consent; a patient having implant placement
             surgery will continue participation in the study regardless of whether or not they
             receive restorative treatment according to protocol (protocol deviation)

         10. Patients who agree to be evaluated for each study visit.

         11. Minimum primary stability, insertion torque &gt; 35Ncm (this will be a criteria that is
             met at the time of surgery)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with known systemic diseases such as uncontrolled diabetes, endocrine
             disease, heart disease, immuno-compromised, or mental disorders.

          2. Patients with current use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, bisphosphonates or
             corticosteroid treatments.

          3. Patients with active infection or severe inflammation in the areas intended for
             implant placement.

          4. Prisoners

          5. Patients with a &gt; 10 cigarette per day smoking habit.

          6. Patients with a history of therapeutic radiation to the head or jaw.

          7. Patients in need of bone grafting at the site of the intended implantation site(s).

          8. Patients who are known to be pregnant at the screening visit or planning to become
             pregnant within 6 months of study enrollment.

          9. Patients with evidence of severe parafunctional habits such as bruxing or clenching.

         10. Patients with HIV or Hepatitis infection

         11. Patients who have previously failed implants at the site intended for study implant
             placement

         12. Patients in need of other treatments or surgeries at a site adjacent to the intended
             implantation site

         13. Patients with a history of severe periodontal disease
