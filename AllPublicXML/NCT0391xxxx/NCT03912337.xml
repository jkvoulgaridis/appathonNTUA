  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the effect of erenumab compared to placebo on disability in employed subjects
      with episodic migraine (EM) who have previously failed 1 or more migraine preventive
      treatments.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Migraine prevention continues to be an area of large, unmet medical need, with existing
      therapies often having modest efficacy and poor tolerability. Calcitonin gene-related peptide
      (CGRP) has an important role in the pathophysiology of migraine. Erenumab-aooe is a fully
      human monoclonal antibody that targets the CGRP receptor, and interrupts its downstream
      effects. Erenumab has been approved for the preventive treatment of migraine in adults. The
      present study is a Phase IV trial that will assess the effect of erenumab on disability and
      work productivity in employed subjects with episodic migraine (EM) who have previously failed
      1 or more migraine preventive treatments.
