  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of acute severe pain in pediatric emergencies required a quick and effective
      therapeutic support. Actually in France, only peripheral venous access or oral therapies with
      onset of action are commonly used and only few treatments can be used to manage the acute
      severe pain in children. In June 2017, an intranasal fentanyl use protocol has been
      established in the pediatric emergency department of Mercy hospital-Metz. The intranasal
      fentanyl treatment has proved his effectiveness and safe condition in many countries since
      few years even though has not yet obtained a marketing authorization for use in children in
      France. In view of the information, parental permission was obtained before the intranasal
      administration. The efficacy and surveillance data in all patient records of children who
      benefited this analgesic protocol were retrospectively collected between June 2017 and August
      2018. This retrospective study wants to describe the efficacy and safety of intranasal
      fentanyl on the pediatric emergency department.

    <description>Face Legs Activity Cry Consolability (FLACC) scale or Visual Analog Scale (VAS) FLACC scale involve, as its name implies, 5 items: face, legs, activity, cry and consolability with a score ranging from 0 to 2 each, knowing that 0 represents &quot;no pain&quot;. The sum of each items is from 0 to 10, and 10 constitutes an intense pain.
VAS is a 100-mm long horizontal line with verbal descriptors at each end to express the extremes of the feeling. Patients should mark the point on the line that the best correspond to their symptom severity. The patient's mark indicates pain severity and it's quantified by measuring the distance in millimeter from 0 (0 representes &quot;no pain&quot; and 100 represents &quot;worst possible pain&quot;)</description>

    <description>The Glasgow Coma scale (GCS) describes the level of consciousness. The GCS measures 3 functions: eye opening (with score between 1 and 4), verbal response (with score between 1 and 5) and motor response (with score between 1 and 6). Then, the sum of the scores is calculated. Pediatric brain injury are classified by severity 8 or lower reflecting the most severe, 9-12 being a moderate injury and 13-15 indicating a mild traumatic brain injury.</description>
