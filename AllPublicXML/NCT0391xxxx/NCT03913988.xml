  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators will compare traditional lucid dream induction techniques,
      stress reduction strategies, and sleep hygiene across three study groups: (1) lucid dream and
      stress reduction techniques, and sleep hygiene; (2) lucid dream reduction and sleep hygiene;
      and (3) sleep hygiene. Participants will be first-year occupational therapy students
      embarking upon their first full-time 3-month clinical internship. Enrolled participants will
      be randomized to one of the three groups. The intervention will span 12 weeks and allow for
      participants to learn about and practice lucid dream induction, stress management, and sleep
      hygiene in bi-monthly online group sessions and through daily home exercises.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A significant impediment to completing academic health care programs is student stress level,
      which have been reported to be increasing in the last decade. Many students are not prepared
      for the rigor and intensity of their first clinical internship and experience exacerbations
      of stress and anxiety at this time. There is evidence that lucid dream induction methods have
      effectively alleviated stress and anxiety in veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder,
      and depression in community dwelling adults. Although lucid dream techniques have been used
      to manage anxiety in some populations, it has never been used to help health care students on
      clinical internship experiencing heightened stress levels. In this study, the investigators
      aim to determine whether lucid dream induction techniques combined with stress management and
      sleep hygiene could effectively help students on their first clinical internship to better
      manage stress and anxiety. The investigators hope to gain a greater understanding of which of
      three study conditions can best alleviate stress and anxiety in participants.

    <description>The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) is a 10-item, 6-point, self-report Likert scale (0 = no stress, 5 = high stress) that requires 5 minutes to complete. The scale yields a total score ranging from 0 (no stress) to 50 (highest stress) with scores 25+ indicating a possible stress disorder. The PSS measures stress level in the last month and was intended for use by community-dwelling adults.</description>

    <measure>Lucidity and Consciousness Dream Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Lucidity and Consciousness Dream Scale (LuCiD) is a 28-item, 6-point self-report Likert scale (0 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree) that requires 10 minutes to complete. The scale yields a total score ranging from 0 (no experience of lucid dreaming) to 140 (highest experience of lucid dreaming) with scores 70+ indicating moderate to high lucid dream activity.</description>

    <description>This group will meet for 6 online sessions, every other week, over the 12-week study. Each online session will run for 1 hour. Each of the 6 sessions will consist of the following:
Psychoeducation regarding lucid dreaming, stress reduction, and sleep hygiene
Practice of lucid dreaming induction techniques
Guided visualization
Opportunity for participants to discuss their experience with lucid dreaming induction techniques, adherence to the lucid dreaming home exercise program and tracking log, using their dream diaries, and adherence to the sleep hygiene program and tracking log.</description>

    <description>This group will meet for 2 online group sessions and 4 email communications. The 2 online group sessions will each last 1 hour and occur in weeks 1 and 12. The 4 email communications will occur in weeks 3, 5, 7, and 9 and consist of individual communication between each participant and the PI or co-investigator. Each email communication will require 10 minutes of participants' time.
The control group will be asked to engage in Sleep Hygiene techniques in which they adhere to a recommended protocol and record their adherence in a Sleep Hygiene Tracking Log, requiring 5 minutes per day.
Through the 2 online sessions and the individual email with the investigators, participants will have the opportunity to discuss their experience with adherence to the sleep hygiene program and tracking log. Investigators will help participants trouble shoot problems adhering to the sleep hygiene protocol.</description>
