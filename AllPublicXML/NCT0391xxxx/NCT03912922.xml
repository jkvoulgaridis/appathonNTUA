  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research has shown that replacing sitting time with low intensity physical activity (such as
      slowly walking and standing) has beneficial effects on metabolic health, like insulin
      sensitivity, comparable to improvements after sitting all day in combination with 1h
      streneous exercise.

      The main objective of this study is to investigate the underlying mechanisms responsible for
      improved insulin sensitivity after 4 days of sitting less compared to sitting and exercise in
      healthy obese women. Our secondary objective is to investigate the effects of sitting less on
      cardio metabolic parameters.

    <description>Subjects will follow the exercise regime during four days. Each day will consist of 13 hours sitting, 1 hour walking, 1 hour standing, 1 hour exercise and 8 hours sleeping. The cycle session will be at approximately 60% maximal power. Exact cycling intensity and duration will be calculated to ensure equal total energy expenditure between the sitting less and the exercise regime.</description>
