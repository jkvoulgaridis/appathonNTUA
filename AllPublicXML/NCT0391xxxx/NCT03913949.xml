    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic and
      pharmacodynamic properties of APG-2575 in patients with relapse or refractory chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia and non-hodgkin's lymphoma.

      This is a multi-center, single-agent, open-label, Phase I study of APG-2575. The study
      consists of the dose escalation stage and the dose expansion stage. APG-2575 will be
      administered orally, once daily for consecutive 4 weeks as one cycle. Initially, the start
      dose is 20mg. Single patient cohorts will be evaluated, the dose of APG-2575 will be
      increased in subsequent cohorts, to 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, 400 mg, 600mg and 800mg
      accordingly. If there is any one of the following event is observed, a dose-limiting toxicity
      (DLT), two drug related Grade 2 toxicities or one drug related ≥ Grade 3 toxicity, or
      laboratory or clinical tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), or suspected hypersensitivity reaction
      occur in Cycle 1, the dose escalation will convert to the standard 3+3 design, If ≥ 2/6
      patients develop DLT at any dose level dose escalation will cease and the dose level
      immediately below will be expanded to 6 patients. If ≤ 1/6 patients develop a DLT at the
      highest dose reached this will be declared the MTD. After the MTD/Recommended Phase II Dose
      (RP2D) is defined, a maximum of 40 patients will be treated at that dose level.
