  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intra-operative hemodynamic management in high-risk surgery is a priority for the
      anesthesiologist. The current strategy is based on the continuous measurement of cardiac
      output and its maximization by vascular filling has many limitations: invasiveness,
      measurement difficulties, impaired performance, imperative surgical restriction of filling,
      lack of evaluation of flow rate and metabolic needs. Biomarkers may be able to detect early
      an inadequacy between cardiac output and tissue oxygen requirements, venous saturation with
      oxygen (ScvO2) and arteriovenous difference in partial pressure of carbon dioxide (ΔPCO2) as
      well as the appearance of cellular hypoxia (lactate and arteriovenous difference in partial
      pressure of carbon dioxide/arteriovenous difference in oxygen) (ΔPCO2) / DAVO2). Moreover,
      the medical literature remains poor on the evaluation of these markers in per-operative
      context all the more for ΔPCO2 and ΔPCO2 / DAVO2. It seems interesting to evaluate the
      potential of these tools, in patients with major surgery and at high risk (major hepatectomy,
      oesophagectomy and duodeno-pancreatectomy), to predict the risk of postoperative
      complications, especially since surgery involves a restrictive vascular filling strategy that
      may be potentially deleterious to the patient.

    <description>The objective is to determine if there is an association between the mean intraoperative values and within 24 hours postoperative ΔPCO2 and the occurrence of major post-operative complications at day 28 in high-risk surgery (major hepatectomy, esophagectomy or duodeno- cephalic pancreatectomy)</description>

      It was estimated that there is between 40 and 60 ml of blood taken during this kind of
      intervention and in 24-hour postoperative intervention .

      The completion of the study should result in an increase in blood volume taken from 5 to 10
      mL

        The study concerns patients operated for a high-risk digestive surgery, hospitalized
        postoperatively in intensive care unit (agreed in anesthesia consultation). These patients
        will also need to have an arterial catheter and a central venous line in the superior vena
        cava
