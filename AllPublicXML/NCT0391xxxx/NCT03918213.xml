    <textblock>
      High resolution anorectal manometry (HRAM) normative values are still need to be studied in
      different populations and with the use of different (solid-state and water-perfused) systems.
      No studies on HRAM normative values in a Russian population without signs of functional and
      organic anorectal pathology has been carried out yet.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      High-resolution anorectal manometry (HRAM) is a modern technique used to evaluate the
      function of the rectum and its sphincters. It is intended to measure the resting pressure in
      the anal canal, as well as pressure during voluntary contraction of the external anorectal
      sphincter and pelvic floor muscles and to evaluate reactions to the functional tests.

      Several studies have been performed to evaluate normative metrics of anorectal manometry to
      the moment, but most of them enrolled patients living in the US and countries of the Western
      Europe. Nutritional patterns, ethnic composition of the population and other factors may
      cause the differences in the mormative values of HRAM in different populations. Current study
      is organized to evaluate normative metrics of HRAM in a Russian healthy cohort.

    <intervention_model_description>Normative values for the routine procedure of high-resolution anorectal manometry for Russian population has not been studied yet. Some factors allows to suggest that normative values may differ from those obtained in other countries. This pilot study is aimed to either support the null-hypothesis of the presence of the differences or decline it. It is expected to obtain primary data that could be used for further work and planning of the cohort studies. During the study, healthy volunteers are to be examined with a registered diagnostic tool (i.e. high-resolution anorectal manometry with solid-state catheter). This diagnostic procedure is not intended as one for routine examination, therefore the study type is &quot;interventional&quot;, though no pharmacological intervention or surgery is planned. The estimated sample size sufficient to reach the power of 80%, and type 1 error 0.05 was obtained with single-sample t-test of Statistica10 (StatSoft, USA)</intervention_model_description>

        Criteria of non-inclusion of the data to the analysis:

        - Patients may choose to stop their participation in the study by withdrawal of their
        previously signed consent, that leads to the exclusion of their data from the analysis.

        The researcher should be guided by the following criteria, however, he may at any time
        terminate the patient's participation in the study on the basis of his own clinical
        judgment.

        Cancellation of participation in the study can be carried out on the basis of the following
        events:

          -  Lack of the possibility to insert water-perfused catheter during high-resolution
             anorectal manometry procedure due to anatomical features or psychological state of the
             patient.
