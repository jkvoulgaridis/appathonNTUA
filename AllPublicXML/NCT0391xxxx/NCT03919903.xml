      Dental caries is a chronic slowly progressing localized destruction of dental hard tissues by
      the acidic products formed as result of carbohydrates fermentation by bacteria due to
      disturbance in equilibrium between tooth minerals and plaque products through time. (Trindade
      et al., 2014) It's a worldwide disease affecting all ages both sexes with different
      socioeconomic levels. Dental caries commonly affects children and adversely affects their
      quality of life and so their weight and growth if left untreated (Gokhale and Nuvvula, 2015).
      The environmental factor is a very valuable factor affecting dental caries especially the
      mother and the family as whole, the family habits are directly influencing their children
      (Suma G and Anisha P, 2017). As parents are the primary decision makers for children and
      their first role models, their oral health knowledge, attitude and practice as well as habits
      influence their children (Dikshit et al., 2018).

      There is lack of data about parent's oral health knowledge, attitude and practice and their
      implications on their children in Egypt.

      Acquiring information about oral health knowledge of parents, will help identifying those
      children who are at risk of dental caries consequently it will be possible to offer the
      proper preventive and curative measures for them.

      So, we need to know the effect of oral health knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) of
      parents on caries prevalence of their children.

    <description>Questionnaire is the measurement tool for the primary outcome, questionnaires will be admitted to the parents in the waiting area of the diagnostic clinic of Pediatric dentistry and Dental Public Health Department, Faculty of Dentistry, Cairo University.The questionnaire consists of 28 questions; 10 related to knowledge, 6 to attitude, 8 to practice and 4 general questions. The response will be assessed by using a scoring system, where scores are based on correct answers. For the knowledge and practice items, the right answer is coded as 1 and the wrong answer as 0. For attitude items score 1 indicates a positive attitude, while score 0 indicates a negative attitude. The individual scores will then be summed up to yield a total score. Maximum possible score will be 10, 6 and 8 for KAP respectively. Mean Score of &lt;40% andâ‰¥ 40 % are considered as inadequate and adequate performance respectively. (Dikshit et al., 2018) The questionnaire was translated in Arabic language.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Caries Prevalence in their children</measure>
    <time_frame>one year</time_frame>
    <description>Caries Prevalence in the children will be assessed by clinical examination. Examination will be performed at the diagnostic clinic of the Pediatric dentistry department, Faculty of Dentistry, Cairo University. Patient assessment chart will be used for recording the oral assessment data. The oral assessment of every child will be done by a single operator under good lighting condition using mouth mirror and probe to detect the presence of carious (whether smooth or pits and fissure caries), missed (extracted) and filled teeth (Cypriano et al., 2005).</description>
