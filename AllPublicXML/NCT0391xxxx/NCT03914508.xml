      The pilot study will be a one group treatment program and will be utilized to refine the
      M+BWL program.

      The investigators have developed a new model for the treatment of obesity, which emphasizes
      the role of memory on food consumption in an overweight population.The pilot study will be an
      open label trial of a memory+behavioral weight loss (M+BWL) group treatment. The treatment
      will be administered in 14 group sessions over 16 weeks. The investigators will recruit
      adults with overweight and obesity and will assess them at baseline (prior to treatment),
      during treatment, post-treatment (immediately following treatment), and follow-up (3 months
      after treatment). Assessments will include body mass index (BMI), body composition, and binge
      eating over the course of treatment and follow-up. This study will contribute to the study of
      basic behavioral mechanisms and food intake, could provide a novel model for the treatment of
      obesity, and could inform clinical decision making regarding obesity treatment.

    <intervention_name>Memory + Behavioral Weight Loss</intervention_name>
    <description>BWL and memory enhancement (M+BWL) will be integrated to capitalize on the strengths of both treatments. All participants will be taught general behavioral weight loss skills including to decrease caloric intake and increase physical activity, self-monitoring, goal setting, managing high-risk situations, meal planning, slowing eating, problem solving, social support, cognitive restructuring, lapse and relapse prevention skills, and maintaining weight loss. The proposed M+BWL program provides memory interventions based on the literature, including eating attentively, memory of previous meal, memory skills for planning, effects of diet on memory and the relationship between memory and satiety. The M+BWL program will also utilize experiential learning during the group program such as practicing memory enhanced skills during eating.</description>
