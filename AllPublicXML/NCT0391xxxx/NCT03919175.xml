      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a
      specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.

      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved Umbralisib as a treatment for
      any disease.

      The FDA has approved Rituximab as a treatment option for this disease.

      Umbralisib is an investigational drug which blocks a protein called PI3K. PI3K is a protein
      that plays a role in the way cells grow. In this type of cancer, PI3K is increased and more
      active than usual. This helps the cancer cells to grow and survive. Early clinical trials
      have shown that Umbralisib can kill cancer cells in some patients and cause their tumors to
      shrink.

             composition to umbralisib or rituximab.

          -  Evidence of ongoing systemic bacterial, fungal or viral infection, except localized
             fungal infections of skin or nails.

          -  Evidence of chronic active Hepatitis B (HBV, not including patients with prior
             hepatitis B vaccination; or positive serum Hepatitis B antibody) or chronic active
             Hepatitis C infection (HCV), active cytomegalovirus (CMV), or known history of HIV. If
             HBc antibody is positive, the patient must be evaluated for the presence of HBV DNA
             (by PCR). If HCV antibody is positive, the subject must be evaluated for the presence
             of HCV RNA by PCR. If the patient is CMV IgG or CMV IgM positive, the subject must be
             evaluated for the presence of CMV DNA by PCR. Patients with positive HBc antibody and
             negative HBV DNA via PCR are eligible, but prophylaxis with entecavir or lamivudine is
             recommended. Subjects who are CMV IgG or CMV IgM positive but who are CMV DNA negative
             by PCR are eligible, but antiviral prophylaxis should be considered per institutional
             protocol.

          -  Any severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions or other conditions that could
             affect participation in the study such as:

          -  Symptomatic, or history of documented congestive heart failure (New York Heart
             Association functional classification III-IV [see Appendix: NYHA Classifications])

          -  Significant cardiovascular disease such as uncontrolled or symptomatic arrhythmias,
             CHF, or myocardial infarction within 6 months of enrollment.

          -  Concomitant use of medication known to cause QT prolongation or torsades de pointes
             should be used with caution and at investigator discretion.

          -  Poorly controlled or clinically significant atherosclerotic vascular disease including
             cerebrovascular accident (CVA), transient ischemic attack (TIA), symptomatic
             peripheral arterial disease, angioplasty, cardiac or vascular stenting within 6 months
             of enrollment.

          -  Psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
             requirements

          -  Known history of drug-induced liver injury, alcoholic liver disease, non-alcoholic
             steatohepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, ongoing extrahepatic obstruction caused by
             stones, cirrhosis of the liver.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because rituximab is an agent with known
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the
             mother with rituximab or umbralisib, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the
             mother is treated with rituximab or umbralisib. These potential risks may also apply
             to other agents used in this study.
