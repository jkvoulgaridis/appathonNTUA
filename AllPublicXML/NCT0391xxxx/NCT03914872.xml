        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of a solid tumor

          -  Pathology review demonstrates tumor cellularity of &gt;30% in quantities sufficient to
             complete DNA and RNA library construction

          -  At least 18 years of age.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control, abstinence) prior to study entry and for
             the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is
             pregnant while participating in this study, she must inform her treating physician
             immediately.

          -  Able to understand and willing to sign an IRB approved written informed consent
             document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known allergy, or history of serious adverse reaction to vaccines such as anaphylaxis,
             hives, or respiratory difficulty.

          -  Acute or chronic, clinically significant hematologic, pulmonary, cardiovascular,
             hepatic renal, and/or other functional abnormality that would jeopardize the health
             and safety of the participant as determined by the investigator based on medical
             history, physical examination, laboratory values, and/or diagnostic studies.

          -  History of syncopal or vasovagal episode as determined by medical record and history
             in the 12 month period prior to first vaccination administration.

          -  Individuals in whom a skinfold measurement of the cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue
             for eligible injection sites (left and right medial deltoid region) exceeds 40 mm.

          -  Individuals in whom the ability to observe possible local reactions at the eligible
             injection sites (deltoid region) is, in the opinion of the investigator, unacceptably
             obscured due to a physical condition or permanent body art.

          -  Therapeutic or traumatic metal implant in the skin or muscle of either deltoid region.

          -  Any chronic or active neurologic disorder, including seizures and epilepsy, excluding
             a single febrile seizure as a child.

          -  Current use of any electronic stimulation device, such as cardiac demand pacemakers,
             automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator, nerve stimulators, or deep brain
             stimulators.

          -  Pregnant and/or breastfeeding.
