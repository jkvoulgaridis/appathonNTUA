  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke can be classified as ischemic, i.e. due to the lack of blood flow, and haemorrhagic,
      caused by bleeding. Stroke results in focal signs and symptoms, with a devastating impact on
      a patient and his family. Although robotic rehabilitation is very useful in improving motor
      function, there is no a clear evidence on its role in improving cognitive abilities, which
      are often compromised in stroke patients.

      To this end, the investigators designed a randomized controlled experimental study on stroke
      patients, with the aim of evaluating the effects of robotic neurorehabilitation using Lokomat
      with and without virtual reality on cognitive functioning in stroke patients, compared to
      traditional therapy.

    <description>The patients included will be divided into three groups of 30 patients each. In this group patients will undergo a rehabilitation training with the Lokomat Pro, in which the exoskeleton device is equipped with a VR screen. The rehabilitation protocol consists of 24 training sessions (3 sessions per week, for 8 weeks, each session lasting about 45 minutes). Lokomat will be used to improve gait, whereas motor and cognitive function will be normally trained by using conventional neurorehabilitation. Patients will be evaluated at baseline (T0), immediately (T1) and after 3.month (T2) of treatment.</description>

    <description>The patients included will be divided into three groups of 30 patients each. In this group patients will undergo a rehabilitation training with the Lokomat-Nanos, in which the exoskeleton device is equipped with a screen with a visual feedback (but not virtual reality). The rehabilitation protocol consists of 24 training sessions (3 sessions per week, for 8 weeks, each session lasting about 45 minutes). The Lokomat-Nanos will be used to improve gait, whereas motor and cognitive function will be normally trained by using conventional neurorehabilitation. Patients will be evaluated at baseline (T0), immediately (T1) and after 3.month (T2) of treatement.</description>

    <description>The patients included will be divided into three groups of 30 patients each. In this group patients will undergo a conventional gait rehabilitation. The rehabilitation protocol consists of 24 training sessions (3 sessions per week, for 8 weeks, each session lasting about 45 minutes). Beside conventional overground training for gait, motor and cognitive function will be normally trained by using conventional neurorehabilitation. Patients will be evaluated at baseline (T0), immediately (T1) and after 3.month (T2) of treatement.</description>
