    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase 1b/2 study to determine the composite response rate
      of BXCL701 administered orally and daily, combined with PEMBRO, in patients with SCNC. The
      study will also assess other efficacy parameters, such as rPFS, PSA PFS, OS and DOR, as well
      as the safety of the combined treatment. The study will consist of 2 stages:

        1. Lead-in Stage - in which the safety and tolerability of the combination of BXCL701
           administered once daily (QD) on Days 1 to 14 of a 21-day cycle plus PEMBRO 200 mg
           administered intravenously (IV) on Day 1 of every 21 days will be assessed and confirmed
           in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). In Cohort 1,
           the initial dose level of BXCL701 will be 0.4 mg; if there are no safety concerns, this
           will be escalated to a total daily dose of 0.6 mg.

        2. Efficacy Stage (Simon 2-Stage) - in which patients with SCNC will be treated with
           BXCL701 combined with PEMBRO.

      Lead-in Stage:

      Patients will be observed for dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) during Cycle 1. Three patients
      will be treated initially with 0.4 mg BXCL701 plus PEMBRO:

        -  If there are no DLTs in Cycle 1, the dose of BXCL701 will be escalated to a total daily
           dose of 0.6 mg in the next cohort of 3 patients.

        -  If ≥1 of the 3 original patients has a DLT in Cycle 1, after a discussion between the
           sponsor and the investigator, either 3 patients (if 1 patient experiences a DLT) or 6 to
           9 patients (if 2 or 3 patients experiences a DLT) will be added at the 0.4 mg BXCL701
           dose level. For this expanded 0.4 mg cohort:

             -  If less than one-third of the patients experience a DLT, consideration will be
                given to dose escalation to 0.6 mg BXCL701 plus PEMBRO

             -  If one-third of the patients experience a DLT, the Efficacy Stage can commence

             -  If more than one-third of the patients experience a DLT, a discussion will be held
                between the investigators and sponsors as to how to proceed.

      Efficacy Stage:

      After assessment of the safety and confirmation of the BXCL701/PEMBRO dose schedule (i.e.,
      either 0.6 mg or 0.4 mg BXCL701) to be used in the subsequent stage, the Efficacy Stage will
      begin. Eligible SCNC patients will receive BXCL701 QD on Days 1 to 14 of a 21-day cycle plus
      PEMBRO 200 mg administered IV on Day 1 every 21 days.

    <description>BXCL701 tablets dosage strengths include 0.2 mg and 0.05 mg tablets for oral administration.
The starting dose regimen of BXCL701 is 0.4 mg QD on Days 1-14 every 21 days. The BXCL701 dose regimen for any patient depends on the cohort enrolled during the Lead-in Stage. Additional dosing schedules 0.6 mg QD may also be evaluated during the Lead-in Stage.
On days when PD studies are being performed, BXCL701 should be administered at the study center and should be administered at approx. the same time of day on each treatment day in the cycle. In cycles in which PD are not evaluated, BXCL701 also should be administered at approx. the same time of day on each treatment day.
Patients may continue to receive study treatment until the development of discontinuation criterion are met, or closure of the study by the sponsor; no maximum duration of therapy has been set.
The PEMBRO dose will be 200 mg, administered as an IV infusion over 30 mins. on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle.</description>

             study entry.

          2. Patient has received external-beam radiation or another systemic anticancer therapy
             within 14 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter, prior to study treatment.

          3. Patient has received treatment with an investigational systemic anticancer agent
             within 14 days prior to study drug administration.

          4. Patient has received prior treatment with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-programmed
             death ligand 2 (PD-L2) agent or with an agent directed to another co-inhibitory T-cell
             receptor (e.g., cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 [CTLA-4], OX-40, CD137) or
             requires concomitant treatment with DPP4 inhibitors.

          5. Patient has an additional active malignancy that may confound the assessment of the
             study endpoints. If the patient has a past cancer history (active malignancy within 2
             years prior to study entry) with substantial potential for recurrence, this must be
             discussed with the sponsor before study entry. Patients with the following concomitant
             neoplastic diagnoses are eligible: non-melanoma skin cancer and carcinomas in situ
             (including transitional cell carcinoma, anal carcinoma, and melanoma in situ).

          6. Patient has clinically significant cardiovascular disease (e.g., uncontrolled or any
             New York Heart Association Class 3 or 4 congestive heart failure, uncontrolled angina,
             history of myocardial infarction, unstable angina or stroke within 6 months prior to
             study entry, uncontrolled hypertension or clinically significant arrhythmias not
             controlled by medication).

          7. QT interval corrected for heart rate using Bazett's formula (QTcB) &gt;480 msec at
             Screening.

          8. Patient has uncontrolled, clinically significant pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic
             obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary hypertension) that in the opinion of the
             investigator would put the patient at significant risk for pulmonary complications
             during the study.

          9. Patient has brain or leptomeningeal metastases that are symptomatic and progressive on
             imaging. Patients with a history of central nervous system (CNS) metastases must have
             received appropriate treatment. Central nervous system imaging is not required prior
             to study entry unless there is a history of CNS involvement or clinical suspicion of
             CNS involvement. Imaging of patients with a prior history of CNS metastases should be
             compared to prior imaging to discern disease progression.

         10. Patient has an active autoimmune disease or Grade ≥3 pneumonitis that has required
             systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e., with use of disease modifying agents,
             corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine,
             insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary
             insufficiency) or treatment with drugs (e.g., neomercazol, carbimazole) that function
             to decrease the generation of thyroid hormone by a hyperfunctioning thyroid gland
             (e.g., in Graves' disease) is not considered a form of systemic treatment of an
             autoimmune disease.

         11. Patient has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy
             at a prednisone equivalent dose of &gt;10 mg daily for at least 1 week or other form of
             immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1).

         12. Patient has uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to,
             uncontrolled infection, disseminated intravascular coagulation, or psychiatric
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.

         13. Patient has known positive status for human immunodeficiency virus, active or chronic
             Hepatitis B, or Hepatitis C. Screening is not required.

         14. Patient has any medical condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, places
             the patient at an unacceptably high risk for toxicity.
