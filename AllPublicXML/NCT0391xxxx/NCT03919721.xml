  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study funded by a Phase II SBIR to build and test the feasibility of a new software
      prototype for delivering evidence-based behavioral therapy treatment for autism. The
      software, called Motivity.net, will be used by behavioral therapy provider groups across the
      country to manage the intensive data collection and analysis workflow associated with Applied
      Behavioral Analysis (ABA) and related therapies, which are becoming standard-of-care
      treatment for children with autism.

      This is a study funded by a Phase II SBIR to build and test the feasibility of a new software
      prototype for delivering evidence-based behavioral therapy treatment for autism. The
      software, called Motivity.net, will be used by behavioral therapy provider groups across the
      country to manage the intensive data collection and analysis workflow associated with Applied
      Behavioral Analysis (ABA) and related therapies, which are becoming standard-of-care
      treatment for children with autism. Experiad will conduct an 8-week within-subject pilot
      study of 6 BCBAs, 12 BTs and 12 children to answer product research questions about
      Motivity's ability to perform its intended functions, measuring the degree to which it allows
      interventionists to encode their models, achieve more efficient program management, improve
      communication, and increase responsiveness to a child's progress. Experiad will also use
      descriptive statistics to provide preliminary insight into the potential impact of the system
      on a child's performance in their ABA therapy.

Each child will have 15-20 active therapy programs, each of which will be randomly assigned to one of two sets: the experimental (Motivity-enabled) or control (therapy-as-usual). For the control set, BTs will use their existing methods, either paper-based or a competitor's data collection system. Tutors will use Motivity for 8 weeks in therapy under supervision in a single case-study pilot.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Children are receiving Applied Behavioral Analysis therapy to treat their autism. Therapy is comprised of 15-20 discrete programs that are intended to shape specific behaviors. Tutors collect data on child's performance towards goals. For each child, some of the programs will be tracked with paper data collection methods, others will use electronic data collection. This study is to test the usefulness of the electronic data collection system to replace paper in existing interventions.</description>
