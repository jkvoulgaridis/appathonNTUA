  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Premature children are particularly vulnerable in terms of infection and vaccinated in a
      specific, reinforced vaccination schedule. However, the beginning of the vaccination of these
      children is often postponed and the vaccination schedule little followed.Concerning the
      vaccination of premature children, the national recommendations of the High Council of Public
      Health (HCSP) are different from those of the French experts in pediatric vaccinology. The
      HCSP recommends a vaccination schedule beginning at the age of 8 weeks postnatal, including,
      as for full-term infants, two injections at 2-month intervals of vaccine against diphtheria,
      tetanus, poliomyelitis, haemophilus influenzae B type, whooping cough and hepatitis B.
      Anti-pneumococcal vaccination is recommended at 2, 3 and 4 months of life.

      The French experts of the Infectious Pediatric Pathology Group (GPIP) of the French Pediatric
      Society recommend a primary vaccination against whooping cough, diphtheria, tetanus,
      poliomyelitis, Haemophilus Influenzae B (DTPCoqHIB) and hepatitis B at 2, 3 and 4 months for
      children born before 33 weeks of amenorrhea (WA), and at 2 and 4 months for those born
      between 33 and 36 weeks + 6 days. Primary anti-pneumococcal vaccination is recommended at 2,
      3 and 4 months for all children born prematurely before 37WA.

      On the other hand, the cocooning vaccination of the parents against whooping cough is
      recommended in case of birth at term as of premature birth. This cocooning strategy has not
      been sufficiently applied, justifying a recall in 2008 for all adults who have not received
      pertussis vaccination during the last ten years.

      The investigators seek to evaluate the follow-up of the recommended vaccination schedule of
      premature children leaving Angers University Hospital and the reasons associated with the
      non-monitoring of the calendar in order to identify possible lines of work to improve
      immunization compliance.
