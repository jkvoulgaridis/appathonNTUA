    <textblock>
      This study evaluates if dynamic arterial elastance measured before general anesthesia
      induction can predict the occurrence of hypotension due to general anesthesia induction.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As general anesthetics may be responsible for vasodilation and cardiac depression, arterial
      hypotension after induction of general anesthesia is a common event and may contribute to an
      adverse outcome. Dynamic arterial elastance has been proposed as a functional parameter of
      arterial tone and studies showed that it was able to predict pressure response to fluid
      administration in fluid-responsive patients and the amount of mean arterial pressure
      riduction as a conseguence of noradrenaline dose reduction in critically ill patients.

    <description>Dynamic arterial elastance (Eadyn) will be recorded at baseline before induction of general anesthesia. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) will be recorded at baseline and continuously until tracheal intubation. The lowest value of MAP will be considered to define hypotension occurrence.</description>
