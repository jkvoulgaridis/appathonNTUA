      Was performed a longitudinal, study with twenty patients recruited for the bariatric surgery
      group and 20 for clinical treatment. The analysis of HRV and endothelial function were
      performed through peripheral arterial tonometry, in patients with obesity before and after
      three months of bariatric surgery. Were also analyzed GLP-1, insulin and glucose at fast, and
      30 and 60 minutes. The results were compared in parallel with a control group with clinical
      treatment for obesity.

      To assess the pathophysiological mechanisms that leads the benefits in cardiovascular risk
      after bariatric surgery, through the autonomic nervous system and endothelial function, was
      performed a longitudinal, study with twenty patients recruited for the bariatric surgery
      group and 20 for clinical treatment.

      The analysis of HRV and endothelial function were performed through peripheral arterial
      tonometry, in patients with obesity before and after three months of bariatric surgery.
