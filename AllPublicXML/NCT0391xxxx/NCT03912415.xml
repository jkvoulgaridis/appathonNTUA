  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, Phase 3 study of efficacy and safety of
      BCD-100 plus platinum-based chemotherapy with and without bevacizumab versus placebo plus
      platinum-based chemotherapy with and without bevacizumab

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either Test Regimen or Comparator
      Regimen as the first-line treatment for advanced cervical cancer. Subjects will receive study
      therapy Q3W until progression of the disease or signs of unacceptable toxicity. In the
      absence of dose-limiting toxicity chemotherapy should be continued for at least 6 cycles,
      then, upon Investigator's decision and/or subjects' wish, the use of chemotherapy can be
      stopped while maintenance therapy with BCD-100/Placebo with or without bevacizumab (depending
      on initial therapy choice) continues until disease progression.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Signing an IRB/EC-approved informed consent

          2. Females ≥ 18 years of age on day of signing informed consent

          3. Histologically confirmed squamous carcinoma of the cervix

          4. Progressing thru or recurrent disease treated for curative intent or primary
             metastatic cervical cancer stage FIGO IVB

          5. Agreement to newly obtained core or excisional biopsy of a tumor lesion not previously
             irradiated for determination of PD-L1 status prior to randomization (using archival
             biopsy material is only acceptable in subjects in whom obtaining a new sample is
             contraindicated)

          6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1

          7. For women of childbearing potential: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from
             heterosexual intercourse) or to use a contraceptive method with a failure rate of &lt; 1%
             per year from the moment of signing informed consent, during the treatment period and
             at least 6 months after administration of the last dose of study drug. A woman is
             considered to be of childbearing potential if she is postmenarcheal, has not reached a
             postmenopausal state (≥ 12 continuous months of amenorrhea with no identified cause
             other than menopause), and has not undergone surgical sterilization (removal of
             ovaries, fallopian tubes, and/or uterus). Examples of contraceptive methods with a
             failure rate of &lt; 1% per year include but are not limited to bilateral tubal ligation
             and/or occlusion, male sterilization, and intrauterine devices. The reliability of
             sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical
             study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g.,
             calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) is not acceptable method
             of contraception.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Indications for potentially curative treatment (surgery or radiation therapy)

          2. Prior systemic treatment for recurrent, secondarily progressive or initially
             metastatic disease

          3. Previous use of chemotherapy other than initial treatment for curative intent (e.g.
             chemotherapy used concurrently with radiation therapy, neoadjuvant or consolidation
             chemotherapy cycles before radiotherapy or 2 chemotherapy cycles after completion of
             chemoradiotherapy are allowed)

          4. Contraindications to cisplatin, carboplatin, paclitaxel, or bevacizumab

          5. Known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis.
             Participants with known brain metastases may participate provided that the brain
             metastases have been previously treated with radiotherapy or surgery only and are
             radiographically stable

          6. Concomitant diseases or conditions which pose a risk of AE development during study
             treatment:

               1. uncontrolled hypertension, defined as systolic &gt; 150 mm Hg or diastolic &gt; 90 mm
                  Hg;

               2. stable angina functional class III-IV;

               3. unstable angina or myocardial infarction less than 6 months prior to
                  randomization;

               4. NYHA Grade III-IV congestive heart failure;

               5. serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication (subjects with asymptomatic

               6. atopic asthma, Stage III-IV COPD, angioedema;

               7. severe respiratory failure;

               8. any other diseases which pose unacceptable risk of AE development during study
                  treatment in Investigator's opinion.

          7. Active or known or suspected autoimmune disease (subjects with Type 1 diabetes
             mellitus, hypothyroidism only requiring hormone replacement, or skin disorders
             (vitiligo, psoriasis, or alopecia) not requiring systemic treatment are permitted to
             enroll).

          8. Condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids or other
             immunosuppressive medications within 14 days prior to randomization.

         12. Bilirubin ≥ 1.5 x UNL (excluding Gilbert's syndrome if bilirubin &lt; 50 µmol/l) or

             alkaline phosphatase ≥ 2.5 x UNL.

         13. Chemotherapy or radiation therapy less than 28 days prior to randomization.

         14. Major surgery procedure less than 28 days prior to randomization.

         15. Previous use of PD-1/PD-L1/PD-L2 agent or another agent directed to stimulatory or
             co-inhibitory T-cell receptor (e.g. CTLA-4, OX 40, CD137).

         16. Previous use of VEGF/VEGFR inhibitors, including bevacizumab, ramucirumab, aflibercept
             and tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

         17. Prior invasive malignancy with any evidence of disease within the last 3 years.
             Subjects with non-melanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ (e.g. breast cancer) who
             have undergone potentially curative therapy are not excluded.

         25. Significant adverse events (AE) of previous therapy excluding chronic and/or
             irreversible events which cannot affect study drug safety evaluation (e.g. alopecia)

         26. Known hypersensitivity or allergy to paclitaxel, cisplatin, carboplatin, bevacizumab,
             BCD-100 or any of their excipients. Known hypersensitivity or allergy to drugs derived
