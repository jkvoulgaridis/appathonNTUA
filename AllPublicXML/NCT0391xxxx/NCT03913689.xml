    <textblock>
      This Registry study will prospectively evaluate the long-term effectiveness, safety, and
      tolerability of the StimRouter Neuromodulation System, along with evaluating the technical
      performance of StimRouter, surgical outcomes, health-related quality of life, concomitant
      medical use, and subject's impression of improvement.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-label, long-term, multi-center registry. Up to 1000 subjects with
      chronic pain related to peripheral nerve will be enrolled by approximately 30 qualified
      sites. Subjects who are eligible for a StimRouter will be enrolled in order to evaluate the
      subject's experience at pre-implant, the implant, and post-implant for up to 60 months. Based
      on routine care, subjects will be seen at day of implant, within 2 weeks post-implant, 1
      month post-implant, 3 months post-implant, 6 months post-implant, 12 months post-implant, and
      annually thereafter for the duration of the study. Specific assessments will be completed by
      the subject and clinician at these visits.

    <description>The Numeric Pain Rating Scale is a unidimensional measure of pain intensity in adults including those with chronic pain in which the respondent selects a whole number (0-10) that best reflects the intensity of his/her pain, with 0 being no pain and 10 being the worst possible pain. The scale is shown as a horizontal bar or line to respondents. It will be administered at each study visit to examine changes in subjects' pain over time.</description>

    <description>Patient function will be assessed at each follow-up visit using the 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) and consists of eight scaled scores which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section, and include vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning, and mental health. In these scales, the lower the score, the more disability. The higher the score, the less disability. Each scale score is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight.</description>
