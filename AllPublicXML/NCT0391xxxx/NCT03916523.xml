  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is the most common cause of respiratory failure
      in the first few days in life. It is characterized by the tendency of alveoli and terminal
      bronchioles to collapse due to the lack of surfactant. RDS is inversely related to
      gestational age and remains a dominant clinical problem encountered among preterm infants.

      The reduction in tidal volume secondary to alveolar collapse may result in alveolar
      derecruitment, cyclic opening and closing of atelectatic alveoli and distal small airways
      leading to inflammation and lung injury). On the other hand, the use of high positive end
      expiratory pressure (PEEP) may be associated with excessive lung parenchyma strain and
      unfavorable hemodynamic effects. Therefore, lung recruitment maneuvers have been proposed and
      used to open collapsed lung while managing with low pressure PEEP. However, the best
      recruitment maneuver technique is currently unknown.

      Proinflammatory cytokines are synthesized by alveolar macrophages, type II pneumocytes and
      other local pulmonary cells causing inflammation that starts a cascade leading to lung
      injury. Nevertheless, they are released systemically and can lead to injury of other organs.

      This study aims to measure inflammatory cytokines in the serum of premature infants who
      receive and do not receive sustained lung inflation. The study hypothesis is that, in
      premature infants supported with CPAP, the use of sustained inflation is associated with
      decreased inflammatory biomarkers and improved respiratory outcomes.

      The study includes infants with gestational age of 28-24 weeks during the first 6 hours of
      life who will be randomly assigned to either receive (or do not receive) sustained
      inflations. Serum concentrations of cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, IL-1β and TNF-α) will be measured
      at enrollment and at 96 hours. The primary outcome of this study will be the change in serum
      cytokine concentrations after intervention in both groups. Clinical respiratory outcomes will
      be monitored.
