  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of long needle and short needle
      in the treatment of internal hemorrhoids and rectal prolapse through CAES (Cap-assisted
      endoscopic sclerotherapy).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Traditional endoscopic sclerotherapy for internal hemorrhoids require retroflection of the
      endoscope. Retroflection of the endoscope has blind areas and affects the precise operation.
      And, short-needle injection can easily lead to artificial ulcer and secondary bleeding. CAES
      is a new, minimally invasive endoscopic technique for the treatment of internal hemorrhoids
      and rectal prolapse. CAES was performed based on the requirement of the cap, endoscope,
      disposable endoscopic long injection needle, enough insufflated air and sclerosing agent. It
      can accurately control the injection angle, direction and depth under direct vision, and
      avoid iatrogenic injury caused by ectopic injection to the greatest possible extent. To
      investigate the effect of long needle and short needle on the outcome of CAES, participants
      with internal hemorrhoids and rectal prolapse were randomly assigned to a long needle group
      and a short needle group using a prospective, randomized, controlled study at multiple
      centers in China. The efficacy, adverse events and satisfaction of the two groups were
      observed.

    <description>Recurrence was defined as the recurrence of bleeding, prolapse and other symptoms in patients from 3 days to 24 weeks after CAES or seeking other non-surgical treatment and surgical treatment of internal hemorrhoids again within 24 weeks (except drug conservative treatment).</description>

    <measure>Symptoms of anal pain</measure>
    <time_frame>1day, 7days, 14days and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>NRS pain digital rating scale was adopted, that is, 0-10 was used to represent different degrees of pain, 0 was painless, and 10 was severe pain. 0 painless, 1-3 mild pain (pain does not affect sleep), 4-6 moderate pain, 7-9 severe pain (inability to fall asleep or waking up during sleep), 10 severe pain.</description>
