  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-blind, randomized, five (5)-period, cross-over study in healthy adult
      participants. A group of approximately 10 participants will assess the sensory attributes
      (taste and palatability) of 4 different formulations of an investigational product
      (PF-06651600 active pharmaceutical ingredient) and Bitrex (Registered) positive control in a
      specified sequence in 1 day.
