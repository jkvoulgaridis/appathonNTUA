  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to detect changes in the dopamine system in the brain of
      patients with schizophrenia, especially when pretreated with antipsychotic medication. Here,
      the investigators want to find out whether the treatment with these drugs can cause permanent
      changes in docking points (receptors) of dopamine in the brain. It will be examined whether
      number and response of dopamine receptors is altered, which are associated with the onset of
      psychotic symptoms. For this purpose, a single PET/MR measurement will be performed in all
      participants. In total 140 volunteers, consisting of 30 healthy volunteers, 20 first-episode,
      drug-naive patients with schizophrenia and 90 pretreated patients with schizophrenia will be
      included over a time period of three years. In addition, the influence of nicotine
      consumption on dopamine receptors will be invesitgated by comparing data from smoking and
      non-smoking patients. In clinical practice, an elevation of dopamine action caused by
      alterations in receptors in the brain is of most importance. This may be the reason why the
      treatment with antipsychotic agents does not work in some patients. In addition, a permanent
      elevation of dopamine action is associated with permanent brain alterations by these drugs.
      The result can contribute to work out valuable indications, whether it makes sense to
      continue a long term therapy with antipsychotic drugs in a patient. But also the in-depth
      understanding of the impact of nicotine on the course of therapy can help to open up
      possibilities for improved drug treatment.

      This project will study for the first time in humans, whether long-term treatment with
      antipsychotic agents, representing nowadays gold standard for patients with schizophrenia,
      may lead to an up regulation of dopamine D2-like receptors and associated, a supersensitivity
      of these receptors. The detection of such changes and the study of influencing factors (in
      particular smoking and type of medication) are most important for the understanding of
      relapse risks, development of treatment resistance and the risks for motor complications of
      antipsychotic pharmacotherapy. This monocentric, controlled study will include 140
      participants over a time period of three years. 30 healthy volunteers, 20 first-episode,
      drug-naive patients with schizophrenia and 90 pretreated patients with schizophrenia will
      undergo a single PET/MR measurement.
