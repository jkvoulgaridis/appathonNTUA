  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study intends to explore a new therapy to reduce the incidence of atrial fibrillation in
      thoracic patient who receive video-assisted thoracoscopic lobectomy .The results of the study
      are to assess the effects of this new intervention on the incidence，duration of atrial
      fibrillation and other complications including postoperative delirium after video-assisted
      thoracoscopic lobectomy .And reducing the burden of POAF on patients and their families,
      hospitals and public resources.

The total score on the QoR40 ranges from 40 (poorest quality of recovery) to 200 (best quality of recovery).</description>
