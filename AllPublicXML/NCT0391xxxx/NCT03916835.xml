  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to measure the efficacy of music during a painful procedure in
      pediatric intensive care unit.

      Music therapy has real effects on the pain level already proven in adults units. Our
      objective is to apply this technic to children. The investigators will evaluate this technic
      during cleaning care which is daily procedure for each stable patient and wich may be painful
      in this population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pediatric intensive care units may be anxious places. A lot of painful and stressful
      procedures are done every day. A simple care such as a simple cleaning care may become
      painful or uncomfortable.

      Usually those situation require the use of painkillers. For several years, new approaches are
      used in order to decrease the pain level without medication such as hypnosis or music
      therapy. Music therapy proved efficacy to reduce pain in different procedures and is
      currently used in adult intensive care units in order to decrease anxiety and pain.

      One specific program, &quot;Music Care&quot; is based on a &quot;U sequence&quot; which use tempo and rhythm
      variations following the U scheme, to relax patients.

      This program will be evaluated in our department and the investigators will study the effects
      on the pain level during a cleaning care .

      The patients will be evaluated during two consecutive cleaning cares. One with and the other
      without music therapy. The investigators will compare the variation of the FLACC scores
      (before and during cleaning care ) to show a difference between both methods. The order (with
      or without) will be randomized. The patient will be his one control.
