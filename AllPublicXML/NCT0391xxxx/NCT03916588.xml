    <textblock>
      To investigate the efficacy of an individualized treatment plan delivered through remote
      technology along with enhanced staff training within a supervised memory unit on patient
      outcome, care quality, health care utilization/cost, and staff burden. Remote monitoring of
      activity data will also be explored.
