  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Building upon the clinical experience of the investigators with the magnetic resonance
      (MR)-guided radiation therapy system and applying principals of hypofractionation toward the
      current treatment paradigm of concurrent chemoradiation and consolidation immunotherapy for
      locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), this prospective, single-arm Phase II
      clinical trial with safety lead-in will test the feasibility and outcomes of this approach.

    <description>The first 6 patients enrolled on study will comprise the Safety Lead-In cohort and will be closely monitored for toxicity related specifically to the experimental chemoradiation portion of the study treatment. After these 6 patients have been enrolled, accrual will temporarily be suspended for a minimum of 6 months after completion of chemoradiation to allow for the evaluation of adverse events.
Patients will receive concurrent chemoradiation over the course of 3 weeks (15 fractions of radiation with online adaptive treatment planning at fractions 6, 9, and 12 and weekly carboplatin + paclitaxel). Four to 6 weeks after the end of chemoradiation, durvalumab immunotherapy will administered every two weeks for up to 12 months.</description>

             granulomatosis, Sjögren's syndrome, Guillain-Barré syndrome, multiple sclerosis,
             autoimmune thyroid disease, vasculitis, or glomerulonephritis. Specific instances of
             autoimmune disease are eligible and allowed on study, as below:

                  steroids, with no acute exacerbations within the last 12 months (requiring
                  psoralen, ultraviolet A radiation, methotrexate, retinoids, biologic agents, oral
                  calcineurin inhibitors, high potency or oral steroids

             organizing pneumonia (i.e., bronchiolitis obliterans, cryptogenic organizing
             pneumonia, etc.), or evidence of active pneumonitis on screening chest CT scan.

          -  Chronic oral steroid use (greater than prednisone 10 mg orally once daily, or its
             equivalent) for any indication.
