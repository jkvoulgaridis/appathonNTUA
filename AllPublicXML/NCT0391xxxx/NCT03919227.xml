  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) has been considered as the first-line choice for the
      management of ＜20mm kidney stones. Insertion of a ureteral access sheath (UAS) before RIRS
      surgery is currently accepted as an effective method to improve the effectiveness of surgery,
      but can be accompanied by serious complications. In long-term clinical practice, the
      investigators has found that different Bladder Filling Degree was accompanied by different
      Resistance During UAS Insertion Procedure in RIRS, which leads to the difference in success
      rate of UAS insertion.The investigator aims to perform a prospective and randomized
      controlled trial comparing the success rate of UAS insertion procedure under different
      bladder filling degree,and discuss the relationship between insertion resistance and ureter
      injury.

      Upper urinary calculi is a common disease that endangers human health, Retrograde intrarenal
      surgery (RIRS) has been considered as the first-line choice for the management of ＜20mm
      kidney stones. Insertion of a ureteral access sheath (UAS) before RIRS surgery is currently
      accepted as an effective method to improve the effectiveness of surgery, for UAS can drain
      irrigation to reduce renal pelvic pressure and maintain vision clear. But incorrect way to
      insert UAS can be accompanied by serious complications. For instance, If the ureter was not
      dilated by DJ stent before RIRS surgery, or ureter was relatively narrow, the insertion of
      UAS would encounter great resistance. Sometimes the ureter was violently pushed into UAS, it
      might cause ureteral perforation or avulsion. As for how to insert UAS correctly, there is no
      unified international standard at present. Different surgeons have different experience. In
      long-term clinical practice, the investigators has found that different Bladder Filling
      Degree was accompanied by different Resistance During UAS Insertion Procedure in RIRS, which
      leads to the difference in success rate of UAS insertion. In addition, there seems to be some
      relationship between the resistance of UAS insertion and the ureter injury in surgery.
      Therefore, the investigator aims to perform a prospective and randomized controlled trial
      comparing the success rate of UAS insertion procedure under different bladder filling degree,
      and discuss the relationship between insertion resistance and ureter injury.

    <description>Primary insertion of a UAS is not always successful. The ideal position of the UAS is with its distal extremity just below the ureteric-pelvic junction (UPJ). Insertion failure is defined as UAS cross the upj or do not reach the proximal ureter or the surgeon's decision to resign UAS insertion due to high resistance to the retrograde progression of the UAS along the urinary tract.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ureteral lesion grade</measure>
    <time_frame>intraoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>Base on post-ureteroscopic lesion scale (PULS), reported by Traxer O and Thomas A in 2013. UAS related ureteral injuries were divided into 5 grades according to ureteral wall anatomy. Grade 0 means no lesion found or only mucosal petechiae. Grade 1 means ureteral mucosal erosion without smooth muscle injury. Both Grade 0 and Grade 1 are considered as low-level injuries. Grade 2 means ureteral wall injury, including mucosa and smooth muscle, with adventitial preservation (periureteral fat not seen). Grade 3 means ureteral injury indicated ureteral perforation involving the full thickness of the ureteral wall, including the adventitia. Grade 4 means injury corresponded to total ureteral avulsion with complete rupture of ureteral continuity. Grade 2, 3 and 4 are high-level injuries.</description>
