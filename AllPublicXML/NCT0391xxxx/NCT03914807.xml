  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cow's milk is a dietary staple for children in North America. Though clinical guidelines
      suggest children transition from whole (3.25% fat) milk to reduced (1%) fat milk at age 2
      years, recent epidemiological evidence supports a link between whole milk consumption and
      lower adiposity in children. The purpose of this trial is to determine which milk fat
      recommendation minimizes excess adiposity and optimizes child nutrition and development.
      CoMFORT will be a parallel group randomized controlled trial among children aged 2 to 4 years
      participating in the TARGet Kids! practice-based research network. Children will be
      randomized to receive one of two usual care nutritional recommendations: 1) a recommendation
      to consume whole milk, or 2) a recommendation to consume reduced (1%) fat milk. The primary
      outcome is Body Mass Index z-score (zBMI); secondary outcomes will be cognitive development
      (using the Ages and Stages Questionnaire), vitamin D stores (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D),
      cardiometabolic health (glucose, hsCRP, non-HDL, LDL, triglyceride, HDL and total
      cholesterol, insulin, and diastolic and systolic blood pressure) and sugar sweetened beverage
      intake (measured by 24-hour dietary recall). Outcomes will be measured 24 months
      post-randomization and compared using ANCOVA, adjusting for baseline measures. This trial
      will contribute to nutrition policy for children in effort to reduce childhood obesity using
      a simple, inexpensive and scalable cow's milk fat intervention.
