      Aim: To investigate the effect of physician-initiated, medication reviews in geriatric
      patients on self-reported health-related quality of life, admissions and mortality.

      Trial design: Randomized trial with polypharmacy intervention in addition to standard
      geriatric care. After referral to the geriatric outpatient clinic (but before the first
      visit), a medical secretary screens the patient's medication on the electronic medication
      list. If the patient is taking more than 8 different drugs, the patient is randomized to
      either standard geriatric care or standard geriatric care plus polypharmacy intervention.
      During the first visit, the patient is informed of the project and asked for written,
      informed consent. If given, we collect data regarding the patient's medication and any
      medication changes during the intervention, demographics, frailty (FRAIL Scale), Charlson
      Comorbidity Index, self-reported history of falls, recent admissions, self-reported,
      health-related quality of life (EQ-5D-5L) and death. Data is collected at baseline, 4 months
      follow-up and 13 months follow-up.

      Participants: All randomized, polymedicated (&gt;8 drugs) patients referred to the geriatric
      outpatient clinic.

      Outcomes: The primary outcome is the between-group difference in the EQ-5D-5L difference
      (self-reported, health-related quality of life) between baseline and 13 month follow-up.

      The secondary outcomes are number of medications, number of successful medication
      discontinuations, number of admissions and visits to the emergency department, self-reported
      low-energy falls, and death.

    <intervention_model_description>Randomized, parallel clinical trial with two arms. The participants are randomized to usual care or usual care plus polypharmacy intervention when they are referred to the geriatric outpatient clinic before the first visit. They stay in the assigned group until end of trial (after 13 months follow-up). Randomization is performed by the medical secretaries in the outpatient clinic in REDCap's randomization module and randomization is stratified on gender, age group (65-70 years, 71-80 years, &gt;80 years) and number of drugs (9-11 drugs, 12-16 drugs, &gt;16 drugs).</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Comparison of changes in EQ5D-5L index from baseline to 4 months follow-up between the control and intervention group (including death). EQ-5D is an abbreviation for &quot;European Quality of life - 5 Dimensions&quot; and measures Quality of Life. The scale has five subcomponents with scores from 1 (best) to 5 (worst). The five subcomponents consitute a health state that is translated into an index value using the Danish Crosswalk Index Value Calculator from Euroqol's website. The index value is anchored at 0 = death and 1 = full health and the range in the Danish population is from -0.624 (worse than death) to 1.0 (full health). Higher values / increases in index value is better than lower values / decreases in index value.</description>

    <description>A physician from the Department of Clinical Pharmacology prepares a critial medication review before the first visit in the outpatient clinic through critical review of the patient's medical journal and communication with the patient's GP. During the visit in the outpatient clinic, medications are changed based on the medication review with consent from the patient. After the visit the GP is notified of the changes. It is possible to see the patient more than one time in the outpatient clinic (might be needed if tapering or lots of changes) and possible to follow-up on medication changes by telephone with the patient.</description>
