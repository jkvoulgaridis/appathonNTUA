    <textblock>
      We investigated the effects of whole body vibration (WBV) and high-impact (HI) exercises in
      postmenopausal women with low bone mineral density. In summary, WBV exercises are effective
      in preventing bone loss and WBV and HI exercise programs are effective in decreasing fall
      risk, increasing health-related quality of life and improving depressive symptoms

      Purpose: The aim of this study was to determine the effects of six months of supervised
      whole-body vibration (WBV) and high-impact (HI) exercises on bone mineral density (BMD),
      serum bone turnover markers, fall risk, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and depressive
      symptoms in postmenopausal women, additionally, to evaluate the advantage of each training
      program to another.

      Methods: In a prospective, randomized controlled 6-month interventional trial 58 eligible
      postmenopausal women were assigned to WBV training group (n=19), HI training group (n=19), or
      control group (n=20). The patients in both training groups participated in a supervised
      training program, which consisted of the one-hour exercise session three times a week for six
      months. The WBV groups received vibration (30-35 Hz, 2-4 mm) in five different static
      positions. The HI group jumped rope (10-50 jumps/day). All patients received calcium (1000
      mg) and vitamin D (880 IU) supplementation per day. In all participants, baseline and
      six-month BMD at the lumbar spine and femur were measured by Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry
      (DXA). Serum osteocalcin (OC) and C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTx) were
      measured at baseline, three- and six-month intervals. Fall risk was assessed by using the
      Timed Up and Go (TUG) test and fall index measured by static posturography at baseline,
      three- and six-month intervals. HRQoL and depressive symptoms were assessed using the Quality
      of Life Questionnaire of the European Foundation for Osteoporosis (QUALEFFO) and Beck
      Depression Inventory (BDI), respectively, at baseline and six-month of the study.

    <description>The WBV training consisted of a high frequency (30-40 Hz) vibration stimulus at a low setting (2-4mm peak to peak) on a Power Plate pro5 vibration platform (Performance Health Systems, LLC, Northbrook, IL, USA). Each patient received the vibrations under supervision using five different static positions: squat, deep squat, widestep squat, lunge, and hands-front lunge. The exercise programs for each experimental groups consisted of 20 to 60-minute sessions on three days per week for 24 weeks, and they were performed under the supervision.</description>
