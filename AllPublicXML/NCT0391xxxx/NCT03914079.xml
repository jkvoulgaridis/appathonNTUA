  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this multi-center study is to collect and study the acoustic and
      electrical signals created by the heart during the cardiac cycle as a result of stenosis or
      plaque associated with coronary artery disease (CAD).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research intends to evaluate acoustic and electrical cardiovascular signals in patients
      with known or suspected CAD and establish the ability of the CAD-det System to accurately and
      reliably detect them utilizing coronary computed tomography (CCTA) and invasive coronary
      angiography (ICA) as reference standards. In addition, this study will collect clinical and
      acoustic data of other cardiac pathologies to better understand their impact on the acoustic
      signatures associated with CAD.

    <time_frame>up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>CAD-det results will be categorized by sex as:
Acoustic and electrical signals consistent with 0-30% diameter stenosis (Negative for CAD);
Acoustic and electrical signals consistent with 31-49% diameter stenosis (Pr-clinical / Negative);
Acoustic and electrical signals consistent with 50-69% diameter stenosis (Positive);
Acoustic and electrical signals consistent with 70% or greater diameter stenosis (Positive); and
Equivocal or non-diagnostic.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Estimation of coronary artery stenosis by CCTA and ICA categorized by sex as:</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>0 - 30% diameter stenosis (Negative);
31 - 49% diameter stenosis (Negative / Pre-clinical);
50 - 69% diameter stenosis (Positive);
70% or greater diameter stenosis (Positive); and
Equivocal
In cases where a participant undergoes both CCTA and ICA, the ICA results shall serve as the reference method results used for statistical analysis of the diagnostic accuracy of CAD-det. In participants with equivocal ICA and when invasive coronary physiology or functional assessments (eg. FFR, iFR, Pd/Pa, RFR) are performed, these assessments will be used to ascertain if the CAD-det can determine functional (hemodynamically significant) CAD.</description>
