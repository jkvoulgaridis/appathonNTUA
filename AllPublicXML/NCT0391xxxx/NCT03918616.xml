  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson disease (PD) is a chronic degenerative disease characterized by a progressive loss
      of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Its pathophysiological mechanisms are still
      partially unknown; a main role seems to be played by chronic neuroinflammation. A few reports
      have addressed the possible involvement of the inflammasome in PD, just describing the
      protective effect of P2X7 purinergic receptor (P2X7R) blockers in murine models of the
      disease and in microglial cells, where NLRP3 is activated by α-Synuclein, triggering a
      neuroinflammation that contributes to degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. It is still
      unclear whether, in addition to the increased brain expression and function of the
      nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich repeat, pyrin domain containing type 3 (NLRP3)
      inflammasome platform, a systemic activation of such complex might participate in the
      pathogenesis of PD, which could be the role of the P2X7R in this scenario, and whether such
      patterns undergo any specific epigenetic regulation. The present study has been designed to
      address these issues.

      The day of the study patientes underwent a complete clinical evaluation and assessment of
      psycho-physical abilities using specific test such as Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE),
      Cognitive Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-Cog), Clinical Dementia Rating Scale,
      Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). Blood samples were collected from an
      antecubital vein to assess serum and plasma aliquots for blood routine analysis and RNA and
      protein extraction from circulating lymphomonocytes.

      To explore a putative epigenetic regulation of such complex scenario some circulating miRNAs
      likely involved in the pathogenesis of neurological diseases and neuro-inflammation will be
      measured.

      Expression and functional activity of P2X7R-inflammasome complex will be measured by PCR and
      WB. Acute phase cytokines inflammasome-related levels will be determined by ELISA.
      Biochemical parameters (fasting glucose, lipid profile, serum creatinine, uric acid) will be
      measured by standard methods in the biochemistry laboratory of the University Hospital in
      Pisa. The same determinations will be repeated after one year from the first visit.
