  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bariatric surgery is currently considered the most effective treatment for achieving
      significant, sustained weight loss and reducing comorbidities associated with obesity. Every
      year in France, more than 55,000 undergo this surgery and nearly 450 000 French have a
      history of surgery for obesity. The mechanisms of action of bariatric surgery are multiple
      and are not limited to caloric restriction. Neuro-hormonal effects, changes in the anatomy of
      the digestive tract, vagal changes or bile circulation have been identified as contributing
      factors to weight loss and postoperative improvement of comorbidities. In addition,
      post-operative changes in dietary preferences have also been described, which could
      contribute to initial weight loss and its maintenance over time (aversion to lipid and sugar
      products).

      The counterpart of the rapid and durable efficacy of bariatric surgery is the exposure of
      patients to a significant risk of protein-energy malnutrition. It should be noted that the
      protein intake, very limited in the first months after surgery, remains well below the
      recommended intake after the first postoperative year. Spontaneous consumption of meat and
      vegetable protein is significantly reduced during the first postoperative month and up to one
      year after surgery. Apart from the limitation of gastric volume induced by surgery, clinical
      experience indicates that many patients turn away from protein consumption by aversion. A
      parallel was made between the significant drop in protein consumption during the first months
      and the initial loss of lean mass. Thus changes in dietary preferences induced by bariatric
      surgery could also contribute to postoperative nutritional risk (protein aversion).

      At the same time, it is noted that olfactory and taste modifications have been reported in
      previous studies that could be associated with these changes in food preferences.

      The hypotheses of the current study are that the type of surgery may affect dietary
      preferences differently after obesity surgery and that surgical failure may be associated
      with preferences for high fat, high sweet and low protein foods postoperatively for both
      types of surgery.

      As far as the investigating team is aware, no study compares dietary preferences between
      sleeve gastrectomy and gastric bypass using this approach.
