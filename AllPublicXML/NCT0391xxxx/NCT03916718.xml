    <description>This is a care management program and health care outcomes feasibility study utilizing the dementia Care Ecosystem (CE) program developed at UCSF and tailored to high need Ochsner PWD (patient with dementia) and their CGs (caregivers). Dyads (CGs and PWD) will receive a tailored clinical assessment addressing dementia severity, PWD and CG needs, education/strategies to management common dementia issues, medical issues and medication reconciliation, caregiver wellness strategies, linkages to community-based resources, advance care planning, education about the risk of ED and hospitalization, and care coordination with other specialties. Dyads will be followed on a monthly basis to monitor needs, provide support, and problem solve issues.</description>
