  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prolapse is a condition that can cause disabling pelvic, urinary or sexual function disorders
      and impaired quality of life.

      Regarding the prolapse of the middle floor, the vaginal sacrospinofixation according to
      Richter is the reference technique for the suspension of the vaginal fundus. But the
      technique of sacrospinofixation vaginally is not without several difficulties in the short
      term but also in the medium and long term.

      Recently, anchoring devices have been developed to limit the dissection of the sacrospinous
      ligament and the operative exposure by the sometimes traumatic valves.

      The investigating team uses a technical variant in the form of an isthmic posterior strip of
      light weight and whose arms are sutured to the sacrospinous ligaments. The advantages of this
      isthmic strip are based on its small size, its very low basis weight and its wide mesh
      (improvement of tolerance) via a mini-invasive vaginal approach (thus allowing ambulatory
      care).

      Patient functional discomfort is the main problem related to the presence of a prolapse,
      therefore, the researchers wish to evaluate patient feelings following the use of this
      isthmic band. The researchers' hypothesis is that the sacrospinofixation technique with
      posterior isthmic band Bilateral Sacrospinous Colposuspension (BSC) Mesh (Agency for Medical
      Innovations (AMI) laboratory) improves symptoms experienced by patients with mid-level
      prolapse.
