      Researchers are evaluating a noninvasive treatment with ultrasound waves for Atherosclerotic
      Renal Artery Stenosis (ARAS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will study 30 patients with ARAS randomized to SWT or sham (n=15 each) twice a
      week over 3 weeks. We will measure before and again 3 months after a 3-wk regimen renal
      cortical and medullary perfusion and function (multi-detector computed tomography [MDCT]),
      oxygenation, and fibrosis (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), urinary and plasma levels of
      renal injury markers, systemic endothelial function, and heart rate variability, an index of
      sympathetic activation.

             SWT treatment: e.g. myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, stroke, that
             would, in the opinion of the investigators, compromise the safety of the patient.

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension (Systolic BP &gt;180 mmHg despite therapy).

          -  Pacemaker, implantable defibrillator or other contraindication to MRI
