  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized trial examining the impact of expiratory muscle strength training
      (EMST) on maintenance of safe and efficient oropharyngeal swallow function in persons with
      cancer of the head and neck (HNCA) undergoing treatment with radiation therapy or
      chemoradiotherapy (RT/CRT).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thirty (30) persons with newly-diagnosed HNCA who will be treated with RT/CRT will be
      randomized to an 8-week program of either Active Expiratory Muscle Strength Training (EMST) +
      Standard Care or Sham EMST + Standard Care in order to examine the impact of EMST on
      swallowing function. The training program will consist of 5 sets of 5 breaths, 5 days per
      week for 8 weeks, coincident with RT/CRT. Patients randomized to the Active EMST group will
      use the EMST150 (product name) expiratory muscle strength trainer according to package
      instructions. Those randomized to the Sham EMST group will use an EMST150 device that has
      been modified to eliminate resistance to airflow.

      All subjects will be evaluated prior to initiation of cancer treatment (baseline assessment),
      4 weeks into cancer treatment and again at the completion of cancer treatment (8 weeks after
      initiation of treatment). Assessment will include measurement of maximum expiratory pressure
      (MEP), a videofluoroscopic swallow study (VFSS) to objectively document swallow function, and
      administration of swallow-related quality of life (QOL) questionnaires.
