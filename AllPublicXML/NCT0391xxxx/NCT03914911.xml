      This is a single arm, multicenter study. It will be conducted in 3 medical centers, in the
      breast-imaging unit during ultrasonic guided core needle biopsy procedures performed in women
      with abnormality in the breast.

      The study duration is only during the biopsy procedure, and the follow up period is 2 -3
      weeks.

    <description>AEs will be documented during the biopsy procedure and SAEs will be followed up to 3 weeks after the biopsy procedure. Rates of adverse events such as bleeding, hematoma, infection and pain will be compared to adverse events for similar procedures published in the literature and anticipated in the product risk analysis.</description>

    <description>A questionnaire will be completed by the radiologist and applicable radiology lab staff to assess the ease of device assembly and handling properties. Each of the eight questions will use the same four point rating scale. At the end of the study the average and standard deviation will be calculated for each of the questions.</description>
