      This is a prospective, multi-center controlled observational clinical study. All subjects
      will receive Titan Endoskeleton TT/TO acid etched titanium implant for the planned procedure.
      Each site will have a predetermined bonegraft extender to be used in all enrolled subjects at
      that site.

        One hundred and fifty (150) subjects will participate in the study at a max of 15 clinical
        sites. All subjects will have been diagnosed with lumbar spine disease at one or two levels
        of the lumbar spine that requires lumbar interbody fusion procedure as per the opinion of
        the treating surgeon.Subjects will be offered the opportunity to participate in the trial
        if he/she is determined to be a candidate for TLIF fusion surgery. The population will be
        drawn from an existing patient population per participating site.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Be 18-75 years of age, and skeletally mature

          2. Have clinical and radiological evidence of degenerative disc disease at one or two
             levels of the lumbar spine between L2-S1. May also have spondylosis, spinal stenosis,
             or spondylolisthesis at these levels.

          3. In the opinion of the treating surgeon, must already be a qualified candidate for
             lumbar fusion surgery including 6 months of conservative care prior to surgical
             intervention.

          4. Psychosocially, mentally and physically able to comply with protocol, post-operative
             management and follow-up schedule.

          5. Subject must understand and sign the written Informed Consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Previous history of fusion surgery at the index level(s).

          2. Clinical, laboratory and/or radiological evidence of back pain secondary to acute or
             chronic infection, malignancy, other space occupying lesions and metabolic bone
             demineralization diseases (e.g. osteomalacia, gout, Paget's disease etc.)

          3. Osteoporosis defined as a DEXA bone density measurement T score ≤ 2.5 (Necessity for
             DEXA scan will be determined by investigator's standard of care)

          4. Any terminal or autoimmune disease including but not limited to HIV infection,
             rheumatoid arthritis or lupus.

          5. Any other concurrent medical disease that might impair normal healing process.

          6. Morbid obesity (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2).

          7. Investigational drug or device use within 30 days.

          8. Currently a prisoner.

          9. Currently experiencing a major mental illness (psychosis, schizophrenia, major
             affective disorder) which may indicate that the symptoms are psychological rather than
