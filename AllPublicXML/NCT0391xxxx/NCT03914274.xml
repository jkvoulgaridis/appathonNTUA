  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Foot lesions can be developed during hiking because of external factors. This makes it
      important to study the effect of hiking equipment on lesion development.

      This study analyzes the extrinsic factors involved in the appearance of injuries at the feet
      during the realization of a route of low difficulty and short travel. 33 participants wore
      cotton not technicians socks in his two feet, were used like control socks and 76
      participants wore technical socks &quot;Tierra&quot; and &quot;Set&quot; one on each foot.

      Socks it used as an indispensable element to protect the foot of injuries during sports
      practice. The different compositions of socks can influence the appearance of injuries. The
      technical socks are designed for high-performance sports use (&quot;Lurbel&quot; brand, models &quot;Tierra&quot;
      and &quot;Set&quot;), and non-technical socks (cotton) for everyday use. The socks had different
      composition: &quot;Tierra&quot; (50% regenerative, 25% cool-teak, 17% polyamide ions, 8% lycra); &quot;Set&quot;
      (75% cotton, 17% polyamide, 8% lycra) and cotton (98% cotton, 2% elastane). The technical
      socks had reinforced weave in the toe, metatarsal and heel areas.
