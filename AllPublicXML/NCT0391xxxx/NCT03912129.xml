  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pediatric Evans syndrome (pES) is a rare and severe disease combining immunologic
      thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA). French patients from
      the 30 hematologic pediatric centers are from 2004 included in a prospective national
      OBS'CEREVANCE cohort.

      A first pilot study revealed a monogenic cause in 7/18 patients (40%) with mutations in the
      CTLA-4, LRBA, STAT3 GOF, and KRAS. TNGS or exome studies were performed between 2015 and 2018
      inn 80 patients with pSE from the OBS'CEREVANCE cohort. This approach, combined with by
      immunophenotyping lymphocyte, identified a genetic cause of the disease in 26 patients (32%)
      (TNFRSF6, CTLA4, LRBA, STAT3 GOF, PIK3CD, RAG1, KRAS) and potential causal mutations in 18
      other patients (22%), bringing the proportion of potential single gene cause to 76%.

      The central hypothesis of this study is that most, if not all, cases of pSE are related to a
      monogenic or digenic cause, possibly with the intervention of genetic modifiers such as
      somatic mutations.

    <description>A first systematic approach by Targeted-Next Generation Sequencing will be used on the entire cohort of patients with pSE. This step will be performed on a sequencing chip specifically developed to detect anomalies in known genes involved in autoimmunity.
In patients for whom no mutations are identified, a whole exome sequencing (WES) approach will be applied to patients and their parents to seek to identify mutations in new genes that may be related to pSE.
In patients for whom this WES approach is unsuccessful, the search for somatic lymphocyte mutations, or copy number variants will be performed before considering a complete genome sequencing .
If several candidate genes are identified, the clinical data provided by the CEREVANCE and the phenotypic analyses carried out prior to genetic analyses by the CEDI laboratory will guide the choices to prioritize the study of the identified variants.</description>
