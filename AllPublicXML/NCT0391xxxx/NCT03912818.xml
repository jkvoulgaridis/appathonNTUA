    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects of durvalumab and chemotherapy before surgery in
      treating patients with variant histology bladder cancer. Immunotherapy with monoclonal
      antibodies, such as durvalumab, may induce changes in the body's immune system and may
      interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy,
      such as methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, cisplatin, gemcitabine, and carboplatin, work
      in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving durvalumab in addition to
      standard chemotherapy may lead to better outcomes in patients with variant histology bladder
      cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety and tolerability of durvalumab in combination with chemotherapy in
      subjects with variant histology bladder cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the percent of subjects post-neoadjuvant chemo-immunotherapy who achieve
      tumor stage of pT2 N0 M0 or better (pT1 N0 or pT0) at cystectomy.

      II. To assess the response rate (RR) in post-neoadjuvant chemo immunotherapy as assessed by
      the investigator using imaging at screening and post treatment.

      III. To assess the molecular characterization of tumor tissue pre-neoadjuvant therapy and at
      post treatment cystectomy (for subject who have persistent disease).

      IV. To determine circulating free deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (cfDNA) (cell free DNA) at
      baseline, during treatment and following post treatment cystectomy using Natera sequencing
      platform.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 cohorts.

      COHORT I: Patients receive durvalumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day 1,
      methotrexate over 3 minutes on day 1, vinblastine IV over 3 minutes on day 2, doxorubicin IV
      over 5 minutes on day 2, and cisplatin IV over 60 minutes on day 2. Cycles repeat every 14
      days up to 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients
      undergo cystectomy within 6 weeks.

      COHORT II: Patients receive durvalumab IV over 60 minutes on day 1, cisplatin IV over 60
      minutes on day 1, and gemcitabine IV over 60 minutes on days 1 and 8. Cycles repeat every 21
      days up to 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients
      undergo cystectomy within 6 weeks.

      COHORT III: Patients receive durvalumab IV over 60 minutes on day 1, carboplatin IV over 60
      minutes on day 1, and gemcitabine IV over 60 minutes on days 1 and 8. Cycles repeat every 21
      days up to 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients
      undergo cystectomy within 6 weeks.

      After surgery, patients are followed up at 30 and 90 days.

The safety and tolerability of durvalumab in combination with chemotherapy in subjects with variant histology bladder cancer who initiate study treatment will be assessed as the number, by treatment cohort, of grade 3, 4, or 5 adverse events, considered probably or definitely related by the investigator. The outcome will be reported as a number.</description>

    <description>Achievement of tumor staging will be determined by pathologist at cystectomy and reported by treatment cohort. Assessed per National Comprehensive Cancer Network bladder cancer guidelines.
