  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary Artery Compliance measurements will be obtained with the Respirix device in
      patients with congestive heart failure decompensation. Echocardiogram, weight measurements,
      and BNP will also be gathered as independent measures of decompensation in the clinic.
      Pulmonary Artery Compliance measurements will be made daily during the hospital stay.
      Patients can continue using the device at home for the next 3 weeks. Each patient will serve
      as their own control and relative changes from their baseline will be recorded for each
      parameter.
