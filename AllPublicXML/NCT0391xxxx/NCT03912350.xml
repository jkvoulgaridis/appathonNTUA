  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, non-randomized, open-label, parallel group, multiple-dose study to
      assess the pharmacokinetic, safety, and tolerability of balovaptan in male and female
      subjects with moderate hepatic impairment compared to healthy subjects with normal hepatic
      function matched by age (±10 years), sex, and body mass index (BMI; ±20%).

             of the first dose administration, unless in the opinion of the Investigator the
             medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise safety.
