  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the presence and quantity of non-caloric sweeteners in newborns
      umbilical cord blood, and in their mother's breast milk at delivery, at 2 months, 4 months
      and 6 months of age. Microbiota composition will be evaluated in milk and in feces of both
      mother and child.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The consumption of non-caloric sweeteners (ENC) is increasingly common in our country due to
      its wide use in all types of food and beverages, even those not labeled as &quot;diet&quot;. Despite
      its widespread use and being an alternative to the consumption of sugars, several studies
      have shown that frequent ENC users are also at risk of excessive weight gain, type II
      diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. In addition to this, the consumption of ENC in the
      early stages of life may predispose to the development of metabolic disorders later in
      life.The ENC have been shown to have effects on the health of those who consume them, causing
      metabolic disorders, weight gain and changes in the microbiota. The newborns, in whom gut
      microbiota is in the process of being established, influenced by the vaginal and intestinal
      microbiota of the mother, as well as by the mother's milk, are a vulnerable population in
      whom the effect of ENC consumption has not been investigated. This makes it relevant to study
      the prevalence of ENC in breast milk and umbilical cord blood of their newborns and to
      evaluate the composition of the intestinal and milk microbiota in order to identify changes
      attributable to the consumption of ENC.
