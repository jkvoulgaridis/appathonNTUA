  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is rising in prevalence, and will likely become the
      predominant cause of chronic liver disease in HIV-infected individuals.

      Metabolic factors and obesity are important risk factors for NAFLD in HIV-infected
      individuals. There is currently no approved effective pharmacological treatment for fatty
      liver disease. Therefore, lifestyle modification directing at weight loss is currently the
      cornerstone of treatment for fatty liver disease in the general population. Hypocaloric diets
      can improve fatty liver in the general population, but the most effective specific dietary
      interventions are yet to be elucidated.

      The study aims to 1. determine the efficacy of a lifestyle modification programme in inducing
      resolution of NAFLD in HIV-infected individuals 2. to determine the efficacy of a lifestyle
      modification programme in improving insulin resistance, pro-inflammatory markers, and liver
      fibrosis in HIV-infected individuals with fatty liver disease 3. to determine changes in
      intestinal microbiome secondary to the lifestyle modification programme, and the association
      with resolution of NAFLD in this group of patients.

    <description>The dietary intervention program will be scheduled for 12 months, and conducted by a dietitian.The program aims to increase energy expenditure and reduce caloric intake, with an emphasis on long-term lifestyle and behavioural change. An exercise instructor will provide advice on physical activity. A mobile tracking device to monitor calories expenditure will be provided to each participant during they study period to encourage physical activity.</description>
