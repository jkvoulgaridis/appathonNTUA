  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will increase our understanding of the mechanisms underlying changes in opioid
      medication use associated with three psychosocial chronic pain (CP) treatments. These
      treatments are: (1) Cognitive Therapy (CT), (2) Mindfulness Meditation (MM), and (3)
      Activation Skills (AS). The sample will be adults with CP who are at risk of opioid misuse.
      The purpose of this study is to understand the specific ways these treatments work for
      reducing opioid use. In addition, the investigators are interested in examining moderators of
      treatment response. The findings will potentially inform the future streamlining of
      psychosocial treatments, as well as the development of algorithms for matching individuals
      with CP who are at risk for opioid misuse to the specific treatment most likely to
      efficiently optimize benefit.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study involves participating in eight videoconference group treatment sessions and
      telephone interviews over the course of approximately eight to nine months. All study
      procedures will take place over videoconferencing computer software, online, or by telephone.
      There are no in-person visits for the study. Participants wear an activity monitor for about
      two and a half months starting two weeks before treatment begins. They will also complete
      brief online surveys twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening, for about two
      and a half months starting two weeks before treatment begins. These surveys will be completed
      on a computer, tablet, or smartphone.

      Extended Assessments

      During the study, participants would also complete four extended assessments with a research
      staff member. The first interview is completed before treatment begins, the second is
      completed after treatment ends, the third is completed three months after treatment ends, and
      the fourth and final is completed six months after treatment ends. The first two extended
      assessments (Pre- and Post-Treatment) are completed with a research staff member verbally
      over the telephone. The final two extended assessments (3-month and 6-month Follow-up) may be
      completed either with a research staff member verbally over the telephone or independently
      online.

      Online Surveys

      About two weeks before treatment starts, participants begin doing brief (~2-5 minutes) online
      surveys twice a day. The online surveys can be completed on a smartphone, tablet, laptop, or
      desktop computer. Automated notifications in the morning and in the evening reminding the
      participant to to complete the brief survey twice a day.

      Activity Monitor

      Participants wear an activity monitor 24 hours a day for the 2.5-month Monitoring Period
      (which spans two weeks before treatment to one month after treatment). The activity monitor
      is worn on the non-dominant wrist, like a wristwatch.

      Weekly Interviews

      Beginning two weeks prior to treatment, participants will be contacted weekly by a staff
      member to complete a telephone survey. Participants complete 10 total surveys over the course
      of 10 weeks, concluding about one month after treatment ends. Each survey takes approximately
      10-15 minutes.

      Treatment

      Participants are randomly assigned to one of the three treatment groups. Treatment consists
      of eight group treatment sessions completed remotely over a videoconferencing platform. There
      will be, on average, two sessions per week, and each session will take up to 90 minutes. Each
      treatment session will take place over the internet on a computer, tablet, or smartphone
      using the videoconference application. Each session will be led by the same study clinician,
      who is a trained clinical psychologist. Participants will be required to use a video camera
      and audio through either a microphone or phone for each group treatment session.

      All three treatment interventions will involve educating participants about pain, discussing
      the impact of pain, and discussing different ways to manage it in hopes of decreasing pain
      and its impact. The three treatments are: (1) Mindfulness Meditation, (2) Cognitive Therapy
      and (3) Activation Skills.

      Each treatment intervention will have home practice activities to complete between sessions.
      Home practice activities may include, but are not limited to, creating thought records,
      listening to pre-recorded guided practices, and keeping track of activities and goals.
      Participants also receive a treatment workbook with materials to refer to and discuss during
      the group sessions as well as additional materials to read between sessions.

    <measure>Change in Medication Use</measure>
    <time_frame>Collected via phone up to 7 weeks before Tx 1, post-treatment (up to 2 mos after Tx 8), and at 3- and 6-mos after Tx 8]</time_frame>
    <description>Change in medication use will be assessed by asking participants to report use of antidepressant, sedative/hypnotic, anticonvulsant, NSAID, or opioid medications within the past 7 days. For NSAID and opioid medications, participants will be asked to report medication name, quantity per dose (e.g., 50 mg), and number of medication doses taken in the past week. For each antidepressant, sedative/hypnotic, or anticonvulsant medication, participants will report yes or no to having taken them in the past week. Researchers will calculate a morphine equivalent dose (MED) for opioid medications; a lower MED indicates less self-reported opioid medication use. For all other medication types, researchers will track medication counts (if medication was used or not) at each time point.</description>

    <measure>Change in Cannabis Use</measure>
    <time_frame>Collected via phone up to 7 weeks before Tx 1, post-treatment (up to 2 mos after Tx 8), and at 3- and 6-mos after Tx 8]</time_frame>
    <description>Change in cannabis use will be assessed by 3 investigator-developed items on cannabis use. Participants will be asked to report use of any cannabis or cannabis products in the past 7 days. Participants will be directed to note that the term cannabis is being used to refer to marijuana, cannabis concentrates, and cannabis-infused edibles (can also refer to products with CBD). At the Post-Treatment and Follow-up time points, participants will be asked whether they were taking any cannabis or cannabis products at the beginning of the study and for how long they had been taking those products prior to the start of the study. Researchers will track if cannabis was used or not at each time point.</description>

Responses from each of the 17 items from the PCL-C will be summed to form a total score ranging from 17 to 85. A higher score indicates greater severity of PTSD related symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Pain Interference</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed via EMA twice daily during 2 weeks before Tx 1, 4-week treatment period, and immediate 4 weeks after Tx 8; also collected via phone up to 7 weeks before Tx 1, post-treatment (up to 2 months after Tx 8), and at 3- and 6-months after Tx 8</time_frame>
    <description>Change in pain interference with different activities/aspects of life will be measured with five items from the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Pain Interference item bank. Responses from each item will be summed for a total t-score score based on normative data. Higher scores indicate more self-reported pain interference with different activities/aspects of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Pain Catastrophizing (Cognitive Content Mechanism)</measure>
    <time_frame>EMA twice daily (&amp;weekly via phone) during 2 weeks before Tx 1, 4-week treatment period, and immediate 4 weeks after Tx 8; also collected via phone up to 7 weeks before Tx 1, post-treatment (up to 2 months after Tx 8), and at 3- and 6-months after Tx 8</time_frame>
    <description>Primary Mechanism Variable
Change in pain catastrophizing will be measured with items from the University of Washington (UW) Pain Appraisal Scale (PAS) item bank and the 2-item Coping Strategy Questionnaire (CSQ) Catastrophizing Scale. When assessed via phone, responses from the PAS will be summed for a total raw score from 6-30. The total raw score will then be converted to a IRT (Item Response Theory)-based T-score. Higher T scores indicate a higher level of pain catastrophizing. Similarly, the 2-item CSQ will be averaged for a mean score from 0-6. A higher mean CSQ score indicates a higher level of pain catastrophizing.
The PAS is also assessed via EMA. When assessed via EMA, responses from the PAS will be summed for a total raw score from 4-20. The total raw score will then be converted to a IRT-based T-score. Higher T scores indicate a higher level of pain catastrophizing.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Non-Judgment (Cognitive Process Mechanism)</measure>
    <time_frame>EMA twice daily (&amp;weekly via phone) during 2 weeks before Tx 1, 4-week treatment period, and immediate 4 weeks after Tx 8; also collected via phone up to 7 weeks before Tx 1, post-treatment (up to 2 months after Tx 8), and at 3- and 6-months after Tx 8</time_frame>
    <description>Primary Mechanism Variable
Change in non-judgment will be measured with items from the Pain-Related Cognitive Process Questionnaire (PCPQ) Non-Judgmental Scale. When assessed via phone, the full 6-item scale will be used while only four items are used in the EMA. Items will be averaged for a mean score from 0-4. Higher mean PCPQ scores indicate higher frequencies of using the adaptive cognitive process of non-judgment in responding to pain.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Activity Level (Actigraphy - Mechanism)</measure>
    <time_frame>Worn daily for 2 weeks before Session (Tx) 1, during 4-week treatment period, and during immediate 4 weeks after Tx 8</time_frame>
    <description>Primary Mechanism Variable
Change in activity level will be measured by an actigraphy device worn by the participant measuring activity level and sleep.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Activity Level (Exercise Self-Report - Mechanism)</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed via EMA twice daily during 2 weeks before Tx 1, 4-week treatment period, and immediate 4 weeks after Tx 8; also collected via phone up to 7 weeks before Tx 1, post-treatment (up to 2 months after Tx 8), and at 3- and 6-months after Tx 8</time_frame>
    <description>Primary Mechanism Variable
Change in time spent exercising will be measured using the Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire, a 3-item questionnaire assessing time spent in mild, moderate, and strenuous exercise. When assessed via phone, participants will report the number of times in the past week spent in each of the three intensity levels. The number of times at each intensity level will be multiplied by MET values of 3, 5, and 9, respectively, and these values are then summed to create a total weekly exercise score. Higher total weekly exercise scores indicate higher levels of physical activity.
The Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire is also assessed via EMA. When assessed via EMA, participants are asked to report the number of minutes they spent exercising at each of the three intensity levels for that day. More time reported at each of the three exercise intensity levels indicate higher levels of physical activity.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Activity Level (Hours Spent Sitting without Exercising Self-Report)</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed via EMA twice daily during 2 weeks before Tx 1, 4-week treatment period, and immediate 4 weeks after Tx 8</time_frame>
    <description>Primary Mechanism Variable
Change in hours spent sitting without exercising will be measured using a single self-report item. A higher number of hours spent sitting without exercising indicates a higher amount of sedentary time.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Pain Intensity (Mechanism)</measure>
    <time_frame>EMA twice daily (&amp;weekly via phone) during 2 weeks before Tx 1, 4-week treatment period, and immediate 4 weeks after Tx 8; also collected via phone up to 7 weeks before Tx 1, post-treatment (up to 2 months after Tx 8), and at 3- and 6-months after Tx 8</time_frame>
    <description>Primary Mechanism
Change in pain intensity of chronic pain will be measured using a 0-10 numerical rating scale. Participants will be asked to choose a number from 0-10 that best represents their pain intensity. Higher scores indicate higher levels of self-reported pain intensity.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Depression and Anxiety Severity (Mechanism)</measure>
    <time_frame>collected via phone up to 7 weeks before Tx 1, weekly starting two weeks before Tx 1 through four weeks after Tx 8, post-treatment (up to 2 months after Tx 8), and at 3- and 6-months after Tx 8</time_frame>
    <description>Primary Mechanism Variable
Change in depression and anxiety will be measured with the respective Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Short Forms. Responses from each item will be summed to form a total t-score score based on normative data. Higher scores indicate higher self-reported levels of depression/anxiety.</description>
