  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to develop a questionnaire that should distinguish patients with
      lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) from other patients. LSS can cause significant pain and
      disability leading to dramatically reduced quality of life, immobility and functional
      limitation.

      The number of people with pain and disability due to LSS is expected to increase with age due
      to the degenerative nature of the disease. With an aging population this could potentially
      become a major health economic challenge.

      One of the challenges to estimate the true prevalence is the lack of a valid and reliable
      gold standard for LSS. To our knowledge, no diagnostic screening tool designed to estimate
      the prevalence of LSS in a clinical population of Danish patients with chronic low back pain
      (LBP) and leg pain has been developed.

      The objective of this project is to develop a diagnostic screening tool for LSS - the LLS
      Screen. This should consist of a set of items useable in a self-administered questionnaire, a
      rule to compute the probability of having LSS, and a cutpoint to be used to obtain a
      sensitivity of 95%. The rule should be applicable in patient populations suffering from low
      back pain and with increased suspicion to suffer from LSS due to failure of non-surgical
      treatment

      The specific objectives are:

      A. To identify items with high content validity for diagnosing LLS B. To investigate the
      preliminary value of items included in the LLS screen C. To investigate the performance of
      the included items in the LLS screen D. To decide on the content of the final version of the
      LLS Screen

      This project consists of four parts. Part I addresses objective A based on a literature
      search and qualitative semi-structured interviews. Part II addresses objective B by
      conducting a case-control study concurrent with a cohort study and performing a series of
      analyses to investigate the preliminary value and performance of the items. Part III
      describes the performance of the items by combining them in various ways to obtain an optimal
      diagnostic rule (objective C). Finally, part IV is a decision of the content of the final
      version of the LSS Screen based on information from Part I, II and III (objective D).

      Part II:

      A case-control study with cases and controls identified within a prospective clinical
      population based cohort study that will be boosted with cases of LSS.

      Cohort design First, a prospective clinical population based cohort of patients with low back
      pain and/or leg pain will be initiated. Patients above 50 years of age will be included in
      the study at their first visit at the Spine Centre where they fill out the screening
      questionnaire (index test) before they are seen by a clinician. The primary diagnosis
      (reference test) will be assessed and determined by specialists at the Spine Centre.

      Case-control design Secondly, patients with LSS will be recruited from other departments to
      artificially increase the prevalence of LSS. Patients with LSS will be recruited from the
      surgical department at the Spine Centre of Southern Denmark, Middelfart, Denmark and
      Department of Spine Surgery, Odense University Hospital (OUH), Odense, Denmark.
