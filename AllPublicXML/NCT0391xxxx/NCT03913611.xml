  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised controlled trial involving patients who have a double-row arthroscopic
      rotator cuff repair.

      Null hypothesis: There is no difference in outcome between standard rehabilitation and
      accelerated rehabilitation after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.

      Following surgery, they will be randomised to one of two groups:

        1. Standard rehabilitation, with enforced sling use for 6 weeks and a structured exercise
           programme.

        2. Accelerated rehabilitation with no requirement to use a sling and a structured exercise
           programme.

      The primary outcome measure will be the Oxford Shoulder Score at 6 months. We will also
      collect data on postoperative pain, range of shoulder movement and other subjective outcome
      measures. All patients will have MRI scans at 6 months postoperatively to assess the
      integrity of the repair, allowing comparison of failure rates between groups.

    <textblock>
      This is a randomised controlled trial involving patients who have a double-row arthroscopic
      rotator cuff repair. We wish to compare clinical and radiological outcomes for patients
      undergoing standard rehabilitation protocols versus accelerated rehabilitation.

      A double-row repair will be used in this study as it has been shown in laboratory testing to
      be stronger and withstand significantly more cyclical loads before failure.

      Patients who have failed conservative treatment for their rotator cuff tears will be offered
      inclusion in the study. Baseline scores and measurements will be taken prior to surgery.
      After a successful surgical repair has been confirmed, patients will be randomised to one of
      two rehabilitation programmes. One programme will mandate use of a sling for 6 weeks, and
      another will not require use of a sling after the immediate postoperative period.

      All patients will be followed up for one year, at intervals of 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months
      and 12 months, using subjective outcome measures, objective measures of movement and an MRI
      scan to assess the integrity of the repair at 6 months.

    <time_frame>6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months postoperatively.</time_frame>
    <description>A validated patient-reported outcome measure of shoulder function. This score is composed to two subscales. One is for pain and the other subscale is for disability. Both subscales range from 0 to 100, with lower scores representing a better outcome. The scores are averaged to provide a global score.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>EQ5D</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months postoperatively.</time_frame>
    <description>A validated patient-reported outcome measure of general health. The descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state.
The EQ VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale, where the endpoints are labelled 'The best health you can imagine' and 'The worst health you can imagine'. This is on a range of 0 to 100, with higher scores representing a better outcome.</description>
