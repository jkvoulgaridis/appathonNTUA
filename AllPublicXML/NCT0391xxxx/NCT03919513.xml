  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inspiratory muscle training(IMT) was one of the widely used pulmonary rehabilitation method
      in COPD patients.However, when the respiratory muscles are fatigue without sufficient rest,
      IMT may increase muscle fatigue and aggravate muscle damage. Noninvasive positive pressure
      ventilation (NPPV) is another important strategy of pulmonary rehabilitation which could
      overcome airway resistance and reduce respiratory work, improve respiratory muscle fatigue.
      Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore the effective of the &quot;IMT - NPPV
      sequential&quot; rehabilitation method, that is, first inspiratory muscle training, followed by
      respiratory muscle resting (non-invasive positive pressure ventilation).

      Exploring the effects of the new rehabilitation method of &quot;IMT - NPPV sequential&quot;, comparing
      with the single rehabilitation strategy such as inspiratory muscle training and non-invasive
      positive pressure ventilation.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Respiratory muscle strength(composite outcome measure)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Currently, the maximal inspiratory pressure (PImax) and maximal expiratory pressures(PEmax) are measured by a digital manometer (AZ-8205, AZ Instrument, Taichung City, Taiwan)and combined to evaluate respiratory muscle function.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Diaphragmatic function</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Diaphragmatic function can be assessed by diaphragm electromyogram (EMGdi) measured by a high-performance data acquisition device (Powerlab 16/35; ADInstruments, Australia), which reflect the physiological activity of the diaphragm and indicate functional status of the central drive.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Symptom Evaluation(composite outcome measure)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Individuals with chronic respiratory disease often have symptoms such as dyspnea, fatigue, cough, weakness, sleeplessness, and psychological distress. Instruments for assessment of multiple symptoms include COPD Assessment Test (CAT) and Modified Medical British Research Council Scale(mMRC).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pulmonary function(composite outcome measure)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Pulmonary function is measured using a spirometer(PonyFX 229, Cosmed, Rome, Italy) that is calibrated daily.The FEV1 and percent-of-predicted FEV1, FVC and percent-of-predicted FVC which are presented in one report are used to evaluate Pulmonary Function.</description>

    <measure>Exercise capacity</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Exercise capacity is evaluated using the 6-min walking distance (6MWD) according to American Thoracic Society guidelines.</description>
