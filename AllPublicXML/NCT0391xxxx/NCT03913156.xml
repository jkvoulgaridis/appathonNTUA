  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the feeding patterns and practices at the introduction of a second stage
      phe-free protein substitute will be assessed in young children with PKU. This will be
      compared with the normal weaning process in healthy non-PKU age-matched children. In
      addition, tolerability and acceptability of the study product will be evaluated in a smaller
      group of subjects who have already been transferred onto a second stage protein substitute.
      The study is performed in 3 centers in the United Kingdom.

      Part 1:

      For subjects with PKU, the study product will be incorporated in the diet as the second stage
      protein substitute until the subjects are 2 years of age.

      The healthy non-PKU age-matched subjects will not have the study product incorporated in
      their diet in order to be able to compare the weaning experience and nutritional intake of
      PKU subjects with non-PKU subjects. The healthy subjects will also be part of the study until
      the subjects are 2 years of age.

      Part 2:

      All PKU subjects will take the study product for 7 days.
