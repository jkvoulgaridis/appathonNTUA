      The purpose of this study is to observe and evaluate the efficacy and safety of SHR-1210
      combined with preoperative chemotherapy for locally advanced esophageal squamous cell
      carcinoma

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In China, the incidence of esophageal cancer has declined in recent years, but the mortality
      rate has been ranked fourth. Morbidity and mortality were ranked sixth and fourth in all
      malignancies, respectively. Therefore, esophageal cancer has always been a major malignant
      tumor that threatens the health of our residents. We designed a single-arm, open-label, phase
      II trial of SHR-1210 combined with preoperative chemotherapy for locally advanced esophageal
      squamous cell carcinoma. The purpose of this study is to observe and evaluate the efficacy
      and safety of SHR-1210 combined with preoperative chemotherapy for locally advanced
      esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
