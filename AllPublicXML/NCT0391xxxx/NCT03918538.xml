      Aim: To develop and testing a home exercise program for lung cancer survivors to improve
      their exercise tolerance and quality of life during the rehabilitation phase.

      Design: An experimental design will be used in the study. The 90 lung cancer survivors, who
      were diagnosed with lung cancer within one year and have completed their initial cancer
      treatment, will be recruited and randomized to the control or intervention group. After
      pre-test, the intervention participants will receive a 60 minutes of teaching regarding the
      home rehabilitation exercise program, with a printed exercise manual. The intervention
      participant will also receive a weekly phone call from the interventionist to enhance their
      exercise adherence and helping to overcome exercise barriers. The similar outcome measures as
      study one will be assessed on the baseline, 1th month, 3th month, and 6th month.

      Measurements: The study outcomes will be evaluated by three physical measures, six-minute
      walk test, Modified Borg Scale, 30-second Chair Sit-to-Stand Test, and 30-second Chair
      Sit-to-Stand Test, as well as a study questionnaire including Functional Assessment of Cancer
      Therapy-Lung (FACT-L) and FACIT-Fatigue. For study one the following data will be collected
      from the patient'schart: post-operative pulmonary complications, days of chest tube
      insertion, and days of hospitalization.

      Data analysis: Descriptive analysis will be used to describe patients'demongraphics, disease
      variables, and outcome variables. The Chi-square, T-test, and General Linear Mix-effect Model
      will be used to test the efficacy of the study interventions.

      Background: With appropriate treatment, lung cancer patients can be a long-term survivor.
      However, many patients suffered from post-operative pulmonary complications, limited activity
      tolerance, and poor quality of life. Nurses in a great position to provide individualized
      health education regarding exercise for these patients; therefore to develop and test
      cost-effective nurses-lead lung rehabilitation exercise education programs deserver further
      scientific efforts.

      Aim: To develop and testing a home exercise program for lung cancer survivors to improve
      their exercise tolerance and quality of life during the rehabilitation phase.

      Significance: The study results will provide evidence for the efficacy of pulmonary
      rehabilitation and a home exercise program for enhancing exercise tolerance and quality of
      life in lung cancer survivors.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>six-minute walk test</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The six-minute walk test measures the distance an individual is able to walk over a total of six minutes on a hard, flat surface. The goal is for the individual to walk as far as possible in six minutes. The individual is allowed to self-pace and rest as needed as they traverse back and forth along a marked walkway.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>30-second arm curl test</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>To measure upper body strength and endurance. The participant is sitting on the edge of a stabile chair, with seat height of 44 cm (originally 43.18 cm). The back is outstretched, the feet resting flat on the ground. A handle weighing 2 kg for women or 3.5 kg for men is held in the dominant hand. The arm is directed downwards, along the chair, perpendicularly to the floor. Participant's task is, at a command given by the testing person, to rotate the hand upwards while simultaneously flexing the extremity in the elbow (flexion with supination), and subsequently to extend the extremity to its baseline position.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>30-second chair sit-to-stand test</measure>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lung (FACT-L)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>There are two subscales, 27 items of FACT-General and 9 items of Lung Cancer Subscale. Each item is rated on a 5-point Likert scale (0-4). The total score of the 36 items represents the score of the scale. The higher values represent better quality of life.</description>

    <measure>The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>There are 13 items in the scale. Each item is rated on a 5-point Likert scale (0-4). The total score of the 13 items represents the score of the scale. The possible score for the scale ranges from 0 to 52. The higher values represent more fatigue.</description>
