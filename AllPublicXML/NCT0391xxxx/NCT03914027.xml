    <textblock>
      Pulmonary sarcoidosis (PS) is defined as a multisystem granulomatous disorder of unknown
      cause affecting different vital organs, especially the lungs.

      PS manifest in reduction of pulmonary function. Overall symptoms lead to poor physical
      conditioning contributing to a vicious cycle of more physical inactivity.

      Treatment of sarcoidosis is usually limited to patient symptoms. Progressive fibrosis
      sometimes can lead to respiratory failure and ultimately, pulmonary transplantation.

      Physical training shows promising evidence of a positive effect on PF. No defined training
      program with regard to exercise frequency, duration or intensities exists.

      PS is a relatively rare disease and patients are scattered in great geographically areas,.It
      is difficult to organize targeted group training with supervised physical training,
      convenient for patients and affordable for the public health sector. Tele-rehabilitation (TR)
      seems to be a good approach to reach patients in low inhabited areas, going from health care
      to self-care, empowering patient's awareness of their disease and increasing the flexibility
      patients need to acquire healthier behaviors.

      Preliminary evaluations from TR initiatives in Scotland showed tele-rehabilitation to be more
      cost effective with patients living in remote areas than with the outreach- or centralized
      model.

      No studies on the feasibility effect of TR in PS exists. The study is a prospective
      randomized controlled trial investigating the effects of tele-rehabilitation in patients with
      PS compared to standard practice. 24 patients with PS will be randomized in two groups,
      trained by tele-rehabilitation for 12 weeks and afterwards followed for 6 months. The control
      group will follow the usual control program for PS patients that only involves outpatient
      visits approximately every 3rd month. No specific PS rehabilitation program exists. The
      intervention group will receive TR in the form of video consultations- and chat sessions with
      a real physiotherapist and workout sessions with a virtual physiotherapist agent. They will
      also train with virtual reality glasses or tablets that show the actual exercises in the
      training program.

      Patients will be tested with pulmonary function, physical, anxiety and quality of life
      parameters, all at baseline, after 12 weeks of intervention, 3 and 6 months after cessation
      of the program.

      Background:

      Pulmonary Sarcoidosis (PS) is defined as a multisystem granulomatous disorder of unknown
      cause affecting different vital organs, especially the lungs . The pathogenesis is complex
      and a single immunologic reaction and modulation of one cytokine is unlikely to resolve all
      aspects of the disease.

      PS affects people throughout the world. The prevalence in Denmark is 6.4 cases per 100,000,
      consistent with the range of 5 to 40 per 100,000 reported from other northern European
      countries.

      PS manifest in reduction of pulmonary function resulting in cough, dyspnea and fatigue and
      can be complicated by fibrosis and pulmonary hypertension. The overall symptoms lead to poor
      physical conditioning contributing to a vicious cycle of more physical inactivity

      Treatment of sarcoidosis is usually limited to patient symptoms. In case of progressive
      pulmonary involvement or involvement of other vital organs, corticosteroids are indicated to
      prevent or stabilize organ damage. However, progressive fibrosis sometimes can lead to
      respiratory failure and ultimately, pulmonary transplantation.

      Physical training shows promising evidence of a positive effect on PF, can improve
      psychological health and physical functioning and also decrease fatigue, increase muscle
      strength and increase exercise capacity. Until today there is no defined training program
      with regard to exercise frequency, duration or intensities in PS contrary to chronic
      obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).

      PS is a relatively rare disease and that sarcoid patients are scattered in great
      geographically areas, it is difficult to organize targeted group training with supervised
      physical training, convenient for patients and affordable for the public health sector. New
      technologies in healthcare are being introduced to treat patients from a distance in these
      years. Tele-rehabilitation (TR) seems to be a good approach to reach patients in low
      inhabited areas, going from health care to self-care, empowering patient's awareness of their
      disease and increasing the flexibility patients need to acquire healthier behaviors. TR has
      previously been shown to be feasible in patients with lymphedema, COPD and orthopedic
      diseases for lower back, knee and shoulder.

      TR with COPD patients at home is feasible and well accepted by the patients, although
      technology has been perceived as difficult. TR seems to improve the functional level as
      assessed by walking capacity, dyspnea, quality of life and daily physical activity . The
      interaction between the COPD patients at home and the healthcare professionals at the clinic
      through TR has evolved as a dialogue channel forming a basis for mutual learning processes
      and new relationships. Preliminary evaluations from TR initiatives in Scotland showed
      tele-rehabilitation to be more cost effective with patients living in remote areas than with
      the outreach- or centralized model.

      There have so far been no studies on the feasibility effect of TR in PS.

      Hypothesis Tele-rehabilitation in patients with PS is feasible and improves exercise
      capacity, quality of life and activities of daily living.

      Aim To assess the feasibility and effect of tele-rehabilitation with a tele-rehabilitation
      platform (NITRP) compared to standard treatment with respect to exercise capacity, quality of
      life and activities of daily living in patients with PS.

    <description>Change in fatigue measured by FAS at 12 weeks, 6 and 9 months after baseline. The 10-item Fatigue Assessment Scale (FAS)(Vries et al. 2004) (Michielsen et al. 2006) is a 10-item general fatigue questionnaire to assess fatigue. Five questions reflect physical fatigue and 5 questions (questions 3 and 6-9) mental fatigue. An answer to every question has to be given, even if the person does not have any complaints at the moment. Scores on question 4 and 10 should be recoded (1=5, 2=4, 3=3, 4=2, 5=1). Subsequently, the total FAS score can be calculated by summing the scores on all questions (recoded scores for questions 4 and 10). The total score ranges from 10 to 50. A total FAS score &lt; 22 indicates no fatigue, a score ≥ 22 indicates fatigue. All online versions of the FAS calculate the FAS scores automatically: a total score as well as mental and physical score will be provided.</description>

    <description>Each patient will have the opportunity to have minimum one VC per week the first month, one Video Consultation each second week the second month one VC a month the rest of the trial. Here the physiotherapist, via history will extract the information needed to calibrate the daily TR program according to the patient's physical status and needs.
Workout Sessions with a Virtual Physiotherapist Agent (VPA): The patient will train according to what is decided by the physiotherapist and the patient in the VC or chat meetings. Normally, the patients will train 10-20 minutes daily at home with its individual and tailored VPA. Instead of ergometer bike training, the patient will receive some easy training tools such as elastics, weights and a fitness-step that can be used in the different exercises showed by the VPA to reach the same intensity of workout. The VPA will then be animated to motivate and encourage the patient to exercises at home.</description>
