  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and efficacy of CD19/CD22 Bispecific CAR-T for the treatment of
      MRD-positive B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Patients will be given a conditioning
      chemotherapy regimen of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide followed by a single infusion of
      CD19/CD22 CAR+ T cells.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants with MRD-positive B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia can participate if all
      eligibility criteria are met. Tests required to determine eligibility include disease
      assessments, a physical exam, Electrocardiograph, CT/MRI , and blood draws. Participants
      receive chemotherapy prior to the infusion of CD19/CD22 CAR+ T cells. After the infusion,
      participants will be followed for side effects and effect of CD19/CD22 CAR+ T cells. Study
      procedures may be performed while hospitalized.
