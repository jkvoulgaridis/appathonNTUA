      The aim of this study was to evaluate the surgical decisions and prognosis of the radiomics
      and Watson artificial intelligence in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.

    <textblock>
      Hepatectomy is an effective treatment for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, but liver
      failure after hepatectomy may lead to increased postoperative mortality.Therefore, it is very
      important to make preoperative surgical decisions, evaluate the safety of the operation and
      identify which patients are likely to suffer from liver failure.Imaging omics is a newly
      emerging research method in recent years, which has great potential in cancer diagnosis and
      treatment, and can monitor treatment and predict the prognosis of patients, so as to better
      realize accurate diagnosis and treatment of diseases.The artificial intelligence platform
      developed by IBM Watson for Watson tumor treatment decisions can provide treatment decisions
      and corresponding theoretical basis to guide surgical decisions based on the key clinical
      data of liver cancer patients.

    <description>The artificial intelligence platform developed by IBM Watson can provide treatment decisions and corresponding theoretical basis to guide surgical decisions based on the key clinical data of liver cancer patients.
The imaging histology can be used to conduct intraoperative navigation surgical resection and treatment monitoring, and established a prognosis model to predict the prognosis of patients by grading the results of postoperative follow-up and microvascular invasion of pathological liver cancer, so as to better achieve accurate diagnosis and treatment of the disease.</description>
