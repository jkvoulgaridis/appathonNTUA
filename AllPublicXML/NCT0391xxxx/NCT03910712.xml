  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, open-label, phase II study, comparing the efficacy and safety of
      trastuzumab plus aromatase inhibitors, with or without pyrotinib, in the treatment of HR
      (hormone receptor)+/HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) + MBC and inoperable LABC
      patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, two-arm, open-label, multicenter phase II trial. Our primary purpose is
      to compare that PFS of patients with trastuzumab, AI plus pyrotinib and trastuzumab plus an
      AI for HER2-positive and hormone receptor-positive MBC or locally advanced breast cancer
      (LABC).

      Eligible patients will randomized to a ratio of 1:1 to pyrotinib+ trastuzumab + aromatase
      inhibitor (experimental group) or trastuzumab+aromatase inhibitor (control group).
      Stratification factors were 1)time since adjuvant hormone therapy (&lt;=12 months/＞12 months/no
      prior hormone therapy); 2) lesion (visceral; non-visceral).

      In treatment period, patients will be administrated trastuzumab plus aromatase inhibitors,
      with or without pyrotinib, every 21 days for 1 cycle, until disease progression, toxicity
      intolerance, withdrawal of informed consent, patients judged must be terminated study
      termination.

      The imaging evaluation was performed according to the RECIST 1.1 criteria every 6 weeks.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization to 36 month</time_frame>
    <description>PFS was defined as the time from randomization to first documented disease progression (PD) using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) or death from any cause, whichever occurred first. For target lesions, PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of the longest diameter recorded since treatment started or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions. For non-target lesions, PD was defined as the appearance of 1 or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.
The PFS will be will be estimated using Kaplan-Meier method. A Kaplan-Meier curve, median PFS, hazard ratio with appropriate confidence intervals will be reported.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization to 36 month</time_frame>
    <description>Overall Survival (OS), defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death, regardless of the cause of death. Participants who were alive at the time of the analysis were censored at the date of the last follow-up assessment. Participants without follow-up assessment were censored at the day of last study medication and participants with no post-baseline information were censored at the date of randomization.
The OS will be will be estimated using Kaplan-Meier method. A Kaplan-Meier curve, median OS, hazard ratio with appropriate confidence intervals will be reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective Overall Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization to 36 month</time_frame>
    <description>ORR was defined as percentage of participants with best (confirmed) overall response (BOR) of either CR or PR. ORR was assessed by the investigator according to RECIST version 1.1 and is based on BOR, which is defined as best response recorded from start of study treatment until disease progression/recurrence or death. Participants needed to have two consecutive assessments of PR or CR to be a responder. Only participants with measurable disease at baseline were included in the analysis of BOR and who did not have any evaluable post-baseline assessments were classified as not evaluable.
The ORR will be reported by percentage with each arms and appropriate confidence intervals.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response (DoR)</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization to 36 month</time_frame>
    <description>DoR is defined as date of initial confirmed PR/CR until date of progressive disease or death from any cause. PR or CR or SD is according to RECIST version 1.1.
The DoR will be estimated using Kaplan-Meier method. Kaplan-Meier curves, median DoR, hazard ratio with appropriate confidence intervals will be reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Response (TTR)</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization to 36 month</time_frame>
    <description>Time to Response (TTR), defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of first CR or PR. CR or PR is according to RECIST version 1.1.
The TTR will be estimated using Kaplan-Meier method. A Kaplan-Meier curve, median TTR, hazard ratio with appropriate confidence intervals will be reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Benefit Response (CBR)</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization to 36 month</time_frame>
    <description>CBR is percentage of participants with best (confirmed) PR or CR or SD for at least 6 months. PR or CR or SD is according to RECIST version 1.1.
The CBR will be reported by percentage with each arms and appropriate confidence intervals.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adverse events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>From screening phase until AEs returns to Grade 0-1 or baseline</time_frame>
    <description>AEs were graded according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0.3.
In general, AEs are graded according to the following: Grade 1 Mild AE Grade 2 Moderate AE Grade 3 Severe AE Grade 4 Life-threatening or disabling AE Grade 5 Death related to AE.
The type, grade and frequency of AEs will be reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life (QoL) by FACT-B</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization to 36 month</time_frame>
    <description>QoL was assessed using Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy for Breast Cancer (FACT-B). FACT-B is a 37-item questionnaire with 5 subscales assessing physical, social, emotional, and functional well-being, as well as a breast cancer specific subscale.
FACT-B questionnaires were completed by patients on screening phase (baseline) and each 6 weeks after randomization. Mean change from baseline of FACT-B scores by each visit for each arms will be reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life (QoL) by EQ-5D</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization to 36 month</time_frame>
    <description>QoL was assessed using EuroQoL 5-Dimensions (EQ-5D). EQ-5D is a standardized instrument developed by the EuroQol Group as a measure of health-related quality of life that can be used in a wide range of health conditions and treatments.
EQ-5D questionnaires were completed by patients on screening phase (baseline) and each 6 weeks after randomization. Mean change from baseline of EQ-5D scores by each visit for each arms will be reported.</description>
