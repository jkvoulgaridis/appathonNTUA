  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interventional, prospective, multicenter, post-marketing clinical follow-up study.

      After midline laparotomy, the probability to develop an incisional hernia ranges from 10% to
      50% depending on the complexity of the surgery and patient state of health.

      As the clinical data needed for the study corresponds with those collected by Club Hernie
      registry, the clinical study will use the established registry database to collect
      performance and safety data on the prevention of incisional hernias within 24 months post
      operatively.
