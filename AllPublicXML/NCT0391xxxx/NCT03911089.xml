    <textblock>
      Original study: Study aims to enroll 3-5 children with confirmed Urinary Cycle Disorder
      (UCD). Subjects meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria are included during the baseline
      visit. All subjects will receive the investigational product for a period of 16 weeks. At
      baseline, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 16 weeks the study parameters are assessed.

      The study amendment aims to collect case studies retrospectively of children who have used
      UCD Anamix Infant for at least 16 weeks, in countries where UCD Anamix Infant is already
      available on the market. It is aimed to collect the same study parameters of the original
      study at preferably the same timepoints.
