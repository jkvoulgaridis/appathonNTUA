  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Scleroderma Patient-centered Intervention Network (SPIN) is an organization established
      by researchers, health care providers, and people living with scleroderma (systemic
      sclerosis; SSc) from Canada, the United States, Mexico, Australia, France, Spain, and the
      United Kingdom. The objectives of SPIN are (1) to assemble a large cohort of SSc patients who
      complete outcome assessments regularly in order to learn more about important problems faced
      by people living with SSc and (2) to develop and test a series of internet-based
      interventions to help patients manage problems related to SSc, including a self-management
      program (SPIN-SELF Program).

      In the SPIN-SELF feasibility trial, eligible SPIN Cohort participants will be randomized to
      be offered the SPIN-SELF Program (in addition to usual care) or to usual care only. The
      SPIN-SELF Program was designed by SPIN members based on key tenets of behaviour change that
      have been successfully incorporated in programs for more common diseases and on patient
      input. It utilizes social modelling through educational videos of SSc patients describing
      their challenges and what they have done to cope with SSc, as well as videos teaching key
      self-management techniques. After an introduction to self-management and instructions on how
      to navigate the program, a short quiz comprised of one-item questions will direct patients to
      modules that are most relevant to their symptoms and disease management challenges. The
      program's modules address (1) pain; (2) skin care, finger ulcers, and Raynaud's; (3) sleep
      problems; (4) fatigue; (5) gastrointestinal symptoms; (6) itch; (7) emotions and stress; (8)
      body image concerns due to disfigurement; and (9) effective communication with healthcare
      providers.

      The aim of the SPIN-SELF feasibility study is to collect data to assess the feasibility of
      planned procedures for the full-scale trial; required resources; and scientific aspects of
      the study (e.g., withdrawal rate, outcomes measures). These data will be used to determine
      whether it is feasible to carry out the main trial or whether changes need to be made before
      conducting a full-scale RCT of the SPIN-SELF Program.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The SPIN Cohort currently includes over 1800 SSc patients from 41 sites in Canada, the United
      States, Mexico, Australia, and France, Spain, and the United Kingdom. SPIN Cohort
      participants complete outcome measures via the Internet upon enrolment and subsequently every
      three months. SPIN utilizes the cohort multiple RCT (cmRCT) design as a framework for
      conducting trials of interventions. SPIN Cohort participants consent to allow personal data
      to be used for observational research, to assess intervention trial eligibility and, if
      eligible, to be randomized. Participants also consent that, if eligible and randomized to
      usual care, the participants' data can be used to evaluate intervention effectiveness without
      the participants being notified that they have been randomized to the usual care group and
      not offered the intervention. Thus, in SPIN trials, trial status is masked for participants
      in the control arm, who are not aware that they are participating in the trial, but not for
      participants in the intervention arm. The investigative team does not interact with patients
      for care provision or outcome assessment, which are done automatically via the internet.

      The SPIN-SELF feasibility study is embedded in the SPIN Cohort and will evaluate the
      feasibility of conducting a full-scale RCT of the SPIN-SELF Program. Investigators will
      randomize 40 SPIN Cohort participants with low disease management self-efficacy and an
      indicated interest in using an online self-management program to be offered the SPIN-SELF
      Program or usual care only.

      Randomization will occur at the time of participants' regular SPIN Cohort assessments.
      Eligible participants, based on questionnaire responses, will be randomized automatically
      using simple 3:2 randomization, using a feature in the SPIN Cohort platform, which provides
      immediate randomization and complete allocation sequence concealment.

      Feasibility outcomes include participant eligibility and recruitment, and numbers and
      percentages of participants who do not respond to follow-up measures. Use of the online
      intervention will be described by presenting the frequency of logins and time spent on the
      SPIN-SELF Program. Analysis of outcome measures will include the completeness of data and
      presence of floor or ceiling effects. Descriptive statistics will be used to provide means
      and standard deviations for the measures. Qualitative information and information related to
      management and usability of the SPIN-SELF Program will inform any necessary changes to the
      intervention or trial procedures.

    <description>The 6-item SEMCD Scale measures self-efficacy among patients with chronic medical conditions by asking them to rate their confidence that they can perform certain tasks related to managing their disease. Items are rated on a numerical scale ranging from 1 (not confident at all) to 10 (totally confident). The score for the scale is the mean of all item scores, with higher scores reflecting greater self-efficacy</description>

Items are scored on a 5-point scale (range 1-5), with different response options for different domains, and the single pain intensity item is measured on an 11-point rating scale. Higher scores represent more of the domain being measured</description>

    <description>The SPIN-SELF program utilizes social modelling through educational videos of scleroderma patients who describe their own challenges and what they have done to cope with living with scleroderma, as well as videos of patients and health professionals who teach key self-management techniques. The program includes sections on general self-management skills, including goal-setting and self-monitoring), progress tracking, sharing goals and progress with friends and family, and patient stories of experiences with using self-management techniques to cope with SSc symptoms. The program's 9 modules focus on (1) coping with pain; (2) skin care, finger ulcers and Raynaud's; (3) sleep problems; (4) fatigue; (5) gastrointestinal symptoms; (6) itch; (7) managing emotions and stress; (8) coping with body image concerns due to disfigurement; and (9) effective communication with healthcare providers.</description>
