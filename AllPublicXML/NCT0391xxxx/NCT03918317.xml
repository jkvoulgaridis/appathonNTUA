  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to to determine the efficacy and side effect profile following radiation
      therapy for participants with the AeroForm device placed. The AeroForm device is FDA
      approved.

      Primary objective:

      To assess the proportion of successful initial phase of tissue expander/implant based breast
      reconstructions (no reconstruction failure or unexpected return to the operating room)
      following post-mastectomy radiation therapy in participants with AeroFormplaced.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To evaluate the rate of successful exchange of tissue expander for implant

        -  To evaluate the rate of reconstruction revisions

        -  To evaluate CTCAE acute and chronic toxicity rates, infections and cosmetic outcomes

        -  To evaluate dosimetry to treatment targets as well as organs at risk (heart, lungs) with
           AeroFormas compared to traditional reconstruction techniques.

        -  To evaluate time to initiation of chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy.

        -  To evaluate clinical outcomes-local recurrence, regional recurrence, distant metastases,
           survival

        -  To evaluate participant breast reconstruction related QOL with the AirXpander
           AeroFormdevice

      This is a phase II trial evaluating the use of the intervention in participants with breast
      cancer undergoing post-mastectomy radiation therapy in order to define the toxicity profile
      and associated subsequent successful surgical reconstruction rate

    <description>The AeroFormdevice will be placed in an immediate fashion at the time of mastectomy in a submuscular, prepectoral or dual-plane approach. The tissue expander will be minimally inflated intraoperatively to minimize dead space and while facilitating tension free closure. Participants will undergo standard postoperative management, and will be given instructions on utilization of the device, including daily expansion until desired volume is reached as determined b surgeon and participant agreement.</description>

          -  Female subject of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum
             pregnancy within 72 hours prior to receiving CT simulation. If the urine test is
             positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required.

          -  Subjects must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written
             informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with metastatic disease

          -  Subjects receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Subjects treated with non-standard radiotherapy (hypofractionation,
             hyperfractionation, partial breast/axilla)

          -  Subjects with active infection requiring IV antibiotics

          -  Subject has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or
             laboratoryabnormality that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the
             subject's participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best
             interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

          -  Subjects with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing
             or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris,
             cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit
             compliance with study requirements.

          -  Subject has received prior radiation therapy to neck, breast, or chest or other area
             that will result in overlap.

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding women or expecting to conceive children within the projected
             duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit through 120
             days after the last day of trial treatment are excluded from this study because of the
             potential toxicities of radiation therapy. Additionally, because there is an unknown,
             but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the
             mother with AirXpanders, breastfeeding women will be excluded. These potential risks
             may also apply to other agents used in this study.
