  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators study 160 patients undergoing spinal surgery.Participants will be randomly
      divided into study group and control group.The study group will receive controlled
      hypotension by nitroglycerin and be divided into 3 groups according to CI.

      This study will be done in Guangzhou Red Cross Hospital .The investigators study 160 patients
      aged from 45 to 70 years,weight from 48 to 68kg classified as American Society of
      Anesthesiologists (ASAs) physical status Ⅰ-Ⅱ who will be candidate for posterior
      decompression of vertebral canal,discectomy and internal fixation by pediclescrew(one
      centrum).The investigators excluded patients with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular
      diseases,hepatic or renal dysfunction,and patients receiving drugs that interfere with
      coagulation before surgery.

      Patients randomly divided into study group(group H,n=120)and control group (group C,n=40).The
      study group according to CI(Cardiac Index) levels of intraoperative hypotension period(mean
      of CI at T2,T3,T4) were divided into three groups: 1st group: CI: 1.5-2.0 L /(min•m2), 2nd
      group: CI: 2.0-3.0 L /(min•m2), 3rd group: CI: 3.0-4.0 L /(min•m2),and which CI &lt; 1.5 or CI &gt;
      4.0 was eliminated the experimental group, which, in control group, CI&lt; 2.5 or CI &gt;4.0 was
      eliminated the experimental group.
