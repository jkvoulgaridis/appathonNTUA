  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is currently a gap within the literature as to the effects of a thrust versus
      non-thrust mobilizations techniques specifically to the upper cervical spine C0-C3 along with
      home exercise program to help reduce frequency and intensity of cervicogenic headaches.
      Therefore, the purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of in treating headaches
      using non-thrust or thrust mobilizations in addition to postural corrective exercises on
      patient outcomes measures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cervicogenic headaches are classified as secondary headaches and typically rise from a
      musculoskeletal, cervical spine, disc, or soft tissue elements and are accompanied by neck
      pain. Dominant features of cervicogenic headache include unilateral head pain, external
      pressure over the ipsilateral upper neck, limited cervical range of motion, and trigger
      attacks by various neck motions. Cervicogenic headaches typically originate from the
      atlanto-occipital and upper 3 segments of the cervical spine and can radiate to the head or
      face region. Physical therapist have for some time been treating cervicogenic headaches with
      a variety of different treatment techniques ranging from conservative therapy, passive and
      active range of motion, stretching for cervical, strengthening exercises for the upper
      extremity, and manual therapy. However, little is known about the effects of thrust and
      non-thrust manipulative physical therapy treatments along with exercises to help reduce
      cervicogenic headaches. The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of physical
      therapy in treating headaches using non-thrust to the upper 3 segments of the cervical spine
      or thrust mobilizations to the upper 3 segments, plus the addition of postural corrective
      exercises in treating cervicogenic headaches.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Neck Disability Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4-weeks and 1-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Neck Disability Index contains 10 items, seven related to activities of daily living, two related to pain, and one item related to concentration. Each item is scored from 0-5 and the total score is expressed as a percentage, with higher scores corresponding to greater disability.</description>

    <measure>Numeric Pain Rating scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 hour, 48 hours, 4-weeks and 1-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be asked to indicate the intensity of their pain using an 11-point scale ranging from 0 (&quot;no pain&quot;) to 10 (&quot;worst pain imaginable&quot;).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Headache Impact Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4-weeks and 1-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Headache Impact Test is a 6 item self-report, questionnaire and the responses on all questions are summed to produce a total score ranging from 36 to 78, with higher scores indicating a greater impact of headache on daily life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Global Rating of Change Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>48 hours, 4-weeks and 1-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be asked to rate their overall perception of improvement since beginning treatment on a scale ranging from -7 (a very great deal worse) to zero (about the same) to +7 (a very great deal better).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Acceptable Symptom State</measure>
    <time_frame>4-weeks and 1-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Acceptable Symptom State (PASS) is used to define the level of symptoms beyond which patients consider themselves well. The PASS question: &quot;Taking into account all the activities you have during your daily life, your level of pain, and also your functional impairment, do you consider that your current state is satisfactory?&quot; with response options &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Active cervical range of motion</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 hour, 48 hours, 4-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The active cervical range of motion (ACROM) assessment of the cervical spine will include flexion and extension in the sagittal plane, lateral flexion in the frontal plane and rotation in the transverse plane. A single inclinometer and Cervical Range of Motion Device will be used to collect ACROM.</description>

    <description>Once therapist has assessed subject and has found the patients most comparable sign they will be performing a high velocity thrust at the end of the patients available range, as described by Maitland's Approach. The thrust will be performed only once. The therapist will perform either a localized cervical rotation thrust which primary movement is rotation or a longitudinal cephalad C1 and C2 thrust, both targeting the upper cervical spine.</description>
