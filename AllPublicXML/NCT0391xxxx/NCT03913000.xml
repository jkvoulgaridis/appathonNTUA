        Inclusion Criteria:

        All subjects:

          -  Signed informed consent in a language understandable to the subject prior to any
             study-mandated procedure.

          -  Male and female subjects aged between 18 and 79 years (inclusive) at screening.

          -  Body mass index (BMI) of 18.0 to 34.0 kg/m2 (inclusive) at screening. Body weight of
             at least 50 kg.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening
             and a negative urine pregnancy test on Day-1. They must consistently and correctly use
             (from at least first dosing, during the entire study, and for at least 30 days after
             last study treatment intake) a highly effective method of contraception with a failure
             rate of &lt; 1% per year and must use condoms, diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide,
             or be sexually abstinent. Hormonal contraceptive must be initiated at least 1 month
             before study treatment administration.

        Renal function impairment subjects:

        • At screening and on Day -1, the stage of renal function impairment will be defined by
        Creatinine Clearance (CLcr) by the Cockcroft-Gault (C-G) equation:

          -  Mild renal function impairment: CLcr 60-89 mL/min (Group A).

          -  Moderate renal function impairment: CLcr 30-59 mL/min (Group B).

          -  Severe renal function impairment: CLcr &lt;30 mL/min (Group C).

        The stage of renal impairment will need to be confirmed at Day -1 and the CLcr values on
        Day -1 will need to remain within ± 25% of the screening value.

        Healthy subjects:

        • Normal renal function confirmed by a CLcr ≥ 90 mL/min. Normal renal function will need to
        be confirmed at Day -1 and the CLcr value on Day -1 will need to remain within ± 25% of the
        screening value.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        All subjects:

          -  Pregnant or lactating women.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to ID-085 or treatments of the same class, or any of its
             excipients.

          -  Known hypersensitivity or allergy to natural rubber latex.

          -  Any circumstances or conditions, which, in the opinion of the investigator, may affect
             full participation in the study or compliance with the protocol.

        Renal function impairment subjects:

          -  Subjects on dialysis.

          -  Hemoglobin concentration &lt; 9 g/dL.

          -  Serum potassium concentration &gt; 6 mmol/L.

          -  Platelet count &lt; 100 × 10^6/mL.

          -  History of severe renal stenosis.

          -  History of clinically relevant bleeding disorder.

          -  Gastrointestinal bleeding within 2 weeks prior to screening.

          -  Presence of unstable diabetes mellitus.
