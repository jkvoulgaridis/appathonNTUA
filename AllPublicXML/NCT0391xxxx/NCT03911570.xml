  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to retrospectively evaluate the symptomatic effects of
      crystalline glucosamine sulfate (GS), prescribed for the actually approved indication of knee
      OA, in addition to conventional therapy, in comparison to the conventional therapy alone in
      patients with primary hand osteoarthritis (HOA).This is a 6-months retrospective comparative
      study including patients with concomitant knee and primary HOA, according to the ACR
      criteria. To be eligible the patients had to present clinical symptoms of hand OA for at
      least 3 months, defined as global hand pain score superior to 40 mm on a 0-100 Visual
      Analogue Scale (VAS) and a Functional Index for Hand Osteoarthritis (FIHOA) score of at least
      6. Furthermore, the patients have had a radiographic evidence of HOA within the previous 6
      months with a Kellgren-Lawrence score of II-III. The participants are stratified into two
      groups based on whether or not crystalline GS at the daily dose of 1500 mg was added to the
      conventional therapy for HOA, including exercise, acetaminophen and non steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors. Primary outcome
      measures are the difference between the two groups in the change of VAS pain and in the
      FIHOA, from baseline after 6 months. Secondary outcomes were health assessment questionnaire
      (HAQ), medical outcomes study 36-item short form (SF-36) and symptomatic drugs consumption.

    <time_frame>Basal time; one month; three months; six months</time_frame>
    <description>The FIHOA score represents a quantitative measure of functional disability of the hands; it contains 10 items and is an investigator-administered questionnaire. Patients are asked to answer each item using a four-point Likert scale: 0 = possible without difficulty, 1 = possible with slight difficulty, 2 = possible with considerable difficulty, 3 = impossible; the range of scores is 0-30 and the highest values indicate the worst functionality. The validate Italian version of FIHOA is used for the present study.</description>

    <measure>Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Basal time; one month; three months; six months</time_frame>
    <description>HAQ is a self administered questionnaire developed to measure disability consisting of 8 sections: dressing arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and activities and ranging from 0 to 3 with a higher score corresponding to worse disability</description>

    <time_frame>Basal time; one month; three months; six months</time_frame>
    <description>SF-36 is a widely used measure of health and wellbeing, including two main domains, mental and physical component summary (MCS and PCS respectively), that investigates 8 different areas of perceived health, such as physical functioning, physical role, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, emotional role and mental health. Scores range from &quot;0 to 100&quot; where &quot;0&quot; indicates the worst condition and &quot;100&quot; indicates the best possible condition</description>

        The participants were stratified into two groups based on whether or not (GS Group and
        Control Group) crystalline GS treatment, prescribed for the actually approved indication of
        knee OA, was added to the conventional therapy. This stratification was based on regrouping
        patients with similar clinical characteristics at baseline.
