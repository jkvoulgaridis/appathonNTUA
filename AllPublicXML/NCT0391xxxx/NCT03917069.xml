    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled clinical trial of nab-paclitaxel + carboplatin

        -  Endostatin for advanced melanoma after failure of PD-1 therapy. The aim was to evaluate
           the efficacy and safety of nab-paclitaxel+carboplatin

        -  endostatin versus combination of paclitaxel and carboplatin in patients with advanced
           melanoma after failure of PD-1 therapy.

      The enrollment time is expected to be 1.5 year and the observation time is 2 years. The
      regimen were performed on a 28-day/21-day cycle respectively. Subjects who met the entry
      criteria were treated in a 2:1 group according to a randomized list: the treatment group was
      treated with nab-paclitaxel + carboplatin + endostatin regimen, and the control group was
      treated with paclitaxel + carboplatin. In this trial, the efficacy is evaluated every 8 weeks
      until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity,or until the investigator deemed that the
      patient's condition was unacceptable for further treatment. The follow-up period was 24
      months after the end of treatment (follow-up patient survival information and new anti-tumor
      treatment). The planning enrolled sample size for nab-paclitaxel + carboplatin + endostatin
      group and paclitaxel-carboplatin group were 90 patients and 45 patients, respectively.
