  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Girls with obesity and polycystic ovarian syndrome will receive either glucagon like
      peptide-1 receptor agonist therapy or a dietary intervention for 12 weeks to decrease the
      metabolic syndrome, in particular to lower hepatic fat and improve insulin sensitivity.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In obese girls with polycystic ovarian syndrome, testosterone and obesity combine to create
      unique pathology to increase metabolic disease including fatty liver and insulin resistance,
      which may be mediated by altered glucagon like peptide-1 activity. The investigators will
      treat girls with obesity and polycystic ovarian syndrome for 4 months with a glucagon like
      peptide-1 receptor agonist compared to dietary intervention to primarily lower hepatic fat
      and secondarily improve whole body and adipose insulin sensitivity. Mechanisms of hepatic
      metabolism, including rates of de novo lipogenesis and relative mitochondrial flux will also
      be assessed.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Sedentary- less than 2 hours of moderate (jogging, swimming etc) exercise a week.

          2. BMI equal or greater than the 90th percentile for age and gender

          3. PCOS per the most stringent NIH criteria adapted for adolescents (irregular menses &gt;12
             months post-menarche and clinical or biochemical hypertestosteronemia

          4. Participants cannot be on hormonal contraception, so participants should remain
             abstinent or use reliable non-hormonal contraception (e.g. copper IUD) for the entire
             study period. For participants who receive semaglutide, they should avoid pregnancy
             for at least 2 months after stopping medication to avoid fetal exposure to the
             medication.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosed with or have a family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) or
