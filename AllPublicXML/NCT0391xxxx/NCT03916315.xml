    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effectiveness of The Unified Transdiagnostic Protocol, a
      psychological treatment for the intervention of a broad range of anxiety disorders. It is
      compared the effectiveness of the treatment with the changes of the same participants before
      and after the treatment and a control group. The changes are being assessed through
      subjective measures such as psychometrics and objective measures such as
      Electroencelophalography.

    <textblock>
      Anxiety disorders are among the highest prevalence of disorders in the general population
      worldwide, however, in the last decades they were treated by separate.

      However, it has been proposed that several emotional disorders have a common root and can be
      treated similarly. This is called the Unified Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of
      Emotional Disorders. The treatment has as objective to be implemented from 11 to 17 sessions,
      with 8 modules. This treatment can be applied to a bigger range of disorders, not only
      anxiety disorder, however, the objective of this study is to focus on the most urgent
      disorders in the border of Mexico and USA, that are anxiety disorders. According to the
      available scientific literature, this is the first time that this study has been applied in
      Mexican population. This study will have an intervention group that will receive the
      transdiagnostic treatment, and a control group that will be in a waiting list, and after the
      waiting list and the measured took place these patients will also receive the treatment. In
      both conditions the participants will be measured pre and post. The subjective measures will
      include the following psychometrics:

        1. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Symptom Scale (PSS).

        2. Interview Program for Anxiety Disorders.

        3. Beck Depression Inventory.

        4. State Trait Anxiety Inventory.

        5. Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale .

        6. Big Five Inventory.

        7. Scale of Beck's Suicidal Ideation.

        8. Yale-BrownObsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS)

      Also it is planned to measure the brain activity through an electroencephalogram,
      specifically the Gamma rhythm. It has been observed that when patients with General Anxiety
      disorder are emotionally aroused their Gamma rhythm increases. Part of the objectives of this
      study is to replicate the procedure by Oathes et al., that consist in measuring the brain
      activity of the participants with an electroencephalogram of 17 channels, following these
      steps: 2 minutes' base line, 5 minute relaxation and 5 minutes emotionally aroused, in their
      study it was observed in the patients that the Gamma rhythm was lower in the relaxation
      phase, increasing at the base line and having the highest record in the emotionally aroused
      minutes. To perform this measure, it will be used the EMOTIVE EPOC + of 14 channels is
      non-invasive, painless, low cost method Used for scientific research. The 14 channels with
      which the device counts. It allows to measure the cerebral areas AF3, F7, F3, FC5, T7, P7,
      O1, O2, P8, T8, FC6, F4, F8, AF4, based on the international system 10-20.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Decrease in the scores of the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Symptom Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>3 to 4.5 months, depending on the development of the patient and the sessions needed, 11 to 17.</time_frame>
    <description>The Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Symptom Scale is a 17-item structured interview. The severity over the last 2 weeks of each item on the PSS is rated by the interviewer using a 4-point scale: 0 = not at all, 1 = a little bit, 2 = somewhat, and 3 = very much. The maximum possible score is 51 (severely affected) and the minimum possible score is 0 (total absence of the symptoms). The total severity score is calculated as the sum of the severity ratings for the 17 items. The diagnosis of the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Symptom Scale is made when at least 1 re-experiencing, 3 avoidance and 2 arousal symptoms are endorsed on the scale by individuals who were traumatized at least one month prior to the assessment. It is expected a statistical significant decrease (P &lt; 0.05) in the symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder in the patients suffering from this disorder.</description>

    <time_frame>3 to 4.5 months, depending on the development of the patient and the sessions needed, 11 to 17.</time_frame>
    <description>The State Trait Anxiety Inventory consists of two subscales of 20 items each that measure anxiety as a transient state of tension (Scale A-State), and as a characteristic of the personality relatively stable over time (Scale B -trait). The items are composed by an assertion to which the subject responds indicating their degree of identification. In the case of state anxiety, the scale goes from 1 (not at all), 2 (somewhat), 3 (moderately), 4 (very much), while in the trait anxiety it ranges from 1 (almost never), 2 (sometimes), 3 (often), 4 (almost always). In both, a percentage of the items evaluates well-being or absence of anxiety, while the rest of the items to the presence of anxiety. Scores range from 20 to 80, in each subscale, with higher scores correlating with greater anxiety. It is expected a statistical significant decrease (P &lt; 0.05) in the anxiety symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Decrease in the symptoms of depression</measure>
    <time_frame>3 to 4.5 months, depending on the development of the patient and the sessions needed, 11 to 17.</time_frame>
    <description>The Beck Depression Inventory is a self-report that provides a measure of the presence and severity of depression. Contains 21 items indicative of symptoms such as sadness, crying, loss of pleasure, feelings of failure and guilt, suicidal thoughts or desires, pessimism, etc. Each item is answered on a 4-point scale, from 0 to 3, where each number is identified different for each item, in all of them 0 means absence and 3 full presence (e.g. sadness), except for items 16 (changes in the sleep pattern) and 18 (changes in appetite) that contain 7 categories. The minimum and maximum scores in the test are 0 and 63. Cut-off points ha that allow to classify those evaluated in one of the following four groups: 0-13, minimum depression; 14-19, mild depression; 20-28, moderate depression; and 29-63, severe depression. It is expected a statistical significant decrease (P &lt; 0.05) in the depression symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Decrease in the symptoms of General Anxiety Disorder</measure>
    <time_frame>3 to 4.5 months, depending on the development of the patient and the sessions needed, 11 to 17.</time_frame>
    <description>On the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale subjects are asked how often, during the last 2 weeks, they have been bothered by each of the 7 core symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder. Response options are &quot;not at all,&quot; &quot;several days,&quot; &quot;more than half the days,&quot; and &quot;nearly every day,&quot; scored as 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Therefore, GAD-7 scores range from 0 to 21, with scores of â¥5, â¥10, and â¥15 representing mild, moderate, and severe anxiety symptom levels, respectively. It is expected a statistical significant decrease (P &lt; 0.05) in the General Anxiety symptoms.</description>

    <description>The Yale-BrownObsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) is composed of 10 items: 5 related to obsessions and the other 5, to compulsions, having an answer option from 0 to 4 (from not presenting a symptom until presenting extreme symptoms). The diagnostic classification is based on the points of cut where 0 to 7 represents &quot;without clinical manifestations&quot;, 8 to 15, &quot;mild&quot;, 16 to 23, &quot;moderate&quot;, 24 to 31 as &quot;severe&quot; and 32 to 40 as &quot;extreme&quot;. It is expected a statistical significant decrease (P &lt; 0.05) in the Obsesive Compulsive symptoms.</description>
