  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inappropriate medication prescribing is highly prevalent among comorbid medical patients and
      leading to adverse drug events (ADE), re-admissions, quality of life and mortality. Thus, the
      aim of this study is primary to investigate the feasibility of a interdisciplinary
      intervention focused on deprescribing and medication optimization in the Integrated
      Outpatient Department at Copenhagen University Hospital, Amager, Denmark.

      Participants in the intervention group receives a medication review by a clinical pharmacist
      and physician with a follow up after 7 and 30 days. The control group receives standard care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The FMA-CPH trial is designed as a single-blinded randomized controlled pilot trial starting
      at the first consultation and end 30 days after.

      Patients that meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria are invited to
      participate. After signing a written informed consent, the participants are block randomized
      to either the intervention or control group.

      Medication prescription for comorbid patients is challenging and may be attributed to marked
      inter-individual variations in general health, organ function, pharmacokinetic and
      pharmacodynamic properties, biological age and physical performance. The intervention group
      receive a medication review.

      It is hypothesized that the intervention is feasible and more patients in the intervention
      group will complete ≥1 deprescribing and/or ≥1 medication optimization 30 days after the
      beginning of the intervention than the patients in the control group.

      Secondary it is hypothesized the patients in the intervention group:

      A. Complete more deprescribing compared to the control group (30 days after intervention) B.
      Complete more medication optimization compared to the control group (30 days after
      intervention) C. Have a higher knowledge about own medication (14 days after intervention) D.
      Have a higher level of satisfaction with medication information (14 days after intervention)

    <description>The clinical pharmacist perform medication review and presents medication interventions orally and written to the physician. The physician perform the changes and inform the patient about the changes. 7 days after intervention the patient receives a follow up phone call from the pharmacist about the medication interventions. If the pharmacist during the follow up phone call identify any complications due to compliance/add on/deprescribing the pharmacist uses motivational conversation to come to a solution.14 days after the beginning of the intervention the patients knowledge about their medication and satisfaction with medication information is investigated by a phone questionnaire and measured on a Likert scale (1-5). 30 days after the beginning of the intervention the pharmacist collect an updated medication history. Finally we investigate the number of patients who have completed at least one deprescribing and/or medication optimization in each group.</description>
