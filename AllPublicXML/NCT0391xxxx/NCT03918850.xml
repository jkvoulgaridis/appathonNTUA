  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of treating opioid use disorder
      (OUD) in pregnant women with extended-release buprenorphine (BUP-XR), compared to sublingual
      buprenorphine (BUP-SL), on mother and infant outcomes. The primary hypothesis is that the
      BUP-XR group will not have greater illicit opioid use than the BUP-SL group during pregnancy
      (non-inferiority).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an intent-to-treat, two-arm, open-label, pragmatic randomized controlled trial.
      Eligible participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to BUP-XR or BUP-SL, balancing on
      site, estimated gestational age (EGA) at time of randomization (6 weeks-18 weeks vs. 19
      weeks-30 weeks), and whether they are on BUP-SL at the time of randomization (yes vs. no).
      Participants will be provided with study medication and attend weekly medication visits
      through 12 months postpartum.

          3. have a single fetus pregnancy (can be based on self-report if an objective assessment
             is unavailable)

          4. meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM)-5 criteria for moderate/severe OUD and be

          7. be enrolled in outpatient addiction treatment at a participating site (e.g., have
             completed intake)

          8. be able to understand the study, and having understood, provide written informed
             consent in English

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Potential participants must not:

          1. have a physiological dependence on alcohol or sedatives requiring medical
             detoxification

          2. have a psychiatric condition that, in the judgment of the site medical clinician (MC),
             would make study participation unsafe or which would make treatment compliance
             difficult. Examples include:

               -  Suicidal or homicidal ideation requiring immediate attention

               -  Severe, inadequately-treated mental health disorder (e.g., active psychosis,
                  uncontrolled bipolar disorder)

          3. have a medical condition that, in the judgment of the study MC, would make study
             participation unsafe or which would make treatment compliance difficult. Medical
             conditions that may compromise participant safety or study conduct include, but are
             not limited to, allergy/sensitivity to study medications and the following based on
             clinical labs:

               -  aspartate aminotransferase (AST) / alanine aminotransferase (ALT) greater than 5X
                  upper limit of normal

               -  serum creatinine greater than 1.5X upper limit of normal

               -  total bilirubin greater than 1.5X upper limit of normal

          4. be currently in jail, prison or any inpatient overnight facility as required by court
             of law or have pending legal action or other situation (e.g., unstable living
             arrangements) that, in the judgement of the site investigator, could prevent
             participation in the study or in any study activities;

          5. be currently receiving methadone or naltrexone for the treatment of OUD;

          6. be enrolled in or planning to enroll in treatment beyond the level of 3.1 (clinically
             managed low-intensity residential services) of the American Society of Addiction
             Medicine criteria

          7. be enrolled in or planning to enroll in: a) a trial testing medication for managing
             OUD during pregnancy; b) research testing an intervention for substance use disorder
             or NOWS in their infant unless they are willing to provide a release for the research
             records.
