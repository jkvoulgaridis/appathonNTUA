  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Among aged patients with poor ovarian reservation(defined as age 35 to 42 years; antral
      follicle count（AFC）≤ 5 or anti-mullerian hormone（AMH）≤ 1.2 ng/ml), cumulative live birth
      rate(CLBR) and time to live birth(TTLB) of the first stimulation cycle were compared between
      a starting dose of 300IU or 150IU rFSH in controlled ovarian stimulation with
      gonadotropin-releasing hormone（GnRH）antagonist protocol. This study is a prospective
      randomized controlled trial.

    <measure>Cumulative live birth rate</measure>
    <time_frame>22 months</time_frame>
    <description>Live birth is defined as the delivery of any viable infant at 28 weeks or more of gestation after our interventions。And cumulative live birth rate is calculated by dividing the number of women achieving live birth after transfers of all study-specific embryos (within 1 year after randomization) by the total number of women randomized to the specific group.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to live birth</measure>
    <time_frame>22 months</time_frame>
    <description>Time to live birth is defined as the interval between the date of randomization and achieving live birth.</description>

    <measure>Cycle cancellation rate</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Cycle cancellation is defined as cycle cancelled before obtaining at least one viable embryo for any reason. And cycle cancellation rate is calculated by dividing the number of women cancelled their cycle before obtaining at least one viable embryo for any reason by the total number of women randomized to the specific group.</description>

    <measure>Cumulative Clinic pregnancy rate</measure>
    <time_frame>14 months</time_frame>
    <description>Clinic pregnancy will be diagnosed with the detection of an intrauterine gestation sac. And cumulative clinic pregnancy rate is calculated by the number of women who achieves clinical pregnancy after transfers of all study-specific embryos (within 1 year after randomization) by the total number of women randomized to the specific group.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>cumulative pregnancy loss rate</measure>
    <time_frame>19 months</time_frame>
    <description>Pregnancy loss is defined as a complete spontaneous abortion or a nonviable pregnancy before 28 weeks of gestation. And cumulative pregnancy loss rate is calculated as the number of pregnancy losses / number of clinical pregnancy after transfers of all study-specific embryos (within 1 year after randomization).</description>

    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Good quality embryo is defined as embryo that is graded as 6CII or better or blastocyst. And good quality embryo rate is calculated by dividing the number of good quality embryo by the total number of embryo obtained after fertilization in the specific group.</description>
