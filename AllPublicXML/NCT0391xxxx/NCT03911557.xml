      This study will examine whether patients with relapsed/refractory solid tumors harboring
      evidence of somatic hypermutation (intermediate versus high tumor mutational burden) will
      exhibit improvement in disease progression-free survival with dual Tremelimumab and
      Durvalumab treatment.

      This study is phase II basket trial to evaluate the benefit of immunotherapy (Durvalumab and
      Tremelimumab combination) in treatment of relapse/refractory solid tumor patients whose
      tumors express a high tumor mutational burden (TMB high &gt;20 mutations/MB) or moderate tumor
      mutational burden (10-20 mutations/MB) as based on next generation sequencing (NGS). The
      primary endpoint of the study is the TTP (time-to-progression) ratio or growth modulation
      index (GMI) which is defined for individual patients as the ratio of their TTP on the current
      therapy to their TTP on the most recent previous therapy.

             age-specific requirements apply:

         12. Women &lt;50 years of age would be considered post-menopausal if they have been
             amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal treatments
             and if they have luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone levels in the
             post-menopausal range for the institution or underwent surgical sterilization
             (bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy)

         13. Women ≥50 years of age would be considered post-menopausal if they have been
             amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal

         14. Females of childbearing potential who are sexually active with a non-sterilized male
             partner must use at least 1 highly effective method of contraception from the time of
             screening and must agree to continue using such precaution for 180 days after the last
             dose of durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy or 90 days after the last dose
             of durvalumab monotherapy. Non-sterilized male partners of female patient must use
             male condom plus spermicide throughout this period. Cessation of birth control after
             this point should be discussed with a responsible physician. Not engaging in sexual
             activity for the total duration of the drug treatment and the drug washout period is
             an acceptable practice; however, periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the
             withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of birth control. Female patients should
             also refrain from breastfeeding throughout this period.

         15. Non-sterilized males who are sexually active with a female partner of childbearing
             potential must use a male condom plus spermicide from screening through 180 days after
             receipt of the final dose of durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy or 90 days
             after receipt of the final dose of durvalumab monotherapy. Not engaging in sexual
             activity is an acceptable practice; however, occasional abstinence, the rhythm method,
             and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of contraception. Male patients
             should refrain from sperm donation throughout this period

             access an available archival tumor sample taken less than 6 months prior to study
             enrollment if a fresh tumor biopsy is not feasible with an acceptable clinical risk
             and no antecedent treatment has been done.

             informed consent

          7. History of another primary malignancy except for

               1. Malignancy treated with curative intent and with no known active disease ≥5 years

          9. Patients with untreated brain metastases, spinal cord compression, or leptomeningeal
             carcinomatosis should be excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor
             prognosis, because of symptoms that may arise form inflammatory reactions, and because
             they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the
             evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events. Patients whose brain metastases
             have been treated may participate provided they show radiographic stability (defined
             as 2 brain images, both of which are obtained after treatment to the brain metastases.
             These imaging scans should both be obtained at least four weeks apart and show no
             evidence of intracranial progression). In addition, any neurologic symptoms that
             developed either as a result of the brain metastases or their treatment must have
             resolved or be stable either, without the use of steroids, or are stable on a steroid

             local practice), hepatitis B (known positive HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) result),
             hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency virus (positive HIV 1/2 antibodies). Patients
             with a past or resolved HBV infection (defined as the presence of hepatitis B core
             antibody [anti-HBc] and absence of HBsAg) are eligible. Patients positive for
             hepatitis C (HCV) antibody are eligible only if polymerase chain reaction is negative
             for HCV RNA

         12. Current or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 14 days before the first
             dose of durvalumab or tremelimumab. The following are exceptions to this criterion:

             Patients, if enrolled, should not receive live vaccine whilst receiving IP and up to
             30 days after the last dose of IP

         14. Female patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding or male or female patients of
             reproductive potential who are not willing to employ effective birth control from
             screening to 90 days after the last dose of durvalumab monotherapy or180 days after
             the last dose of durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy

         15. Known allergy or hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs or any of the study drug
             excipients.

         16. Prior exposure to immune mediated therapy with anti-PD-1/ anti-PDL1including
