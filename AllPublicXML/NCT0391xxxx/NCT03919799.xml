      Phase II Diffuse Cutaneous Systemic Sclerosis study seeking to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of KD025. Upon eligibility confirmation, a total of sixty (60) adult subjects will be
      enrolled and randomized into three (3) groups (1:1:1) to either receive orally administered
      KD025 (two doses) or matched placebo for 28 weeks. The study will be double-blinded for the
      first 28 weeks followed by an open label extension period of 24 weeks. After un-blinding, the
      subjects on KD025 will continue on the same KD025 dose whereas the subjects in the placebo
      group will be re-randomized to one of the KD025 doses.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a chronic autoimmune disease that causes widespread microvascular
      damage and excessive deposition of collagen in the skin and internal organs. Limited
      cutaneous systemic sclerosis is primarily cutaneous, affecting the hands, arms, and face.
      Diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis (dcSSc) is a more serious manifestation of the disease
      and is often rapidly progressive, not only involving the skin, but also involving internal
      organs including kidney, heart, and lungs.

      Subjects who have signed an IRB/IEC-approved informed consent form and met all of the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled. A total of sixty (60) subjects will be
      randomized into three (3) groups (1:1:1) to receive orally administered KD025 200 mg once
      daily (QD; n = 20), KD025 200 mg twice daily (BID; n = 20), or matched placebo (n = 20) for
      28 weeks. The study will be double-blinded for the first 28 weeks followed by an open-label
      extension of 24 weeks. After unblinding, the subjects in Group 1 and 2 will continue on the
      same KD025 dose whereas the subjects in the placebo group will be re-randomized to one of the
      KD025 doses (200 mg QD or 200 mg BID) in 1:1 fashion.

To determine the validity and usefulness of a modified Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) for measurement of disease status and changes in disease status over time in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc). The HAQ-DI scale consists of 20 questions referring to eight component sets: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and activities. The total score indicates the participant's self-assessed level of disability. There are four possible responses for each component: 0 = without any difficulty; 1 = with some difficulty; 2 = with much difficulty; 3 = unable to do. The HAQ-DI is the sum of the domain scores, divided by the number of domains that have a score (i.e. the average score), with total range of 0 to 3, higher scores showing larger functional limitation.</description>

Each VAS item is rated separately (0âˆ’100 millimeters [mm]), with higher scores indicating more severe disease. The five items are: 1) intestinal disease, 2) breathing problem, 3) Raynaud syndrome, 4) finger ulcers, and 5) overall disease.</description>

             (â‰¤ 25 mg/week) for at least 4 weeks

          6. Adequate organ and bone marrow functions evaluated during the twenty-eight (28) days
             prior to enrollment as follows:

               1. Absolute neutrophil count â‰¥ 1.5 Ã— 10^9/L

          7. Female subjects of childbearing potential have a negative pregnancy test at screening.
             Females of childbearing potential are defined as sexually mature women without prior

             However, women who have been amenorrheic for twelve (12) or more months are still
             considered to be of childbearing potential if the amenorrhea is possibly due to prior
             chemotherapy, anti-estrogens, or ovarian suppression.

               1. Women of childbearing potential (i.e., menstruating women) must have a negative
                  urine pregnancy test (positive urine tests are to be confirmed by serum test)
                  documented within the 24-hour period prior to the first dose of study drug.

               2. Sexually active women of childbearing potential enrolled in the study must agree
                  to use two forms of accepted methods of contraception during the course of the
                  study and for three (3) months after their last dose of study drug. Effective

                  hormonal contraception for at least 3 months (e.g., oral, injectable, implant,
                  transdermal) plus one barrier method; or (iii) two barrier methods. Effective
                  barrier methods are male or female condoms, diaphragms, and spermicides (creams
                  or gels that contain a chemical to kill sperm), or a vasectomized partner.

          8. For male patients who are sexually active and who are partners of premenopausal women:
             agreement to use two (2) forms of contraception as in criterion number 7 above during
             the treatment period and for at least three (3) months after the last dose of study
             drug.

          9. Male Subjects must not donate sperm for three (3) months after last dose of study
             drug.

         10. Able to provide written informed consent prior to the performance of any
             study-specific procedures.

             days of study entry (for studies involving biologics, within three half-lives of the
             biologic);

          4. History or other evidence of severe illness or any other conditions that would make
             the subject, in the opinion of the Investigator, unsuitable for the study;

          5. Chronic heart failure with New York Heart Association Class II,III or IV;

          6. Positive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) test;

          7. Active hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), or positive tuberculin skin
             test;

          8. Diagnosed with any malignancy within three (3) years of enrollment, with the exception
             of basal cell or completely resected squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, resected in
             situ cervical malignancy, resected breast ductal carcinoma in situ, or low-risk
             prostate cancer after curative resection;

          9. Has had previous exposure to KD025 or known allergy/sensitivity to KD025, or any other
