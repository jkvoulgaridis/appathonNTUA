    <textblock>
      A retrospective study was done on the medical records for 24 rectal cancer patients underwent
      robotic proctectomy from September 2017 to July 2018 at the First Afﬁliated Hospital of Xi'an
      Jiaotong University.In the same department,a total of 25 patients who treated with
      laparoscopic proctectomy and 24 patients underwent open proctectomy were were selected as
      controls in a 1:1:1 ratio. Comparing the perioperative conditions and hospitalization related
      costs of the three groups.
