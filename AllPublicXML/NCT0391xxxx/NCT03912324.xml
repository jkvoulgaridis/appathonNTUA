  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      New parameters or methods, such as ablation index, have been developed for the quantification
      of high-frequency energy used in pulmonary vein isolation, but there is no known method for
      atrial fibrillation considering individual differences in atrial tissue. The atrium is only
      1/3 of the thickness of the ventricle and is thinner in women and older than men or young
      people.

      The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of radiofrequency energy
      therapy using atrial individual differences. In order to reflect the thickness of the atrium,
      we will use the unipolar and bipolar maps and the myocardial thickness map using computed
      tomography (CT) images. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of energy titration therapy by
      random assignment of high frequency energy therapy group, CT image application high frequency
      energy therapy group, and existing empirical high frequency therapy group.

      A. Study design

        1. Prospective randomization (Unipolar voltage subtraction map guided PV(pulmonary vein)
           isolation group vs. CT myocardial thickness map guided PV isolation group vs. Empirical
           PV isolation group )

        2. Target number of subjects: 480 (160 per group)

        3. Rhythm FU : 2012 ACC/AHA/ESC guidelines (Holter monitoring at the baseline, 2 month, and
           thereafter every 6 months; ECG if the patient has any symptom)

        4. Anticoagulant therapy followed by 2014 ACC/AHA/ESC guidelines

        5. All complications in each group will be evaluated including the re-hospitalization rate,
           major cardiovascular event, and mortality rate.

      B. Progress and rhythm/ECG follow-up

        1. To be performed in accordance with the 2012 ACC/AHA/HRS guidelines for AF management

        2. Follow-up at 1 weeks, 3 months, and thereafter every 6-month after procedure.

        3. Rhythm control at 3 months, and thereafter every 6-month follow-up with Holter

        4. If the patient complains of symptoms, ECG will be performed at any time, and rhythm
           follow-up will be carried out with a Holter or event recorder.

      C. Follow-up All the patients will be followed-up at 1, 3, 6 months, and thereafter every 6
      months. If the patient shows any symptom within the clinical study period, patient will visit
      the outpatient clinic. ECG will be performed at every outpatient visits, and 24-hour Holter
      or event recording will be performed every 6 months for 2 years, and every year after 2 years
      (2012 Heart Rhythm Society/EHRA/European Cardiac Arrhythmia Society Expert Consensus
      Statement guidelines). If atrial fibrillation or atrial tachycardia lasting more than 30
      seconds is observed in 12-lead ECG or Holter, it will be evaluated as recurrence. Recurrence
      within 3 months after the procedure will be classified as early recurrence, and that after 3
      months will be classified as clinical recurrence.
