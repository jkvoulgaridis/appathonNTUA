      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the tumescent anesthesia technique
      in the surgical management of hand tenosynovitis. For this, an open clinical trial was
      conducted, which included patients with hand tenosynovitis (carpal tunnel syndrome, trigger
      finger and Quervain syndrome), which were randomly assigned to a group. The control group was
      released pulleys and ligaments with local anesthetic technique and hemostasis with pneumatic
      tourniquet; While the study group was released from the pulleys and ligaments with tumescent
      anesthesia. The study variables were: anesthesia time, trans-surgical bleeding, pain, total
      procedure time and tissue reperfusion time.

      Introduction: The WALANT technique (Wide Awake Local Anesthesia No-Torniquet) proposes the
      use of local anesthesia, epinephrine and tourniquet in the areas of the hand to be repaired,
      making costs and time and comfort more efficient.

      Objective: Evaluation of the effectiveness of the WALANT technique versus regional anesthesia
      with tourniquet in pain control, surgical management of stenosing tenosynovitis.

      Material and methods: Open clinical trial including patients with the trigger finger, tunnel
      syndrome in the operating room, candidates for surgery, and excluding previous surgeries at
      the site of the injury, hemodynamic instability, peripheral vascular diseases, smoking,
      anxiety, or psychiatric diseases. The anesthetic method was applied to the incision sites
      according to the diagnosis and the proposed procedure. At the end of the test, tumescent
      solution and control, 1% lidocaine plus pneumatic tourniquet on the forearm at 250mmHg. The
      main variables were: type of anesthesia and pain during the procedure. Descriptive and
      inferential statistics were applied (xi2, t-student or Mann-Whitney U).

    <description>A tumescent solution was prepared; consisting of 40 cc of 0.9% Saline Solution, 10 cc of 2% Lidocaine, 0.4 cc of Epinephrine (1: 1000) and 4 cc of 7.5% Sodium Bicarbonate. This solution was applied in the incision sites according to the diagnosis and the proposed procedure. In case of trigger finger, 3 cc was applied subcutaneously in the proximal palmar crease of the affected finger; for Quervain syndrome, 5 to 6 cc of tumescent solution was injected along the first extensor compartment at the radial styloid level; and in the case of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, 10 cc of tumescent solution was infiltrated on the flexor retinaculum in the subcutaneous tissue and from 7 to 10 cc below it. Subsequently, 20 minutes were waited for the epinephrine to cause vasoconstriction, and the asepsis of the limb was continued , sterile fields were placed, the incision site was corroborated and the surgical procedure proposed for each pathology was started.</description>

    <description>Lidocaine 1% was applied to the incision sites according to the diagnosis and the proposed procedure. In case of trigger finger, 3 cc was applied subcutaneously in the proximal palmar crease of the affected finger; for Quervain syndrome, 5 to 6 cc were injected along the first extensor compartment at the radial styloid level; and in the case of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, 10 cc was infiltrated on the flexor retinaculum in the subcutaneous tissue and from 7 to 10 cc below it. Afterwards, a pneumatic tourniquet was placed at the level of the forearm at 250 mmHg after exsanguination with a bandage from Esmarch. The asepsis of the limb was continued, sterile fields were placed, the incision site was corroborated and the surgical procedure proposed for each pathology was started.
At the end of the surgical procedure, it was closed by planes, a soft bandage was placed, the tourniquet was removed and the patient was taken to recovery.</description>
