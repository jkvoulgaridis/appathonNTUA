  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective single-centre randomised controlled trial to examine the
      feasibility of a fully powered randomised controlled trial to examine if HPLC-SRM-MS guided
      intervention is superior to standard clinical care in improving clinical, behavioural and
      health-economy outcomes in RA patients prescribed MTX.

      The trial will consist of 4 stages:

        -  Screening (~-2 weeks)

        -  Recruitment, consent, randomisation, data collection, examination and blood sampling -
           baseline visit 1 (time point 0)

        -  Intervention - telephone appointment (visit 2, intervention arm)

        -  Outcome - visit 3

        -  Process evaluation - visit 4

      Prior to any trial specific procedures, the participant must have signed the informed consent
      form (ICF).

      The trial will offer a small financial compensation for successfully recruited patients
      toward the costs of parking/refreshments/travel costs/inconvenience related to attending
      visits

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) affects up to 1% of the adult population. It is a condition that is
      treatable by medications. Methotrexate (MTX) is the first-line therapy for RA however, up to
      60% of patients prescribed MTX still have active RA. This puts these patients at higher risk
      of joint damage compared to those whose RA is under control.

      One important explanation for the poor control in those who receive treatment is that some
      patients, for many reasons, do not take their medications as recommended (non-adherence).
      Non-adherence is associated with increased costs to the NHS and reduced response to MTX.

      The study will assess whether it is achievable to conduct a much larger study to explore
      whether a review of how well patients are coping with MTX can improve RA control.
      Understanding the reasons for poor RA control has the potential to improve the health and
      well-being of individual patients, avoid unnecessary tests and hospital appointments and save
      money in healthcare.

      The trial will recruit 50 patients with RA who have been prescribed MTX for more than 2
      years. 25 patients will be asked to donate blood samples and complete questionnaires, but
      their treatment will continue as standard. The blood tests will include patients MTX levels.
      The results of the test provide a direct measure of medication adherence. For the other 25
      patients, the results of the blood tests will be fed back to them with tailored targeting of
      the main reason(s) for the deviation from the prescribed MTX. At the end of the study, the
      investigators will assess the feasibility of a randomised controlled trial of a biochemical
      screening of adherence guided intervention in patients with RA treated with MTX.
