  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to treat patients who have been diagnosed with brain cancer, including
      glioblastoma (GBM) and diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG). The treatment uses
      immunomodulatory vaccine generated by autologous dendritic cells (DCs) pulsed with
      genetically modified tumor cells or tumor-related antigens including neoantigens to inject
      into patients. Vaccine-induced T cell responses have been associated with improved survival.
      The study will evaluate the safety and potential benefit of the novel immunomodulatory DC
      vaccines.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) or glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive malignancy.
      DIPG mainly occurs in the ventral pontine of childhood. The overall median survival time is 9
      to 11 months. The 2-year survival rate is less than 10%. Thus DIPG has become one of the most
      fatal diseases in children. These tumors invade and infiltrate the surrounding brain, making
      complete surgical excision impossible. Several studies focused on the identification of GBM
      or DIPG-specific antigens and evaluated their potential for vaccine application.
      Immunomodulatory DC vaccines based on ex vivo genetic modifications in combination with known
      tumor-specific antigens may substantially enhance the activation potential of tumor-specific
      T cells with improved benefit to patients.

      Although certain antigens are highly specific in DIPG or GBM, existing immune tolerance
      suppresses anti-tumor immunity in cancer patients. To induce anti-cancer immune response in
      patients, ex vivo modification of immune modulatory antigens or immune cells will be
      necessary. Advanced whole exome sequencing has been developed to identify specific mutations
      in tumors and predict best-fit MHC-specific neoepitopes for T cell activation. In this study
      we will investigate novel DC vaccines based on autologous DCs pulsed with genetically
      modified tumor cells or related antigens such as neoantigens to induce a strong anti-tumor
      immunity. Early studies of DC-based vaccines targeting gliomas have shown acceptable safety
      and low toxicity profile. This is a multi-center randomized Phase I study to evaluate safety
      of novel DC vaccines.

    <description>This study will inject DC vaccine cells near lymphoid tissue close to the tumor. The patient will receive intravenous cyclophosphamide (200 mg/m2) or oral (cytoxan) before the vaccine, followed by DC vaccine and intravenous bevacizumab (15 mg/kg) the next day. The cells will be repeatedly infused every month for six consecutive months depending on the response and the condition of the patient. The amount of DC vaccine cells per injection is based on prior report at 5-10x106. An initial dose escalation scheme will be imposed.</description>
