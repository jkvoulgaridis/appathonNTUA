  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a need for better visualization of resection margins during surgery for soft tissue
      sarcoma. Optical molecular imaging of soft tissue sarcoma associated biomarkers is a
      promising technique to accommodate this need. The biomarker Vascular Endothelial Growth
      Factor (VEGF-A) is overexpressed in soft tissue sarcoma versus normal tissue and has proven
      to be a valid target for molecular imaging. VEGF-A can be targeted by the monoclonal antibody
      bevacizumab. Monoclonal antibodies can be labeled by the near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent dye
      IRDye800CW (800CW). The investigators hypothesize that bevacizumab-800CW accumulates in VEGF
      expressing cancer, enabling soft tissue sarcoma visualization using a NIR intraoperative
      camera system. In this pilot intervention study the investigators will determine the optimal
      dosage of bevacizumab-800CW (10, 25 or 50mg) to detect soft tissue sarcoma intraoperatively.
