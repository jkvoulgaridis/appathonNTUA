           21 (L858R) substitution mutation-positive NSCLC, patients with locally advanced or
           metastatic EGFR T790M mutation-positive NSCLC who have been previously treated with EGFR
           TKI therapy in Korea

        -  Secondary objective: To assess efficacy of the study drug for EGFR-tyrosine kinase
           inhibitor (TKI) naïve patients with locally advanced or metastatic, EGFR exon 19
