    <textblock>
      The incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer in China's cancer disease spectrum is on the
      rise, and it is a common malignant tumor that harms the health of Chinese residents.This
      study was a one-arm, single-center, open clinical study. A total of 50 patients were enrolled
      in the study.

    <textblock>
      Because of the clinical lack of research to explore the safety and efficacy of VEGFR2
      inhibitors in combination with anti-PD-1 antibodies in the treatment of colorectal cancer, we
      intend to conduct a single-center, one-arm, open, investigator-initiated clinical study aimed
      at To clarify the efficacy and tolerability of PD-1 antibody SHR-1210 in combination with
      VEGFR2 inhibitor apatinib in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer microsatellite
      stabilization, and to explore the tumor tissue and hematological immune molecular markers
      predicting the effectiveness of the protocol. Things. The results of this clinical trial will
      likely increase the objective response rate of advanced colorectal cancer after standard
      treatment, and hopefully find molecular markers that can predict the sensitivity of
      colorectal cancer PD-1 immunotherapy combined with anti-angiogenic targeted therapy.
      Therefore, it has important clinical significance.
