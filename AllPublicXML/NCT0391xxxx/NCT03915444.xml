      This is a phase II open-label study evaluating the efficacy and safety of nab-paclitaxel
      cisplatin, and gemcitabine in patients with metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.

      An individual cycle of therapy will be defined as Days 1 and 8 every 21 days. Multiple cycles
      may be administered until the patient is withdrawn from therapy.

      Overall response rates as well as individual categories of response (CR, PR, SD, and PD) will
      be determined using RECIST 1.1 (Frese 2012). Time-to-event endpoints, including PFS and OS
      will be assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method (Kaplan 1958). Evaluation of stable disease at
      9 weeks will also be assessed. Toxicity (adverse events) will be recorded using the NCI
      CTCAE, version 5.0.
