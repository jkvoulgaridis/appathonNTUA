  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to enhance the scalability of family-focused therapy (FFT), a
      12-session evidence-based therapy for youth at high risk for mood disorders, through
      augmentation with a novel mobile phone application called MyCoachConnect (MCC). In
      adolescents with mood instability who have a parent with bipolar or major depressive
      disorder, clinicians in community clinics will conduct FFT sessions (consisting of
      psychoeducation and family skills training) supplemented by weekly MCC &quot;real time&quot;
      assessments of moods and family relationships; based on results of these assessments and the
      family's progress in treatment, clinicians will then push personalized informational and
      coaching alerts regarding the practice of communication and problem-solving skills. The
      investigators hypothesize that the augmented version of FFT (FFT-MCC) will be more effective
      than FFT without coaching/informational alerts in altering treatment targets and in
      stabilizing youths' mood symptoms and quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigative group has shown in several randomized trials that family-focused therapy
      (FFT) for symptomatic youth at high-risk for bipolar disorder - consisting of psychoeducation
      and family communication and problem solving skills training - is an effective adjunct to
      pharmacotherapy in hastening symptomatic recovery. However, between 50%-60% of high-risk
      youth still have residual mood symptoms and functional impairment after 18 weeks of FFT. In
      prior studies, two constructs have emerged as predictors of lack of response to treatment:
      mood instability in the child and expressed emotion (EE) in parents (i.e., frequent critical
      comments or hostility). In adolescents (ages 12-18) with a parent with bipolar disorder or
      major depressive disorder, the investigators hypothesize that augmenting FFT with frequent
      and targeted interventions in the home setting through a Smartphone app (MyCoachConnect, or
      MCC) will (a) have a greater and more rapid impact than standard FFT on the targeted
      mechanisms of mood instability in adolescents and EE in parents, and (b) as a result, enhance
      symptom resolution and functioning in adolescents. To be eligible, adolescents must score
      high on parent-rated measures of mood instability, and have at least one parent who is
      high-EE by speech sample coding criteria. The MCC app will record weekly open speech samples
      from parents and children and daily and weekly mood ratings from adolescents. The app
      assessments will be fed back to the FFT clinician, who will use this information to &quot;push&quot;
      recommendations for mood regulation, communication, and problem-solving strategies (linked to
      the FFT modules) for parents and youth. In year 1, the investigators will conduct an open
      trial (n=25) to determine (a) the feasibility and acceptability of FFT with mobile coaching
      (FFT-MCC), as given by clinicians in community settings, and (b) associations between
      online/speech feature proxies of the targets (mood instability and EE as measured weekly by
      MCC) and standard measures of the targets. In years 2 and 3 the investigators will conduct a
      60-case randomized clinical trial in which families are assigned to FFT with MCC skills
      coaching or FFT with MCC assessments only, with no skills coaching. The primary hypotheses
      are that FFT-MCC will be acceptable to parents, adolescents and clinicians, and more
      effective than FFT without MCC coaching in engaging the targets of mood instability and EE
      and promoting improvements in adolescents' mood symptoms and quality of life over 27 weeks.
      The study will facilitate the translation of a technological augmentation to an
      evidence-based family intervention, with the goal of increasing treatment access among
      families with mood disorders.

    <measure>Average mood symptom scores over 27 weeks on the Adolescent Longitudinal Interval Follow-up Evaluation</measure>
    <time_frame>27 weeks, with ratings done by an independent evaluator each week</time_frame>
    <description>Adolescent Longitudinal Interval Followup Evaluation (ALIFE), a measure of mood disorder fluctuation based on an interview with the child and at least one parent. ALIFE Psychiatric Status Ratings range from 1 (asymptomatic) to 6 (extremely symptomatic) and are made weekly for depression, mania, hypomania, delusions, hallucinations, and suicidal ideation. Scores of 5 or higher are considered full syndromal (e.g., for major depressive disorder or manic episode) and scores of 1-2 are considered remitted.</description>

    <measure>Mood instability, as rated by parents and children using the Children's Affective Lability Scale (CALS) and the Parent-Rated General Behavior Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>Mean Children's Affective Lability scores computed at baseline and every 9 weeks for 27 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in mood states from sadness to irritability to elation or other moods. The CALS is a 20-item survey completed by parents. In this study, a score of 20 will be used to indicate high mood instability. Parent ratings on the Parent General Behavior Inventory, 10 item Mania scale will be made at study entry, with a score of 6 or higher indicating mood instability.</description>

    <measure>Expressed emotion in parents from the Five Minute Speech Sample</measure>
    <time_frame>Ratings of high vs. low expressed emotion in each parent obtained at baseline and every 9 weeks for 27 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Parental expressed emotion is a measure of critical comments, hostility, or emotional overinvolvement. The primary instrument in this study is the Five Minute Speech Sample, which is scored by an independent evaluator on number of criticisms, presence/absence of hostility, or overinvolvement. One critical comment or a rating of present for hostility or overinvolvement means the parent is rated high in expressed emotion, and low expressed emotion otherwise. Expressed emotion is also measured by the Perceived Criticism Scale, a 1-10 measure of how often the child thinks each parent criticizes him/her. A rating of '5' is considered high and indicative of a high EE parent/offspring relationship.</description>

    <time_frame>weekly call-ins, with linguistic counts of negative or positive words tabulated each week for 27 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Callers are asked to speak for 3-5 minutes about how they are doing and whether anything has gone well or whether they have had difficulties. The samples will be transcribed and coded via the Linguistic Inquiry Word Count. The goal is to measure whether mood instability and expressed emotion can be captured from weekly free speech call-ins by parents or youth.</description>

    <description>Youth in this study arm will receive 12 sessions of FFT (psychoeducation, communication skills training, and problem-solving skills training) with their parents and siblings. They and their parents will make regular mobile app ratings of mood, sleep, family functioning, stress, and perceived criticism. Children and parents will call into a voice-activated phone system and be asked to speak freely for 3-5 minutes about their health and family functioning. They will be guided through 12 lesson plans in which they practice skills such as active listening or identifying prodromal signs of episodes, paralleling what they are learning in sessions. The clinician will be able to set a weekly skill training assignment and observe the family's practice of the skill between sessions. They will adapt session content accordingly.</description>
