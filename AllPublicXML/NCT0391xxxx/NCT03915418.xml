  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common cause of child disability. Nearly 40% of PC children
      suffer from sleep disorders, which are not routinely screened. The neuro-cognitive, physical
      and environmental morbidity of sleep disorders should require their diagnosis and management.
      Limited access to the reference exam (polysomnography or PSG) delays the diagnosis and only
      allows screening of these disorders for a limited number of PC children. The hypothesis of
      our study is that connected technologies could optimize screening for sleep disorders in PC
      children by selecting children requiring PSG exploration and specific management.

    <measure>Sleep Quality Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>15 days</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep quality questionnaire used as a screening tool for sleep disorders: use of the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children. Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children (SDSC) is a screening tool for sleep disorders in children and adolescents with good psychometric properties. It is one of the most used sleep questionnaires in the clinic but also in clinical research. Since its creation, the SDSC has been translated into several languages and recently validated in French. The ranking is obtained from a 26-item questionnaire completed by the parents. This scale distinguishes 6 major groups of sleep disorders: disorders of the installation or maintenance of sleep, breathing disorders, waking disorders, sleep-wake transition disorders, excessive daytime sleepiness and hypersudation of sleep.</description>

    <measure>Data quality outcome measures</measure>
    <time_frame>25 months</time_frame>
    <description>Data quality will be assessed by establishing for each sensor the ratio (expressed in percent value) between the duration of the data effectively recorded to the total duration the patient weared the sensors. Pauses in recording during recording sessions will be identified in absolute value and duration for each sensor. Specific issues in recording will be reported, especially regarding the contents of RAW files.</description>
