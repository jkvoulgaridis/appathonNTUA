  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nurses often experience occupational stress, burnout and secondary trauma in their
      workplaces. Nurses face many stressful situations such as the death of patients, violence,
      acute conditions, the suffering of patients, which they are usually unable to control.
      Moreover, these situations are considered to be the daily routine of nurses. An essential
      aspect of reducing occupational stress is the individual empowerment of nurses. There are
      several interventional studies aimed at empowering nurses in the workplace that use different
      methods. The studies in the literature mostly consist of programs focused on mindfulness,
      resilience, and self-care. However, it can be seen in these studies that sample selections
      were not randomized, there was no control group, and no follow-up was performed . Besides, in
      almost all of the studies, it can be observed that all nurses who accepted to participate in
      the study were included in the study and no risk groups were determined. Therefore, it is not
      clear whether these interventional studies are primary prevention or secondary prevention
      studies. Building on these needs, a randomized controlled trial to empower nurses may make a
      significant contribution to the literature.

      There is a need for randomized and controlled studies with high levels of evidence to explore
      the interventions that are expected to reduce occupational stress and empower employees.

      The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of nurse-led intervention programme on
      compassion fatigue, burnout, compassion satisfaction and psychological distress in nurses.

      Aim: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of nurse-led intervention programme on
      compassion fatigue, burnout, compassion satisfaction and psychological distress in nurses.

      Design This single‐blind randomized controlled trial was designed to compare compassion
      fatigue, burnout, compassion satisfaction and psychological distress levels before and after
      the intervention, and in the following 6 months among experimental group and control group.

      Participants and Settings The study was conducted at a public hospital in western Turkey.
      Nurses in the general inpatient units work 8-h and 16 h shifts for 160-180 h a month and
      provide care for an average of 20 patients per shift. Nurse-Led Intervention programme was
      presented during a 4-week period. All of the nurses who worked at clinics and had at least
      six months of experience were invited to complete the compassion fatigue subscale developed.
      84 of the 150 nurses who responded to the questionnaires received a score on compassion
      fatigue higher than the mean score (20 points) for all nurses were invited to participate in
      the nurse-led intervention programme. Among these nurses, 48 nurses who agreed to participate
      in the research were randomly assigned, with 24 to the intervention group, and 24 to the
      control group. Two nurses from the intervention group stated that they did not have enough
      time so they could not attend all the sessions. A total of 4 nurses, two from the
      intervention group and two from the control group, did not fill out the post-test 1 and
      post-test 2 questionnaires.

      Sample Size Calculation and Randomization The sample size was predetermined by using a power
      calculation with the Openepi Sample size calculation programme. The power calculation was
      based on a medium effect size (0.5), an alpha of 0.05 and a power of 0.80; as a result the
      sample size was determined as 20 per group. Random allocation was concealed by using a
      computer-generated random allocation. During the randomization, the researchers and the
      participants did not know the groups to which they would be allocated. No blinding was
      applied to the participants and the researchers.

      Intervention Nurse-led Intervention Programme The nurse-led intervention is a programme to
      help nurses to improve professional quality of life and reduce psychological distress. The
      nurse-led intervention programme comprised four sessions; which lasted approximately 1.5-2 h.
      The Intervention group was divided into two smaller groups of 12 people. The programme was
      developed by the first and third authors. Intervention were applied in a quiet and
      comfortable room in an uncrowded part of the hospital. The nurses were served food and
      beverage, and an intimate atmosphere was created. Interventions were applied by first author,
      the first author had previously managed nurse support groups, patient groups with breast
      cancer. The first author who was a psychiatric nurse has also been an active educator in the
      psychiatric and mental health nursing and coping with stress education classes offered at an
      urban university and was trained in cognitive behavioural therapy. The content and structure
      of the group sessions were based on the principles of cognitive restructuring techniques.

      Control No intervention was applied to the nurses in the control group during the study.
      After the research process was completed, the same program was applied to the control group
      nurses who were willing to participate in the program.

      Outcome measures Primer outcomes were compassion fatigue, burnout and compassion
      satisfaction. These outcomes were evaluated by the Professional Quality of Life Scale
      (ProQOL-IV).

      Seconder outcome was psychological distress. The GHQ-12 is a scale surveying psychiatric
      symptoms observed within the last few weeks.

      Data collection All groups completed the forms prior to (pre-test), just after (post-test 1)
      and 6 months after (post-test 2) the intervention. Envelopes were used every time data were
      collected from the nurses. Nurses were requested to ﬁll these questionnaires at an
      appropriate time and place in the clinics. The envelops collected from the nurses by
      researchers.

      Validity and reliability To provide validity and reliability, measurement tools showing good
      psychometric properties were used. The volunteer participants were randomly assigned to the
      intervention and control groups, and the intention to treat method was used for data
      analysis. The study was reported in accordance with the CONSORT 2010 Statement principles.

      Ethical considerations Permission was obtained from the Noninvasive Research Ethics Board in
      the relevant university, and written permission was obtained from the hospital. The
      participants were informed about the aim of the study, all participants gave written and
      verbal informed consent.

      Data analysis Descriptive statistics were evaluated with numbers, percentage, mean and
      standard deviation. Mann Whitney U test was used to compare the intervention and control
      groups, and Friedman analysis (Wilcoxon analysis with Bonferroni Correction) was used to
      compare the mean scores of the three measurements (pre-test, post-test 1, post-test 2). Since
      there were 3 pair comparisons in the Bonferroni Correction method, the new significance level
      was determined as p &lt;0.017. Chi-square test was used to compare the independent variables of
      both groups. All nurses who had participated in the randomization were tracked and analyzed.
      All analyses were conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. The missing data were compensated
      using the last-observation-carried forward method.
