  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study is designed to determine the feasibility of providing a mindfulness
      meditation program to patients with newly diagnosed malignant glioma during standard of care
      chemoradiation. Newly diagnosed malignant glioma patients will participate in six 1-hour
      mindfulness sessions over the phone, followed by one 1-hour in-person mindfulness session.
      Patients will complete various Quality of Life questionnaires and distress measuring tools
      prior to initiating the mindfulness sessions, at the clinic visit following the mindfulness
      intervention, and ~2 months after completing the mindfulness intervention. Additionally,
      patients will be provided with supplemental materials including website references and guided
      audiotape meditations to guide their individual practice outside of the weekly guided
      sessions.

      The main objective of this study is to assess the feasibility of a mindfulness meditation
      intervention program, designed to mitigate the distress associated with the disease and first
      line treatment of patients with malignant glioma, and to determine whether it merits
      additional research in a subsequent trial.

      There are no risks associated with participation in this study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fifteen newly diagnosed WHO grade III or IV malignant glioma patients will be enrolled to
      this pilot feasibility study. Following completion of informed consent, patients will
      complete a baseline assessment consisting of various QoL/distress assessments including the
      Trail Making Test, the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cognitive Function (FACT-Cog),
      the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness
      Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F), the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Brain (FACT-Br), the
      Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire - short form (FFMQ-SF), the Functional Assessment of
      Chronic Illness Therapy-Spiritual Well-Being (FACIT-Sp12), the NCCN Distress Thermometer with
      Symptom Inventory, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). They will then begin
      the mindfulness intervention, consisting of six weekly telephone-based mindfulness sessions
      followed by one in-person mindfulness session. Post-treatment measures and an Exit Survey
      will be administered following the one in-person mindfulness session. Two months later, the
      QoL, cognition and distress assessments will be repeated and a Final Exit Survey will be
      administered. The Exit Survey will ask the patient about their individual mindfulness
      practice during the intervention, their intention to continue the practice beyond
      participation in this study, their satisfaction with the services received, and their
      perception of the effectiveness of the program. The Final Exit Survey will ask the patient
      about their mindfulness practice since the Exit Survey, and their intention to continue with
      the mindfulness practice. The investigators will also collect demographic data such as age,
      marital status, education, employment, date of diagnosis and death, tumor grade, histology,
      and type of treatment from the patient.

    <description>One measure of the acceptability of the mindfulness intervention is the extent of satisfaction patients have with the mindfulness sessions.
