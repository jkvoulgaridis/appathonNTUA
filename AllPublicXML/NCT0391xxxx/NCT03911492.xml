  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter study will enroll 100 patients with acute traumatic cervical and thoracic
      SCI who have a lumbar intrathecal catheter inserted within 24 hours of their injury. The
      lumbar intrathecal catheter will be inserted pre-operatively for the measurement of ITP and
      the collection of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples. SCPP will be calculated as the
      difference between MAP and the ITP.

      There are two important distinct yet related objectives in this prospective interventional
      study.

        1. Determine the effect of SCPP maintenance ≥ 65 mmHg in acute SCI on neurologic recovery
           as measured by ASIA Impairment Scale (AIS) grade conversion and motor score improvement.

        2. Collect CSF and blood samples for the measurement of neurochemical biomarkers and
           storage for future biomarker discovery and validation studies.

      Objective 1. To determine if actively maintaining an SCPP of at least 65 mmHg with a
      combination of MAP augmentation and CSF drainage promotes better neurologic recovery than
      routine hemodynamic management that focuses solely on MAP augmentation.

      Objective 2. To determine if actively maintaining an SCPP of at least 65 mmHg with a
      combination of MAP augmentation and CSF drainage will allow for a reduction in the usage of
      vasopressors in acute SCI.

      Objective 3. To determine the feasibility of draining CSF to reduce ITP in the acute
      post-injury setting, when the cord may be swollen against the dura causing subarachnoid space
      occlusion at the injury site.

      Objective 4. To determine if there are complications associated with the installation of the
      intrathecal catheter and drainage of CSF in the acute SCI patient.

    <description>Neurologic recovery over time will be measured using the ISNCSCI examination - at Baseline, Days 1-7, and months 3, 6 and 12. Our primary outcome measure will be the change in total motor score at 6 months post-injury (a time point at which most motor recovery has occurred and is commonly used in acute SCI clinical trials).</description>

    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>CSF and blood samples will be obtained from the intrathecal catheter at 8-hour intervals, three times daily, for 7 days. These samples will be markers that correlate with injury severity and predict neurological outcome.</description>
