  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The GENOME + project will enroll patients (n = ca. 100) and their healthy parents with
      unclear molecular cause of the disease, suspected genetic cause of the disease and previous
      detailed molecular analysis like Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) did not lead to the
      identification of the disease causing mechanism. As well healthy parents of those affected
      for trio analysis (exception of one parent is not available for the study).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the GENOME+ study (monocentric, prospective, open-label diagnostic study), patients with
      molecularly undiagnosed diseases will diagnostically be analyzed by means of omics
      technologies or re-analyzed using existing datasets. The following questions will be leading
      the study:

      Primary:

      • Identification of the molecular causes of unclear rare diseases

      Secondary:

        -  Improve number of diagnoses for patients with rare diseases

        -  Further characterization of the identified putative disease causes

        -  Increase number of patients receiving appropriate therapy after successful diagnosis.

      In addition, healthy parents of the subjects may be included in the study to perform
      parent-child (trio) analyses.

      In addition, phenotype and omics data will be shared within the University Hospital Tübingen,
      Germany and with external collaborators to improve the diagnostic rate of the patients
      included in the study.

      Storage of blood or tissue samples is not primary goal of this project, but may be necessary
      for further analyses.
