  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study would further evaluate the safety and efficacy of human amniotic mesenchymal stem
      cell (hA-MSC) for the treatment of lupus nephritis (LN).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eleven patients with WHO class III, IV or V LN were given hA-MSC (Peripheral intravenous
      infusion, dose 1×106/kg cells, once every month for three times). At the same time, five
      patients with LN who were not given hA-MSC as the blank control group. All patients did not
      received intravenous corticosteroids pulse therapy, but the use of oral corticosteroids and
      intravenous cyclophosphamide, or oral mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus , leflunomide were
      allowed.
