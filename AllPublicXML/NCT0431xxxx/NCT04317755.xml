    <textblock>
      Body image is one of the leading concerns for young. Such concerns can have serious health
      consequences, including unhealthy weight control and exercise behaviours, depression and
      self-harm, low self-esteem, substance abuse. Emerging approaches for improving body image are
      effective among adolescent girls and boys in the school setting. However, the vast majority
      of trials in this area are conducted in high-income westernised countries, despite body image
      concerns increasingly being recognised as a global concern. As such, it is important to
      develop and disseminate interventions to promote positive body image among adolescents in in
      low-to-middle income countries, too.

      One country where body image concerns are becoming an increasing issue is India. The
      investigators recently finished developing and evaluating a body image programme, Dove
      Confident Me, among adolescents in New Delhi, India. The investigators found immediate and
      3-month follow-up improvements in body image, disordered eating, self-esteem, and other
      related outcomes. Whilst these findings offer an effective body image programme for school
      students in urban areas of India, this may not be feasible for schools in more rural areas in
      India.

      The aim of the present study is therefore to conduct a pilot randomised controlled trial of a
      comics-based body image programme among adolescents in a rural area of India, in order to
      understand its acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy. This comics-based
      programme will be based on Dove Confident Me, which was found to be effective among
      adolescents in Delhi, India.

      To assess the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of the comics, the study
      will compare the body image and well-being of students who take part in the programme to
      students who do not take part in any programme (classes as usual). Investigators will also
      gather in-depth feedback from students, and teachers via focus groups and interviews, in
      order to inform future improvement of the programme for wider implementation.

      To undertake this project, the investigators will recruit students and teachers from six
      schools in a rural area of India. Students will complete questionnaire assessments of body
      image and well-being before and after the 5-week programme period, and again 10-12 weeks
      later to assess longer-term benefits.

      Background:

      Body image is a significant and prevalent concern for adolescents in high-income countries
      such as the UK, the USA, and Australia. For example, a study of 1,600 girls in the UK found
      that four in ten 11-16 year old girls are unhappy with the way they look. Similarly, a
      nationally representative survey of nearly 22,000 young people in Australia found that 3 in
      10 adolescent boys and girls are very concerned about their body image, and body image was
      voted among the top three life concerns. The high prevalence of body image concerns among
      adolescent boys and girls is worrisome, given their serious negative physical and
      psychological health consequences. For example, body dissatisfaction is associated with
      engagement in unhealthy weight loss behaviours and the onset of eating disorders, depression
      and self-harm, substance use, and lower levels of academic engagement.

      There is increasing recognition that body image is a global issue, as opposed to one
      relegated to privileged adolescents in high-income Westernised countries. For example, in
      India, 57% of adolescents aged 15-19 years report being concerned with their appearance.
      Further, adolescent girls across different regions of India have expressed concerns in
      relation to their weight and report dieting behaviours. Skin colour has also been indicated
      as an additional source of appearance concern among young people in India. A large-scale
      study among Asian, African, and South American countries, found that 19% of Indian
      undergraduate students had used a skin lightening product in the previous 12 months, strongly
      suggesting dissatisfaction with their natural skin tone, which may be pertinent to younger
      groups.

      Collectively, these findings indicate the importance of developing and disseminating
      interventions to promote positive body image among adolescents in India. The investigators
      recently finished developing and evaluating a school-based body image programme, Dove
      Confident Me, among adolescents in New Delhi, India. Immediate and 3-month follow-up
      improvements were found in body image, disordered eating, self-esteem, and other related
      outcomes. Whilst these findings offer an effective body image programme for school students
      in urban areas of India, this may not be feasible for schools in more rural areas in India;
      where they do not have electricity or computers.

      The aim of the present study is therefore to conduct a pilot randomised controlled trial of a
      comics-based body image programme among adolescents in a rural area of India, in order to
      understand its acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy. This comics-based
      programme will be based on Dove Confident Me, which was found to be effective among
      adolescents in Delhi, India.

      Design:

      A cluster randomised controlled pilot trial will be employed, whereby six schools will be
      randomly allocated to receive the body image intervention or classes-as-usual (control).
      Students will be assessed on body image and related outcomes at baseline, post-intervention
      and 10-12 weeks follow-up, under standardised conditions.

      Participants &amp; recruitment:

      Six co-educational secondary schools in a rural state of India (TBC) will be invited to take
      part in this study. They will be schools via the government. All students in classes 6-7
      (equivalent of UK years 7-8; students aged 11-13) in each school will be invited to take
      part.

      After expressing their initial interest, each school will receive detailed information
      regarding the aims, objective and requirements of the study to help them decide if they would
      like to take part in this research project. Depending on the school, either the head teacher
      will provide active informed consent, or parents will consent. Students will also be required
      to provide their consent before taking part. All students will have the opportunity to opt
      out of the study, or withdraw from the study at any time, irrespective of head teacher
      consent.

      The exact numbers of students that take part in this research will depend on the number of
      children enrolled in classes 6-7 at each school recruited, and the number that opt out during
      the student consent process or are lost at follow-up due to moving schools, or being away
      from school on the day the data is collected. However, the aim will be to recruit 1,200
      students for each condition, with 50% males. This will allow us to detect a small effect.

      Intervention:

      AdhaFULL AdhaFULL is a comic-book series co-created by BBC Media Action and UNICEF, which
      follows the journey of 3 adolescents as they solve cases related to important issues (e.g.,
      under-age marriage, nutrition, gender-stereotypes, peer pressure etc). The comics aim to
      raise awareness and encourage adolescents to take action against these issues. There are 6
      different comics based on AdhaFULL, which target issues relating to gender stereotypes and
      appearance concerns amongst adolescents in rural India. Specifically, they focus on gender
      prejudice (Comic 1),societal appearance ideals (Comic 2), media literacy (Comic 3),
      appearance comparisons (Comic 4), appearance-related conversations and teasing (Comic 5), and
      promoting 'body activism' (Comic 6). At the end of each comic, the teacher will facilitate
      one or two activities with the students based on the comic.

      Procedure:

      Investigators from the Centre for Appearance Research (CAR) based at the University of the
      West of England will be leading the study remotely from Bristol, UK. CAR researchers will be
      responsible for designing the study, analysing the data, and writing up the manuscript. They
      will also be working with the Dove Self-Esteem Project, UNICEF, and BBC Media Action to
      design the comics.

      1) Intervention Delivery and Efficacy Evaluation Students aged 11-13 from six government
      secondary schools in a rural part of India will be recruited, and independent randomisation
      will be used to assign schools to each condition. This will be done using freely available
      computer software. The teachers will be trained (in person) by two researchers from CAR on
      the delivery of the comics and activities. Both of these researchers possess experience of
      delivering, and training others to deliver, a range of body image interventions.

      A questionnaire comprising the self-report measures described below will be used to assess
      the impact of the intervention on students' body image and associated risk factors. After
      obtaining consent from the school head teachers, and the students, these measures will be
      administered in the classroom to the 11-13 year old students at pre-intervention (1-2 weeks
      before intervention delivery), immediately after intervention delivery (within 1 week of the
      final session), and again at 10-12 weeks follow-up. The questionnaire will take students no
      more than 20-25 minutes to complete. Students will complete questionnaires under standardised
      conditions supervised by their teachers and trained research staff. Blinding of students,
      teachers, and researchers is not possible due to the nature of the intervention. However,
      risk of bias from teachers and researchers is minimised due to anonymous self-report
      assessments. Risk of contagion is also minimised by randomising at the school level.
      Participating schools will receive a £150 honorarium. This project has ethical approval from
      the University of the West of England's Faculty Research Ethics Committee.

      In order to assess the fidelity of the intervention manuals, all sessions will be
      audio-recorded as well as observed by a researcher and rated based on adherence to lesson
      plans. The teachers will be asked to complete a brief form after each lesson stating which
      activities were completed.

      To assess intervention feasibility and acceptability, at the conclusion of the intervention,
      an interview will be conducted with the teachers to explore their experience of delivering
      the body image lessons. They will also be asked how well the content of the intervention was
      received, how comfortable they felt delivering the session, and their suggestions to improve
      the intervention further.

      A sub-sample of students (approximately 10 girls, 10 boys) in the intervention condition will
      also be invited to take part in single-gender focus groups, in order to explore their
      opinions of the intervention. Permission to audio record the focus groups and interviews will
      be sought from participants prior to commencing the discussions.
