  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, non-blinded, multi-center, non-inferiority trial designed
      to compare effectiveness and side-effects of methotrexate versus prednisolone as first-line
      therapy for pulmonary sarcoidosis..
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sarcoidosis is a multisystem, granulomatous disorder, most commonly affecting the lungs.
      Symptom burden is high, and quality of life (QoL) and social participation are negatively
      affected. In patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis, treatment is recommended in case of
      significant symptoms and/or impaired or deteriorating lung function. Evidence-based treatment
      recommendations are limited, outdated and largely based on expert opinion.

      Prednisone is currently the first-choice therapy in pulmonary sarcoidosis and leads to
      short-term improvement of lung function. Unfortunately, prednisone has major side-effects and
      is associated with impaired QoL. Methotrexate is presently considered second-line therapy,
      and appears to have fewer side-effects. The investigators hypothesize that first-line
      treatment with methotrexate is as effective as prednisone, with fewer side-effects and better
      QoL.

    <description>Patients will complete the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire, a standardized instrument to measure health outcomes in two components: health description and valuation. It comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression on a 5-point scale. From these 5 answers an index value is derived between 0 and 1, with a higher value corresponding with a better QoL. In the valuation part the patients' general health status is evaluated using a VAS-score from 0 to 100, with a higher score representing a better QoL.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of sarcoidosis according to the ATS/ERS/WASOG criteria, in case of absent
             histology a diagnosis of sarcoidosis can also be established in a multidisciplinary
             team meeting in a sarcoidosis expert center based on a highly suggestive clinical and
             radiological picture.

          -  Age ≥18 years.

          -  A pulmonary indication for treatment and parenchymal involvement on X-ray or CT-scan
             conducted within three months before inclusion (determined by the treating physician
             and conform current guidelines).

          -  A forced vital capacity (FVC) of ≤90% of predicted, or a diffusion capacity of the
             lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) ≤70% of predicted, or ≥5% FVC decline/≥10% DLCO
             decline in the past year. For pulmonary functions tests GLI reference values are used.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any condition or circumstance that, in the opinion of the investigator, may make a
             subject unlikely or unable to complete the study or comply with study procedures.

          -  Previous immunosuppressive treatment for sarcoidosis

          -  Use of systemic immunosuppressive therapy within the preceding three months for
             another disease than sarcoidosis

          -  Pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant or breastfeed during the study
             treatment or within 90 days after the last dose in the randomized study phase. For
             males; planning to pro-create during the study or within 90 days after the last dose
             of the randomized study phase.

          -  Primary systemic treatment indication being an extra pulmonary location of sarcoidosis
             (e.g. cardiac of neurological)

          -  Contra-indication for methotrexate or corticosteroids:

               -  severely impaired renal function (creatinine clearance &lt;30 ml/min)

               -  impaired hepatic function (serum bilirubin-value &gt;5 mg/dl or 85,5 micromole/l)

               -  bone marrow insufficiency with severe leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, or anaemia

               -  severe acute or chronic infections, such as tuberculosis, HIV, parasitic
                  infections or other immunodeficiency syndromes
