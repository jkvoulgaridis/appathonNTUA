  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fractures of the tibial plateau, while very painful, typically do not receive nerve blocks.
      This is because of a concern that the numbness from a nerve block would &quot;mask&quot; the typically
      painful symptoms of compartment syndrome, a condition that can lead to a permanent loss of
      function of the injured limb. Our study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of saphenous nerve
      block for pain management after surgical repair of a tibial plateau fracture. Based on
      cadaver studies and our clinical experience, we suspect that the saphenous nerve contributes
      to pain sensations of the tibial plateau and will not mask the pain from a compartment
      syndrome. In summary, while saphenous nerve block represents a safe option after tibial
      plateau open reduction internal fixation (ORIF), we aim to evaluate its effectiveness in this
      patient population.

    <description>Regional Anesthesia nerve blocks have become standard practice for several orthopedic surgeries for post-operative pain management, however concerns for compartment syndrome have prevented nerve blocks to become common practice for tibial plateau open reduction internal fixation pain management. Interestingly, saphenous nerve blocks do not cover the sciatic nerve, allowing for pain management while reducing concerns that it may possibly mask compartment syndrome. Patients will receive ropivacaine through the catheter from the start of the nerve block.</description>
