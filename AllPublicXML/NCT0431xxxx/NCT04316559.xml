  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      People with opioid-use disorder (OUD) might benefit from having more treatment drugs to
      choose from. A new drug, TRV734, could be used like methadone to treat OUD. It might not have
      as many side effects.

      Objective:

      To test if TRV734 relieves withdrawal symptoms and has fewer side effects than oxycodone in
      people with OUD.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 18-75 who have been receiving daily treatment with methadone for opioid use
      disorder for at least 3 months

      Design:

      Participants will be screened under Protocol 415. They will be screened with:

      Medical, social, and psychiatric history

      Physical exam

      Electrocardiogram (ECG). For this, sticky pads will be placed on the participant s chest to
      monitor their heartbeat.

      Blood and urine tests

      Participants will stay in a residential unit for 13-26 days.

      Most days, participants will receive their regular daily dose of methadone.

      On 4 or 5 occasions, 3-4 days apart, participants will skip two doses of methadone in a row.
      About 4 hours after they skip the second dose, they will have an IV catheter inserted with a
      needle so that blood samples can be taken. They will take capsules of either oxycodone, a
      placebo, or the study drug. They will have an ECG. They will complete questionnaires. Their
      blood pressure, pupil size, and alertness will be tested. They will then take their usual
      dose of methadone.

      Participants will give daily urine and breath samples.

      Background. Opioid-agonist medications (methadone and buprenorphine) are the most effective
      treatments available for opioid addiction. However, they are not effective in all cases, and
      with the vast number of people requiring treatment in the current crisis, even a modest
      increase in the percentage of people who respond to treatment would represent a substantial
      benefit in public health. Recent advances in neuropsychopharmacology have led to the
      discovery of a new class of opioid agonists that are functionally selective. That is, they
      are biased towards specific post-receptor pathways and in theory can produce therapeutic
      opioid effects (analgesia, withdrawal relief) while minimizing side effects (sedation,
      respiratory depression) that can lead people to discontinue treatment with methadone or
      buprenorphine.

      Objective. Our goal is to assess the efficacy and tolerability of a biased opioid agonist for
      suppressing or reversing opioid withdrawal.

      Participant population. Adults who are physically dependent on opioids and already receiving
      chronic daily methadone treatment (up to 53 enrolled; up to 30 completers, plus three to run
      in an initial unpowered dose-finding pilot). Target enrollment will include 40% women and 60%
      minorities (mostly African-American), reflecting the demographics of the relevant local
      population.

      Experimental design. A double-blind within-subject randomized placebo-controlled experiment
      will be used to test whether a biased opioid agonist suppresses withdrawal when given about
      52 h after discontinuing methadone. TRV734 (capsule form), a biased opioid agonist with good
      oral bioavailability, will be compared to placebo and to oxycodone (positive control) in
      matching capsules. A signal of efficacy and safety in the proposed laboratory study will be
      our cue to embark on a larger clinical trial.

      Methods. Participants will stay at the inpatient unit for 13-21 consecutive nights to help
      ensure that participants use no additional opioids during a 52-hr opioid abstinence period
      prior to each test session. The first three participants will be enrolled in an unpowered
      dose-finding five-session pilot study (18-26 consecutive nights) to test placebo, oxycodone,
      and a range of doses of TRV734, starting on the high side of the analgesic dose range. The
      highest dose that relieves withdrawal symptoms with no appreciable adverse effects will be
      used as the higher of two doses for the participants in the main study. To help demonstrate
      that TRV734 s effects are dose-related, we will also select a lower dose with
      withdrawal-relief efficacy intermediate between placebo and the higher dose. For participants
      in the main study, there will be four experimental sessions: one each with placebo,
      oxycodone, and the two doses of TRV734. Safety and research measures will be collected before
      (baseline) and for 4 hours after administration of study drugs. The participant s usual
      methadone dose will be administered after each session.

      Outcome measures: The primary outcome will be suppression of withdrawal symptoms, to be
      assessed by the SOWS (Subjective Opioid Withdrawal Scale). Secondary outcomes will include
      safety, specificity of effects (e.g., absence of psychomotor slowing), tolerability, and
      suppression of objective signs of withdrawal. Instruments used for these assessments will
      include the COWS (Clinical Opioid Withdrawal Scale), scales for opioid effects, psychomotor
      assessments, and differential dropout across sessions. We hypothesize that the higher dose of
      TRV734 will be superior to placebo in therapeutic effects and have lower adverse effects
      (including effects on alertness and psychomotor performance) compared to oxycodone.

          -  Willing to provide blood samples through an intravenous catheter.

          -  For women of childbearing potential: must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy
             test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 72 hours prior to
             the first study drug dose (active or placebo) AND agree to use an adequate method of
             contraception (Adequate methods of contraception for sexually active women are those
             who have a male sexual partner(s) who is surgically sterilized prior to inclusion;
             have a sexual partner(s) who is/are exclusively female; is using oral contraceptives
             (either combined or progesterone only) WITH a single-barrier method of contraception
             consisting of spermicide and condom or diaphragm; is using double-barrier
             contraception, specifically, a condom plus spermicide AND a female diaphragm or
             cervical cap; or is using an approved intrauterine device (IUD) with established
             efficacy.) to avoid pregnancy for a period of 3 months beginning from 30 days prior to
             first dose of study drug. Women of childbearing potential include any female who has
             experienced menarche and who has not undergone successful surgical sterilization
             (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or is not
             postmenopausal (Standard NIH Clinical Center criteria for menopause: -Women over age
             55 who have not had a period for 1 year will be considered menopausal and do not need
             a pregnancy test, FSH test, or contraception.

          -  Women between 50-55, who have not had a period for 1 year, should have an FSH test. If
             their FSH level is more than 20, they will be considered menopausal and do not need
             pregnancy testing or contraception. If their FSH level is less than 20, they will need
             pregnancy testing and contraception as required by the protocol.

          -  Women between 45-50 who have not had a period for 1 year will need both an FSH test
             and a pregnancy test. If they are not pregnant and their FSH level is more than 20,
             they will be considered menopausal, and will not require contraception or additional
             pregnancy testing. If their FSH test is less than 20, they will need pregnancy testing
             and contraception as required by the protocol.).

               -  For men, unless surgically sterilized (vasectomy with documentation of
                  azoospermia), must agree to practice abstinence or use barrier contraception, and
                  not donate sperm, for a period of 3 months beginning from first dose of study
                  drug.

                  (6) Self-report of experiencing noticeable opioid withdrawal after missing just
                  one or two days of methadone; this will be operationalized with the screening
                  question: How many days of methadone do you have to miss before you have
                  withdrawal symptoms such as runny nose, nausea, aches, chills, or anxiety?
