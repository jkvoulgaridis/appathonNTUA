  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Craniosacral Therapy (CST) is a non-manipulative, very gentle, manual treatment method that
      aims to release restrictions of the fasciae and regulate the arousal of the sympathetic
      nervous system, which is often increased in chronically ill patients. Initial randomized
      trials support CST`s efficacy and effectiveness in reducing symptoms of patients with
      psychosomatic and chronic pain disorders. To date, there is no trial investigating the
      effectiveness of CST as a supportive strategy for enhancing cancer-related quality of life in
      women with breast cancer. In clinical practice, therapists also report alleviating as well as
      regulating effects of simple CST self-help techniques, offered to patients within a group
      concept.

      Within the recent study, a CST treatment and self-help protocol for women after curative
      therapy of breast cancer was developed and shall be tested against a waiting list control
      group. The first group will receive 24 units of CST treatment in a 1:1 setting with a
      certified craniosacral therapist over 12 weeks. The second group will receive 24 units of
      group training (women with partners) in CST self-help techniques offered by a certified
      craniosacral therapist over 12 weeks. They will be reassessed after 12 and 26 weeks (6
      months) after randomization. The third group will wait for 26 weeks and will receive no
      specific study intervention. After 26 weeks patients of the third group were offered to take
      part in two individual CST interventions and the CST self-help training. For all groups,
      treatment as usual is allowed.

The patients have to agree to participate with a partner (husband, child, friend, etc.) in the introductory day and 90% of the following TUs. All patients will receive a script with theoretical CST information and descriptions of the learned techniques, which should facilitate the correct practice at home.
