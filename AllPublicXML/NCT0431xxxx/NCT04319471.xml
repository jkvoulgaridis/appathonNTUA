      This study is a randomized, phase II, prospective, multicenter clinical trial to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of sufficient chemoradiotherapy plus oral capecitabine/S-1 for 1 year in
      the treatment of oligometastatic Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma

    <description>PFS was defined as the time from randomization to first documented disease progression (PD) using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) or death from any cause, whichever occurred first. For target lesions, PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of the longest diameter recorded since treatment started or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions. For non-target lesions, PD was defined as the appearance of 1 or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with oligometastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (newly diagnosed or after
             treatment) ; patients with first diagnosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma diagnosed by
             pathological biopsy; metastatic focus in principle need biopsy pathological diagnosis;
             but if the patient refuses to take the metastatic biopsy, the clinician decides with
             clinical evidence

          2. Patients with a ECOG score of 0,1 or 2 and an expected survival period of more than 6
             months; those who can cooperate in observing adverse reactions and outcomes;

          3. At least one tumor lesion can be measured according to recist 1.1 criteria

          4. Have good organ function

          5. Informed consent signed and dated indicating that the patient has been informed of all
             relevant aspects of the study ;

          6. Patients who are willing and able to comply with visiting arrangements, treatment
             plans, laboratory tests, and other research procedures ;

          7. Be willing to comply with arrangements during the study to no longer participate in
             any other clinical studies related to drugs and medical devices.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with severe history of rapid-onset allergy to any of the drugs used in this
             study ;

          2. Patients with local and/or regional recurrence;

          3. Combine with other malignancies in 5 years (except non-melanin skin cancer or
             pre-invasion cervical cancer);

          4. Any of the following conditions existed during the first six months of screening:
             myocardial infarction, severe/unstable angina pectoris, coronary/peripheral artery
             transplantation, symptomatic congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular accident,
             transient ischemic attack, or symptomatic pulmonary embolism. patients known to have
             coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure that does not meet the above
             criteria or left ventricular ejection fraction ＜ 50% and must use an optimized stable
             medical protocol determined by the therapist, if appropriate, to consult a
             cardiologist ;

             immunodeficiency virus. Patients with hbv surface antigen (hbsag) positive but HBV DNA

          6. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, drug-induced pneumonia, organic pneumonia
             (bronchiolitis obliterans),Chest CT scans showing evidence of active pneumonia during
             history or screening of idiopathic pneumonia;

          8. Inability or limitation of civil capacity ;

          9. Patients with physical or mental disorders who, according to the researchers, can not
             fully or fully understand the possible complications of the study ;

         10. May increase the risk associated with the treatment of the study protocol, or may
             interfere with the interpretation of the study results and (as judged by the
             researchers) may render the patient unfit to participate in other severe acute or
             chronic medical conditions (including immune colitis, inflammatory bowel disease,
             non-infectious pneumonia, pulmonary fibrosis) or mental disorders (including dementia
             and epilepsy, recent, past year or active suicidal ideation or behavior) or laboratory
             abnormalities ;

         11. Patients with expected survival ＜6 months ;

         12. Previous diagnosis of immunodeficiency or known Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) or

         13. Male or female pregnant or lactating women who have fertility but are unwilling or
             unable to use contraception throughout the study period and at least one year after
