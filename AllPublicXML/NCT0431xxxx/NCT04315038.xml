  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Perform quantitative metabolomics on human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples and establish
      the first human CSF Metabolome Database of aging process in Taiwan.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Metabolomics is new science based on metabolite profiles in biofluids and tissues, which
      under bioinformatics approaches and analyses could help to characterize metabolomic status of
      CSF in aging process. In this prospective study, the investigators plan to enroll 200 health
      volunteers and 40 neurodegenerative diseases patients with received operation under spinal
      anesthesia. Blood and CSF samples will be analyzed using hydrogen-1 nuclear magnetic
      resonance (1H-NMR) and lipid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS).

    <description>Plan to enroll 200 health volunteers and 40 neurodegenerative diseases patients with received spinal anesthesia. Blood will be collected at time point of pre-anesthesia 10 minutes and CSF samples will be collected at time point during spinal anesthesia induction. Blood will be collected, drawn into EDTA-coated tube.</description>

      CSF samples will be stored in aliquots at −80 °C before analysis. The sample will be analyzed
      using hydrogen-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) and lipid chromatography-mass
      spectrometry (LC-MS) in the Metabolomic Core Laboratory at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital or
      Chang Gung University. Demographic data including age, gender, body weight, blood pressure
      and past medical data will be investigated.
