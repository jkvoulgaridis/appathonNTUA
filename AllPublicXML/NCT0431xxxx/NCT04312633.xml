  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to create a registry (collect data and keep it in a research
      database) to learn more about two methods of taking small tissue samples from your esophagus
      (the esophagus is the tube that carries food and liquid from your mouth to your stomach). The
      two methods of sampling are: 1) Using forceps that take biopsies (small tissue samples) from
      your esophagus, and 2) Using a brush that also takes biopsies from your esophagus.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will look at the impact of the brush biopsy results on your doctor's decisions
      about your future care and treatment.

      In addition , by recording the results of all your biopsies over 5 years, it may be possible
      to find out if the brush biopsy, forceps biopsy, or both can predict which patients with
      heartburn develop Barrett's esophagus, (an abnormality in the esophagus that may lead to
      cancer), and which patients with Barrett's esophagus develop precancer and cancer.

      You are being asked to participate in the study because you are receiving an upper endoscopy
      (a procedure where a tube with a light and camera are inserted in your mouth and down your
      throat) with forceps and brush biopsies of your esophagus as part of you standard clinical
      care, and you are at least 18 years old.
