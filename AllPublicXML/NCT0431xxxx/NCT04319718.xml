  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a proof of concept study to determine whether an extended release vaginal film can
      deliver drug for seven days. Two film formulations containing MK-2048 which differ by
      dissolution and spreadability attributes will be compared for safety and pharmacokinetic
      outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I randomized trial assessing the safety, acceptability, and pharmacokinetics
      of two formulations of MK-2048 vaginal film. While the primary objective is to evaluate the
      safety of the product, the overarching objective of this study is to provide proof of concept
      that an antiretroviral drug can be delivered in an extended release film formulation to
      provide drug delivery for 7 days or more after a single application. Forty eight women will
      be randomized with equal frequency to receive a single dose of a vaginal film containing
      MK-2048 (either the high Eudragit® or low Eudragit® formulation). The film will be inserted
      by a clinician on the day of enrollment. Vaginal swabs and plasma will be collected at days
      0, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14 and 28 for all participants. On the day of enrollment, some participants
      may elect to participate in immediate post insertion sample collection (vaginal swab and
      plasma) at one or two time points within 6 hours of insertion. Genital biopsy samples and a
      rectal swab will be obtained on day 7, and cervicovaginal lavage will be collected at
      screening and days 14 and 28. The primary endpoint is the frequency of Grade 2 or higher
      adverse events. The secondary endpoints are: MK-2048 concentrations in plasma, cervical
      tissue homogenate, cervicovaginal lavage fluid, rectal and vaginal swab eluents;
      self-reported assessment of qualities of the experience with the films drawn from existing
      survey on microbicidal films, and general acceptability ratings drawn from market research
      methodology.
