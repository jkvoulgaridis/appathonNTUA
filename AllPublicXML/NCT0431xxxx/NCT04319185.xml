  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with End-Stage Kidney Disease (ESKD) wishing to choose Peritoneal Dialysis (PD) may
      not be able to perform this modality due to advanced age, physical function/dexterity,
      vision, cognition, mobility, or psychosocial issues. This intervention will seek to test the
      feasibility of a clinical support model to address these barriers.

      Patients identified by their nephrologist as wishing to choose Peritoneal Dialysis (PD), but
      needing assistance, are referred to the research staff for discussion and consent.

      Based on the assessment of the subject's nephrologist, PD staff, and researchers, the subject
      will receive assistance beyond the standard PD care offered in US dialysis centers. Such
      assistance will be provided for up to one visit/day, seven days/week, for up to three months.
      At the end of that time period, the subject will be able to perform PD independently, have
      identified a care provider, or have planned with his/her nephrologist for an alternative
      dialysis modality.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A patient identified by his/her nephrologist or the WellBound dialysis staff as a candidate
      for Peritoneal Dialysis (PD) who meets the inclusion criteria will be referred to the
      research staff for a discussion of the study and consent. A referral to this program can come
      from any physician referring to participating centers.

        -  Each subject consented into the study receives the standard of care education and
           training for home PD, in addition to the usual insertion of a PD catheter.

        -  The subject is then transferred to home PD with an individualized assistance plan and
           research follow-up.

        -  The subject receives the assistance of up to one visit per day depending on the
           subject's needs, as assessed by the interdisciplinary team, the nephrologist, and the
           primary investigator or delegate.

        -  The assistance will be provided by a research associate who has undergone full training
           in the PD techniques required to assist the PD subject at home.

        -  Every 4 weeks the PI or delegate reviews the subject's progress with the nephrologist
           and nephrology nurse to assess further assistance needs.

        -  Total assistance of up to 3 months is provided after which the subject is either
           independent, has a care provider, or has developed a plan with his/her nephrologist for
           future dialysis care.
