  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed as a randomized, double blinded and placebo-controlled clinical
      trial. The aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Zhigancao Tang granule
      in patients with HFpEF of Qi-Yin dificiency.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF) is a clinical syndrome characterized
      by diastolic dysfunction.The incidence of HFpEF is increasing in recent years. Standard
      treatment of heart failure does not improve the prognosis of HFPEF patients. Zhigancao Tang
      was used to improve the symptoms of chronic heart failure in China.This
      randomized,double-blinded and placebo-controlled trial will objectively and standardly
      evaluate the effectiveness and safety of Zhigancao Tang granule.After 12 weeks of treatment,
      122 HFpEF patients with deficiency of Qi and Yin were observed and evaluated in terms of
      heart function, clinical symptoms,exercise tolerance and quality of life.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cardiac Functional Grading</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Significant effect: cardiac function recovered to level 1 or increased by level 2; Effective: cardiac function increased by level 1 but failed to reach level 2; Ineffective: cardiac function did not change; Worsening: cardiac function decreased by level 1 or above.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ultrasonic cardiogram</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Echocardiographic measurement of Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), left ventricular end diastolic diameter (LVEDd), left ventricular end systolic diameter (LVESD), ratio of left ventricular early diastolic fast filling peak to late diastolic filling peak (E / a), ratio of early diastolic velocity of mitral valve to early diastolic annular velocity (E / E ').</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>6-min walking test (6mwt)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>6 minute walking test (6mwt) is a measure of the distance the patient can reach as far as possible by walking on a hard ground without obstacles within six minutes at the fastest possible speed. It provides a comprehensive assessment of exercise capacity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Minnesota Heart Failure Quality of Life Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Minnesota Heart Failure Quality of Life Scale was used to assess the impact of heart failure on life in the last four weeks. A total of 21 questions related to physical and emotional change. Higher scores mean a worse outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide（NT-proBNP）</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>NT-proBNP is a reliable and sensitive indicator of heart failure. Its elevation is positively correlated with severity of heart failure.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>TCM syndrome score</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>TCM syndrome score is used to assess changes in Qi-Yin Dificiency related symptoms during treatment. The higher the scores, the more heart failure symptoms. Higher scores mean a worse outcome.</description>
