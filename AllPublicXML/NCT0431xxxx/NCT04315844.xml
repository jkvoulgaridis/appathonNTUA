      To evaluate the efficacy and security of Ewata combined with a stent device in the treatment
      of acute ischemic stroke within 8 hours To prove whether the clinical efficacy and safety of
      Ewata r is not inferior to other guidings.

      This clinical trial uses multicenter, single-arm, prospective trial design,people who met the
      enrollment requirements were performed with Ewata balloon guiding and stent type thrombectomy
      device.The clinical results were compared with those of other historical guiding catheter
      products combined with the stent type thrombectomy device to to evaluate the clinical
      efficacy and safety of Ewata balloon guide catheter in combination with a stent for
      thrombectomy.

    <description>When the balloon guiding catheter arrives at the desired location, the thrombectomy instrument can enter the balloon guiding catheter smoothly, which can be opened successfully when needed to form a local blockage of blood flow. After the thrombectomy, the thrombectomy instrument can be withdrawn back into the guide catheter, which is considered as a success.Ewata balloon guide catheter should be used at least once during thrombectomy</description>
