  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study based on data concerning the first pregnancy treated and followed up after the
      diagnosis of oAPS in the NOH-APS cohort, according to clinical results already published; and
      on a thematic library collected and preserved at the time of the positive pregnancy test.

      ADAMTS 13 will be explored in the available samples defined above: ADAMTS13 antigen (presence
      of the molecule), ADAMTS13 activity (VWF proteolysis activity of the molecule), global
      autoantibodies against ADAMTS13 (plasma antibodies recognizing solid phase insolubilized
      ADAMTS13), these 3 parameters for the description of ADAMTS13 being measured using
      commercially available diagnostic kits, ELISA type, Technozyme® range, Technoclone, Vienna,
      Austria.

      The clinical endpoint evaluated will be the occurrence (yes/no) of preeclampsia, which is
      assessed globally, all subtypes combined. Then evaluated according to subtype: late
      preeclampsia from 34 weeks, early preeclampsia before 34 weeks, eclampsia (convulsions),
      HELLP syndrome, preeclampsia associated with the birth of a small-for-gestational-age child
      (defined at percentile 10 of the tables adjusted for gestational age and sex; severe: defined
      at percentile 3), preeclampsia associated with a retro-placental hematoma, ...
