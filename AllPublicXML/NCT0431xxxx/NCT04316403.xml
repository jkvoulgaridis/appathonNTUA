  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Erbium lasers have been suggested to accomplish corticotomy without flap reflection due to
      their attractive advantages. The current trial aimed to evaluate the efficacy of
      laser-assisted flapless corticotomy in accelerating orthodontic tooth movement. The secondary
      aim was to evaluate the patients' responses to laser application. It was postulated that
      canine retraction after laser-assisted flapless corticotomy would be accomplished within a
      shorter period compared with the conventional canine retraction method, with no significant
      degree of pain and discomfort.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Comprehensive orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances usually takes more than 18 months
      in mild and severe cases. Prolonged treatment time can cause many adverse effects such as
      pain, discomfort, external root resorption, white spots and dental caries. Decreasing the
      treatment time for tooth movement has been the focus of both the clinicians and the patients.
      For the last few decades, investigators have recommended many treatment approaches intending
      to reduce overall treatment time such as low friction and self-ligating bracket systems,
      low-level laser irradiation, electrical currents, pharmacological approaches, local
      platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injection and surgical approaches like dentoalveolar distraction
      and selective alveolar decortication or corticotomy

    <description>A questionnaire was administered at the 1st, 3rd, 5th and 7th day after laser application. The questionnaire contained 5 questions (using 4-point Likert ordinal scales) to collect patients' responses on the following questions:
Question 1: Do you feel pain during eating? Question 2: Do you feel pain during the day? Question 3: Do you feel pain that can awaken you during the night? Question 4: Do you feel swollen on the surgical side?
The possible answers were:
1. No 2.Mild 3.Moderate 4. Severe For the first four questions, the higher the score, the worse the feeling was.
Question 5: Which one of the following has caused more discomfort to you?
1. Extraction of premolars 2. Laser application 3.Both</description>
