  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study was to assess the effect of repeated oral doses of
      Loperamide on the pharmacokinetic profile of a single dose of Pyrotinib Maleate.

      The secondary objective of the study was to assess the safety of Pyrotinib Maleate given
      alone versus Fluzoparib coadministered with Loperamide.
