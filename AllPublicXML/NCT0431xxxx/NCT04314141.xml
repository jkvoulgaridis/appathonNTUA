  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The phalloplasty is a reconstruction technique, consisting of the neophallus creation.

      It is performed in transgender patients in sex reassignment surgery, or in cismale patients
      to correct a congenital or acquired lack of penis.

      There are many surgical techniques, but none is optimal. Surgical and functional outcomes,
      quality of life and patient's satisfactions with phalloplasty are missing in the
      international literature.

      Urological center of Lyon is a reference center of this kind of surgery and has the
      possibility to evaluate that.

      In this study, 124 transgender and 19 cismale patients with phalloplasty are eligible.

      This study will allow us to adapt our practice to the patient's return and improve the
      information given to patients before their surgery.

      It will also improve our surgical techniques, depending on the results achieved.
