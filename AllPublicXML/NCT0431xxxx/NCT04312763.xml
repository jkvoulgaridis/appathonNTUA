  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to validate an observer-rated assessment titled &quot;Functional Low-Vision
      Observer Rated Assessment (FLORA-20)&quot;, which comprises 20 functional vision tasks commonly
      performed in or around a blind individual's home environment. This study shall be carried out
      with individuals who have an implanted visual prosthesis device. There are no new
      implantations or changes to the original implant or external wearables being studied or
      tested. Additionally, data from the study shall not be used alter standard of care or the
      user's treatment options.
