  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common genetic cause of autism spectrum disorder (ASD).
      The investigators wish to examine brain distribution of sigma-1 receptors in young adult
      males with FXS using 18F-FTC-146 PET. This project will study the distribution of sigma-1
      receptors in 15 young (18-30 years) male adults with FXS compared to 5 healthy adult
      volunteers.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the study, we will measure sigma-1 receptor density in the regions of interest in brain
      known to be involved in executive functioning and cognition using 18F-FTC-146 PET. We will
      then compare S1R density in areas ROIs not involved in executive functioning and
      cognition.This will provide a framework for predicting functional impairment based on
      brain-behavior relationships.

      The study has two aims. The first aim is to evaluate the reliability of 18F-FTC-146 brain
      uptake in healthy controls under test and retest conditions to establish a baseline measure
      of S1R density and quantify regional brain uptake of radiotracer in five healthy adults. The
      second aim is to characterize S1R density in brains of young adult males with FXS which will
      then be compared to healthy volunteers.

      This would be the very first PET study to image sigma-1 receptor density in participants with
      fragile X syndrome, thereby testing whether altered receptor density is present in brain in
      fragile X syndrome patients when compared to healthy volunteers. If confirmed, the current
      study would provide compelling clinical-translational support for an important
      pathophysiological mechanism of cognition and executive function. The current study has
      considerable potential for advancing the neurobiological understanding of fragile X syndrome
      in humans.

    <description>Regional brain uptake of [18F]FTC-146 will be analyzed by kinetic modeling with metabolite-corrected arterial input functions to establish stability and reproducibility of [18F] FTC-146 in humans under test and retest conditions.

    <time_frame>Up to 6 hours per scan performed on Day 0 (both groups) and Day 7 (healthy volunteers)</time_frame>
    <description>Binding potential provides an estimate of the S1R receptor distribution and affinity of [18F]FTC-146 to the S1R receptors. Binding potential measurements will be compared between participants with fragile X syndrome and control group with healthy volunteers to assess if there is a difference. Binding Potential (BPND) is estimated as the distribution volume ratio (DVR) -1.
DVR's of tracers are used in PET receptor studies where the radiopharmaceutical can be specifically bound to receptors; nonspecifically bound to other macromolecular components, or free in tissue (FT). DVR is calculated using a Logan Plot, which uses the dynamic PET images obtained during imaging and compartment modeling to graphically analyze by linear regression pharmacokinetic data for radiopharmaceuticals that undergo 'reversible' uptake.
Healthy volunteers will have scans at Day 0 and Day 7, and FXS patients will have a single scan on day 0. All scans will be analyzed.</description>
