  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to measure the effect of tirzepatide on food intake in
      participants who are overweight or very overweight. The study will also use imaging to learn
      more about how tirzepatide affects specific parts of the brain. The effect of tirzepatide on
      appetite will also be studied. The study will last up to about four months and will include
      up to 14 visits to the study center.

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Fasting and Postprandial Appetite Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 3</time_frame>
    <description>The VAS scales will be analyzed as continuous variables on the 0-100 scale for individual components. Overall appetite score will be calculated as the average of the four individual scores (satiety + fullness + [100-prospective food consumption] + [100-hunger]/4). The higher overall appetite score indicates less appetite and the lower score indicates more appetite.</description>
