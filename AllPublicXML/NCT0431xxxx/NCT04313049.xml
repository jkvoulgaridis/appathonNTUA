    <textblock>
      As part of the EMPATIA @ Lecco project, task 2.9 and task 4.5 respectively provide for the
      refinement and testing of robotic solutions on the market oriented towards patient
      empowerment. Within the LARA project, the JACO2 mechanical arm (Kinova Technology, Montreal,
      QC, Canada), a medical device, which can perform some functions as if it were the subject's
      arm, will be tested. JACO2 can be controlled by joystick, supplied with the system, or by
      voice control system, developed by CNR-ITIA to allow use even for those with severe strength
      impairments. The trial will involve patients with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), Becker
      Muscular Dystrophy (BMD), Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy (LGMD), congenital and
      Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy (FSH) over the age of 10 years. In literature of the
      last decade we find evidence of social and personal benefits deriving from the use of
      assistive mechanical arms in daily life activities by patients with disabilities due to
      neuromuscular diseases. The results indicate improved quality of life, greater self-esteem
      and greater integration into society. In addition to the benefits for the person, it has been
      shown that the introduction of assistive technologies in the life of patients can lead to
      potential savings on direct and indirect costs of National Health Services. Assistive robotic
      arms have a potential user base of approximately 150,000 people only in the United States of
      America. This population includes subjects who have partially lost the function of the upper
      limb due to degenerative diseases or because of spinal cord injuries or infantile cerebral
      palsy. The number of potential users could increase by improving the usability of these
      systems that, at the moment, still require a certain functionality of the upper limb, in
      general, and of the hand, in particular. It is in fact known that the introduction of
      assistive technologies in daily life is not limited so much by the fact that patients do not
      accept or profit from them, but rather by the actual possibility of using them effectively.
      Therefore, a customization of the functionality of the devices based on needs and wishes of
      the patients alongside an improvement in their usability would lead to an increase in
      potential users. It is for this reason that usability, together with safety, has become one
      of the most studied topics in assistive robotics. In the case of assistive robotic
      manipulators, usability problems often concern their control which, even today, takes place
      through the use of joysticks that require fine motor skills in the hand. In fact, being
      systems with multiple degrees of freedom, that is, equipped with different segments that can
      translate (or rotate) in different directions, different buttons are integrated in the
      control joysticks in addition to the classic lever with knob. From this emerges the need to
      develop alternative joystick control methods that do not involve the use of the hand.
