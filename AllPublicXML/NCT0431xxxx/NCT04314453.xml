  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Different procedure of percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomy (PELD) was with ventral
      decompression of dural sac on the lumbar spinal stenosis remains unkonwn.The traditional
      transforaminal endoscopic spine system (TESSYS) of PELD has been used in clnical for many
      years, but cannot achieve dorsal decompression. A newly developed modified TESSYS procedure,
      &quot;U&quot; route PELD combining ventral and dorsal decompression was introduced. Nevertheless, the
      superior between TESSYS and &quot;U&quot; route PELD procedures on treating LSS remains unknown. This
      study is desinged to recruit degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis patients who underwent
      TESSYS or &quot;U&quot; rout PELD, recruited from January 2014 to December 2017. These patients will be
      followed up for 2 years, and assessed the minimum dura sac cross sectional area (mDCSA) by
      MRI, and visual analogue scale (VAS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) at pre- and
      post-operation. The global clinical outcomes were evaluated using modified MacNab criteria
      postoperatively. Thus, comprehensively evaluate the safety and therapeutic effects of the two
      PELD procedures on LSS treatments.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  (1) patients with the diagnosis of degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) (central
             stenosis with or without lateral recess stenosis) on mono or double segments, with the
             imaging evidence of magnetic resonance images (MRI) and computed tomography (CT); (2)
             patients presented low back pain, limp and sciatica, and have accepted conservative
             treatment more than 3 months but failed in symptoms relief; (3) patients agreed to
             accept TESSYS or the &quot;U&quot; route PELD procedure over other spinal surgeries; (4)
             patients had lumbar MRI imaging examines in our hospital at pre- and post-operation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  (1) patients with spinal instability, including dynamic instability or more than Grade
             II spondylolisthesis; (2) patients had spinal surgical history; (3) patients with
             peripheral nerve disease, systematic infection, bleeding diathesis or high risk of
             bleeding that cannot tolerate the surgery; (4) patients with mental illness and were
             uncooperative; (5) patients lost to the follow up.
