  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center prospective, observational study of the Quantra System with the QStat
      Cartridge in trauma patients and patients undergoing liver transplant.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Quantra System is a fully integrated and automated in vitro diagnostic device which uses
      SEER Sonorheometry, an ultrasound-based technology, to characterize the viscoelastic
      properties of a whole blood sample during coagulation. The QStat Cartridge was developed to
      monitor hemostasis in patients that may experience a range of coagulopathies of various
      etiologies, including fibrinolytic defects. These patients include the trauma and liver
      transplant populations. The cartridge consists of four independent channels each containing
      different sets of reagents, which provide four measurements performed in parallel yielding
      five parameters that depict the functional status of a patient's coagulation system.

      This multi-center, prospective, observational pilot study will evaluate the performance of
      the Quantra System with the QStat Cartridge as compared to conventional viscoelastic testing
      methods in blood samples obtained from trauma patients and patients undergoing liver
      transplant.
