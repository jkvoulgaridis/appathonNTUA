  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed project aims to evaluate the safety of DuraMesh™ suture for laparotomy closure
      in an emergent setting, while also providing preliminary efficacy data with regard to
      incisional hernia prevention. Conventional techniques for laparotomy closure in the setting
      of an emergency laparotomy or delayed abdominal closure suffer from a lack of durability,
      with incisional hernia rates of 30-34% reported. While prophylactic planar mesh placement has
      emerged as a cost-effective strategy to prevent hernia formation in the clean, elective
      laparotomy setting, higher rates of surgical site complications and increased technical
      complexity preclude its use in the emergency or contaminated setting. Utilized exactly like
      conventional suture without any change in surgical closure technique, DuraMesh™ provides the
      durability of planar mesh reinforcement without the marked increase in foreign material or
      added surgical complexity. As a result, DuraMesh™ is the only hernia prevention strategy that
      can be forward-deployed in support of the injured warfighter. While this study is
      specifically targeted to a gap in the care of the injured warfighter, the potential benefits
      extend well beyond the military applications. With over 2 million laparotomies performed
      annually in the United States, and approximately 20% of these resulting in an incisional
      hernia, the need for an alternative abdominal wall closure strategy is equally dire in the
      civilian setting. This clinical trial represents an opportunity to drive the needed paradigm
      shift towards prevention, rather than costly management of incisional hernias. The
      investigators anticipate this work will rapidly lead to further research, including providing
      the preliminary data necessary to launch a multi-center randomized controlled trial to assess
      the clinical efficacy of DuraMesh™ for hernia prevention in both the emergent and elective
      operative settings.

  <detailed_description>

      This is a multisite randomized control proof-of-concept trial to evaluate the safety of
      DuraMesh™ laparotomy closure in the trauma and emergency laparotomy setting. Approximately
      120 patients will be randomized (2:1) to DuraMesh™ laparotomy closure versus conventional
      suture closure. #1 DuraMesh™ will be provided for patients assigned to the DuraMesh™
      treatment arm. Patients will participate in a one-year follow-up regime (2 weeks,1 month, 3
      months, 6 months and 12 months).

      Primary Laparotomy Closure Treatment 1) Study Group - DuraMesh™ Laparotomy Closure (DLC)
      Treatment 2) Control Group - Conventional Suture Closure (CSC)

      Patients undergoing a midline laparotomy for trauma or emergency surgery will be randomized
      to either #1 DuraMesh™ suture or conventional laparotomy closure using size #1
      slowly-absorbing (PDS) single strand or looped suture, based on surgeon preference. All
      patients will be assessed for post-operative complications at 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, 6
      months, and 12 months postoperatively. Patients will also be assessed for incisional hernia
      formation at the same post-operative time points (2 weeks,1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 12
      months). Hernia outcomes will be based on physical examination, with ultrasound used for any
      uncertainties.
