    <measure>Mean Percent Adhesion</measure>
    <time_frame>12 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Percent adhesion is assessed by laying a transparent sheet the exact size of the product over the top of the product and outlining areas of adhesion with a marker on the transparent sheet. The area excluded from the adhered area will be assessed to determine the degree of lift-off. Adhesion is assessed every 3 hours after product application. Mean percent adhesion is calculated as the sum of scores at each assessment time point divided by the total number of observations.</description>

    <description>Subjects receive both lidocaine topical system 1.8% and the generic lidocaine patch 5%. The sequence in which they receive the lidocaine products is determined by random assignment. For subjects in Arm 1, lidocaine 1.8% topical systems are applied in Period 1, and the generic lidocaine 5% patches are applied in Period 2.</description>
