  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sinusoidal Obstruction Syndrome (SOS), also referred to as hepatic veno-occlusive disease
      (VOD), is rare but serious complication of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT).
      Defibrotide is the only FDA approved therapy to treat SOS and has significantly improved
      outcomes. When applied early, SOS symptoms often quickly improve and an abbreviated course
      can be applied. This study is looking at an abbreviated 5 day course of defibrotide in those
      patients with a complete response to therapy with the primary outcome being day 100 overall
      survival as compared to history data.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sinusoidal obstructive syndrome (SOS) has a reported mean incidence of 13.7% and even among
      those undergoing reduced intensity conditioning regimens is approximately 9%. SOS is a
      clinical syndrome characterized by painful hepatomegaly, jaundice, ascites, fluid retention,
      and weight gain. The onset is usually before day 35 after stem cell infusion. SOS ranges in
      severity from a mild reversible disease to a severe syndrome associated with multiorgan
      failure (MOF) and death. Prior to the introduction of defibrotide, severe SOS was nearly
      universally fatal with a mortality rate approaching 100% by day 100 after allo-SCT.

      The diagnosis of SOS/VOD is clinical and should be considered in any patient who has
      undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and develops liver dysfunction. Patients
      with mild or moderate disease have reasonably good outcomes with supportive therapy alone
      while in contrast prognosis is much worse in severe SOS which occurs in about 25-30% cases.

      Defibrotide is the only established Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved therapy to
      treat SOS. It is now approved for use in adults and children with SOS with renal or pulmonary
      dysfunction following HCT. The standard treatment is 25 mg/kg/day in 4 divided doses of 6.25
      mg/kg for 21 days. However, responses are frequently brisk and complete in many patients thus
      it has been postulated that in responding patients this treatment course could be abbreviated
      given the risk for adverse events such as hypotension/shock and hemorrhage.

      This is an open label pilot study evaluating an abbreviated 5 (as compared to 21) day course
      of defibrotide in patients with confirmed SOS. The primary outcome is day 100 survival as
      compared to historical data.

    <intervention_model_description>The goal of this study is to assess the 100-day survival of a 5-day defibrotide treatment for hepatic SOS in allogeneic stem cell transplant patients compared to the standard 21-day treatment. It is hypothesized that the 5-day treatment will have non-inferior 100-day survival rates to the 21-day treatment. Historically, 100-day survival has been 58.9% in moderate and 38.2% in severe SOS. Investigators believe that the null survival for the 21-day defibrotide treatment is 50%. Investigators wish to determine non-inferiority of the 5-day treatment with a 5% margin of error.</intervention_model_description>
