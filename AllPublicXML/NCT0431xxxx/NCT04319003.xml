  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kiritimati is an isolated coral atoll in the Pacific Ocean, and is one of 32 islands that
      comprise the Republic of Kiribati. Obesity and type 2 diabetes rates are high in Kiribati,
      but the causes and rates of childhood obesity/diabetes are unknown. However, it has been
      hypothesized that high consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages on Kiritimati may be a
      contributing factor. The investigators therefore conducted a study in Kiritimati in September
      2018 with the aim of 1) quantifying obesity and diabetes rates amongst children on Kiritimati
      and 2) testing the feasibility of a sugar-reduction intervention in Kiritimati schools. The
      investigators randomized the two high schools on the island to either the control group or
      the intervention group. The investigators measured height/weight, continuous blood glucose
      (using flash glucose monitoring), and diet (using 24-hour diet recalls). One week into the
      study, the intervention school received an intervention, which consisted of installation of a
      water filter at the school, the provision of water bottles to each student at the school, and
      a 30-minute educational presentation on the link between sugar consumption and type 2
      diabetes. The investigators then measured how blood glucose and diet changed the week
      following the intervention, and compared this to the control school.
