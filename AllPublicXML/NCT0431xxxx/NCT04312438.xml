      The aim of the study is to assess the safety of an oral food challenge (OFC) with cow's milk
      proteins and to assess the tolerance of cow's milk proteins in children with a food allergy
      after introducing cow's milk into the diet.

      The aim of the study is to assess the safety of an oral food challenge test with cow's milk
      proteins and to assess the tolerance of cow's milk proteins in children with food allergies
      after introducing cow's milk into the diet.

      The study covers children over 12 months of age diagnosed with cow's milk allergy, treated
      with a non-dairy elimination diet based on extensively-hydrolyzed formulas or amino acid
      formulas, admitted to the Department of Pediatrics, Gastroenterology and Nutrition to conduct
      an open oral food challenge. In all children, after appropriate assessment and qualification
      (interview, physical examination, skin prick tests, results of allergen - specific
      immunoglobulin E (IgE), total blood count, fecal calprotectin and lactoferrin), an oral food
      challenge test with cow's milk will be performed. The oral food challenge test will be
      carried out in accordance with current standards and with child protection in the event of an
      adverse reactions. During the food challenge test (first 24 hours), after 2 weeks (phone
      survey) and 3 months after the test (visit to the Department) the frequency, severity and
      type of allergic reactions and cow's milk protein tolerance will be assessed. The safety of
      oral food challenge with cow's milk protein in children previously fed with extensively -
      hydrolyzed formulas or amino acid formulas will be compared. The results of allergy tests,
      total blood count and intestinal inflammatory markers (fecal calprotectin and fecal
      lactoferrin) will also be assessed before and 12 weeks after oral food challenge. The
      assessment of the incidence and severity of allergic reactions and tolerance of cow's milk
      proteins after introduction into the diet in children challenged with cow's milk proteins may
      help to establish guidelines on the qualifications and how to conduct an oral challenge test.
