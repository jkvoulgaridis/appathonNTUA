  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary abnormalities are present in up to 60% of patients with early rheumatoid arthritis
      (RA), and up to 10% of the patients will develop clinical interstitial lung disease (ILD).
      Recent data indicate that inhibition of Janus kinase is beneficial for this extra-articular
      manifestation. Our goal is to determine whether tofacitinib is an effective and safe
      treatment, compared to standard-of-care methotrexate, for subclinical and clinical ILD in
      patients with early RA. The study also explores disease mechanisms in lungs and joints, to
      identify potential biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, and response to treatment of RA-ILD.

      Study objectives:

      Primary objective: Effects of tofacitinib compared to that of methotrexate on interstitial
      pulmonary abnormalities at 24 weeks.

      Secondary objectives: Effects of tofacitinib compared to that of methotrexate on pulmonary
      abnormalities and function, RA disease activity and remission rates and patient reported
      outcome measures at different time points. Frequency of adverse events.

      Exploratory objectives: Effects of tofacitinib compared to that of methotrexate on cellular
      and molecular activity profiles of clinical samples from joints and lungs.

      Study design:

      A randomized, actively controlled, open-label, assessor-blinded, multicenter 48 weeks phase
      IV trial. The study design includes an optional sub-study collecting tissue samples using
      ultrasound-guided synovial biopsies and bronchoalveolar lavage.

      Study population and intervention:

      Patients with early untreated RA with active and seropositive disease will be eligible for
      screening and the performance of high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT). Subjects with
      pulmonary abnormalities suggestive of RA-ILD will be randomized (1:1) to tofacitinib 5 mg BID
      (group 1) or standard-of-care methotrexate 20 mg weekly (group 2) for 48 weeks. All patients
      receive prednisone with tapering for 6 weeks. Patients with incomplete response at 24 weeks
      will escalate to combination therapy with tofacitinib+methotrexate (group 3). Intra-articular
      injections of cortisone will be allowed during the study.

      145 subjects will be included and screened (part 1), and approximately 48 subjects will be
      randomized to active treatment (part 2).
