  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Muscle power training has proven to be an effective intervention to prevent sarcopenia and
      frailty in old people. In the last decade, new concepts related to the functionality of old
      people have been generated, such as muscle quality and functional capacity.

      The power training consists of rapid movements of short duration that imply a more
      specialized neuromuscular response and that improve the functional response reflected in
      activities of daily life that demand a certain manifestation of muscular power (stand up of a
      chair, climbing stairs, rebalance, accelerate suddenly, among others). Therefore, it is
      important to investigate the dose-response relationships in power training in older people
      and establish how possible improvements in muscle quality can be reflected in functional
      capacity.

      The aim of this study is to compare the effects of power training at two different loads on
      muscle quality and functional capacity in women aged 65-75

      Fifty-six women will be randomly assigned to one of two muscle power training supervised for
      a physical activity instructor with different velocity loss (VL) thresholds: 10% (VL10) and
      30% (VL30). Subjects followed a muscle power training for 8 weeks (2 sessions per week on
      alternate days) using the leg extension exercise, with similar relative intensity (50% 1RM).
      Between weeks one and four two series will be performed per session. Then the number of
      series will increase to three per session. The inter-set recovery period will be always of
      2-min.

      Before and after the muscle power training the following tests will be performed: 1) measure
      of body composition with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry for determining the lean mass of
      thighs; 2) three functional test (chair stand test, time up go test with cognitive task and
      gait speed test); 3)Progressive loading test in a leg extension machine until finding the
      mean muscle power corresponding to 50% of 1RM (speed of concentric phase of 6.67 Â± 0.04 m/s
      measured using a camera-based optoelectronic system).

    <measure>Change on chair stand test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants stand up straight as quickly as they can five times, without stopping in between. After standing up each time, subjects will sit down and then stand up again. They will keep their arms folded across their chest. The examiner will be timing with a stopwatch.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change on time up go test with cognitive task</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The participant stands up from a chair, walks to the mark 3 m away, turns around, returns to the chair, and sits down again. The participants walk safely, as fast as possible. While walking, the participant counts backward in threes from a randomly chosen start number between 60 and 100 to avoid a learning effect.</description>
