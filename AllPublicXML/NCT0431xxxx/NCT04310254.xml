    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized clinical trial was to evaluate the incidence of postoperative
      pain after root canal treatment using different final irrigation protocols. Patients whom
      need root canal treatment for first time were included. The presence of postoperative pain
      was assessed after root canal treatment cases at 12, 24, 48, 72 hrs and 1 week.

      The aim of this clinical study was to evaluate the intensity and duration of postoperative
      pain following different final irrigation procedures. Patients who have asymptomaticdevital
      teeth required endodontic treatment were included in this study and routine root canal
      treatment procedure was applied to these teeth. All of the patients have been recruited from
      the Istanbul Medipol University Dental Clinics in Istanbul. Ninety asymptomatic teeth were
      randomly participated into 3 treatment groups in terms of intracanal medicament applied. The
      presence of postoperative pain was assessed after 12, 24, 48, 72 hrs and 1 week.
      Postoperative pain was recorded by each patient by using visual analogue pain scale. Before
      the treatments, the nature of the study, complications and associated risks were totally
      explained and written informed consent was obtained from all study participants. The patients
      were offered local anesthetic before the treatment start. The routine root canal treatment
      procedure was applied. Different final irrigation solutions applied in accordance to the
      manufacturers' instructions. At the end of treatment, each patient was given an evaluation
      sheet, explained the treatment procedure and using of visual analogue pain scales, and
      informed to be returned during the following one week. After one week the teeth was examined
      according to for pain intensity, percussion &amp; palpation sensitivity, swelling, analgesic
      intake and clinical status.

    <description>The primary outcome measure of the study was to assess if different intracanal medicaments and single-visit root canal treatment influence the occurrence of postoperative pain.Postoperative pain was assessed using a well defined Heft-Parker visual analogue scale (VAS) scale. Each patient recorded the pain level on a 100-mm VAS scale experimental basis for revising the graphic rating scale for pain in well-defined categories at 5 time intervals as 12, 24, 48, 72 hours and 1 week after treatment. The VAS scale was divided into 4 categories: No pain or faint pain corresponded to 0 mm. Mild pain was defined as greater than 0 mm and less than or equal to 25 mm. Mild pain included the descriptors of weak and mild pain. Moderate pain was defined as greater than 50 mm and less than 75 mm. Intense pain was defined as equal to or greater than 75 mm. Intense pain included the descriptors of strong, severe, and maximum possible.</description>
