      Purpose: Using a novel oxygen blender prototype with modified bCPAP to manage children 1
      month to 5 years of age hospitalized with respiratory distress due to lower respiratory tract
      infection (LRTI) in low-resource settings is not associated with clinical failure within 1
      hour of use.

      Aim: To investigate if this novel oxygen blender is safe to use among children 1 month to 5
      years old hospitalized for respiratory distress from lower respiratory tract infections in a
      low-resource setting.

      The study will be a prospective cohort feasibility and safety trial. Patients admitted to
      Chenla Children's Healthcare who meet eligibility criteria will be asked for consent and then
      enrolled. Once enrolled, the participant will be treated per hospital protocols and
      stabilized on bCPAP respiratory support. Once stable for 2 hours, the blender will be
      incorporated into the bCPAP circuit. At this point, the study nurses will begin recording
      data for the study as well as providing standard medical care per hospital protocols.

    <measure>Feasibility as Measured by Clinical Failure</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome of this study is the feasibility of the investigational device as measured by clinical failure within 1 hour of installing the blender in the bubble continuous positive airway pressure (bCPAP) circuit. Clinical failure is defined as the occurrence of any of the following patient events: intubation, death, or transfer for higher level of care, or any 2 of the following events; &lt;85% O2 saturation after 30 min of treatment, new signs of respiratory distress, or partial pressure of carbon dioxide greater than 60 mmHg and pH less than 7.2 in capillary blood gas.
Outcome will be reported as the percent of participants who experience clinical failure within 1 hour after blender installation.</description>

    <time_frame>Approximately 7 days</time_frame>
    <description>Oxygen saturation will be measured with pulse oximeter every 6 hours for the length of hospital submission. Outcome will be reported as mean of all measurements per patient. Units are percent.</description>

    <measure>Bubble Continuous Positive Air Pressure (bCPAP) Maintenance</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 7 days</time_frame>
    <description>bCPAP maintenance is defined as the number of times no bubbling in the water column is noted by study staff indicating the need for maintenance. Need for maintenance will be assessed every 2 hours for the length of hospital stay. Number of incidents per patient will be recorded and outcome will be reported as a mean value of all measurements per patient.</description>

    <measure>Blender Maintenance</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 7 days</time_frame>
    <description>Blender maintenance is defined as the number of times the blender needs to be repaired or replaced per patient. Need for maintenance will be assessed every 2 hours for the length of hospital stay. Number of incidents per patient will be recorded and outcome will be reported as mean value of all measurements per patient.</description>

    <intervention_name>Low-Resource Oxygen Blender</intervention_name>
    <description>The device that is being evaluated is a novel low-cost, high access oxygen blender designed to be used in the World Health Organization bCPAP design. It functions by utilizing the Venturi effect, whereby a narrow jet of one fluid (i.e. oxygen) creates a suction effect and entrains surrounding ambient fluid (i.e. room air) into the jet, effectively creating a mixed solution of both fluids. The cost of materials amounts to approximately 1.40 U.S.D. The average time it takes to build a blender and incorporate it into a bCPAP circuit for a new user is approximately 16 minutes. The materials can all be found in a standard hospital, namely 3cc syringes with rubber stops and a 22 gauge hypodermic needle.</description>
