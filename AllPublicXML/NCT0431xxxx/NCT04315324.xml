    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well OBI-3424 works in treating patients with T-cell acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia that has come back (relapsed) or does not response to treatment
      (refractory). Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as OBI-3424, work in different ways to stop
      the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or
      by stopping them from spreading. OBI-3424 may reduce the amount of leukemia in the body.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess the response rate (complete remission [CR] or CR with incomplete count recovery
      [CRi]) of AKR1C3-activated prodrug OBI-3424 (OBI‐3424) in patients with relapsed/refractory
      T‐cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the frequency and severity of toxicities of OBI‐3424 in this patient
      population.

      II. To estimate event‐free survival (EFS), relapse‐free survival (RFS) and overall survival
      (OS) in this patient population.

      TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate minimal/measurable residual disease (MRD) negativity (among patients who
      achieve CR or CRi).

      II. To bank specimens for future research.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive AKR1C3-activated prodrug OBI-3424 intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days
      1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 17 cycles in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every month for 1 year, every 2
      months for 1 year, every 3 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months for up to 5 years from
      registration.

             prior to registration

          -  Patients must have no evidence of &gt;= grade 2 acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) or
             moderate or severe limited chronic GVHD and must have no history of extensive GVHD of
             any severity within 90 days prior to registration. Extensive GVHD is defined as 1)
             generalized skin involvement or 2) localized skin involvement and/or hepatic
             dysfunction plus liver histology or cirrhosis or involvement of eye or minor salivary
             organ or oral mucosa or any other target organ

          -  Patients must not have systemic fungal, bacterial, viral or other infection that is
             not controlled (defined as exhibiting ongoing signs/symptoms related to the infection
             and without improvement, despite appropriate antibiotics or other treatment) within 14
             days prior to registration

          -  Patients must not be pregnant or nursing due to the teratogenic potential of the drug
             used on this study. Females of reproductive potential must have a negative serum
             pregnancy test within 14 days prior to registration. Women/men of reproductive
             potential must have agreed to use an effective contraceptive method during and up to 6
             months after treatment. A woman is considered to be of &quot;reproductive potential&quot; if she
             has had menses at any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months. In addition to
             routine contraceptive methods, &quot;effective contraception&quot; also includes heterosexual
             celibacy and surgery intended to prevent pregnancy (or with a side-effect of pregnancy
             prevention) defined as a hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral tubal
             ligation. However, if at any point a previously celibate patient chooses to become
             heterosexually active during the time period for use of contraceptive measures
             outlined in the protocol, he/she is responsible for beginning contraceptive measures
