      Purpose: The objective of our study was to assess the cardiovascular risk of a Cameroonian
      military population and compare it to the cardiovascular risk of the neighboring civilian
      population.

      Patients and methods: We will conduct a cross-sectional study that involved subjects aged
      from 18 to 58 years, recruited from October 2017 to November 2018 at the Fifth Military
      Sector Health Center in Ngaoundéré. Data collection and assessment was done according to
      World Health Organization STEPS manual for surveillance of risk factors of Non-communicable
      chronic diseases; and the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test. Five cardiovascular risk
      factors were assessed, smoking, harmful alcohol consumption, obesity/overweight, hypertension
      and diabetes. Cardiovascular risk was considered high in subjects with three or more
      cardiovascular risk factors. Univariates analysis and multivariate logistic regression were
      carried out according to their indications.

The cardiovascular risk factors used for the cardiovascular risk assessment were smoking, excessive alcohol consumption (defined by an AUDIT score ≥ 8), overweight or obesity, hypertension, and diabetes.

        The subjects of our study were recruited according to two methods at the Military Medical
        Center of Sector N°5 in Ngaoundere.

        Participation in the study was proposed to any soldier who attended the Military Medical
        Center of Sector N°5 for the annual re-engagement medical visit during the period from
        January 1, 2017 to November 13, 2018.

        The civilian populations were recruited from two free cardiovascular risk factors screening
        campaigns carried out from January 04, 2017 to January 10, 2017 and from November 12, 2018
        to November 18, 2018. These campaigns were open to soldiers wishing to participate.
