  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is reported that postmastectomy pain syndrome (PMPS) is a common problem, ranging from 25%
      to 60%.

      The pain is localized in the axilla, medial upper arm, breast, and/or chest wall and lasting
      beyond three months after surgery when all other causes of pain such as infection have been
      eliminated.

      The pain seriously affects the patient's mood, everyday activities, and social function and
      causes heavy economic burden for the healthcare system.

      Postmastectomy pain syndrome (PMPS) itself is not a specific diagnosis but rather describes a
      cluster of symptoms frequently observed in breast cancer survivors following treatment.

      Many patients will experience short-term nociceptive pain after breast cancer treatment.
      However, with PMPS, patients frequently experience persistent neuropathic-type pain: burning,
      tingling, aching, a subjective sense of &quot;tightness&quot; around the chest wall, or even phantom
      breast or nipple pain. Neuropathic pain results from dysfunction of the peripheral nerves
      caused by surgery, radiation, or neurotoxic chemotherapies.

      Currently, there are a wide variety of approaches to treat this type of pain. physical
      therapy has been employed as a modality to improve physical function.

      As far as interventional procedures, intercostal nerve blockade, stellate ganglion blockade,
      and paravertebral blockade have all been utilized with varying degrees of success.

      Paraverberal blocks have superseded thoracic epidurals when it comes to choice of a regional
      anaesthesia technique to provide analgesia for breast surgery.

      The injection of local anaesthetic solution in the paravertebral space results in a
      unilateral block, which is sensory, motor, and sympathetic. The uptake of the local
      anaesthetic solution is enhanced due to the absence of fascial sheaths binding the spinal
      nerves.

      Another potential target for an interventional procedure for chronic pain after treatment for
      breast cancer is the serratus plane. The serratus plane block is a novel ultrasound‐guided
      nerve block, which is able to anesthetize the hemithorax.

      The serratus plane block relies on the fact that there are branches of the intercostal nerves
      following within 2 potential spaces, one superficial and one deep, surrounding the serratus
      anterior muscle. The serratus anterior muscle arises as strips from the first 9 ribs and
      converges posteriorly on the scapula to form the medial wall of the axilla.

      The innervation of the serratus anterior muscle is via the long thoracic nerve (Bell's
      nerve), and the nerve itself is covered by the fascia of the serratus anterior muscle and
      lies anterior to the muscle.

    <description>To perform Serratus block, patients will be placed in the lateral decubitus position with the affected side facing up, or in the prone position with the affected side facing the operator . After sterile preparation, a linear ultrasound probe will be utilized to identify the latissimusdorsi and serratus anterior muscles in a sagittal plane. The plane superficial to the serratus anterior muscle and below the latissimusdorsi muscle will be identified. The skin will be topicalized with 1 mL of 1% lidocaine using a 30‐gauge needle. Using an in‐plane approach, a 25‐gauge 1.5‐cm needle will be used to inject a total of 20‐mL of 0.25% bupivacaine with 80 mg of triamcinlone under direct ultrasound visualization.</description>

    <description>TPVB will be given using high frequency linear US transducer, place the probe parallel to the vertebral spine at T2 level and shifted 2-3 cm laterally to obtain the appropriate visualization. Following the identification of plura, transverse process and paravertebral space, the needle will be inserted in caudocranial direction using in-plane approach. Confirm negative vessel or pleural breach via aspiration then proceed with local anaesthetic 10ml of 0.25% bubivacine and 80mg triamcinlone slowly; the pleura will be seen to be pushed downward.</description>
