  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of the study is to conduct an observational study involving intensive
      care unit patients receiving mechanical ventilation and determine if there are differences in
      diaphragm thickness ultrasound measurements during expiratory and inspiratory phases in a
      controlled and spontaneous mode.

    <textblock>
      In this study diaphragm ultrasound measurements at end-expiration and peak inspiration phases
      in assist control and pressure support mode in consented patients admitted to the medical
      intensive care unit. One-time measurements will be obtained during the first 48hrs that the
      patients are receiving mechanical ventilation.

      Three consecutive images will be obtained by an investigator that is blinded to the mode
      (controlled vs. spontaneous). Once measurements are obtained, a second investigator will
      switch to the other mode (controlled vs. spontaneous) and the blinded investigator will
      obtain three consecutive images after the patient has adjusted to the subsequent mode (one
      minute). Tidal volumes will be matched between modes as close as possible. The order of modes
      to ultrasound (controlled then spontaneous or spontaneous then controlled) will be determined
      by the non-blinded second investigator. Once the ultrasound measurements are obtained by the
      research team, image acquisition is concluded for the enrolled patient. The ventilator will
      be programmed back to the original settings determined by the medical ICU team.

      The hypothesis is that the end-expiration diaphragm ultrasound measurement will be thicker in
      spontaneous mode than controlled mode.
