      Part 1: 3+3 dose escalation of HCQ combined with abemaciclib in advanced solid tumors.

      Part 2: HCQ at top-dose level from part one is combined with abemaciclib and endocrine
      therapy in HR+/Her 2- advanced breast cancer (ABC) and divided into two cohorts based on
      prior exposure to endocrine therapy.

      Primary Objective

        1. Dose-escalation cohort: To determine safety and tolerability of HCQ combined with
           abemaciclib.

        2. Dose-expansion cohort: To determine safety and tolerability of HCQ combined with
           abemaciclib and endocrine therapy in HR+/Her2- ABC.

      Secondary Objectives

        1. To assess the clinical efficacy of HCQ in combination with abemaciclib and hormone
           blockade in the dose- expansion cohort of advanced ER- positive breast cancer
           participants.

        2. To assess the clinical efficacy of HCQ in combination with abemaciclib in the dose-
           escalation cohort

          4. Second primary malignancy except most in situ carcinoma (e.g., adequately treated
             non-melanomatous carcinoma of the skin) or other malignancy treated at least five
             years previously with no evidence of recurrence.

          5. Uncontrolled or symptomatic CNS metastases.

          6. Known history of G6PD deficiency.

          7. Taking other commercially available medications which may theoretically either
             stimulate or inhibit autophagy; these include calcitriol and chloroquine.

          8. Taking medications which may lead to interactions with HCQ, including penicillamine,
             telbivudine, botulinum toxin, digoxin, and propafenone.

          9. Must not be taking HCQ at baseline.

         10. Females who are pregnant or lactating.

         11. The participants has active bacterial infection (requiring intravenous [IV]
             antibiotics at time of initiating study treatment), fungal infection, or detectable
             viral infection (such as known human immunodeficiency virus positivity or with known
             active hepatitis B or C [for example, hepatitis B surface antigen positive]). No
             screening tests is required for this criterion.

         12. The participant has a personal history of any of the following conditions: syncope of
             cardiovascular etiology, ventricular arrhythmia of pathological origin (including, but
             not limited to, ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation), or sudden
             cardiac arrest.

         13. The participant receiving treatment with strong and moderate CYP3A inducers within
             seven days prior to the first dose of study drugs.

         14. Participant receiving treatment with tamoxifen within seven days prior to the first
             dose of study drugs.

         15. Participant receiving treatment with live vaccines within 30 days prior to the first
             dose of study drugs.

         16. Participant receiving medications which may prolong the QT interval.
