      Work stress and pruritus: imbalance of effort balance reward in patients with psoriasis.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background. Stress increases the likelihood of psoriasis flare-up episodes and itching. Few
      studies have focused on work-related stress on such skin symptoms.

      Objective. To study the association between work-related stress, pruritus and quality of life
      among workers suffering from psoriasis.

      Methods. Investigators will conduct a monocentric non-interventional prospective study.
      Patients suffering from psoriasis will be recruited in both the Dermatology inpatient ward
      and outpatient clinic of Brest University Hospital . Included patients will be workers.
      Work-related stress will be assessed using the Effort-Reward Imbalance (ERI) model. The
      impact of pruritus on quality of life will be assessed with the Itchy Quality of Life
      (ItchyQoL) self-administered questionnaire. The collected data will include age, sex, body
      mass index, ordered medication to treat psoriasis, weekly working hours. The association
      between ERI and ItchyQoL scores will be studied using a univariate logistic regression.

    <description>The Itchy Quality of Life questionnaire (ItchyQoL) assess the quality of life linked to pruritus. It is a 22-item questionnaire wich assess the frequency of pruritus'symptoms in the past seven days. The score is between 22 and 110. The higher the score, the greater the impact of pruritus.</description>

    <measure>Occupational stress</measure>
    <time_frame>time required to complete the self questionnaire estimated at approximately 5 min immediately after consultation with the dermatologist</time_frame>
    <description>The effort-reward imbalance questionnaire in 23-item for occupational stress. Six items make it possible to calculate the extrinsic efforts felt (score e) and eleven items assess the rewards perceived by the employee (score r). The ERI score is then calculated as follows: Ratio = (11 x e) / (6 x (66 - r)) (e: effort scale score, r: rewards scale score). A ratio greater than one indicates an imbalance in favor of efforts. The last six items make it possible to calculate the score for intrinsic efforts (over commitement). They relate to the inability to get away from work, impatience and disproportionate irritability.</description>
