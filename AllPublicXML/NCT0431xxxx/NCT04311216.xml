  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to identify factors responsible for recurrent shoulder instability
      in children. Shoulder instability, i.e. complete or partial dislocation of the shoulder
      joint, is common in children, resulting in pain and disability. Recurrent instability can
      damage the shoulder joint resulting in the premature development of arthritis.

      Rehabilitation approaches are preferred over surgical methods for the growing child e.g.
      physiotherapy to restore movement and prevent further instability. Existing rehabilitation
      procedures are based on addressing factors assumed to be responsible for instability e.g.
      physiotherapists may try to increase shoulder stability by building up the shoulder muscles
      to compensate for the damaged ligaments. It is evident however that the mechanisms of
      shoulder instability are not well understood, as failure rates for physiotherapy are high,
      with 70% - 90% of children continuing to suffer recurrent instability. This is an
      observational, cross-sectional study of children (aged 8 to 18) presenting with shoulder
      instability of any origin, traumatic or atraumatic (n=15) and an age-matched sample (n=15)
      with no history of shoulder problems. Muscle activity and movement pattern differences will
      be measured using non-invasive 3D motion capture and surface electromyography, to identify
      factors responsible for instability. Only a single visit to the site will be required (The
      Orthotic Research &amp; Locomotor Assessment Unit (ORLAU) based at The Robert Jones &amp; Agnes Hunt
      Orthopaedic Hospital NHS Foundation Trust in Oswestry.).

      If investigators better understand the mechanisms associated with instability, physiotherapy
      interventions to reduce dislocations and disability can be better targeted. If specific
      patterns of activity associated with instability are identified, these could be addressed
      through personalised and improved exercise prescription and rehabilitation. Additionally,
      causes of instability for which physiotherapy may not be appropriate may be identified,
      therefore ensuring patients are referred to the correct service in a timely manner, improving
      patient outcomes and allocating physiotherapy resources more appropriately. Participants will
      be recruited from musculoskeletal/orthopaedic outpatient clinics. This study is funded by the
      Private Physiotherapy Education Foundation.

        This study will consist children aged between eight and 18 years of age. The two groups
        will include children with (shoulder instability participants) and without shoulder
        instability (age matched contols).
