  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research concerns the evaluation of the maintenance of the efficiency and incidence of
      adverse effects of pharmacological treatments in sex offenders with paraphilia.

      Despite the increasing use of pharmacological treatments in these indications, there are few
      data to indicate which sex offender populations benefit from which pharmacological treatments
      and which adverse events are observed, particularly with anti-androgens or antidepressant
      treatments that are widely used in these subjects. A recent Cochrane study showed that
      psychodynamic treatment is less effective in terms of sexual delinquency compared to
      probation alone and has not shown significant efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)
      compared to the lack of treatment, except for a study in which anti-androgen therapy was
      associated with CBT. Another recent study concluded that the tolerance, even of
      anti-androgenic drugs, was uncertain, as all studies were small and of limited duration, and
      new research is needed in the future. Further research demonstrating the efficacy of SSRIs in
      the treatment of paraphilic disorders is still needed and long-term studies are lacking.
      Their use for this indication is still off label.

      As far as we know, this cohort should be the largest population of paraphilic sex offenders
      studied for the longest time to date in a field where research is insufficient. This large
      sample receiving routine care and followed for 3 years should allow to analyse the
      maintenance of the effectiveness of the pharmacological treatments received (SSRIs or
      anti-androgens), and their tolerance. In addition, this analysis of clinical practices should
      be crucial to improve the knowledge of the indications for these treatments, which could
      possibly be reviewed with respect to their effectiveness and tolerance, especially in the
      most serious cases of paraphilic sex offenders.

    <textblock>
      This research uses a &quot;naturalistic&quot; follow-up method (over 3 years). The main objectives
      focuses on two main issues that are important in clinical practice: (1) the tolerance of
      anti-androgenic treatments traditionally used for many years in young sexual offenders with
      severe paraphilias (2) the maintenance of the efficiency of SSRIs not yet approved for this
      indication (despite their current use in the treatment of minor paraphilic disorders).

      The paraphilic sex offender population are divided into three groups: those receiving SSRIs,
      those receiving anti-androgens (either GnRH agonists or CPA) and those receiving no
      pharmacological treatment.
