  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the past decade, museums have become involved in the care of patients by using art to
      improve their quality of life and well-being. Museums have, thus, emerged as new partners in
      public health. Very few programs developed by museums have focused on primary care patients
      who are a target audience for museum health program preventions. For the development of
      appropriate museum programs based on visit tour, there is a need to improve knowledge the
      effects of a museum visit prescribed by a primary care physician in patients. The objective
      of this study is to examine effects on mental and physical health and quality of life in
      primary care patients visiting the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts (MMFA), this visit being
      prescribed by their physician. Based on a cross-sectional study it will be prescribed to all
      patients consulting their primary care physician to visit the MMFA and to complete after this
      visit a series of self-administered questionnaires within the two days after their visit at
      the museum. The period of recruitment will be one year. The outcomes are the scores of the
      different questionnaires.
