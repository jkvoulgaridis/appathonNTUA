  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A pathological complete response (pCR) after surgery occurs in approximately 20% of rectal
      cancer patients submitted to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, with apparent survival benefit. This
      group could, potentially, be spared the morbidity of surgery.

      The diversified response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (nCRT) amongst tumors suggests a complex
      relationship between tumor biology and response possibly due to a number of genetic or
      molecular pathways that might regulate chemoradiosensitivity.

      Accumulating evidence indicated that circulating cell-free nucleic acids can be a promising
      biomarker of response, in liquid biopsy, for rectal cancer. The concentration of baseline
      plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) appears significantly higher in responders compared to
      non-responders.

      The objective of this study is to investigate the potential role of cfDNA as a marker of pCR
      (or partial response) to nCRT as well as a marker of outcomes (overall survival and
      disease-free survival).

      The investigators are conducting a prospective, observational, cohort, non-randomized study
      of consecutive patients with locally advanced rectal cancer submitted to nCRT, followed by
      surgical excision 6-12 weeks later. Patients are assigned to groups according to their
      pathological response to nCRT. A total of 20 patients with complete pathological response, 50
      partial response and 50 non-responders will be selected over a year and followed for another
      year. Participants will be observed and examined during the entire course of treatment and
      the follow-up period.

      Serial analysis of cfDNA through liquid biopsies will be performed in consecutive patients at
      specific time points (pre-nCRT, post-nCRT and postoperative week 1), incorporating analysis
      of concentration, dimension of DNA fragments, % of mutation frequency (CIN, APC, p53, MSI,
      KRAS, BRAF, EGFR, cKIT) and next-generation sequencing of tumour biopsy and surgical
      specimens.

      This study will serve as the feasibility of a larger, comparative study.
