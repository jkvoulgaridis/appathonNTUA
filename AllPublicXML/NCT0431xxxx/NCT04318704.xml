  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      NP-120 (Ifenprodil) has been shown to mediate anti-inflammatory responses and reduce
      pulmonary fibrosis in a murine model of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF). In addition,
      NP-120 significantly reduced both cough frequency and onset in a guinea pig tussive model.
      The purpose of this proof-of-concept trial is to determine the efficacy of NP-120 in the
      treatment of IPF and its associated cough.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male and female subjects aged ≤85 years of age with a diagnosis of IPF established
             during the previous seven years according to ATS/ERS/Fleischner criteria.

          2. Score ≥ 40 mm on the Cough Severity VAS at Screening

          3. Lung function parameters as follows:

               1. Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) ≥ 45% of the predicted value at screening.

               2. Diffusion lung capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) (corrected for Hb) of 30% to
                  79% of the predicted value at screening.

          4. Any existing Standard of Care (SoC) treatment (e.g. pirfenidone or nintedanib) must be
             deemed as stable (minimum three months) before enrollment.

          5. Subjects must sign and date a written, informed consent form and any required
             authorization prior to initiation of any study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Currently has significant airways obstruction: Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 s
             (FEV1)/Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) ratio of &lt; 0.7 at screening.

          2. Has clinical evidence of active infection, including, but not limited to, bronchitis,
             pneumonia, sinusitis, urinary tract infection, and cellulitis.

          3. Has a history of malignancy within the last 2 years with the exception of basal cell
             carcinoma, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (under observation) and prostate cancer
             requiring anti-androgens, localised treatment (minor surgery, radiotherapy) and/or
             managed by observation.

          4. Has any condition other than IPF that, in the opinion of the investigator, is likely
             to result in the death of the subject within the next 2 years.

          5. Presence of other disease that may interfere with testing procedures or in the
             judgement of the Investigator may interfere with trial participation or may put the
             patient at risk when participating in this trial.

          6. Is likely to receive lung transplantation within the next 12 months.

          7. Currently receiving high dose corticosteroid, cytotoxic (e.g., chlorambucil,
             azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate), vasodilator therapy for pulmonary
             hypertension (e.g., bosentan), and or investigational therapy for idiopathic pulmonary
             fibrosis (IPF) or administration of such therapeutics within 4 weeks of initial
             screening (or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer). A current dose of less than or equal
             to 15 mg/day of prednisone or its equivalent is acceptable if the dose is anticipated
             to remain stable during the study.

          8. Has a history of unstable or deteriorating cardiac or pulmonary disease (other than
             IPF) within the previous six months, including, but not limited to, the following:

               1. Unstable angina pectoris or myocardial infarction, or percutaneous coronary
                  intervention within the last 6 months,

               2. Congestive heart failure requiring hospitalization,

               3. Uncontrolled clinically significant arrhythmias.

          9. If female, the subject is pregnant or lactating or intending to become pregnant before
             participating in this study during the study and within (5 half- lives plus 30 days)
             after last dose of the study drug; or intending to donate ova during such time period.

         10. Women considered to be of childbearing potential who do not use highly effective birth
             control methods during the study.

         11. Known or suspected allergy to the trial drug or the relevant drugs given in the trial.

         12. Involvement in a clinical research study within 4 weeks prior to screening and/or
             prior enrollment in the study. Participation in registry studies is permitted.
