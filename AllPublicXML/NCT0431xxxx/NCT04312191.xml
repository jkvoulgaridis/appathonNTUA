  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study is a prospective, interventional, randomized, treatment-controlled study,
      evaluating the use of Meditation with a Mantra (MM) to decrease anxiety levels and improve
      Quality of Life (QOL) in prostate cancer patients receiving radiation treatment. The study
      will be conducted across 6 radiation treatment sessions in men with newly diagnosed prostate
      cancer, Stage 1 to 3A, and men with recurrent prostate cancer. Patients will receive six
      radiation sessions with usual care with or without the addition of MM. MM Group patients will
      be given a log at the beginning of the study to record how long they are meditating and if
      they found meditation beneficial. The General Anxiety Disorder-7 scale (GAD-7) is a validated
      tool and will be used to assess anxiety in all participants. The Functional Assessment of
      Cancer Therapy-Prostate, Version 4 (FACT-P) is a validated measure of QOL in prostate cancer
      patients and will be used to assess QOL in all participants. A one month follow up phone call
      will determine if the patients are continuing to use the MM and if they found the practice of
      MM useful not only in their radiation treatment sessions but in their everyday lives.

      The current study is a prospective, interventional, randomized, treatment-controlled study,
      evaluating the use of MM to decrease anxiety levels and improve Quality of Life (QOL) in
      prostate cancer patients receiving radiation treatment. The study will be conducted across 6
      radiation treatment sessions in men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer, Stage 1 to 3A, and
      men with recurrent prostate cancer. Approximately forty-six patients will be recruited to
      allow for forty patients to complete assessments. Twenty-three patients will receive six
      radiation sessions with MM and will be the Test Group. Twenty-three will receive usual care
      without MM and will be the Control Group. The Test Group will be taught how to meditate using
      a standard one-word mantra (Om). The first MM session would be a 30-minute introductory
      session prior to the first radiation treatment followed by five 20-minute sessions prior to
      each of the remaining five radiation treatments. The Control Group will receive radiation
      treatments without MM. During the five 20-minute sessions, the patients will receive a
      meditation refresher and reinforcement to continue to practice meditation at home. The
      teaching of MM during all sessions will be done by a dedicated research assistant with a
      Master of Science in Yoga Therapy. Test Group patients will be given a log at the beginning
      of the study to record how long they are meditating and if they found meditation beneficial.
      The General Anxiety Disorder-7 scale (GAD-7) is a validated tool and will be used to assess
      anxiety in all participants. The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate, Version 4
      (FACT-P) is a validated measure of QOL in prostate cancer patients and will be used to assess
      QOL in all participants. The GAD-7 and FACT-P will be assessed at baseline, radiation Session
      3 and radiation Session 6 to determine the impact of MM on anxiety and QOL, respectively, in
      the Test Group compared to the Control Group. A one month follow up phone call will determine
      if the patients are continuing to use the MM and if they found the practice of MM useful not
      only in their radiation treatment sessions but in their everyday lives.

    <intervention_model_description>Patients will be randomized 1:1 to standard of care only (Control Group) versus standard of care plus Meditation with a Mantra (MM) (Test Group) and will be followed for a total of 6 sessions of radiation therapy. Randomization will be executed using a computer-generated schema developed by the study biostatistician and stored in an electronic file.
The Test Group will be taught MM to use during each radiation treatment session and encouraged to practice MM ad libitum outside of the treatment setting.
For both the Control and Test Groups, validated questionnaires for anxiety and Quality Of Life will be administered at baseline, Session 3 and Session 6.
For the Test Group only, a log will be kept by the patient from Session 1 through follow-up, noting the times the MM is practiced. The Test Group will also receive a follow-up phone call on week 10 (one month after Session 6) to record whether the patient has continued to practice MM beyond the study requirements.</intervention_model_description>
