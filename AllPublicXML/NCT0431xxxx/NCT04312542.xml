  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this study is to determine the amount of three systemic markers of
      inflammation: 1) Hemoglobin A1c (Hgb A1c, 2) High Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hsCRP), and
      3) Haptoglobin (Hp) at 9 and 12 month follow-up post scaling and rootplaning (SRP) with and
      without minocycline HCl microspheres, 1 mg.

      Participants from a randomized controlled clinical trial approved by the University of
      Minnesota (UMN) Institutional Review Board (IRB) STUDY00004876 and registered on
      ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03762915) identifying the effects of SRP with and without minocycline
      HCl microspheres, 1 mg on periodontal pathogens and systemic inflammatory markers in the
      blood serum will be invited to participate in this 9 and 12 month follow-up study.
