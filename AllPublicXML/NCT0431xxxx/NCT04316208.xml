  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We aim to determine the level of intraoperative PEEP that optimizes lung compliance without
      causing a rise in subdural pressure and if we can utilize optic nerve sheath diameter
      measurement as an indicator for ICP while optimizing lung compliance during supratentorial
      tumor surgeries.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Application of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) during general anesthesia minimizes
      ventilation/perfusion mismatch, intraoperative atelectasis and postoperative pulmonary
      complications. PEEP application in intracranial surgeries is usually avoided due to the risk
      of raised intracranial pressure (ICP) leading to decreased cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP).
      Several studies examine the effects of PEEP on subdural pressure and CPP however none examine
      how lung compliance is affected at the same time. Ultrasound-guided measurement of optic
      nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) is an indirect indicator of raised ICP and there is limited
      literature on the correlation of ONSD and ICP during intracranial surgery. In this study, we
      aim to determine the level of intraoperative PEEP that optimizes lung compliance without
      causing a rise in subdural pressure and if we can utilize ONSD measurement as an indicator
      for ICP while optimizing lung compliance during supratentorial tumor surgeries.
