  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteosarcoma is the most common primary malignant bone tumor that mainly occurs in children
      and adolescents. Combined surgical resection and intensive chemotherapy has improved the
      5-year overall survival rate (from 51 to 75%). However, drug-induced side effects and tumor
      recurrence after surgery reduce patient quality of life and cut down the patient survival
      rate. Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide Nanoparticles (SPIONs)/Spinning Magnetic Field (SMF) and
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy may increase the cancer cell killing and complete tumor shrinkage
      preserving local structures and functions of patients who cannot receive limb retention
      treatment.

      This study aims to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of SPIONs/SMF in
      combination with neoadjuvant chemotherapy in osteosarcoma patients. They will receive
      intratumoral injection of SPIONs every other day for 3 times, followed by SMF for 2 hours
      every two days, and up to completion of 30 days, and conventional neoadjuvant chemotherapy
      from day 1. The sponsor hypothesizes that SPIONs/SMF will act synergistically with
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy to increase the cancer cell killing, to increase the local efficacy
      of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and to improve the ratio of limb retention. Then, all patients
      will be followed every 8 weeks, for the safety evaluation and cancer disease status until the
      end of the study.
