  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proteinuria is widely recognized as a marker of kidney disease severity, as well as the
      predictor of renal function decline, cardiovascular outcomes, and all-cause mortality.
      However, the severity of kidney disease progression and these outcomes differs among patients
      with various amount of proteinuria. The potential mechanism underlining this disparity may be
      relevant to the quality and quantity of filtered proteins, especially their mechano-chemical
      properties such as physical viscosity and stiffness, amino-acid sequence, and molecular
      weight (low, middle and high molecular weight proteins). The goal of the current project is
      to develop and validate combined Brillouin &amp; Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS)
      Spectroscopy technique for simultaneous non-contact assessment of visco-elastic and chemical
      properties of urine proteins as biomarkers of kidney disease. Systematic studies of these
      properties of proteins in urine samples to be taken from diseased and healthy subjects will
      be cross-validated by Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LCMS). The project ultimately
      aims for the development of an optical spectroscopic sensor for rapid, non-contact monitoring
      of urine samples from patients in clinical settings.
