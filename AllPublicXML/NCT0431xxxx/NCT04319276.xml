  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1 investigational study to assess the safety and preliminary efficacy of oral
      gallium maltolate (GaM) in participants with relapsed glioblastoma (GBM).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-center, single-arm, open-label phase 1 study to determine the
      antineoplastic activity, safety and tolerance of GaM in participants with relapsed,
      treatment-refractory GBM. Although GaM has been studied in previous phase 1 clinical trials
      in normal individuals and in participants with a variety of different solid tumors, it has
      never been evaluated in this population of participants. Dosages in this study have been
      defined to have limited side effects in other phase 1 trials. The maximum number of
      participants to enroll in the dose escalation part will not exceed 24. The trial will follow
      a 3 + 3 phase I dose escalation design.

    <description>This is a 3 + 3 design. Participants will be entered sequentially. If 0 of 3 participants has a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), new participants may be entered at the next higher dose level. If 1 of 3 participants has a DLT, up to 3 more participants are to be treated at that same dose level. If 0 of the additional 3 participants at that dose level has a DLT, new participants may be entered at the next higher dose level. If 1 or more of the additional 3 participants experience a DLT, 0 participants are to be started at that dose level and the preceding dose is the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD). If 2 of 3 of the dosed participants has a DLT on the first dose level, the drug will be administered at a lower dose. If 0 of 3 participants has a DLT at the highest dose level, an additional 3 participants will be enrolled to ensure that 6 participants are treated at the MTD. The MTD is the highest dose level at which no more than 1 of 6 treated participants, experiences a DLT.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Voluntary written consent must be obtained before performance of any study-related
             procedure not part of standard medical care, with the understanding that consent may
             be withdrawn by the subject at any time without prejudice to future medical care.

          2. All participants must have a prior histological diagnosis of GBM (WHO Grade IV).

          3. Participants have previously undergone standard treatment with radiation and/or
             chemotherapy and/or surgical resection. These treatments must be completed at least
             two weeks prior to GaM administration. There is no maximum limit to the amount of
             chemotherapy or radiation participants have received.

          4. Participants must have measurable disease that can be assessed for response to
             treatment as defined by the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria
             which incorporates MRI assessment and clinical factors.

               -  If participant is of childbearing potential (defined as not satisfying either of
                  the above two criteria), agree to practice two acceptable methods of
                  contraception (combination methods require use of two of the following: diaphragm
                  with spermicide, cervical cap with spermicide, contraceptive sponge, male or
                  female condom, hormonal contraceptive) from the time of signing of the informed

               -  Agree to practice true abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and
                  usual lifestyle of the subject. (Periodic abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation,
                  symptothermal, postovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable
                  contraception methods.) 9. Male participants, even if surgically sterilized
