      The primary study goal is to evaluate the histological characteristic of Silk Voice at a
      surrogate implantation site to evaluate the potential for Silk Voice to deliver long-term
      results to patients. Information obtained from this study will help clinician determine Silk
      Voice's treatment duration and whether Silk Voice is appropriate for their patient.

                  willing to comply with the requirements of the study, including sequential
                  photography, periodic check-ins and retrieval of implanted materials;

               -  women of childbearing potential using an acceptable form of birth control during
                  the study period and willingness to take a urine pregnancy test at baseline and
                  at the biopsy date;

               -  sign the Informed Consent form and the Authorization for Use and Release HIPAA
                  form prior to any study-related procedures being performed.

               -  read and understand English

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients will not enroll in the study if they meet any of the following exclusion
             criteria:

               -  a history of allergy or hypersensitivity to injectable hyaluronic acid gel;

               -  a history of allergy or hypersensitivity to silk;

               -  a history of severe allergies manifested by a history of anaphylaxis or history
                  or presence of multiple severe allergies

               -  history of allergies of lidocaine

               -  a history of susceptibility to keloid formation, hypertrophic scarring, and

               -  currently have a hyaluronic acid device implanted

               -  the presence of any contraindication to the implant procedures, including use of
                  platelet inhibiting agents or other anticoagulant, in a relevant period before
                  study entry (per the treating investigator's judgment);

               -  the presence of any condition, which in the opinion of the investigator, that
                  makes the subject unable to complete the study per protocol;

               -  the presence of known allergies or hypersensitivity reactions to local topical
                  anesthetics or nerve blocking agents (if such products are intended to be used
                  for that subject);

               -  the presence of cancerous or pre-cancerous lesions in the area to be treated;

               -  the presence of moderate or severe abnormal rating for firmness or detection of
                  any abnormal structure at the site of injection, such as a scar or lump;

               -  the current use of immunosuppressive therapy;

               -  who are using substances that can prolong bleeding (such as aspirin, nonsteroidal
                  anti-inflammatory drugs, and warfarin) may, as with any injection, experience
                  increased bruising or bleeding at treatment sites

               -  a history of connective tissue diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic
                  lupus erythematosus, polymyositis, dermatomyositis or scleroderma;

               -  participation in any interventional clinical research study within 30 days prior
                  to randomization;

               -  subjects not likely to stay in the study for up to 13 months because of other
                  commitments, concomitant conditions, or past history;

               -  subjects anticipated to be unreliable; or subjects who have a concomitant
                  condition that might confuse or confound study treatments or assessments;

               -  Subject with skin conditions (discoloration, textured, scarring, etc.) in
                  postauricular region that may complicate study evaluation metrics

               -  Subjects that are not considered to be an appropriate candidate at the discretion
                  of the investigator.
