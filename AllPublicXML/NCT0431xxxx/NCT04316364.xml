      This trial is designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of neoadjuvant
      treatment with monoclonal antibody SHR-1316 or placebo in combination with platinum doublet
      chemotherapy in participants with resectable Stage II, IIIA, or selected IIIB nonâˆ’small cell
      lung cancer (NSCLC) followed by adjuvant SHR-1316 or best supportive care and monitoring.
