  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of the proposed study are to develop and evaluate protocols for ethnic/racial
      minority-specific research using cancer registry data. In conjunction with the Cancer
      Registry of Greater California (CRGC), the investigators have developed procedures to
      identify, recruit, and survey ethnic/racial minority patients with MM. To pilot the study,
      the investigators aim initially to test the feasibility of this protocol by contacting 400
      eligible patients (100 African Americans, 100 Latinos, 100 Asian American/Native
      Hawaiian/Pacific Islander-AANHPI and 100 non-Hispanic Whites as a comparison group) to
      conduct a pilot survey through which will ascertain etiological and survival-related factors
      for MM. Ultimately, the investigators hope the findings from this pilot will yield insight
      into the best practices for recruiting minorities with MM and serve as the basis for larger
      population-based studies of MM etiology and survival.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible patients will include African Americans, Latinos and AANHPIs who were diagnosed with
      a first primary, pathologically confirmed MM within the previous five years and who were at
      least 21 years of age at the time of diagnosis. Investigators will also include, as a
      comparison group, non-Hispanic White patients. Patients must have been diagnosed in one of
      the 48 counties of California. Patients must be alive at the time of study and able to
      provide informed consent. The research team will not include those who are unable to consent,
      pregnant women, or prisoners.

      Initially, investigators will randomly select 100 eligible patients from each race/ethnicity
      mentioned above to participate in the pilot study. Once the pilot is completed, the
      investigators will aim to contact all eligible patients reported to the Cancer Registry of
      Greater California (CRGC) until 2024.

      Drs. Carvajal-Carmona and Cress have coordinated with MEDULLA investigators and CRGC research
      staff to develop a questionnaire for racial/ethnic minorities with Multiple Myeloma. The
      survey focuses on demographics, risk factors, cancer treatment, quality of life, and social
      determinants of health. All survey items are adapted from previously tested and validated
      surveys. The survey is expected to take approximately 30-45 minutes to complete.

      CRGC staff, under Dr. Cress supervision, will identify eligible participants using the
      criteria described above based on diagnostic information in the CRGC database. The research
      team will be following California Cancer Registry policies and procedures for release of
      data. CRGC staff will extract patients contact information from the registry and will provide
      this information to research staff at UC Davis, who will work under Dr. Carvajal-Carmona's
      supervision.

      The UC Davis Research team will initially mail each eligible participants a postcard and a
      survey study packet that will include: 1) Simple instruction sheet 2) An introductory letter
      that details the study 3) Information sheet that details on informed consent 4) Survey
      instruction sheet 5) A paper copy of the survey 5) Incentive selection sheet and option to
      continue to the second part of study 6) Brochures about the cancer registry and the UC Davis
      Comprehensive Cancer Center, and return pre-paid envelope.
