  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The world prevalence of obesity in adult population in 2016 was 650 million while in
      Indonesia, it has increased from 14,8 percent to 21,8 percent in 2018. Obesity is an
      established risk factors for metabolic and non communicable- diseases. The purpose of this
      research was to assess the different effect on waist circumference, insulin resistance and
      oxidative stress marker between fasting (intervention) group and not fasting (control) group
      after 8 weeks 5:2 intermittent fasting (IF) among obese male workers.

    <textblock>
      Intermittent fasting is eating pattern in that cycles between periods of fasting and eating.
      5:2 intermittent fasting (IF) is a form of time-restricted fasting which no calories are
      consumed for at least 14 hours (for 4 am to 6 pm) will done in two non-consecutive days days
      per week, followed by ad libitum intake on the remaining days, with water restriction too.

      Participants will be distributed to each group by simple randomization. This study will
      access the characteristic data, dietary intake and physical activity from the participants.
      Anthropometry and blood sample (for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and oxidative stress
      (malondialdehyde and catalase)) were taken at baseline and at the end of the study.
      Participants from each group will gets counseling at the second week of intervention and they
      will follow up to 8 weeks with control and evaluation form.

    <intervention_model_description>Overall, this research will run for ± 10 weeks; 1 week of preparation, 8 weeks of intervention and 1 week of evaluation of the final results of the study.
This research will involve an interview, physical examination and laboratory examination.
This research is a clinical trial research with interventions in the form of fasting. There will be divided into two groups: the intervention group (fasting) and the control group (not fasting). The fasting group will fast every Monday and Thursday, while the fasting group consumes daily food as usual. Both groups will be given education about balanced nutrition.</intervention_model_description>
