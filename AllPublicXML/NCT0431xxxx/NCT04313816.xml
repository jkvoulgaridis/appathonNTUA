  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will ask to a patient and his/her family physician to complete in parallel
      a brief questionnaire at the beginning of the consultation:

        -  for the patient: self-evaluation of his/her vaccine hesitancy (with a 0-100 scale)

        -  for the physician: evaluation of this patient vaccine hesitancy (on the same 0-100
           scale) Each of these 2 questionnaires should be filled blindly from the other.

    <description>Each participant will evaluate hi/her vaccine hesitancy on a 0-100 scale; his/her family physician will also evaluate the vaccine hesitancy of this participant on the same 0-100 scale.

These are arbitrary units.</description>
