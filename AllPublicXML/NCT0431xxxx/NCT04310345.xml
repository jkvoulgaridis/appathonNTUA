    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effects of human-animal interaction on reducing anxiety,
      depression, worry, and pain and enhancing quality of life in children ages 8-17 years old
      with a life threatening cancer and their parent caregivers.

      Objectives:

        -  To examine the feasibility of human-animal interaction (HAI) sessions for children with
           a life threatening cancer and a primary caregiver, specifically to:

             -  To identify and document necessary modifications for a safe and feasible
                intervention

             -  To obtain recruitment estimates and determine potential recruitment barriers

             -  To evaluate elements of implementation fidelity (design, training, delivery/receipt
                of treatment, enactment)

             -  To verify safety

        -  To determine the preliminary efficacy of human-animal interaction sessions:

             -  On children with a life threatening cancer for the outcomes of qualify of life,
                anxiety, depression, worry, and pain

             -  On caregivers of children with a life threatening cancer for the outcomes of stress
                and anxiety

      Exploratory Objective:

      - To explore mechanisms (reduced salivary cortisol and urinary norepinephrine levels)
      associated with 8 weeks of human-animal interaction.
