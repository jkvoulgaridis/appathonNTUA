  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare aggressive malignant tumor. According to the
      literature, the 5-year survival rate of ACC is 12%-47%. For patients with advanced ACC,
      mitotane alone or combined with traditional chemotherapy was the first-line standard
      treatment, but its progression-free survival was only about 1 year. However, for patients who
      fail the first-line treatment, there is a lack of effective treatment. For ACC patients who
      had failed first-line chemotherapy, a phase II clinical trial found that the objective
      response rate and the disease control rate of PD-1 inhibitor Keytruda were 14% and 64%
      respectively, and no grade 3 or 4 adverse events were observed. Anti-tumor angiogenic drugs
      combined with PD-1 inhibitors have shown impressive clinical data in many solid tumors. This
      study is aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PD-1 inhibitor camrelizumab combined
      with apatinib in patients with recurrent or metastatic ACC after standard treatment failure,
      and to seek new treatment for this population.
