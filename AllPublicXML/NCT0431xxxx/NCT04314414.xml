  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the feasibility and acceptability of a peer
      recovery coach (PRC) intervention to improve linkage to hepatitis C (HCV) and/or human
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) care, treatment initiation, and evaluation for HIV pre-exposure
      prophylaxis (PrEP) (when applicable) among individuals with a history of opioid use disorder
      accessing a substance use low-barrier-to-access (LBA) walk-in clinic. In-depth interviews
      will be administered by the research assistant (RA) to participants at baseline, three- and
      six-months post randomization for study participants (40 total participants; 20 patients in
      the intervention group and 20 patients in the standard of care arm). The RA will also
      follow-up with the per recovery coach and administer surveys to assess the feasibility of a
      peer recovery coaching intervention in improving HCV/HIV related linkage to care and
      management. Patient medical records and peer recovery coach monthly reports will be accessed
      and reviewed by the RA to determine fidelity to research protocols.

    <description>The intervention will involve the following elements: establishing rapport, asking permission to discuss drugs, discussing the pros and cons associated with drug use, uncovering the gaps between current and desired quality of life and determining readiness to change. The intervention will last approximately 20 minutes and take place at the time of the clinical visit while participants are waiting to be seen by a clinician or are awaiting laboratory testing.</description>

    <description>Each participant will receive the standard of care at BMC for HCV, HIV, and opioid use disorder. For HCV this includes HCV viral load, genotype, fibrosis staging, and HCV treatment. For HIV this includes HIV antibody, sexually transmitted infections (STI) testing, and prescription for PrEP. For opioid use disorder there is medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) prescription, and urine testing.</description>
