    <textblock>
      Introduction: Intensive care unit (ICU) delirium is an acute onset of brain dysfunction,
      which can affect 25-80% of ICU patients. Delirium is also associated with long term cognition
      impairment, higher mortality and higher ICU costs. Previous acupuncture studies showed the
      potential to prevent delirium. This study will examine the ability of acupuncture to treat
      ICU delirium.

      Methods: A double-blind randomized control trial will examine the effect of press tack
      acupuncture vs. press tack placebos. The patients will be randomly divided (1:1) into one of
      two groups. A total of 80 ICU patient will have to meet the following criteria: age 20-90,
      APACHE score &lt;30, Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC) &gt;4 points (indicates
      existing delirium), Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS): +1, +2, +3, +4, -1, -2. Three
      interventions will be given in each group. The main outcomes will be the delirium days
      according to the ICDSC.

      interventions will be given in each group. The main outcomes will be the delirium days
      according to the ICDSC.

      Expected outcome: The study finding will help to determine the therapeutic effect of
      acupuncture for critically ill delirium patients. Furthermore, the study design will involve
      longer needle/placebos retention which is less investigated nowadays.

      Other information: This study will be conducted in the ICU departments of China medical
      hospital, Taichung city, Taiwan. The study is conducted on stable ICU patients and we don't
      anticipate any serious risk for adverse events following the intervention. The study will
      take place until May 2022.

    <masking_description>Our study goal is the measure the effectiveness of press tack needles (acupuncture group) in reducing delirium severity in critically ill patients in the ICU. In order to ensure a double bind procedure, we will implement the use of press tack placebos (control group) as a competitor. In addition to the mentioned above interventions, patients in both groups will receive routine ICU care as per individual patient's needs.</masking_description>

    <description>Patients in acupuncture group will receive traditional Chinese acupuncture combined with Tung's style acupuncture using Press Tack Needle (PYONEX Φ0.20×0.6 mm made by Seirin Corporation). The needles appear identical to the press tack placebo with the only different is the needle itself which was removed in the placebo needles. The following acupoints will be used: HT 7 (Shen Men), PC 6 (Nei Guan), Yin Tang (EX-HN 3), San Shang (55-02) (three point from Dong's acupuncture system) and the auricular Shen Men point. The treatment will use bilateral acupuncture (if patient's condition does not allow it, unilateral acupuncture will be done). The patient will lie in a supine position during the treatment. Acupuncturist will disinfect the acupoint location with an alcohol pad (70% alcohol), then the acupuncturist will press the needles sticker to the mentioned above acupoints. Interventions will be given on day 1, 3, and 5 after patient's enrolment.</description>

    <description>Patients randomized to the control group will receive press tack placebo (made by Seirin Corporation), which looks identical to press tack needles but, with no needle element.

The treatment methods and patients position will be identical to acupuncture group. Interventions will be given on day 1, 3, and 5 after patient's enrolment.</description>
