  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Real-life, observational, monocentric, ambispective study, carried out in France. The aim of
      the study is to evaluate the success rate of orthopedic management of the Z-foot after at
      least 9 months of follow-up.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will include a single prospective data collection, which will make it possible to
      obtain prospective clinical data at the longest follow-up after treatment, with a minimum
      follow-up of 9 months. This collection will be done during a visit to the office or a phone
      call, depending on the preference of patients and their parents.

      Early data (before the intervention, immediately after, and at 3 months of follow-up) will be
      collected retrospectively in medical records.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The main criterion of the study is the success rate of orthopedic management of the Z-foot.</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Success is a composite criterion, measured at the last follow-up, defined by:
Outer edge of the straight foot; AND
Absence of dorsolateral hump OR possibility of putting on shoes without difficulty AND
Absence of recurrence of the malformation OR resumption of surgery OR resumption of orthopedic treatment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Moderate success rate of the procedure</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Defined by an external edge of the foot that is not rectilinear but the possibility of normal footwear, at the greatest distance (relative to the number of feet treated)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Partial and total success rate (relative to the number of patients treated)</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Total success rate: (number of patients with unilateral involvement and foot treated successfully + number of patients with bilateral involvement and both feet treated successfully) / total number of patients.
Partial success rate in patients with bilateral involvement: number of patients with only one of the 2 feet treated successfully / number of patients with bilateral involvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Convex angle of the outer edge of the foot during follow-up</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>The evolution of the convexity angle of the external edge of the foot will be studied during treatment and follow-up, in a mixed model with repeated measurements, with the initial severity of the malformation as a cofactor (angle ≤ 15 ° /&gt; 15 ° ).</description>
