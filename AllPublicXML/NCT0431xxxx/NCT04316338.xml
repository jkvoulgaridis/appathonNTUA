  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to demonstrate the feasibility, tolerability, safety and preliminary efficacy
      of 6 weeks of fMRI-guided iTBS delivered to personalized regions of the prefrontal cortex
      (PFC) in adults with ASD in reducing irritability in adults with ASD.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Aberrant Behavior Checklist-irritability subscale (ABC-I)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change across time: Baseline minus immediately after final treatment</time_frame>
    <description>A parent/caregiver/clinician completed checklist (58-item) with an irritability subscale (15-item). Each item has a maximum score of 3, meaning that the irritability subscale has a maximum score of 45 and minimum score of 0. Higher scores indicate higher levels of irritability.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Irritability Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, every week of treatment (1-6), immediately after treatment, one month after treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>A 21-item self-report measure of irritability. Each item is rated on how often (Never=0 to Most of the time=4) and the intensity (Not at all=0, Very much so=4) at which they occur.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-injury questionnaire (SIQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediately after treatment, one month after treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>Self-report measure of self-injury, maximum 60 questions but participants only answer relevant questions. Five types of self-injurious behaviors are checked: scratching, bruising, cutting, burning, and biting oneself. It will assess the taxonomic specifications of self-injurious behavior (SIB- (e.g., type, frequency, duration)), but also the affective antecedents and consequences as well as the functions of each type of SIB.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>THE MODIFIED OVERT AGGRESSION SCALE (MOAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediately after treatment, one month after treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>Clinician rated scale of aggression. 4 items rated from 0-4. Maximum score is 16 with higher scores indicating higher levels of aggression, used to evaluate and document the &quot;frequency and severity&quot; of aggressive episodes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediately after treatment, one month after treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>Self-report measure of emotion regulation, evaluating individuals' levels of difficulties in regulating emotions. 36-item questionnaires. Each question rated from 1-5. Maximum score is 180 with higher scores indicating greater difficulty in emotion regulation. The instrument presents 36 items on a 5-point Likert scale of frequency (from 1 = almost never, to 5 = almost always).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Adult Autism Quotient (AQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediately after treatment, one month after treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>50-item self-report measure of autistic traits. Each of 50 statements are rated from 'definitely disagree' to 'definitely agree'.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediately after treatment, one month after treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>43-item clinician rated scale measuring repetitive behaviors associated with ASD. Each item is rated from 0 (behavior does not occur) to 3 (behavior is a severe problem)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Montgomery-Ã…sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediately after treatment, one month after treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>10-item clinician rated measure of depressive symptoms. Each item is rated on a scale of 1-6.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional connectivity between areas involved in negative emotion regulation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediately after treatment, one month after treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will be used to measure functional connectivity between areas involved in emotion regulation, previously shown to be involved in irritability. Areas of interest include: ventromedial prefrontal cortex, the amygdala, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the striatum.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>EEG recordings</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediately after treatment, one month after treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>Electroencephalography (EEG) will be used to measure brain activity and connectivity before and after treatment. Resting-state EEG (5 minutes) with eyes open and TMS-evoked potential recordings will be taken before and after treatment. We are particularly interested in measuring gamma band activity (&gt;30Hz) in participants while at rest.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediately after treatment, one month after treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>MRS will be used to measure GABA levels in two brain areas of interest (ventromedial prefrontal cortex and amygdala) before and after treatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Aberrant Behavior Checklist-irritability subscale (ABC-I)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change across time: Baseline minus one month after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>A parent/caregiver/clinician completed checklist (58-item) with an irritability subscale (15-item). Each item has a maximum score of 3, meaning that the irritability subscale has a maximum score of 45 and minimum score of 0. Higher scores indicate higher levels of irritability.</description>
