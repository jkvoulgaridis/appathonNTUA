      This is an open-label Phase I trial designed to determine the phase 2 recommended dose (RP2D)
      of belinostat in combination with nivolumab with or without ipilimumab.

  <detailed_description>

      Overall, the trial will assess dosing and safety of two regimens in the study population:

        -  The double regimen: belinostat in combination with nivolumab;

        -  The triplet regimen: belinostat in combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab. The trial
           will consist of two parts: Part 1 will establish the RP2D of belinostat in combination
           with nivolumab (doublet regimen) and Part 2 will assess the safety of the RP2D of
           belinostat in combination with nivolumab (doublet regimen) and ipilimumab (triplet
           regimen). In Part 1, the recommended phase 2 dose of belinostat will be determined by
           using an single-patient accelerated titration design confirmed by a modified 3+3 design.

      Once the RP2D of belinostat is confirmed in Part 1, Part 2 will open to the expansion of the
      doublet regimen and begin assessing the triplet regimen. The assessment of safety for the
      triplicate regimen will follow a Bayesian approach as described in the Statistical Analysis
      section and Appendix 2.

      Due to the expected contrast in toxicity profiles between immediate toxicity from belinostat
      at various dose levels and immune mediated toxicity from the doublet and the triplet
      regimens, the definition of dose-limiting toxicities and the DLT evaluation periods will
      differ for each regimen (doublet vs. triplicate). Patients will be managed according to the
      regimen administered.

      Statistical Hypotheses: Belinostat in combination with nivolumab alone and with ipilimumab is
      safe and effective in patients with previously treated metastatic or advanced carcinomas with
      or without ARID1A loss of function (lof) mutations.
