  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative neurocognitive disorders, including postoperative delirium (POD) and
      postoperaive cognitive dysfunction (POCD), are common complications of perioperative
      neurocognition in elderly patients undergoing surgery. POD and POCD have short- and long-term
      consequences, such as increased hospital stays and costs, augmented morbidity and mortality,
      as well as higher risk for cognitive decline later in life. Therefore, early prevention and
      diagnosis of these conditions is of great importance.

      A number of psychometric tests have been proposed as cognitive screening tools. Given the
      fact that many of them show weaknesses and difficulties in performance, scientists have
      sought for more useful alternatives. Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is considered to be
      a good choice, as it has been successfully applied in the perioperative setting. What's more,
      it has been translated and validated for a Greek population with neurological disorders.
      Addenbrooke's Congnitive Examination III (ACE III) has been introduced recently into clinical
      practice. It is an easy to perform and detailed test that covers several neurocognitive
      domains and has shown high sensitivity and specificity in clinical conditions, including
      dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Although current literature lacks data concerning its
      perioperative use, ACE III could prove useful for screening patients undergoing surgery and
      anesthesia on the basis of its favorable characteristics as mentioned above.

      The aim of this study is to translate the ACE III (English version 2012) into Greek and
      assess its validity in perioperative patients aged &gt;55 years.

      In this prospective cohort study, the ACE III will be translated and adapted into Greek by
      the researchers according to the relative guidelines for cultural adaptation. Backwards
      translation will be performed by a fluent bilingual specialist in order to ensure optimum
      reliability of the questionnaire.

      Following power-analysis, 110 surgical patients and 70 healthy volunteers will be included in
      the study protocol after informed consent.. Primary screening of the whole population will be
      conducted using the MoCA test by two examiners. Simultaneously, the ACE III will be applied
      in order to set baseline measurements for each participant. Healthy volunteers and patients
      with MoCA scores at least 26 will form the control group. Retesting of patients and controls
      with both questionnaires will be held 48 hours after initial assessment by the same
      examiners. One third of the population will be assessed at the above time-points by an
      observer to minimize subjectivity of examination.

      Total scores and subscores at both time-points will be calculated and comparative performance
      of all participants will be assessed after statistical analysis of collected data.
