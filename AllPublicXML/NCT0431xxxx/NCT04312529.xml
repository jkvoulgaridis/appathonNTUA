  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess the impact of different positions of the
      glenohumeral joint on the maximum muscle contraction of different shoulder muscles. The
      muscles do not contract with the same intensity depending on the position of the arm in
      relation to the trunk. With the determination of this optimal position to activate the
      shoulder muscles as much as possible, we will be able to strengthen the patients during their
      revalidation.

    <description>The strength will be assess with a isokinetic device. It will allow to calculate the maximum force of the subject at the level of the rotators of the shoulder. This is a dorsal decubitus test. The subject's arm will be positioned during one session in 45° of abduction and the other session in 90° of shoulder abduction.
In this position, the subject will perform tests at different speeds (60°/s concentric, 240°/s concentric and 60°/s eccentric). This will calculate the maximum force.</description>

    <measure>Electrical activity of the muscles</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1.</time_frame>
    <description>The electromyography will allow to calculate the electrical activity of the muscles during the two isokinetics and thus to determine which active position the most the muscles of the shoulder. This measurement is achieved by the installation of surface electrodes</description>

    <description>Isokinetic test:The isokinetic device is used to evaluate the strength of a subject. The test will be performed in two positions. This will determine the best position to activate shoulder muscles EMG (electromyography):it's a device that measures the electrical activity of muscles. This will allow us to record the maximum activity of the shoulder muscles during force tests.</description>
