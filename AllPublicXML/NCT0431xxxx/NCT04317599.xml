  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The presence of a BRAFV600E mutation is considered a marker of poor prognosis in patients
      with mCRC, and findings from clinical trials have largely remained inconclusive regarding the
      efficacy of first line treatments for BRAF-mutant mCRC patients. In the absence of
      targeted/specific treatment for BRAF-mutant mCRC, treatment practices can vary based on local
      practices and guidelines. There is, therefore, an unmet need to document the current
      practices for first-line treatment of BRAF-mutant mCRC, and their effectiveness and safety in
      a real-world setting.

      This real-world, multicenter non-interventional study (NIS) will describe the treatment
      patterns, effectiveness and safety of current treatment regimens in BRAFV600E mutant mCRC
      patients in Europe, with the aim to put the clinical study findings of the ongoing Phase 2,
      single-arm, open label trial (ANCHOR) into context of the current treatment landscape
      excluding investigational therapies. Additionally, the NIS output may be used to support
      future health technology assessment submissions and publications.

      This retrospective, multi-center longitudinal study on BRAFV600E mutant mCRC patients will be
      conducted in Europe to characterize the first-line treatment patterns. All BRAFV600E mutant
      patients having initiated a first-line treatment for mCRC between January 1st, 2016 and
      December 31st, 2018 (both days inclusive) with drugs registered for mCRC in respective
      country will be eligible to participate. The study will not provide or recommend any
      treatment or procedure; all decisions regarding treatment are made at the sole discretion of
      the treating physician in accordance with their usual practices and all eligible patients
      will be considered for enrollment.

      The target countries for patient enrollment will include Germany, France, Italy, United
      Kingdom, Spain, Belgium, Austria and the Netherlands. Approximately 300 adult patients (â‰¥18
      years) from a mix of academic and non-academic sites (up to 65 sites) will be enrolled.
