    <measure>Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to End of Treatment (2 Years)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, places the participant at immediate risk of death, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or is a medically important event.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination (HINE) Section 2 Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 63 and Approximately Every 4 Months Up to End of Treatment (2 years)</time_frame>
    <description>Section 2 of the HINE is used to assess motor milestones of the participants. It is composed of 8 motor milestone categories: voluntary grasp, ability to kick in supine position, head control, rolling, sitting, crawling, standing, and walking.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale - Expanded (HFMSE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 63 and Approximately Every 4 Months Up to End of Treatment (2 years)</time_frame>
    <description>The HFMSE is a tool used to assess motor function in children with SMA. The original 20 item Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale (HFMS) was expanded to include 13 additional items to improve sensitivity for the higher functioning ambulant population. Participants are asked to complete a specific movement and are then graded on the quality and execution of that movement. Higher scores indicate higher levels of motor ability where 0=unable, 1=performed with some assistance, and 2=unaided. The overall score is the sum of the scores for all activities.</description>
