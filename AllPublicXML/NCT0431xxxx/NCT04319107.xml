  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Marfan syndrome is characterized by musculoskeletal manifestations, cardiovascular disease
      and ocular abnormalities, particularly ectopia lentis. Diagnosis depends on clinical
      evaluation, family history and molecular data: mutation in the fibrillin-1 gene (FBN1).
      Ectopia lentis is the most common ocular manifestation in Marfan syndrome with FBN1 mutation
      and is relatively specific to this disease when associated with other features. However,
      clinical examinations for identifying ectopia lentis have not really been codified. The
      purpose of this study is to describe a 5-grade classification of increasing severity for
      ectopia lentis based on clinical examination and to evaluate the predictive value for the
      early grades of ectopia lentis in order to help characterize this major clinical diagnosis
      criterion.

    <description>Pupillary dilatation was performed with instillation of tropicamide and phenylephrine. The ophthalmological examination included visual acuity measurement, using a slit lamp biomicroscopy to analyse the anterior segment and a three mirror lens to appreciate the quality of the dilation validated by the absence of pupillary reflex and to search for ectopia lentis. Ectopia Lentis grade is evaluated according to the 5-grade classification.</description>
