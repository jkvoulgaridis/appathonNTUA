  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To characterize the safety and tolerability profile of ascending doses of scopolamine
      hydrobromide trihydrate (Scopolamine HBT) administered by intramuscular (IM) injection. And
      characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of ascending doses of Scopolamine HBT administered by
      IM injection

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, in-clinic, Phase 1, single-dose,
      IM, sequential dose-escalation study in healthy adults aged 18-55. Healthy volunteers will be
      assigned to 1 of 5 cohorts of Scopolamine HBT dosage groups: 0.005, 0.007, 0.011, 0.014, or
      0.021 mg/kg, or will receive the placebo administered by IM injection to the anterior thigh.
      In each cohort, 6 to 9 subjects will receive active drug and 2 to 3 subjects will receive
      placebo. Each cohort will have at least 3 male and 3 female subjects enrolled among the first
      8 subjects in the dosing group to ensure that at least 1 male subject and 1 female subject in
      each dosing group receive active drug. If nonextreme dose-limiting toxicities are observed in
      any of the cohorts, 4 additional subjects, 3 active and 1 placebo, may be added to each
      cohort.

    <description>A goal of this clinical study is to measure Scopolamine HBT immunity remaining in each participant after IM administration. The predicted efficacious Cmax, based on limited nonclinical studies, is 16-18 ng/mL. At the end of each cohort, the PI, DSMB, and sponsor will evaluate the safety outcomes and PK data associated with the Scopolamine HBT dosing for that group.</description>
