  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to decrease the impact of the fibromyalgia on the daily quality of
      life of the patients suffering of moderate fibromyalgia at 6 months by the practice of an
      adapted physical activity coupled with therapeutic education workshop.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia is chronic pain syndrome expressed as fluctuacting musculotendinous or articular
      pain and chronic tiredness. Among the non-pharmacological treatments, apart the
      &quot;psychological&quot; accompanying, the EULAR (European League Against Reumatism) recommends the
      physical activity in first intention. Thus, physical reconditioning has an important place in
      fibromyalgia. Aerobic conditioning or reconditioning programs for effort induce for some
      patients a benefit on quality of life, tiredness and pain. In France, these programmes are
      mostly carried out in &quot;follow-up and rehabilitation&quot; type care structures.

      Outdoor exercise re-training with the Intelligent Electric Bike for Health combined with
      therapeutic education sessions are proposed in the study. These activities, adapted to each
      group and patient, can best achieve the objective in an ambulatory format closer to the
      patient's daily life.
