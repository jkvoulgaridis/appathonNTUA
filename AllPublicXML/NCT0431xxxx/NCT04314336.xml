  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have performed cost-minimisation analysis and compared the expenses based
      on the plan for public procurement (without clinical pharmacist involvement) for drugs with
      the results of public procurement based on the revised plan for public procurement by the
      clinical pharmacist. The plan for public procurements was based on the 1 year quantity for
      each medicine used by the hospital in the previous year, based on the latest deliverable
      prices at the time of extracting the data to workbook for MS Excel program (ver. 2002,
      Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA).

      The investigators have performed cost-minimisation analysis and compared the expenses for all
      received requests for medicines to the drug and therapeutics committee (DTC) for a decision
      in the 1 year period, before and after involvement of clinical pharmacist in the committee
      work. The expenses were based on approval decisions in the 1 year period for approval time
      period. The denial decisions were also calculated and reported. The denial period calculated
      in rationalisation of expenses were based on 1 year treatment period.
