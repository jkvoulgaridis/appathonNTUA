    <textblock>
      The research was planned on a randomized controlled experimental basis. Simple stratified
      randomization will be performed according to gender and age. Consent will be obtained from
      children and parents who agree to participate in the research.

      Before angiography, &quot;Child Fear Scale&quot;, &quot;State-Trait Anxiety Scale (STAI-TX)&quot;, and &quot;Vital
      Signs Follow-up Form&quot; will be applied to all children taking part in the study and life signs
      will be recorded.

      During angiography, the first group will listen to the music that the child wants to listen
      to. The second group will listen to the music which determined by the researchers. No music
      will be played to the control group. During angiography (when the child is listening to the
      music) vital signs will be recorded in 0. min., 1st minute, 5th minute, 10th minute, 15th
      minute, 30th minute and 60th minute.

      &quot;Numerical Pain Scale&quot;, &quot;Child Fear Scale&quot;, &quot;State Anxiety Scale&quot;, and &quot;Vital Signs Follow-up
      Form&quot; will be re-evaluated to all three groups after angiography.

      This study was planned to determine the effect of music during angiography on pain, fear,
      anxiety and life signs in children aged 7-18.

      The research was planned on a randomized controlled experimental basis. Simple stratified
      randomization will be performed according to gender and age. Consent will be obtained from
      children and parents who agree to participate in the research.

      Before angiography, &quot;Child Fear Scale&quot;, &quot;State-Trait Anxiety Scale (STAI-TX)&quot;, and &quot;Vital
      Signs Follow-up Form&quot; will be applied to all children taking part in the study and life signs
      will be recorded.

      The sample size of the study was determined and the effect size was 0.25 based on the
      Standard effect sizes determined by Cohen. In the study, the sample number of 0.84 in the
      statistical power α=0.05 confidence interval was calculated as 36 for each group.

      During angiography, the first group will listen to the music that the child wants to listen
      to. The second group will listen to the music which determined by the researchers. No music
      will be played to the control group. During angiography (when the child is listening to the
      music) vital signs will be recorded in 0. min., 1st minute, 5th minute, 10th minute, 15th
      minute, 30th minute and 60th minute.

      &quot;Numerical Pain Scale&quot;, &quot;Child Fear Scale&quot;, &quot;State Anxiety Scale&quot;, and &quot;Vital Signs Follow-up
      Form&quot; will be re-evaluated to all three groups after angiography.

The children are expected to evaluate how they feel at the moment. Expressions such as &quot;I feel very angry&quot;, &quot;I feel angry or&quot; I do not feel angry &quot;are asked to mark the most appropriate one for them.
The total number of items is 20. The lowest score is 20, the highest the score is 60.</description>

    <description>Child pain will be assessed by the &quot; Numeric Pain Scale&quot;. This method is intended to determine the severity of pain and to explain the patient's pain in numbers. On numerical scales, it starts with the absence of pain (0) and reaches the level of unbearable pain (10).</description>
