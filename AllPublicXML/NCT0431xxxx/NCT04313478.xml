      This study aimed to examine the relation between trunk control and gross motor performance in
      term and preterm infants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preterm infants are observed to have reduced trunk extension in the prone position, rigid
      postural patterns while reaching a toy, fewer movement reactions, trunk rotation, head
      control, and muscle tone than term infants. To distinguish between the infant with typical
      motor development and the one with atypical / abnormal motor development and to follow up the
      level of their trunk controls is important to identify of the motor development delay in the
      early stage of life.

      This cross-sectional study included 42 preterm infants and 43 term infants at between 3 and 9
      months of age. We investigated the association between the gross motor function and the
      segmental trunk controls of the preterm infants at the 3-9 months of age compared to term
      infants.

    <measure>Alberta Infant Motor Scale (AIMS)</measure>
    <time_frame>15 min</time_frame>
    <description>The gross motor performance of infants were preliminarily evaluated with the Alberta Infant Motor Scale (AIMS). The AIMS, an observational assessment scale, assesses the infants between 0 and 18 months and measures gross motor maturation in infants from birth through independent walking. The AIMS has 58 items, which assess three aspects of motor performance--weight-bearing, posture and antigravity movements in the positions of supine, prone, sitting, and standing positions. A typically developing 18-month-old infant can perform all movements and will obtain a total score of 58. Gross motor performance is defined by the AIMS total score, which is expressed in percentiles based on age. AIMS total score categories were determined by using normative percentile ranges. The categories of gross motor performances were defined as follows: 0-10 atypical development, 11-25 suspected performance, 26-75 normal performance, 76-90 very good performance, 91-100 excellent performance.</description>

    <measure>Segmental Assessment Trunk Control (SATCo)</measure>
    <time_frame>20 min</time_frame>
    <description>The infants were evaluated by using the Segmental Assessment Trunk Control (SATCo). SATCo is the only valid instrument that can assess the level of trunk control by segments and assess the ability of the typical or neuromotor deficient infant to maintain or recover a vertical position while sitting. The infant was positioned in a sitting posture on a wooden bench with the pelvis maintained in a neutral position using a belt system in relation to the vertical axis and with the head upright to identify the level of trunk control. 0 and 1 scores were given according to maintenance of upright posture and the total score was calculated.</description>
