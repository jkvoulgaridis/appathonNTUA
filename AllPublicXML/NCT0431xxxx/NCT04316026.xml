  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction: Shock wave therapy (SWT) has a potential interest to treat spasticity. However,
      the pathophysiology of this treatment remains unknown. Some authors assert that it is
      effective on spasticity itself, while others suggest that it acts more on fibrosis.

      Method: this study will assess the effectiveness of radial SWT to treat wrist and finger
      flexors stiffness in stroke patients, comparing subacute spastic patients (&lt; 12 months) with
      chronic patients presenting muscle contractures (&gt; 12 months). Forty-eight stroke patients
      (24 in the subacute phase and 24 in the chronic phase) will be included. One real and one
      sham sessions of SWT will be performed with a 2-week interval. The order of the sessions will
      be randomized. Motor control, stiffness and spasticity will be assessed with clinical and
      objective measures, just after and just before each session, by a blind assessor. The
      targeted muscles will be flexor carpi radialis, flexor carpi ulnaris and flexor digitorum
      profundus, and will be the same for the two session.
