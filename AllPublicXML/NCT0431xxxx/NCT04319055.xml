  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Computer vision using deep learning architecture is broadly used in auto-recognition. In the
      research, the deep learning model which is trained by categorized single-eye images is
      applied to achieve the good performance of the model in blepharoptosis auto-diagnosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This auto-diagnosis system of blepharoptosis using machine learning architecture will assist
      in telemedicine, such as early screening of childhood ptosis for prompt referral and
      treatment. People could use this software via mobile devices to get a primitive diagnosis
      before they reach the physicians. Furthermore, in primary health care, where there is no
      oculoplastic surgeon, the software could assist primary care physicians or general
      ophthalmologists, in identifying the need for a referral.
