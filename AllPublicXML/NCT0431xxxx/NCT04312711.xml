  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is aimed to assess the value of three-dimensional time-of-flight magnetic
      resonance angiography (3D-TOF-MRA) in hemodialysis patients with occlusive disease in
      arteriovenous fistula (AVF). All participants will receive 3D-TOF-MRA and ultrasound to
      detect the stenosis degree of AVF.

      The Principle of 3D-TOF-MRA is based on the &quot;flow effect&quot; of MR. In the GE sequence of MRA
      imaging, the effect of RF pulses makes the protons in the stationary tissue in the active
      layer in a saturated state, and the longitudinal magnetization disappears. When the inflow
      blood appears, its protons are in an unsaturated state and have a high degree of longitudinal
      magnetization. In this way, a clear difference is formed between saturated tissue and
      unsaturated flowing blood to display blood vessels. Therefore as a non-invasive and safe
      method for diagnosing vascular diseases, 3D-TOF-MRA is used widely in cerebrovascular
      diseases. However, there are currently no studies using 3D-TOF-MRA to diagnose arteriovenous
      fistula (AVF) stenosis in hemodialysis patients. This project plans to use 3D-TOF-MRA to
      detect AVF stenosis in hemodialysis patients to provide a safe and effective diagnostic
      method for patients with end-stage renal failure.
