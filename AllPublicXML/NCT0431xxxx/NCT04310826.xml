  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well a diet high in magnesium works in preventing low blood magnesium
      levels (hypomagnesemia) in patients with ovarian cancer receiving carboplatin chemotherapy.
      Hypomagnesemia is a common side effect of carboplatin-containing chemotherapy. A magnesium
      rich diet may increase the levels of magnesium in the blood and help prevent hypomagnesemia
      resulting from carboplatin chemotherapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Evaluate intervention feasibility.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Evaluate occurrence of hypomagnesemia and the need for a pharmacy regimen including oral
      and intravenous magnesium dosage.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Explore changes in other electrolytes, weight, and occurrence of chemotherapy delay or
      discontinuation and hospitalization which can be related to dietary intervention and program
      completion.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive a dietary magnesium intervention consisting of a food reference list and
      phone calls or video interviews from a registered dietitian, integrative medicine physician,
      or a mid-level provider over 10-20 minutes once a week for up to the 6th cycle of
      chemotherapy (average 15 weeks).
