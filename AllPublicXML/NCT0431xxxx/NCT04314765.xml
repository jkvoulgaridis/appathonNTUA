  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The dehiscence distal to the second molar after lower third molar extraction is very common
      because the access flap for surgical extraction cannot be repositioned on a portion of
      healthy bone to guarantee suture support. The healing process is therefore delayed and the
      possible accumulation of food and debris is often responsible for bad smell and pain with the
      consequent occurrence of an overlapping infection.

      The main aim of the study is to evaluate whether healing is significantly different using two
      different flaps for surgical access. Clinical assessment and a quality of life questionnaire
      are used for the evaluation.
