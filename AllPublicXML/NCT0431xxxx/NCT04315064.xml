    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish the safety of infusions of panobinostat (MTX110)
      into the fourth ventricle of the brain or tumor resection cavity in patients with recurrent
      medulloblastoma and to assess the antitumor activity of simultaneous infusions of
      panobinostat (MTX110) into the fourth ventricle of the brain or resection cavity in patients
      with recurrent medulloblastoma based upon MRI scans and lumbar cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
      cytology.

    <description>Patients will undergo surgery for maximum safe tumor resection with simultaneous placement of a ventricular access device (VAD) into the fourth ventricle or posterior fossa tumor resection cavity.The specific ventricular access device that will be placed is Medtronic Reference number 44102, &quot;Medtronic CSF-Ventricular Reservoir Side Inlet, 18 mm.If a patient already has a ventricular access device in place and additional tumor resection is not required, then that patient can proceed with intraventricular chemotherapy infusions after study enrollment. If the patient has metastatic disease in the brain and/or spine without resectable tumor in the posterior fossa, then only catheter and ventricular access device placement will be performed.Enrolled patients will receive 4 infusions per week of panobinostat (MTX110; 0.5 ml of 300 μM = 52.4 μg), per infusion into the ventricular access device for 6 consecutive weeks for a total of 24 infusions.</description>
