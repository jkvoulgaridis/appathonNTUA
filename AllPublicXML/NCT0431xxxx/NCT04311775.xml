      LMA insertion provide an intact airway for many surgeries during general anesthesia . LMA
      insertion technique was defined when it was first produced by Archie Brain . Accordingly, it
      is recommended to advance the device to the level where resistance is felt blindly. However,
      placing LMA may not always be smooth and uncomplicated. Thus, gas leaks may occur and
      intragastric pressure increase may occur due to gastric insufflation. To overcome these
      difficulties, the placement of the LMA under direct vision using a laryngoscope has been
      described in several studies . Previous studies have shown that the reliability of the
      laryngeal mask can be demonstrated by the oropharyngeal cuff leak test . In addition, the
      classification of the image of the laryngeal structures mediated by fiberoptic imaging and
      vocal cords from the LMA gives us information about the availability of effective positive
      pressure ventilation.

      vocal cords from the LMA gives us information about the availability of effective positive
      pressure ventilation.In cases where difficulties are found in laryngeal mask placement, using
      direct laryngoscope or videosingoscope, placement is frequently applied in anesthesia
      practice. Kim GW et al investigated LMA placement with direct laryngoscope. However, there is
      no study investigating the effectiveness of videongoscopes. Videoingoscopes have wide viewing
      angles through their cameras located at the blade tips. For this reason, we think that it
      will be advantageous in placing a laryngeal mask.
