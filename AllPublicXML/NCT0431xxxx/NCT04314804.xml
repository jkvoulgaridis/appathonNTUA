  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      No actual human data for pharmacokinetics, metabolism, safety, pharmacodynamics, nor efficacy
      parameters are available for inhaled medical cannabis. This study was designed to investigate
      the innocuity and tolerability levels as well as the pharmacokinetic profile of this
      combination when smoked/inhaled as intended in clinical therapeutic use (i.e. patients with
      neuropathic pain). Consecutive dosing (over a period of 7 days) should allow to test the
      tolerability of chronic administration. In addition, the impact of the THC/cannabidiol
      pharmacological activity on the cognition activity, cognitive test will be performed before
      and throughout the treatment and compared to the plasma levels of THC/cannabidiol following
      single and multiple dosing.

             seconds. If there is any pulmonary disease diagnosed previously (obstructive and/or
             restrictive pathology), the patient must be able to perform a maximal inhalation of at
