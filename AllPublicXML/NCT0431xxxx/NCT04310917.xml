  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the second leading cause of death in France and the leading
      cause of death on Reunion Island. Some modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular diseases
      are well identified and can be easily modulated, in particular by hygiene and dietetic
      measures (tobacco, sedentary lifestyle). Other risk factors such as high blood pressure,
      diabetes or dyslipidemia can also be pharmacologically modulated. On the other hand, there is
      a cardiovascular risk factor that we do not know how to modulate: a high level of lipoprotein
      (a) (Lp (a)), whose regulation remains largely unknown.

      High plasma levels of Lipoprotein (a) remain a major risk for the development of
      cardiovascular disease and its clinical complications, which no drug can currently reduce.
      Understanding the biological and genetic determinants modulating Lp (a) levels remains a
      major challenge for treating subjects with hyper Lp (a). Several individuals and possibly
      Reunion families have been detected as having abnormally high rates of apo (a)

      Thanks to the link between cardiovascular clinical picture, Lp (a) concentration and other
      biological markers, the study should allow a better understanding of the mechanisms
      underlying the cardiovascular risk in order to offer advice. prevention and care of at-risk
      subjects screened; or even avenues for adapted genetic counseling (DNA sequencing).

      At the genetic level, several hypotheses could be explored making it possible to link the
      expression of the apo (a) protein to the genotype, in particular the presence of mutations in
      the gene, in the promoter region, polymorphisms, or epistatic regulation.
