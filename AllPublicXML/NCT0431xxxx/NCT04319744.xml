  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Video games are activities that require actively hand-eye coordination and where 3D thinking
      is at the forefront.

      During the teaching of both laparoscopic surgery and robotic surgery techniques, it was
      revealed by the studies that the participants who played video games completed the trainings
      more easily and the success rate increased.

      In a study comparing fiberoptic intubation success, anesthesia assistants playing video games
      had higher successful intubation rates and shorter intubation times in the first attempt.

      Video stylets are newly developed devices that allow the use of video technology in airway
      management.

      It has a camera at the end and a monitor to which the image is transferred. By transferring
      the real-time view of the airway structures, tracheal intubation increases the success rate
      and shortens the intubation time.

      In order to determine whether video game playing has positive effects on videostylet use,ıt
      was aimed to compare the performances of the assistants who did play with the video game
      assistants.

      Anesthesiology assistants will be questioned about whether participants have played video
      games before or not.

      Participants will be divided into two different groups as those with and without prior video
      game experience.

      Video game will be played for those who have previous experience for 5 days via 0.5 hour
      mobile phone (Pubg mobile).No games will be played on the other group.

      Then, all participants will be trained on the video stylet.

      Within the scope of this training, all participants will watch videos about 1-Video stylet
      application.

      2-Verbal explanation will be made by the responsible and investigators of the study 3- All
      participants will practice on the model first

      4-Responsible investigators will practice and show on the real patient.

      5-Then all participants will perform the application on the real patient under the
      supervision of responsible and investigators.

      Tracheal intubation time, success rate, number of interventions will be recorded by
      responsible and investigators.
