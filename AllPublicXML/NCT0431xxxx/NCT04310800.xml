      To validate the effect of Ligation of Intersphincteric Fistula Tract (LIFT) Versus LIFT-plug
      procedure for Anal Fistula Repair in 7 medical centers

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The management of trans-sphincteric anal fistulae of cryptoglandular origin is challenging.
      The ideal management is to effectively heal the fistula without compromising continence,
      avoid fistula recurrence, and quick recovery. Ligation of the intersphincteric fistula tract
      (LIFT) and LIFT reinforced with a bioprosthetic graft (BioLIFT) are two recently reported
      procedures that showed improved healing results. In the LIFT, Rojanasakul et al proposed to
      identify the fistula tract in the intersphincteric space and subsequent division and ligation
      of the tract, and the primary healing rate was 94.4%. The following studies reported slightly
      lower results, but the recurrence rate was as high as 18% to 28%. Ellis et al subsequently
      described a modified LIFT procedure (BioLIFT procedure) in which a bioprosthetic was placed
      in the intersphincteric plane to reinforce the closure of the fistula tract (BioLIFT
      procedure), and yielded a healing rate of 94% in 31 patients who had a minimum of 1 year of
      follow-up after their last treatment. The investigators modified the LIFT procedure by
      combining LIFT with the technique of anal fistula plug. The bioprosthetic plug was placed
      into the fistula tract through the opening in the external sphincter to the external opening
      in the skin after LIFT procedure. The present study was designed to assess the preliminary
      results of LIFT-Plug technique prospectively. The purpose of this study is to validate the
      effect of Ligation of Intersphincteric Fistula Tract (LIFT) Versus LIFT-plug procedure for
      Anal Fistula Repair in 7 medical centers.

    <description>The LIFT-plug procedure was performed as followings. A portion of the fistula tract was excised from ei¬ther end within the intersphincteric space. One porcine small-intestine submucosa extracellular matrix plug was soaked in saline for 5-10 min, then placed into the intersphincteric groove and pulled through the curetted tract to the external opening. The plug was secured with a figure-of-eight 3/0 absorbable suture to the fistula opening in the external sphincter and ligated. Excess plug protruding from the external opening was trimmed flush with the skin without fixation. The wound was loosely closed with 2-3 interrupted 3/0 absorbable sutures.</description>

    <description>The LIFT procedure was performe as followings. The curvilinear incision and dissection of the intersphincteric tract were made as in the LIFT-plug technique. After the tract was isolated, the tract was doubly-ligated and suture-ligated with absorbable sutures as close as possible to the lateral margin of the internal anal sphincter and the medial margin of the external anal sphincter. The tract was then divided between the two sutures. A portion of the fistula tract was excised after ligation of ei¬ther end within the intersphincteric space. The medial ligature was very close to the internal opening, and nearly obliterated the internal opening. The external opening was then enlarged to allow adequate drainage. The internal and external sphincters were then re-approximated, and the skin was closed loosely with interrupted 3/0 absorbable suture.</description>
