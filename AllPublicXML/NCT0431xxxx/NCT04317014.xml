  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      childhood obesity and early puberty are closely related, but existing reports usually focus
      on their relationship from the perspective of phenotype. This study was designed to
      investigate the association between obesity-related genic polymorphisms and the risk of early
      puberty in Chinese Han girls.

      the genotypes of obesity-related SNPs were determined and the unstimulated luteinizing
      hormone, follicle stimulating hormone and estradiol levels were also detected.
