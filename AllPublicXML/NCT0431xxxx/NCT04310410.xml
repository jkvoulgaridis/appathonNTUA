  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PRE-FURTHER study aims to evaluate the feasibility of the combined treatment with
      radiotherapy and focussed ultrasound for pain palliation in patients with painful bone
      metastases, and to optimize the combined treatment logistics. Six to ten patients will be
      included according to in- and exclusion criteria.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Metastatic bone pain strongly interferes with quality of life and daily
      functioning of patients with advanced cancer. Pain palliation may be improved by including
      magnetic resonance image guided high intensity focused ultrasound (MR-HIFU) in addition to
      External Beam Radiotherapy (EBRT). For this purpose, feasibility and optimal logistics of the
      combined treatment need to be evaluated.

      Objective: The PRE-FURTHER project aims to evaluate the feasibility of the combined EBRT and
      MR-HIFU treatment for relief of metastatic bone pain, and to optimize the combined treatment
      logistics.

      Study design: The PRE-FURTHER study is a prospective case series, stage I and IIA study
      according to the Innovation, Development, Evaluation, Assessment and Long term evaluation
      (IDEAL) recommendations. 6-10 patients will receive MR-HIFU treatment following standard
      EBRT.

      Endpoints: The main outcome of this study is the feasibility of the procedure, in terms of
      planability as well as patient-tolerability of the combined treatment within a short time
      frame (3 hours - 4 days interval). In addition, pain relief and safety of the combined
      procedure will be monitored.

    <description>Following standard EBRT (single or multiple fraction), patients will receive one MR-HIFU treatment with the Profound Sonalleve MR-HIFU device on the most painful of their bone metastases. This treatment will take place in a short time frame of 3 hours to maximum 4 days. Patients will be followed up until 4 weeks after treatment. During follow-up they will be phoned around day 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28 to retrieve pain scores, pain medication and (serious) adverse events. At day 3 the patient's experience with the combined treatment will also be inquired.</description>
