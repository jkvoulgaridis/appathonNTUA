  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many of the 2.8 million family caregivers (FCGs) of persons with advanced cancer are
      underserved, particularly African-Americans and rural-dwellers in the Southern U.S.. Most
      have poor access and awareness of community-based palliative care services and have received
      no formal support or training despite providing assistance to their relatives an average of 8
      hrs/day. Providing intense care and witnessing a close friend or family member struggle with
      advanced cancer can result in FCGs experiencing marked distress, particularly as their care
      recipients near end of life (EOL). Reports from NCI and NINR caregiving summits, systematic
      reviews, and the National Academy of Medicine have highlighted major limitations of cancer
      caregiver interventions, including a lack of attention to underserved populations and cost,
      poor scalability, over reliance on highly-trained professionals (e.g., nurses, psychologists,
      behavioral therapists), lengthy sessions over a short duration, and a lack of demonstrated
      impact on patient outcomes and healthcare utilization. To address this gap, the investigators
      have developed and tested feasibility and acceptability of a lay navigator-led early
      palliative care intervention called ENABLE Cornerstone for rural and minority family
      caregivers of persons with advanced cancer in the Southern U.S.. Evolving out of the team's
      prior trials and community stakeholder formative evaluation work, this multicomponent
      intervention is based on Pearlin's Stress-Health Process Model where lay navigators, overseen
      by an interdisciplinary outpatient palliative care team, employ health coaching techniques
      and caregiver distress screening to behaviorally activate and reinforce psychoeducation on
      managing stress and coping, getting and asking for help, improving caregiving skills, and
      decision-making/advance care planning over 6 brief in-person/telephonic sessions plus monthly
      follow-up from diagnosis through early bereavement. This proposed hybrid type I randomized
      effectiveness-implementation trial will determine whether ENABLE Cornerstone compared to
      usual care can improve family caregiver (Aim 1) and patient outcomes (Aim 2) and will
      evaluate implementation costs, cost effectiveness and healthcare utilization (Aim 3), over 24
      weeks with 294 family caregivers and their patients with newly-diagnosed advanced cancer. To
      maximize recruitment, the investigators will recruit from two community cancer centers in
      Birmingham, AL and Mobile, AL. Our theory-driven, standardized approach is innovative because
      it uses lay navigators in collaboration with a palliative care interdisciplinary team to
      promote caregiver activation, skills and knowledge enhancement, as opposed to other
      difficult-to-implement intervention models that rely mostly on delivery of services by
      advanced practice professionals providing lengthy sessions over a short duration. If
      effectiveness is established, the ENABLE Cornerstone intervention offers a highly scalable
      and reproducible model of formal caregiver support that would be primed for dissemination and
      implementation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This hybrid type I randomized effectiveness-implementation trial is designed to answer the
      question &quot;Is ENABLE Cornerstone efficacious in enhancing caregiver and patient outcomes?&quot; The
      primary aims are to assess the effectiveness of ENABLE Cornerstone over 24 weeks (Primary and
      Secondary Aim). The investigators will also explore implementation cost and cost
      effectiveness, including healthcare utilization (Aim 3) and other potential
      mediator/moderator effects of the intervention on coping, social support, and preparedness
      (Exploratory Aim). The study will recruit 294 family caregivers over the age of 21 reporting
      that they are the primary unpaid provider of support to a close family member or friend who
      has been newly-diagnosed with an advanced stage cancer within the past 60 days. Half of the
      participants will be randomized to ENABLE Cornerstone (n=147) which consists of 6 brief,
      weekly in-person/telephone sessions followed by monthly follow-up every 4 weeks as needed by
      participants. The other half will be assigned to a usual care condition (n=147). The
      randomization scheme, stratified by site (UAB and MCI) in block lengths of 8, will be
      executed in REDCap, a clinical trials management software program using a computer-generated
      algorithm. Assessments will be administered via telephone, by a research coordinator blind to
      group assignment. Participants will complete outcome assessments upon enrollment (T1) and at
      12 (T2), 24 (T3) and every 12 weeks thereafter. The T2 assessment captures the short-term
      outcomes of the most intensive part of the intervention. The T3 assessment will capture the
      long-term outcomes of the intervention. Subsequent assessments explore the sustained effect
      of ENABLE Cornerstone at the patient's end-of-life and post death. The primary outcome is
      whether the intervention affects the &quot;slope&quot; of FCG distress at 24 weeks.

      An intention to treat (ITT) approach will be used for all analyses. That is, all caregivers
      and patients will be included in their respective assigned conditions, regardless of their
      degree of participation in the study. Primary data analysis will begin with descriptive
      statistics for baseline caregiver and patient characteristics and outcomes. The investigators
      will examine balance between study groups with respect to baseline characteristics using
      effect sizes such as the standardized mean difference for numerical variables and Cramer's V
      for categorical variables. Conceptually relevant baseline factors showing non-trivial
      imbalances between groups will be then used as adjusting covariates in the longitudinal group
      comparisons. Distributional assumptions will be examined and, when appropriate, we will
      employ inferential and modeling procedures robust to distributional assumptions such as
      normality. Patterns of missing data will be examined and whether baseline characteristics are
      associated with dropout. Conceptually relevant baseline factors predictive of dropout will
      then be used as adjusting covariates in the longitudinal group comparisons. Mixed-effect
      modeling techniques and covariate adjustment will reduce the impact of missing data, as the
      missingness is not assumed completely at random (MCAR) but conditionally (on the covariates)
      at random (i.e., MAR, a milder assumption). We will use the latest versions of SAS and R for
      all analyses and reports.

      For specific aims 1 and 2, a longitudinal model fitted with linear mixed methods will be used
      for each outcome. The focus of inference will be the between-group difference in outcome
      change from baseline over 12 and 24 weeks, modeled by a time by group interaction. A random
      effect for subject will be fitted to account for covariance among repeated measures on the
      same individuals. The fixed-effect part of the model has the form:
      Y=b_0+b_1∙Cornerstone+b_2∙Week12+b_3∙Week24+b_4∙Cornerstone×Week12+b_5∙Cornerstone×Week24,
      where Y ̂ is the expected value (i.e., the mean) of the outcome according to the predictor
      combinations, Cornerstone is a binary indicator of group assignment (1=ENABLE Cornerstone,
      0=usual care), and Week24 and Week12 are binary indicators of the follow-up time points. For
      the usual care group, the mean outcome at baseline is estimated by the b_0 coefficient, the
      mean outcome at Week 12 is estimated by b_0+b_2, and the mean outcome at Week 24 is estimated
      by b_0+b_3. For the ENABLE Cornerstone group, the mean outcome at baseline is estimated by
      b_0+b_1, the mean outcome at Week 12 is estimated by b_0+b_1+b_2+b_4, and the mean outcome at
      Week 24 is estimated by b_0+b_1+b_3+b_5. The overall treatment effect, ∆, will be computed as
      the average between-group difference in change from baseline (averaged over Week 12 and Week
      24) estimated with a linear contrast, ∆ =(1⁄2)∙(b_4+b_5). From the perspective of
      significance testing, the test for the interaction effect, a 2-degree of freedom test, is the
      test of difference in change from baseline between the study groups (since the groups are
      randomized and the mean outcome at baseline should be similar). If necessary, the team will
      conduct covariate adjustment for baseline factors unbalanced between the groups or predictive
      of dropout.

      For specific aim 3, this within-trial analysis will be conducted separately from the
      perspectives of healthcare payers and FCGs and patients following current recommendations.
      Because the ENABLE Cornerstone intervention potentially affects FCG and patient distress and
      QOL and, by consequence, potentially affects healthcare utilization and costs, upfront
      implementation costs will be weighed against potential savings in healthcare costs and
      effectiveness measured by improvements in quality of life adjusted years (QALY) over the
      follow-up period.

For cost effectiveness, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) will be calculated separately for health care payers and FCG-patient dyads, and measure the average net cost per QALY gained for intervention participants vs. usual care participants. ENABLE Cornerstone will be deemed cost-effective if ICERs are below those from CEAs of other caregiver interventions (if available) or below commonly used threshold of $50,000/$100,000 per QALY.</description>
