  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, study to evaluate the
      efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of budesonide extended-release tablets for the
      induction of remission in pediatric subjects, with active, mild to moderate ulcerative
      colitis (UC). Subjects will be permitted to continue taking background oral or rectal
      5-aminosalicylate (5-ASA) products.

    <description>The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of subjects who achieve clinical remission at Day 56, defined as a total Mayo score of ≤ 1 with subscores of 0 for both rectal bleeding and stool frequency, and a subscore of ≤ 1 for endoscopy. The Mayo score is a composite index score based on 4 components: stool frequency (subject reported), rectal bleeding (subject reported), findings of endoscopy, and the physician's rating of disease activity. Each component is scored from 0 to 3, with total scores range from 0 to 12 with higher scores indicating more severe disease.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Established diagnosis of UC is based on:

               -  Clinical history

               -  Characteristic endoscopic findings

               -  Histopathology results from biopsies

          -  Age 5 to 17 years, inclusive, at Screening. Subjects should weigh greater than 13.6 kg
             at Baseline.

          -  Active UC of mild or moderate severity, defined as a total Mayo score between 4 and
             10, inclusive, with rectal bleeding subscore of ≥ 1, stool frequency subscore of ≥1
             and an endoscopy subscore of ≥ 1.

          -  If on a background oral or rectal 5-ASA, the dose and formulation have remained
             unchanged for at least 6 weeks prior to Visit 2 (randomization), Baseline and the
             subject is willing to remain on the same formulation and dose for the duration of the
             study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Current or prior diagnosis of Crohn's disease or indeterminate colitis.

          2. Limited distal proctitis (disease involving only the first 15 centimeters or less
             proximal to the anal verge.

          3. Severe UC, defined as total Mayo score &gt;10.

          4. Not currently in an active phase or flare, defined as a total Mayo score &lt;4, or Mayo
             score between 4 and 10, but Mayo subscore of 0 for rectal bleeding, stool frequency or
             endoscopy.

          5. Infectious colitis (based on positive microbiologic tests at Screening) or any recent
             history of infectious colitis (within 30 days prior to Screening).

          6. Prior gastrointestinal surgery, except appendectomy or hernia (e.g., inguinal,
             umbilical).

             NOTE: Prior cholecystectomy is not exclusionary if more than 1 year prior to
             Screening.

          7. Evidence or history of toxic megacolon or bowel resection.
