      The severity of diverticulitis is usually graded with the use of modified Hinchey Criteria.
      However, there is a condition often seen in the CT scan that is not included in this
      classification itself; 1-2 pericolic bubbles but no free air or fluid into the abdomen or
      above the liver. Outcome in these patients remains unknown. We aim to analyse the treatment
      that these patients and their evolution over the first year after the diagnosis in order to
      predict the disease related outcome.

      The study is set up as a retrospective multicentre observational study. Inclusion criteria
      are Patients over 18 years old, Diagnosed of acute diverticulitis with a CT scan reported as
      1-2 pericolic bubbles. Exclusion criteria: 1) CT scan showing free distant bubbles in the
      abdomen. 2) CT scan showing free fluid.

      Accepting an alpha risk of 0.05 and a beta risk of 0.2 in a two-sided test, 137 subjects are
      necessary in the observed group to recognize a difference in morbidity greater than or equal
      to 10%. A proportion in the reference group has been estimated to be 20%. It has been
      anticipated a drop-out rate of 0%.

      Primary outcome is 30-day morbidity and mortality. Secondary outcomes include malignancy and
      1 year morbidity including recurrences and ongoing disease. Data will be collected in an
      online repository. The CT scans will be reviewed by 2 experienced independent radiologists.
      The management of these patients at the moment of the diagnosis will be recorded, as well as
      their evolution over the first year during the outpatient clinics. Figure 1 represents the
      study flow chart.

      Data will be collected in an online secure and protected repository (Castor edc). The planned
      study period is 2 years (01/06/2020 - 31/12/2021).

      CT scans will be reviewed by 2 experienced radiologists. Every other CT scan performed during
      the follow-up will be reviewed by the same radiologists.

      The management of these patients at the moment of the diagnosis will be recorded, as well as
      their evolution over the first year during the outpatient clinics.

      This study protocol is a new approach to an unknown entity in diverticulitis. We are convince
      that the outcomes are clinically relevant to patients and interesting for all physicians
      treating diverticulitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diverticular disease of the colon is a common disease that includes diverticulosis and
      diverticulitis. Most patients who have diverticulosis remain asymptomatic; however an
      estimated 15-20% will develop acute diverticulitis (AD).(1) AD is an inflammatory condition
      affecting at least one colonic diverticula, often associated with pericolonic
      inflammation.(2) Diverticulitis can range form mild to severe. Severe, complicated cases with
      perforation may be associated with intra-abdominal abscess, generalized, purulent
      peritonitis, fistula formation, bleeding or obstruction. The extent of the perforation
      determines the clinical behavior. Microperforations remain localised because they are
      contained by pericolic fat and mesentery, leading to the formation of small pericolic
      abscesses.

      The gold standard for the diagnosis of diverticulitis is the Computed Tomography (CT). It has
      a sensitivity ranging form 85% to 97% (3,4) and it is very accurate identifying colonic
      perforation, which can have a direct impact on the management of the patient. The severity of
      diverticulitis is usually graded with the use of modified Hinchey's Criteria, based on CT
      imaging and on preoperative findings.(5) It distinguishes four stages of acute complicated
      diverticulitis. Several modifications to the Hinchey classification have been proposed due to
      the advancements in imaging modalities. New subcategories have been added that take
      radiological findings into consideration.(6) However, there is a condition often seen in the
      CT scan that is not included in this classification itself; a single pericolic bubble.

      The management of AD depends on its severity and complexity, and it requires hospitalization,
      bowel rest and surgery in selected cases. Antibiotic therapy is part of the management of
      complicated diverticulitis and recent guidelines are in accordance at recommending
      broad-spectrum antibiotics. Biondo and colleagues evaluated 92 papers in a systematic review,
      concluding that patients with severe AD without need of emergency surgery, should be treated
      with hospitalization, parenteral fluids and a single intravenous antibiotic active against
      aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.(7) Approximately 15-20% of patients admitted with AD have an
      abscess on CT scan.(8) The size of 3-6 cm has been generally accepted to be treated with
      antibiotics vs. percutaneous drainage.(8-10) However, clinical monitoring is mandatory and a
      CT scan should be repeated if the patient does not show clinical and laboratory improvement.

      In the 1990s laparoscopic lavage (LL) was proposed to treat patients affected by peritonitis
      due to perforated AD.(11) Initial results encouraged surgeons to perform LL;(12-14) however,
      in the 2000s three Randomized Control Trials (RCT) were published with mixed results.(15-17)
      Two of them suggested that the traditional surgical treatment (segmental resection and stoma
      formation) achieves more successful results.(16,17) In summary, there are several guidelines
      for the treatment of AD regarding its severity; however, there is no consensus in the
      management of those patients with 1-2 pericolic bubbles but no free air or fluid into the
      abdomen. The treatment that these patients receive is widely variable.

      For this reason, patients admitted in the emergency unit and diagnosed of acute
      diverticulitis with a free pericolic bubble of air, regardless the Hinchey's criteria
      assigned and the treatment received, would be included in this study. We aim to analyse the
      treatment that they underwent and the evolution of these patients over the first year after
      the diagnosis. The patients will not undergo any treatment or test that would not be
      necessary during their follow-up out of this observational and retrospective study.
