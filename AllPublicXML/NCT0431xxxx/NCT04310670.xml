  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project will investigate the effectiveness of patient-centered integrated treatment. The
      correlations between physiotherapy indices, non-invasive brain stimulation, connectivity and
      psychological support will be analyzed.

      At the time of recruitment (T0) a multidimensional evaluation will be performed consisting of
      clinical, neuropsychological, neurophysiological, MRI data obtained from peripheral blood
      sampling (10ml). After completing the program (12 weeks), the effect will be assessed
      according to objectives 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4 (T1). The study will also include a follow-up
      evaluation after 6 months (T2) and 12 months (T3) from the beginning of the treatment to
      evaluate the persistence of the beneficial effects after some time.

    <description>Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) will be used to evaluate the change of neuronal plasticity in a subgroup of patients who will not present contraindications to the method. The TMS uses short-lived magnetic fields and high intensity applied at the scalp level to activate the neurons of a small region of the cerebral cortex through an electromagnetic induction. When these impulses are applied repeatedly, it is possible to induce plastic modification of cortical excitability. Any increase or decrease in amplitude, which persists after the end of TMS repetitive stimulation, indicates that there have been changes in the cortical, long term potentiation (LTP) or depression (LTD).</description>

    <description>The 12-week program aims to improve patients' motor symptoms, gain insight into disease mechanisms, regain control over abnormal movements, and learn better coping strategies.
All members of the therapy team will be consistent in planning communication and treatment goals.
Physiotherapy treatment will be articulated through the use of techniques designed to qualify the functionality of the subject divided by symptom: weakness, dystonic attitudes of the limbs, walking disorders, tremor.
From a psychological point of view, the patient will be treated according to Lacanian psychoanalytic ethics, which allows to adequately respond to the patient's request for healing but who at the same time does not ignore the progress of scientific research in the neurological field.
Furthermore, diversified transcranial electrical stimulation protocols may be applied for therapeutic purposes.</description>
