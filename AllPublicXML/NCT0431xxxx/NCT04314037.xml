  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the bioequivalence (BE) of new coated Cesol tablet
      (Test) versus Biltricide tablets (Comparator) in healthy male participants. Praziquantel
      (rac-PZQ) is the active ingredient for Cesol and Biltricide tablets.
