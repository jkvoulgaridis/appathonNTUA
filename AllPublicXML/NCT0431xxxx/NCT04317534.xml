      A randomized trial of adjuvant Pembrolizumab following surgical resection versus observation
      following surgical resection in patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with
      primary tumors between 1-4 cm.

      Patients will be randomized (1:1) 4-12 weeks following surgery to either:

        -  Arm A: Pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks × 17 cycles

        -  Arm B: Observation

      Stratification factors will include: PD-L1 TPS (&lt;50% vs. ≥50%), and tumor size (1-2 cm vs.
      &gt;2-4 cm)

      Primary Objective:

        -  To evaluate whether the addition of adjuvant Pembrolizumab following surgical resection
           improves disease free survival compared with observation following surgical resection in
           patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with primary tumors between 1-4
           cm in size, regardless of PD-L1 TPS score.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate whether the addition of adjuvant Pembrolizumab following surgical resection
           improves overall survival compared with observation in patients with stage I non-small
           cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with primary tumors between 1-4 cm in size, regardless of PD-L1
           TPS.

        -  To evaluate the disease-free survival and overall survival rates at 1 year, 2 years, and
           3 years on each arm.

        -  To characterize the toxicity profile of adjuvant Pembrolizumab following surgical
           resection in patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with primary
           tumors between 1-4 cm in size.

      Exploratory Objectives:

        -  To evaluate whether the addition of adjuvant Pembrolizumab following surgical resection
           improves disease free survival compared with observation following surgical resection in
           patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with primary tumors between 1-4
           cm in size and a PD-L1 tumor proportion score (TPS) of ≥ 50%.

        -  To evaluate whether the addition of adjuvant Pembrolizumab following surgical resection
           improves disease free survival compared with observation following surgical resection in
           patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with primary tumors between 1-4
           cm in size and a high tumor mutation burden (TMB) defined as ≥ 10 mutations/MB.

        -  To evaluate whether the addition of adjuvant Pembrolizumab following surgical resection
           improves disease free survival compared with observation following surgical resection in
           patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with primary tumors between 1-4
           cm in size and a high tumor mutation burden (TMB) defined as ≥ 16 mutations/MB.

        -  To evaluate the disease free survival and overall survival for patients stratified by
           PD-L1 status (TPS ≥ 50% vs. &lt; 50%), and tumor size (1-2 cm vs. &gt;2-4 cm).

        -  To evaluate the association between various known prognostic variables, including, but
           not limited to, tumor differentiation (well-differentiated, moderately well
           differentiated, poorly differentiated), lymphovascular invasion, sex (male, female), PET
           max SUV and disease free survival and overall survival in patients treated with adjuvant
           Pembrolizumab for stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with primary tumors between
           1-4 cm in size.

        -  To evaluate whether the presence of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) or circulating tumor
           cells (CTCs) following surgical resection predicts relapse in patients with stage I
           non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with primary tumors between 1-4 cm in size.

        -  To evaluate whether the presence of ctDNA or CTCs following surgical resection in
           patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with primary tumors between 1-4
           cm in size can predict which patients benefit from adjuvant Pembrolizumab compared to
           observation.

        -  To evaluate potential biomarkers (which may include genomics, RNA, tumor infiltrating
           lymphocytes, CD4 and CD8 expression, JAK2, STK11/LB1 loss of function, macrophage
           profile, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, and microbiome) as prognostic or predictive for
           improved disease free survival and overall survival.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The participant (or legally acceptable representative if applicable) must provide
             written informed consent for the study. The participant may also provide consent for
             future unspecified research samples. However, the participant may participate in the
             study without participating in the future unspecified research sample collection.

          -  Males and females age ≥ 18 years at the time of consent.

          -  ECOG Performance Status of 0-1 within 28 days prior to registration.

          -  Patients must have undergone complete surgical resection of their stage I NSCLC
             between 4-12 weeks prior to registration and have negative surgical margins (R0).

               -  NOTE: Both squamous and non-squamous histologies are allowed into the study.
                  Cancers with a histology of &quot;adenosquamous&quot; are considered a type of
                  adenocarcinoma and thus &quot;non-squamous histology&quot;.

               -  NOTE: Staging will be according to the AJCC 8th edition.

          -  Pathological tumor size must be 1.0 - 4.0 cm in greatest dimension.

          -  Surgery for this lung cancer must be completed at least 28 days prior to registration.

          -  Must have either previous NGS and PD-L1 results available using the Dako 22C3 antibody
             or have archival tissue of surgical specimen from current diagnosis available to
             perform analyses. If prior PD-L1 results with Dako 22C3 antibody are not available
             from a CLIA-accredited laboratory, subjects must be able to provide 5µm x 4unstained
             slides for prospective analysis to be used for stratification. If NGS results are not
             available, subjects must be able to provide at least 10 x 10µm unstained and 1 x 4µm
             H&amp;E slides from current diagnosis for future NGS and/or other genetic analyses.

          -  Demonstrate adequate organ function as defined in the protocol; all screening labs to
             be obtained within 28 days prior to registration.

          -  Females of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test
             within 72 hours prior to registration. If the urine test is positive or cannot be
             confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required. For subjects
             randomized to the pembrolizumab arm: If there is &gt; 72 hours between the screening test
             and C1D1, another pregnancy test (urine or serum) must be performed and must be
             negative before the subject may start C1D1.

               -  NOTE: Females are considered of childbearing potential unless: they are
                  postmenopausal; are surgically sterile; or they have a congenital or acquired
                  condition that prevents childbearing. See Section 5.1.4 for definitions.

               -  NOTE: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle and preferred
                  contraception for the subject.

          -  A female participant is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant, not
             breastfeeding, and at least one of the following conditions applies:

               -  Not a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) OR

               -  A WOCBP who is using a highly effective contraceptive method (failure rate of &lt;1%
                  per year), or is abstinent from heterosexual intercourse as their preferred and
                  usual lifestyle (abstinent on a long term and persistent basis) during the
                  intervention period and for at least 120 days after the last dose of study drug.
                  The investigator should evaluate the potential for contraceptive method failure
                  (i.e., noncompliance, recently initiated) in relationship to the first dose of
                  study drug. See contraceptive guidance in Section 5.1.4 of the protocol.
