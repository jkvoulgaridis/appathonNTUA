  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a need for biomarkers that can rapidly and sensitively detect therapeutic benefits
      of therapies designed to &quot;rehydrate&quot; airways and monitor disease severity and progression. In
      this study the investigators will evaluate the stability of mucus concentration in patients
      with bronquiectasis (CF and NCBF) and its ability to respond to acute exacerbations in order
      to assess whether it can be a good candidate for biomarker.

      Prospective cross-sectional study of repeated measurements. The recruitment will be performed
      in 3 different cities of Spain: Zaragoza, Barcelona and Murcia.

      Subjects will be asked to repeatedly collect spontaneous and induced sputum samples in both
      stable and exacerbated conditions. All samples will be collected autonomously by patients in
      their homes after they have been instructed and supervised. Hypertonic saline nebulization
      will be used for sputum induction.

    <description>Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ). Self-administered questionnaire that evaluates the impact of cough in three domains: physical, psychological, and social (each one ranged 1 to 7). It is composed of 19 questions and the &quot;total score (range 3 to 21) is calculated by adding the domain scores together&quot;. The lower the score, the greater the severity.</description>

    <description>Cough and Sputum Assessment Questionnaire (CASA-Q). Self-administered questionnaire that consists of 20 questions organized in four domains (cough symptoms, cough impact, sputum symptoms, and sputum impact). Each domain is ranged from 0 to 100. The total score is expressed over 100 and calculated doing an average of the four domains. The lower the score, the greater the severity.</description>
