      This is a single-centre, open-label, Phase Ib study designed to assess if intravenous
      injection of approximately 3200 P. falciparum (NF54 strain) sporozoites can be safely
      administered to achieve blood-stage parasitaemia with a kinetics/PCR profile that will allow
      for the future characterisation of antimalarial blood-stage activity of new chemical entities
      in a relatively small number of participants during early drug development.

      Healthy, malaria-naïve adults, aged 18-55 years, will be enrolled in a maximum of 2 cohorts.
      Enrolment into the cohorts will proceed sequentially, with two target levels of parasitaemia,
      i.e., 5000 parasites/mL blood in Cohort 1 and 10000 parasites/mL blood in Cohort 2.

      The 3-day antimalarial therapy regimen will be further administered and monitored until
      parasite clearance. Safety and tolerability will be monitored during the whole study
      duration.

      This is a single-centre, open-label, Phase Ib study designed to assess if intravenous bolus
      injection of approximately 3200 P. falciparum (NF54 strain) sporozoites can be safely
      administered to achieve blood-stage parasitaemia with a kinetics/PCR profile that will allow
      for the future characterisation of antimalarial blood-stage activity of new chemical entities
      in a relatively small number of participants during early drug development.

      Up to 16 healthy, malaria-naïve males and females, aged 18-55 years, will be enrolled in a
      maximum of 2 cohorts (up to 8 participants per cohort; a participant may be enrolled in one
      cohort only). Enrolment into the cohorts will proceed sequentially, with two target levels of
      parasitaemia previously achieved in healthy participants enrolled in malaria Volunteer
      Infection Studies (VIS) at other study sites, i.e., 5000 parasites/mL blood in Cohort 1 and
      10000 parasites/mL blood in Cohort 2.

      Each participant will be admitted to the clinical unit in the morning of Day -1 and
      inoculated with approximately 3200 P. falciparum sporozoites (NF54 strain) by DVI on Day 1.
      Participants will be discharged 2 h post inoculation on Day 1 and will be monitored daily via
      phone call until Day 6. Participants will come to the clinical unit daily from Day 7 until
      Day 9 and together with the malaria clinical score, the presence of parasites will be
      assessed. Participants will be confined to the clinical unit from Day 10 in the morning.
      Parasite presence and malaria clinical score assessed twice daily and participants will be
      administered registered antimalarial therapy, i.e., Riamet®, when the following criteria are
      met:

        1. Cohort 1: ≥5000 parasites/mL blood or earlier if a participant has a malaria clinical
           score &gt;6 or at Investigator's discretion.

        2. Cohort 2: ≥10000 parasites/mL blood or earlier if a participant has a malaria clinical
           score &gt;6 or at Investigator's discretion.

      The registered 3-day antimalarial therapy regimen will be further administered and monitored.
      qPCR assessments of parasitaemia will be carried out at multiple time points (2, 6, 8, 12,
      16, 24, 36, 48 and 72 h) following initiation of Riamet® and malaria clinical score will be
      assessed twice daily during confinement in the clinical unit. Safety and tolerability will be
      monitored during the whole study duration, specific assessments will be done at periodic
      pre-specified time points from Day 10 and for at least 72 h after initiating antimalarial
      therapy, i.e., during confinement in the clinical unit (see below).

      Of note, all participants must consent to receiving antimalarial therapy, i.e., the
      registered 3-day Riamet® regimen approved for treatment of uncomplicated malaria. Even in the
      case of withdrawal from the study, all participants administered the PfSPZ-DVI Challenge are
      to receive antimalarial therapy as soon as possible, and to have all appropriate visits and
      assessments as required. If an intolerance or contraindication to Riamet® develops, Malarone®
      will be administered.

      Upon parasite clearance (defined as a qPCR value of 0 parasites per mL blood after initiating
      antimalarial therapy) and at least 72 h after initiating antimalarial therapy (estimated to
      occur on or before Day 19 and on or before Day 22 for Cohort 1 and Cohort 2, respectively),
      and if clinically well, participants will be discharged from the clinical unit and will be
      followed up for safety assessments, clinical evaluation and malaria qPCR in the clinical unit
      at the EOS visit on Day 28.

      All participants who received antimalarial therapy will be asked non-leading questions to
      determine the occurrence of any AEs throughout the study and at the EOS visit.

      All participants inoculated with PfSPZ-DVI Challenge will commence antimalarial therapy no
      later than Day 24 for both cohorts, regardless if they reach pre-defined cohort-specific PCR
      parasitaemia/malaria clinical score thresholds (i.e., 5000 parasites/mL blood for Cohort 1
      and 10000 parasites/mL blood for Cohort 2 and/or a malaria clinical score ≥6 for Cohorts 1
      and 2). Participants who start antimalarial therapy on Day 24 will only be discharged from
      confinement at the end of the EOS visit on Day 28.

      Antimalarial therapy may be initiated whenever deemed necessary by the Investigators, e.g.,
      if there is a concern regarding the safety of a study participant. Therapy may be amended
      according to the treating physician if the participant does not respond to treatment or the
      condition worsens.

      A sentinel strategy will be employed in Cohorts 1 and 2. Each cohort will consist of 2
      subgroups of participants, to be enrolled sequentially: Subgroup 1 will be composed of 2
      participants; Subgroup 2 will be composed of 6 participants. Participants in Subgroup 2 will
      not be treated until the last participant in Subgroup 1 has completed antimalarial therapy
      and only upon decision of the Principal Investigator (PI), medical director and medical
      monitor after review of available safety and tolerability data (safety assessments, AEs and
      malaria clinical scores) and parasitaemia data, including clearance of parasitaemia, of
      Subgroup 1.

      Review of available Cohort 1 safety/tolerability and parasitaemia data up to the last dose of
      Riamet® for all inoculated participants in Cohort 1 will be performed by a Safety Review Team
      (SRT) before enrolment of Cohort 2. For progression from Cohort 1 to Cohort 2, the SRT
      members will include at least an independent Early Phase and Clinical Pharmacology MD expert
      experienced in malaria volunteer infection studies (SRT chair), the Medical Monitor, the
      Medical/Project

             the unit; 13. Use of any prescription drugs, herbal supplements (e.g., St John's Wort)
             or over-the-counter medication within 7 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer)
             prior to the PfSPZ-DVI Challenge, or an anticipated requirement for the use of these
             during the course of the study (see Section 6.2); Note: If necessary, the incidental
             use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and paracetamol (2 g/day, 10
             g/week) may be acceptable at the Investigator's discretion and will be documented in
             the eSource system. The use of nutritional supplements during this time that are not
             believed to have the potential to affect participant safety nor the overall results of
             the study, may be permitted on a case-by-case basis by the Investigator.

             14. Any surgical or medical condition possibly affecting drug absorption (e.g.,
             cholecystectomy, gastrectomy, bowel disease), distribution, metabolism or excretion;
             15. Personnel (e.g., Investigator, sub-investigator, research assistant, pharmacist,
             study coordinator or anyone mentioned in the delegation log) directly involved in the
             conduct of the study; 16. Any condition that in the opinion of the Investigator would
             jeopardise the safety or rights of a person participating in the study or would render
             the person unable to comply with the protocol; 17. Personal history of malaria; 18.
             Volunteer has travelled to or lived in a malaria-endemic area within 6 months prior to
             planned study enrolment; 19. Plans to travel to malaria-endemic region during the
             study period up to last follow-up visit; 20. Previous participation in any malaria
             vaccine or CHMI study/VIS; 21. Falling in moderate or higher risk category for a fatal
             or non-fatal cardiovascular event within 5 years (&gt; 5%) determined by a validated risk
             estimation system, e.g., SCORE [21]; 22. Use of systemic antibiotics with known
             antimalarial activity within 5 half-lives of PfSPZ-DVI Challenge (e.g.,
             trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, doxycycline, tetracycline, clindamycin, erythromycin,
             fluoroquinolones or azithromycin) or an anticipated requirement for the use of these
             during the study period (see Section 6.2); 23. Receipt of blood or blood-derived
             products (including immunoglobulin) within 3 months prior to screening. Receipt of
             packed RBCs given for an emergent indication in an otherwise healthy person, and not
             required as ongoing treatment is not exclusionary (for example packed RBCs emergently
             given during an elective surgery).

        Note: In case of an out-of-range clinical laboratory test (according to the clinically
        acceptable ranges for study inclusion laboratory tests in Attachment 4), vital sign or ECG
        value that will determine a participant's eligibility, or in case of a positive drug
        screen, a retest or expert evaluation can be requested. Results of any retest must be
        available prior to inoculation. The result of the retest will be considered for participant
        eligibility at the Investigator's discretion. Participants can be rescreened at the
        discretion of the Investigator.
