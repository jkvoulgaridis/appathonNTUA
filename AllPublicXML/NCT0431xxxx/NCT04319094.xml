  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fifteen to twenty percent of older Americans (6 to 8 million people) suffer from depression
      but more than one-half do not receive any services, a burden disproportionately shared by
      low-income and minority older adults who receive few or no services. The investigators
      propose to test a community-based peer model of depression care called PEERS (a peer support
      program) that provides self-care support for minority and low-income older adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression is a major burden for minority and low-income older adults who are less likely to
      use mental health services, and development of new service delivery models is needed to
      improve the quality of life and address disparities to access for this group. The
      investigators propose to test the effectiveness of a peer-delivered depression care program
      that is embedded in the community and linked to the patient's primary care clinic. The
      investigators will carry out a randomized controlled trial of the PEERS program in which peer
      mentors who have personal experience of depression meet individually with older adults
      recruited in the community for 8 weekly meetings focused on relief of depressive symptoms
      through self-care support and linkages to community resources. This group of low-income and
      minority older adults in the intervention will be compared to a group that receives non-peer
      visits that provide social interaction. The PEERS program takes a chronic disease
      self-management approach and is guided by the conceptual frameworks of social support, peer
      support, and social learning. The investigators will conduct an analysis of mediation to
      understand the mechanism of peer support, by measuring factors such as self-efficacy and
      loneliness that may be responsible for the intervention effect. The investigators' goal is to
      use peer-delivered depression care to decrease the mental health morbidity of at-risk
      low-income and minority adults. The potential public health impact is high because the
      investigators' project seeks to increase access to depression for a vulnerable group of older
      adults who often do not get care and leverages an existing workforce of peer workers whose
      services are reimbursed in many states.
