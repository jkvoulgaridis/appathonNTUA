  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to establish whether the safety of the T-MACS decision aid to
      immediately 'rule out' acute coronary syndromes with one blood sample for the cardiac damage
      marker troponin, is non-inferior to an approach requiring serial troponin sampling over three
      hours.

      We will conduct a randomized, controlled point of care trial embedded in routine practice. We
      will ask clinicians to obtain written informed consent during the course of their clinical
      duties. Patients who have suspected cardiac chest pain, who are identified as being at very
      low risk by the T-MACS algorithm, will be invited to participate.

      Patients will then be randomly allocated to be advised that they can be discharged
      immediately (so long as the doctor and patient have no other concerns; this is the originally
      intended use of T-MACS; intervention arm) or to receive a second blood test after 3 hours
      (current practice; control arm).

      Participants will then be followed up by electronic record review after 30 days and 12
      months. Other than the difference in the requirement for a second blood test, participants
      will not notice any change to their care.

      The accelerated pathway (involving a single blood test) has been shown to be safe in
      observational research involving over 5,000 patients. All of the data that are collected are
      the same of those that are collected in routine care, and they will be anonymised for
      analysis.
