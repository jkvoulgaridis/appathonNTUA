  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We propose to carry out a large multicentric, multinational, randomized controlled trial with
      two phases (two sequential randomized controled trials) to answer two questions: 1) Should
      hospitalized patients with recently diagnosed OHS be discharged from the hospital on an
      auto-titratable NIV treatment until the diagnosis of OHS is confirmed in 3 months? 2) Is the
      long-term effectiveness of outpatient titrated CPAP non-inferior to titrated NIV in
      ambulatory patients with OHS 3 months after hospital discharge? Clinical practice,
      multicenter open-label controlled randomized clinical trial with preset allocation rate (1:1)
      with two parallel-groups conducted in centers from Spain, France, Portugal and USA. The study
      will have two phases with two randomizations. The first phase will be a superiority study and
      the second phase will be a non-inferiority study.

      Objectives: First phase (medium-term): To evaluate the medium-term (3 months) efficacy of
      automatically adjusted noninvasive ventilation (NIV) treatment versus &quot;life style
      modifications&quot; treatment in obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) after an episode of
      acute-on-chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure. The main outcome will be a composite that
      includes hospital resource utilization (hospital and ICU admissions and emergency department
      visits for any cause) and all-cause mortality. Key secondary outcomes will include incident
      cardiovascular events (new hypertension diagnosis or initiation of anti-hypertensive
      treatment, atrial fibrillation, hospitalization for nonfatal myocardial infarction or
      unstable angina, percutaneous coronary interventions, nonfatal stroke or transient ischemic
      attack or for acute heart failure episode, and cardiovascular death), blood pressure,
      arterial blood gases, clinical symptoms and quality of life. Second phase (long-term):
      Evaluate the long-term efficacy (36 months) of manually titrated NIV treatment versus
      manually titrated CPAP treatment in OHS after 3 months of an episode of acute-on-chronic
      hypercapnic respiratory failure, with a composite outcome of hospital resource utilization
      (hospital and ICU admissions, emergency department visits) and all-cause mortality analyzed
      as the primary outcome. Incident cardiovascular events, blood pressure, arterial blood gases,
      clinical symptoms and quality of life will be the main secondary outcomes.

      Methods: Prospective, multinational, randomized open-label controlled trial with two parallel
      arms: 1,110 hospitalized patients with newly diagnosed OHS with acute-on-chronic hypercapnic
      respiratory failure treated with invasive or noninvasive mechanical ventilation who survive
      hospitalization and available for hospital discharge will be randomized to either
      automatically adjusted NIV (555 patients) or &quot;life style modifications&quot; (555 patients) for
      three months. Subsequently, both automatically adjusted NIV and &quot;life style modifications&quot;
      arms will be re-randomized to polysomnographically adjusted CPAP or to polysomnographically
      adjusted NIV groups to complete 36 months of follow up. The first phase of the proposal is a
      superiority study and the second phase is a non-inferiority study. The primary outcome and
      its components will be analyzed by a mixed-effects model with negative binomial. A
      mixed-effects Cox model will be used for hospital resource utilization, new cardiovascular
      events and overall survival. Other secondary outcomes such as repeated measures derived from
      the arterial blood gases (i.e. PaCO2, PaO2, pH, calculated bicarbonate), blood pressure,
      health-related quality of life tests and Epworth Sleepiness Scale during the follow-up will
      be analyzed by a linear mixed-effects model.

    <description>In-laboratory polysomnographic NIV titration will be performed according to published guidelines In addition to lifestyle modification and oxygen (if required) home NIV therapy with fixed pressures will be started. The ventilator mode will be a bilevel pressure in S/T mode. The ventilator adjustment will be firstly performed in awake situation and then during sleep by means of a PSG. The treatment period will be three years.</description>

             receiving hospital therapy with invasive or noninvasive ventilation, and just deemed
             stable for home discharge.&quot;

        to hospital admission (i.e. average daily use of less than 2 hours of PAP therapy) can also
        be enrolled at the discretion of the investigators if they feel the patient is now more
