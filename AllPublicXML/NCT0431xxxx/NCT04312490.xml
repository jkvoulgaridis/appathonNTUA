  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Viral myocarditis has been recognized as a cause of congestive heart failure, however
      diagnosis and treatment represents a challenging process. Recently, there is an increasing
      frequency of different cardiotropic viruses in the clinical setting of myocarditis. The
      introduction of the new molecular techniques in analysing the etiologic agent of acute
      myocarditis has enhanced significantly the knowledge on the molecular epidemiology of these
      viruses. The etiology of patients admitted to our university hospital remains unclear. It is
      therefore important to identify the aetiology associated with myocardial infections.

      The purpose of the present study is to analyze the prevalence of a broad spectrum of
      cardiotropic viruses, including enteroviruses, adenoviruses and parvo B19 virus, in adults
      with suspected myocarditis with special reference to B19 virus due to its increasing
      prevalence nowadays.

      The results of this study will provide a very important information for the prevalent
      infectious viral agents in our university hospital which will guide treatment protocol.

      Objectives

        1. There are almost no data regarding the relative prevalence of viral pathogens associated
           with myocarditis and the demographic and clinical features related to these infections
           in Egypt. Therefore, our main interest is to determine the prevalence of the most common
           viruses in clinically relevant (i.e., hospitalization- requiring) patients with acute or
           chronic myocarditis, using highly sensitive molecular techniques as the diagnostic tool.

        2. Our second aim is to determine the distribution of mono- and coinfections between these
           viral agents.

        3. Finally, to correlate between the microbiological findings in this study and patient
           characteristics including age, sex, clinical features, regional distribution, and degree
           of urbanization (determined on the basis of the size of the city and the density of the
           population) of the patients.

    <description>Endomyocardial biopsies will be stained with Masson's trichrome as well as Giemsa and examined by light microscopy. For immunohistology, tissue sections will be treated with an avidin-biotinimmunoperoxidase method (Vectastain-Elite ABC Kit, Vector, Burlingame, Calif), with application of the following monoclonal antibodies: CD3 (T cells; Novocastra Laboratories, Newcastle, UK), CD68 (macrophages, natural killer cells; DAKO, Hamburg, Germany), and HLA-DR-Î± (DAKO, Hamburg, Germany</description>
