    <textblock>
      Background: Obesity is one of the most important health problems worldwide, several factors
      related to lifestyle as physical inactivity and unbalanced diets increase their development.
      This condition is characterized by low-chronic inflammation by excess of adipose tissue. The
      apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC) protein
      is part of NLRP3 inflammasome, a complex related to inflammation and metabolic alterations.

      Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of physical exercise program on ASC
      gene expression and inflammatory markers in obese adults.

      Methods: 37 obese individuals were randomized to exercise-diet group or diet-group during a
      4-month follow-up period. The dietary evaluation was analyzed by Nutritionist Pro software.
      Body composition was evaluated by bioimpedance (InBody 370). All biochemical determinations
      were analyzed by dry chemistry (Vitros 350). ASC messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression
      was performed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using Taqman probes and by the
      2-ΔΔcq quantification method. Cytokine levels was performed using the Bio-PlexPro™
      HumanTh17Cytokine Assays (MagPix) panel. Statistical analysis was performed with Statistical
      Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) v.22 software.

      A randomized clinical trial was conducted in the Institute of Translational Nutrigenetics and
      Nutrigenomics, Department of Molecular Biology in Medicine, Health Sciences Center, at the
      University of Guadalajara, Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico, from February of 2018 to February of
      2019. All participants were recruited through flyers and social media invitations. Sample
      size was determined according to the mean difference formula for clinical trials. To achieve
      a statistical power of 80% and an alpha of 5%, a sample size of 13 participants in each study
      group was required. However, 37 obese individuals who met the selection criteria were
      randomized in exercise-diet group or diet-group. Blood sample, height and weight were
      measured after 8-12 hour fast and wearing light clothes. The participants in the
      exercise-diet group were cited in the Respiratory Unit of the University of Guadalajara with
      the indication of not consuming caffeine, tobacco or energy drinks 24 hours before the test,
      and not having eaten food at least two hours before the Astrand-rhyming Test. This study was
      approved by the Ethics and Biosafety Committee of the Health Sciences Center, University of
      Guadalajara (registry number CUCS/CINV/0476/18). The procedures were in accordance with this
      institution's guidelines and all the participants signed a written consent-informed.

    <description>The participants who performed exercise-diet intervention performed an Astrand-rhyming test before and after the exercise program intervention. Participants followed a progressive exercise-program during four months according to initial physical fitness. The main exercises consisted of improving aerobic, speed and resistance performance. During all single sessions, breathlessness and fatigue were measured using 0 to10 Borg scale. A personal trainer certified by American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) supervised three sessions per week, the other two unsupervised training days the subjects were given the detailed training program to do in house/park. And also, this group received a diet intervention that consisted of a 20 percentage reduction of total energy expenditure estimated by the Mifflin formula with a nutrients distribution as follows: 50% carbohydrates, 30% lipids, and 20% proteins.</description>
