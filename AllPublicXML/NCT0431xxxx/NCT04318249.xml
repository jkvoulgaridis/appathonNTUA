  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, 30-day research study that is exploring the effects of two simplified
      mindfulness interventions in lung cancer patients aimed to improve their sleep quality and
      anxiety regarding sleep. The investigators will be enrolling a total of 20 patients who have
      insomnia symptoms. Patients will use a behavioral intervention to help with their sleep.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to implement and examine the outcomes of a simplified relaxation
      intervention, Assisted Relaxation Therapy (ART), for lung cancer patients who experience
      insomnia symptoms and other sleep difficulties. This intervention includes using a smartphone
      application called mPhenomic to monitor adherence to the study protocol. A variety of surveys
      will be used to track the interventions' efficacy throughout the study. To test these
      interventions, the investigators will recruit participants (n=20) from a weekly oncology
      patient list located within the University of Pennsylvania. Participants with a history of
      lung cancer who are recruited into the study must have a smartphone. Participants will use
      the ART intervention over the course of 2 weeks and will receive surveys at enrollment (D0),
      end of intervention (D14) and 2 weeks post-intervention (D30). Missing data will be handled
      using imputation methods. The investigators will analyze the data using statistical programs
      to determine progress throughout the study.

    <intervention_model_description>This will be conducted as a parallel group, single-blinded pilot study for reducing insomnia among lung cancer patients. All subjects will participate in some form of insomnia treatment over a fourteen-day period. Participants eligible and enrolled in the study will be randomized into one of the two arms, which consist of the two different ART. Randomization and survey baseline measurements from eligible participants will occur on day -1 and the intervention period will last until day fourteen. On day thirty, two weeks post intervention(s), surveys will be emailed to participants to track any change in sleep quality, respiratory quality, and perception of sleep.</intervention_model_description>
