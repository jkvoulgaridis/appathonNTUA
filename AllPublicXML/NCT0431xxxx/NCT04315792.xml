  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 8 mg endoxifen in the study
      population. As endoxifen represents a totally new class of drugs in the treatment of the
      bipolar disorder, it is essential to compare the drug against placebo to rule out the
      psychological influence upon study results. More so given the risks to patients and their
      communities from a medication whose efficacy has not been thoroughly evaluated against a
      placebo control. Thus, Endoxifen will be compared to placebo to demonstrate that the test
      product is active and to establish that the study is sufficiently sensitive to detect
      differences between the investigational products.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Protein Kinase C (PKC) plays a major role in the regulation of both pre and postsynaptic
      neurotransmission. Excessive activation of PKC results in symptoms related to bipolar
      disorder. PKC exists as a family of closely related subspecies, has a heterogeneous
      distribution in the brain (with particularly high levels in presynaptic nerve terminals), and
      plays a crucial role in the regulation of neuronal excitability, neurotransmitter release,
      regulation of synaptic plasticity and various forms of learning and memory. Research findings
      show that the PKC pathway can be used as a target for developing treatment strategies for
      bipolar disorder. Endoxifen exhibited activity in inhibiting the PKC activity.

      In patients with acute bipolar mania, rapid reduction of symptoms is a key treatment goal;
      however, there is also a need for effective maintenance of effect treatment beyond the period
      of acute stabilization. The current study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of Endoxifen
      in Bipolar I Disorder patients against a control placebo arm.
