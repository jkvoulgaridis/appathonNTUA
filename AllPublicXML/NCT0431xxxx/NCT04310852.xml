  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently there has been a growing interest in the role of subchondral bone in knee arthritis,
      both in its etiology and evolution and in its clinical significance. It has now been widely
      demonstrated that changes in the subchondral bone can develop both as a cause and as a
      consequence of joint degeneration and it is now accepted in the scientific community that the
      presence of these changes is of clinical importance, causing pain and an inflammatory state
      that can contribute to the evolution of arthrosis arthropathy. Recently the use of
      mesenchymal cells obtained from the bone marrow has been proposed for the treatment of
      gonarthrosis by intra-articular injections. Even more recently, treatments have been studied
      and proposed for the treatment of the bone-cartilage interface in knees affected by
      osteoarthrosis, using autologous bone marrow concentrate, with promising results.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic degenerative and disabling disease of joint joints, in which
      metabolic impairment between the synthesis and degradation of cartilage and subchondral bone,
      involves progressive destruction of joint tissue accompanied by chronic pain and synovial
      inflammation. Currently, available therapies are mostly palliative and designed to mask
      symptoms. The study proposed here has been constructed on the basis of the scientific
      evidence reported in the literature regarding the etiology and the treatment of OA. As
      recently demonstrated, the use of mesenchymal cells obtained from the bone marrow was
      effective in the treatment of gonarthrosis by intra-articular injections. Even more recently,
      treatments aimed at treating the bone-cartilage interface in arthritic knees have been
      studied and proposed. In the 2016 Val et al. pilot study, stem cells from the tibial bone
      marrow injected into the percutaneous bone-cartilage interface were described as a new
      therapeutic approach to osteoarthritis of the knee. This procedure is able to repair
      cartilage by stimulating subchondral bone angiogenesis and alleviating ischemia associated
      with arthritic knee pain, generating extremely positive outcomes in patients with low-grade
      osteoarthritis and relieving long-term pain in patients with high-grade osteoarthritis. This
      treatment is also able to induce differentiation and proliferation of chondrocytes, leading
      to an increase in the size of the intra-articular matrix, demonstrating an effective and
      minimally invasive treatment for the resolution of OA. The study described here aims to
      evaluate the potential effectiveness of the synergistic effect of both injections, with the
      aim of improving the symptomatic picture of patients with OA of the knee. Combining
      percutaneous injections at the bone-cartilage interface with intra-articular injections will
      provide proven results for the use of stem cells such as cartilage repair, increased
      vascularity, and pain reduction, in both compartments of the knee affected by OA. The
      positive effects reported in the literature regarding intra-articular injections will be
      combined with those reported with respect to the use of percutaneous injections at the
      cartilage, in order to obtain a better outcome in the treatment of the disease than in
      previous studies.

    <description>The treatment will be carried out in the operating room under ordinary hospitalization and involves the application of 9 ml of autologous bone marrow concentrate in the knee affected by arthrosis. Specifically, 3 ml will be applied at the level of the bone-cartilage interface of the femur, 3 ml at the level of the bone-cartilage interface of the tibia, and 3 ml will be injected into the joint for a simultaneous action also at the level of the cartilage. To obtain the necessary amount of bone marrow concentrate, an aspirate of bone marrow will be taken from the iliac crest (60 ml) and homolateral tibia (30 ml) of the patient and concentrated by BioCue Concentration Kit, company Zimmer biomet, and centrifuge. This autologous bone marrow concentrate will be injected by means of the Perfuse at the level of the tibial and femoral bone-cartilage interface of the percutaneous arthrosis affected compartment under radiographic control.</description>

      The portion of bone marrow concentrate of each patient not used for treatment will be sent to
      the biotechnology laboratory applied to the Orthopedics of the Institute Galeazzi and used
      for histological and molecular analysis. In particular, each sample will be characterized in
      terms of vitality, proliferation, cellular senescence, immunophenotype and differentiative
      capacity towards the osteogenic and chondrogenic lines. In addition, for each sample, the
      immunomodulatory activity exerted by the paracrine way in the presence of human chondrocytes
      stimulated by inflammatory conditions will be evaluated
