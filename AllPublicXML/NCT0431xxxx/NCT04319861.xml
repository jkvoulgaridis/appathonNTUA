  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we retrospectively reviewed clinical data of patients who were treated with an
      anal fistula plug for trans-sphincteric anal fistulas, and evaluated the long-term
      therapeutic effect of an anal fistula plug and the risk factors impacting anal fistula
      healing. In addition, we assessed the effects of post-operative changes on anal function, as
      well as the risk factors affecting anal function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of anal fistulas, especially involving signiÔ¨Åcant anal sphincters, continues to
      represent a challenge for surgeons. Surgery has been the mainstay of treatment, and the ideal
      goal of anal fistula treatment is to obliterate the fistulous tract, while preserving the
      anal sphincter and avoiding fecal incontinence. The anal fistula plug is a sphincter-sparing
      procedure that uses biological substances to close an anorectal fistula. Several studies have
      preliminarily shown that the anal fistula plug had advantages of simple and repeatable
      application, preservation of sphincter integrity, minimal patient discomfort, and subsequent
      surgical options if needed. The healing rate of anal fistula plug varied widely, which range
      from 14% to 88%, and no significant effect on anal function in the short term. Therefore,
      long-term observation and a large sample size are needed to evaluate the long-term healing
      rate of an anal fistula plug, and the effect on anal function. The aim of this study is to
      assess the long-term therapeutic effect of an anal fistula plug in patients with
      trans-sphincteric fistula-in-ano, as well as the impact on anal function.

    <description>The anal fistula plug procedure was performed as followings. A fistula probe was used to identify fistula tracts, and internal and external openings. Gentle mechanical debridement was performed with a blunt curette to remove the necrotic tissue with care not to enlarge the track, then hydrogen peroxide and sterile saline were used to repeatedly to irrigate the fistula. The anal fistutla plug was filled into the fistula, and sutured with a figure-of-eight 2-to-0 Vicryl suture to ensure the plug was fixed in the internal opening of the fistula, avoiding the anal fistula plug being extruded. Trimming the plug at the external fistula and the external opening was left open to ensure adequate drainage.</description>
