  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with chronic ankle instability (CAI) display neuromuscular deficits such as
      altered control of posture and gait when compared with healthy controls. These deficits may
      be attributed to muscle inhibition occurring after a surrounding joint structure has been
      damaged. Functional electrical stimulation (FES) is the application of high-intensity
      intermittent electrical stimuli to generate muscle contractions that may overcome inhibition,
      and which is coupled with a functional task such as gait.

      The current study aims to investigate the short and immediate effects of FES on gait
      parameters and postural control in subjects with CAI. Prior to intervention, treadmill gait
      will be evaluated using a motion analysis system, and postural control will be evaluated in a
      series of tests that measure balance, reaction time to ankle perturbation and stabilization
      ability after jump-landing. Then, a 20 minutes gait training with an FES device will be
      applied. Immediate effects of the training on gait parameters will be assessed. For
      medium-term effects evaluation, subjects will return for additional 7 training sessions (2
      per week for 4 weeks), following by a complete measurements acquisition as prior to
      intervention. At six months follow-up, subjects will be contacted for collecting subjective
      outcomes.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Star excursion balance test (SEBT) score</measure>
    <time_frame>through intervention completion, approximately at 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The SEBT has been previously described as a postural control test that can differ between subjects with CAI and healthy controls. The test is performed with the subjects standing barefoot in the middle of a grid formed by eight tape measures extending out at 45Â° from each other. While the subject is balancing on one leg that is placed in the middle of the grid, the other leg has to reach as far as possible in each direction. The reached distance in centimeters is recorded, with the greater distance representing better postural stability. An average scores is calculated and normalized to the length of the subject's leg in centimeters.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to stabilization (TTS)</measure>
    <time_frame>through intervention completion, approximately at 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>TTS is the time required to normalize ground reaction forces (GRF) after following a jump-landing. To measure TTS, subjects will be required to perform a single-leg drop-jump from a 40-cm box onto a force plate (Kistler, Switzerland) and keep balancing on a single leg for 20 seconds. GRF recordings will be analyzed to determine TTS in seconds in the ML and AP planes, as was previously described. Shorter duration demonstrates better postural stability. Subjects will be allowed at least 3 practice trials, following by 5 successful jumps landings. A rest period of 30 seconds will be allowed between jumps. If a subject will not be able to stabilize for at least 20 seconds, the trial will be repeated.
Lower values indicate better postural control.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Peroneal reaction time (PRT)</measure>
    <time_frame>through intervention completion, approximately at 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>PRT is the time duration between and ankle inversion perturbation and beginning of peroneal muscle activation which is recognized using EMG. Subjects will stand on an inversion stimulator. In an unknown time, a sudden inversion perturbation will occur. Time measurement between perturbation time and muscle activation time is measured in seconds.
Lower values indicate better postural control.</description>

Score ranges between 0-100. Higher scores represent higher levels of function, with score of 100 represents no disability.</description>
