      Explore the sensorially of the premature newborn that is fundamental to adapting the care
      environment to these hospitalized babies

  <detailed_description>

      Indeed, the challenge is to offer them an environment adapted to their sensory skills, so as
      not to alter their development.

      This is in line with the customized care development, better known as the Anglo-Saxon term of
      Neonatal Individualised Developmental Care and Assessment Program.

      The aim is thus to promote later the cognitive development of these children

the Brunet-Lezine scale : it is a global development quotient (QD) which is calculated and which corresponds to a standardized score (average of 100). Higher score corresponds to better child development</description>
