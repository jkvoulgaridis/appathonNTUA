  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of the proposal is to improve capacity for detection and management of
      non-communicable diseases and geriatric syndromes in the aging HIV population in sub-Saharan
      Africa

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The establishment and scale up of solid and sustainable HIV programs in sub-Saharan Africa
      (SSA) has led to a reduction in mortality and morbidity from HIV related opportunistic
      infections and some HIV related cancers. This improved survival has resulted in two
      phenomena: the first is the surfacing of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in the HIV
      population, especially in those on long-term ART, and the second is increased longevity
      leading to increasing numbers of elderly HIV infected individuals

        All patients 60 years and above at IDI are referred to the elderly specialist clinic, which
        is run once a week by a physician, therefore study participants will be identified from
        this clinic. Enrolment into the Geriatric cohort will be offered to all patients 60 years
        and above attending attending their monthly routine clinic visit at the elderly specialist
        clinic will be approached by the study staff, will be given detailed information and be
        asked if they are willing to participate.
