  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Griseofulvin is an antifungal agent used in treatment of Dermatophytosis caused by
      Microsporum spp. (species), Trichophyton spp., Epidermophyton spp., where topical therapy is
      considered inappropriate or has failed. Approved dose of Griseofulvin in Adults (greater than
      or equal to 50 kg) in India is 500 to 1,000 mg daily, but not less than 10 mg/kg bodyweight
      daily. As per the World health organization (WHO) guidance, Griseofulvin belongs to
      Biopharmaceutical Classification System (BCS) Class 2 (&quot;low&quot; solubility-&quot;high&quot; permeability).
      A Bioequivalence (BE) study will be conducted in India to estimate in vivo behavior
      (Pharmacokinetic characteristics) of Griseofulvin 500 tablets and dose proportionality study
      for Griseofulvin 250 mg and 500 mg tablets. This is an open label, randomized, balanced,
      three treatment period, three sequence, single dose, crossover study that will evaluate the
      bioequivalence of Griseofulvin tablets 500 mg test product (T1) versus Griseofulvin tablets
      500 mg reference product (R) as well as dose proportionality of Griseofulvin tablets 250 mg
      test product (T2) with Griseofulvin tablets 500 mg T1 in healthy, adult participants under
      fed conditions. Eligible participants enrolled will be randomized to either of the three
      treatment sequence periods, T1T2R, T2RT1 or RT1T2 according to 1:1:1 ratio. The total
      duration of clinical phase will be approximately 20 days from Day-1 to Day 19 including a
      washout period of at least 7 days (not more than 14 days) for each treatment period. A total
      of 36 healthy, adult participants will be enrolled in this study and the above mentioned
      doses of Griseofulvin will be administered under fed conditions. Participants will be
      followed up 5 days after last dosing.
