      The goal of the study is to determine the effect of classical music on participants pain and
      anxiety associated with lidocaine administration during routine standard of care dermatologic
      procedures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized, unblinded, prospective, single center clinical trial. The purpose
      of the study is to determine the effect of a music intervention in reducing anxiety and pain
      from local anesthesia administration in subjects undergoing a routine, standard of care
      dermatologic procedure. The study population will consist of 100 adult subjects undergoing a
      dermatologic procedure on the head and neck. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 into either the
      placebo or music intervention group.

      Individuals randomized into the placebo (P) group will undergo a set of standardized steps
      prior to local anesthesia injection. Other factors such as skin preparation technique, needle
      size, anesthesia temperature, use of unbuffered solution, needle angle and approximate depth
      of injection will remain standardized. Individuals randomized into the music intervention
      (MI) group will undergo the same set of standardized steps and then be played Frederic
      Chopin's piano sonatas through a headphone device prior to injection. After local anesthesia
      administration, subjects in both treatment arms will be asked to fill out a demographics,
      pain and anxiety questionnaire.
