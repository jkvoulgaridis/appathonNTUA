    <textblock>
      This trial collects multiple tissue and blood samples, along with medical information, from
      cancer patients. The &quot;Cancer Moonshot Biobank&quot; is a longitudinal study. This means it
      collects and stores samples and information over time, throughout the course of a patient's
      cancer treatment. By looking at samples and information collected from the same people over
      time, researchers hope to better understand how cancer changes over time and over the course
      of medical treatments.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To support current and future investigations into drug resistance and sensitivity and
      other National Cancer Institute (NCI)-sponsored cancer research initiatives through the
      procurement and distribution of multiple longitudinal biospecimens and associated data from a
      diverse group of cancer patients who are undergoing standard of care treatment at NCI
      Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) sites.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To provide a service of value to study participants and their medical providers through
      the performance of a molecular profiling assay on tumor samples in a Clinical Laboratory
      Improvement Act (CLIA)-certified laboratory and reporting of results to physicians and
      patients that they may opt to use in clinical management, including analysis of data for
      acquired resistance mechanisms.

      II. To enable the development of patient-derived models such as cell lines and xenografts for
      cancer researchers through the provision of biospecimens from 20% of study participants to
      the NCI's Patient Derived Models Repository (PDMR), a national resource available to
      investigators.

      III. To develop and implement robust approaches in patient and provider engagement to improve
      understanding of biobanking and its relationship to cancer research and increase
      representation of minority and underserved study participants in cancer research.

      IV. To develop increased capabilities in United States (U.S.) community hospitals and clinics
      for contribution to cancer research through biobanking activities.

      V. To enable secondary research generated from the project through deposition of data in
      public repositories such as Cancer Research Data Commons (CRDC), The Cancer Imaging Archive
      (TCIA) and database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGAP), including clinical, radiology and
      pathology data with an emphasis on treatment response and outcome data.

      VI. To provide residual biospecimens and associated data from the project to the cancer
      research community.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo collection of tissue and blood samples prior to initiation of treatment,
      during treatment, and at disease progression. Patients with hematological malignancies also
      undergo collection of bone marrow and cerebral spinal fluid at the same time points. Archival
      blood and tissue, as well as bone marrow of patients with hematological malignancies, is also
      collected, if available. Patient medical records are reviewed, and data is collected for at
      least 10 years.

             small cell lung cancer, metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, stage IV
             gastroesophageal cancer, stage III/IV melanoma, newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia
             or treatment refractory multiple myeloma, is undergoing standard of care therapy per
             National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines and has consented to provide
             longitudinal biospecimens

          -  Patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) 0 or 1
             may be enrolled retrospectively (i.e. at time of progression) if archival material is
             submitted that contains the cancer type for which the participant is enrolled and that
             was collected up to 5 years prior to initiation of a therapy, assuming that no
             intervening molecular targeted or immunotherapies were administered. Patients with a
             PS of 2 may be enrolled only at the discretion of the treating physician and
             radiologist

          -  Patients must have tumor amenable to image guided or direct vision biopsy and be
             willing and able to undergo a tumor biopsy for molecular profiling. The biopsy must
             not be associated with a significant risk of severe or major complications or death.
             In particular, endoscopic, open or laparoscopic surgical procedures are not to be
             performed to provide research biospecimens. However, research biospecimens may be
             provided if the patient needs to undergo such procedures for clinical reasons. Severe
             or major complications are considered to be those:

               -  Requiring therapy, minor hospitalization (more than overnight but &lt; 48 hours
                  [h]).

               -  Requiring major therapy; unplanned increase in level of care, prolonged
                  hospitalization &gt; 48 h.

               -  Resulting in permanent adverse sequelae

               -  Resulting in death

               -  The following tumors may be collected only when patients will be undergoing a
                  procedure due to medical necessity during which the tissue may be collected and
                  not for the sole purpose of the clinical study:

                    -  Brain biopsies: ONLY if the patient has medical necessity for craniotomy for
                       clinical care

                    -  Mediastinal, laparoscopic, gastrointestinal, or bronchial endoscopic
                       biopsies: ONLY to be obtained incidentally to a clinically necessary
                       procedure

          -  Study participants with colorectal cancer (CRC), prostate cancer (PCA),
             gastroesophageal cancer (GEC) and melanoma (MEL) may contribute samples for Patient
             Derived Models (PDM) development if they meet specific Patient Derived Models
             Repository (PDMR) eligibility criteria

          -  Study participants with lung cancer (LCA) and treated with standard of care EGFR, ALK,
             PD-1 and PD-L1 antagonists and multiple myeloma (MML) may contribute samples directly
             to Moonshot investigators if they meet specific Drug Resistance and Sensitivity
             Network (DRSN) eligibility criteria

          -  To ensure that individuals who experience diminished decision making capacity during
             the course of their cancer treatment are eligible, consent may be provided by a
             legally authorized representative (LAR) in accordance with 45 Code of Federal
             Regulations (CFR) 46.102(i). This protocol is minimal risk

          -  NCI PDMR AND DRSN INCLUSION CRITERIA

          -  Newly diagnosed patients with no prior treatment; OR patients with clinical and/or
             radiologic evidence of disease progression

          -  Patients who are currently or have previously enrolled in an oncology interventional
             clinical trial

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness that in the physician's assessment would pose undue
             risk for biopsy

          -  If the patient is on chronic anticoagulation treatment, they must be able and willing
             to have this treatment discontinued for the biopsy. Discontinuation procedures will be
             those of the treating site
