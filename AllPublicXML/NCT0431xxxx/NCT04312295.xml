  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was to evaluate the effects of ACP simulation-based communication training program
      (ACP-SCT program) for nurses to discuss ACP with chronic kidney disease patients
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The ACP-SCT program was including three stages, as follows Stage I: To discuss ACP knowledge
      and law Objective: Opportunity to share experiences, and develop a mutual understanding of
      the the challenge of ACPdiscussing with CKD patients.

      Stage II: communication skills section and Feedback section Objective: 1. To provide a
      structured approach to managing ACP discussions. 2. Opportunity to practice communication
      skills in a safe environment 3. Opportunity to discuss their experiences of the training
      program, and reflect future on their own practice and experience.

    <description>To evaluate the change of knowledge score for nurses from start of training program to end of training program 3 month later. Nurses' knowledge of discussing ACP will measure using the ACP knowledge Scale developed for this study. This Scale consisting of 20 items; each item consisted of a statement for which a participant could answer ''Yes'' to give 1 point, ''No'' or ''don't know'' to get 0 point. A higher scores indicates more knowledge. Data will analysis using SPSS 22.0 statistical software. Descriptive statistics are calculating as frequencies with percentages and means with standard deviation. Generalized estimating equation (GEE) methods with exchangeable working covariance structure will use to examine group differences in ACP knowledge outcomes, adjusting for changes over time. The GEE provides unbiased estimates of intervention effects.</description>

    <description>To evaluate the change of confidence score for nurses from start of training program to end of training program 3 month later. Nurses' self-confidence of communication skills in discussing ACP will measure using the ACP Confidence Scale developed for this study. The instrument consists of 12 items with response options from 0 (not confident at all) to 10(very confident), reflecting an individual's level of confident; higher scores indicates greater confidence. Data will analysis using SPSS 22.0 statistical software. Descriptive statistics are calculating as frequencies with percentages and means with standard deviation. Generalized estimating equation (GEE) methods with exchangeable working covariance structure will use to examine group differences in ACP confidence outcomes, adjusting for changes over time.
