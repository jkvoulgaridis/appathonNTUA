  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although acute rheumatic fever (ARF) has declined in Europe and North America in incidence
      over the past 4 to 6 decades, the disease remains one of the most important causes of
      cardiovascular morbidity and mortality especially in the developing countries that are home
      to the majority of the world's population, Incidence rates in these countries still reach
      epidemic levels.

      The Jones criteria, used for guidance in the diagnosis of ARF since 1944, were last modified
      by the American Heart Association (AHA) in 1992. They were reconfirmed in principle at an
      AHA-sponsored workshop in 2000. and historically have represented the clinical standard to
      establish the diagnosis of ARF. However, in the past few years, developments in several areas
      have prompted reexamination of the traditional Jones criteria. For example, the limited
      diagnostic role for echocardiography in the diagnosis of carditis as expressed in the Jones
      criteria revision of 1992 is a major area of focus. This position may no longer be
      appropriate, because echocardiographic techniques and applications, including quantitative
      Doppler and color flow mapping, have evolved worldwide during the past 2 decades. Other
      national and regional guidelines for the diagnosis of ARF have recently included the use of
      echocardiography/Doppler methodologies. Numerous studies from a broad range of clinical
      circumstances have suggested that there be more widespread use of echocardiography as a way
      to diagnose carditis even in the absence of overt clinical findings (&quot;subclinical carditis&quot;).
      Furthermore, echocardiography has become a cornerstone in worldwide screening programs to
      evaluate the prevalence of rheumatic heart disease (RHD).

      People with a history of RF are at a high risk of recurrent attacks and of developing RHD
      following streptococcal throat infection. Giving penicillin to these people can prevent
      recurrent attacks of RF and subsequent RHD.

      Secondary prophylaxis with benzathine penicillin G (BPG) is the only scientifically proven
      strategy to control RHD. It is recommended to apply a 2-weekly LAP regimen in the first few
      years after the acute episode of RF especially in high risk communities. This can then be
      followed by a 2-weekly LAP regimen in winter and a 3-weekly regimen in summers in the
      subsequent years. Decisions to stop secondary prophylaxis should be based on regular clinical
      assessment.

        This study will be conducted throughout one year in cardiology outpatient clinic of AUCH.
        It will include all available cases who were diagnosed as rheumatic fever with the
        previously inclusion criteria.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients' age ranging from 5 to 18 years old.

          2. Patients previously diagnosed with rheumatic fever (not definitely based on The Jones
             criteria for diagnosis of rheumatic fever).

          3. Patients receiving LAP according to their weight (the regimen of secondary prevention
             of rheumatic fever was 600,000 units LAP for patients weighing 25 kg or less and 1.2
             million units for patients weighing more than 25 kg) every 2 weeks in winter and 3
             weeks in summer, regardless of age.

          4. Patients exhibiting good compliance with LAP treatment (for at least one year).

          5. Patients on LAP for other causes than RF such as those with raised anti streptolysin O
             titre , chronic tonsillitis.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who developed penicillin allergy during prophylaxis.

          2. Patients who refused to continue prophylaxis with LAP.

          3. Patients on oral penicillin.
