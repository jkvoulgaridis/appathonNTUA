      This is a single arm, compassionate use study with 30 patients for leronlimab (PRO 140)
      combined with a treatment of physician's choice (TPC) in patients with CCR5+ mTNBC.

      Leronlimab (PRO 140) will be administered subcutaneously as weekly dose of 350 mg until
      disease progression or intolerable toxicity. Treatment of Physician's Choice (TPC) is defined
      as one of the following single-agent chemotherapy drugs administrated according to local
      practice: eribulin, gemcitabine, capecitabine, paclitaxel, nab-paclitaxel, vinorelbine,
      ixabepilone, or carboplatin. The selected treatment should be administered as per the dosing
      schedule included on the package insert.

      In this study, patients will be evaluated for tumor response approximately every 3 months or
      according to institution's standard practice by CT, PET/CT or MRI with contrast (per treating
      investigator's discretion) using the same method as at baseline. Tumor measurements will be
      done using RECIST v1.1.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Must have a histologically confirmed diagnosis of TNBC. Must demonstrate HER-2
             negative (IHC 0, 1+, or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) negative and ER&lt; 1%,
             and PR &lt; 1%, per ASCO/CAP criteria);

          2. Demonstrate CCR5 + by IHC (&gt;10% of primary or metastatic tumor cells shows membranous
             staining and/or high predominance of CCR5+ tumor-infiltrating leukocytes completed at
             the reference laboratory).

          3. Be willing to provide tissue from a newly obtained core or excisional biopsy of a
             tumor lesion (in case archival tissue is not available);

          4. Subjects with locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer who have been treated with
             ≥ 3 previous chemotherapy drugs (including neo/adjuvant setting) and had progressed or
             were intolerant to the latest chemotherapy. Previous treatment under neo/adjuvant
             setting must have included an anthracycline and a taxane, unless the patient was not
             suitable for these treatments.

             Note: Patients progressed on atezolizumab or other checkpoint inhibitor will be
             eligible for participation in the study.

          5. Patients must have measurable disease based on RECIST v1.1;

          6. Female patients, ≥ 18 years of age;

          8. Life expectancy of at least 6 months;

          9. Patients must have adequate organ and bone marrow function within 28 days prior to
             registration, as defined below:

               -  leukocytes ≥ 3,000/mcL;

               -  absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcL;

               -  platelets ≥ 100,000/mcL;

               -  total bilirubin: within normal institutional limits;

               -  AST(SGOT) &amp;ALT(SPGT) ≤ 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal (ULN)
                  (applicable to all patients, irrespective of liver disease or metastasis); and
                  creatinine: within normal institutional limits.

         10. Clinically normal resting 12-lead ECG at Screening Visit or, if abnormal, considered
             not clinically significant by the Principal Investigator.

         11. Females of child-bearing potential (FOCBP) and males must agree to use two medically
             accepted methods of contraception with hormonal or barrier method of birth control, or
             abstinence, prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation and for 60
             days after the last dose of study drug (Refer to Appendix 1). Should a female patient
             become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she
             should inform her treating physician immediately. NOTE: A FOCBP is any woman

             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator;
