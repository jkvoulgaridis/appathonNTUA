  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The STI-6129-001 study is a three-stage, multicenter, open-label, dose-finding, phase 1
      trial. It is designed primarily to identify the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of STI-6129
      by assessing the safety, preliminary efficacy and pharmacokinetics of this
      anti-CD38-Duostatin 5.2 antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) for the treatment of relapsed or
      refractory systemic AL amyloidosis.

      The patients that will be treated with STI-6129 in this trial are relapsed or refractory
      systemic AL amyloidosis patients who have received prior lines of treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is composed of three dosing plan stages. The initial stage of this trial is the
      dose-escalation stage. A standard dose-escalation 3+3 design will be utilized to identify a
      safe maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of STI-6129 in patients with relapsed or refractory
      systemic AL amyloidosis. After identification of the MTD, or the finding that the last dosing
      cohort is tolerated well (i.e., the maximum practical dose [MPD]), 12 patients will be
      enrolled to receive STI-6129 treatment at the MTD/MPD level to collect pharmacokinetic data (
      the pharmacokinetic (PK) stage) to model a treatment schedule that achieves a stable
      effective serum concentration. Results from the dose-escalation stage and the pharmacokinetic
      stage will be analyzed to develop a treatment dose/schedule for treating 30 additional
      patients enrolled in the expansion stage.

      Each patient enrolled will receive up to three 3-week cycles of STI-6129. After the treatment
      period, patients will be monitored bi-monthly for up to a year.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Confirmed diagnosis of AL amyloidosis by tissue biopsy of an involved organ, or a
             surrogate site such as abdominal fat demonstrating amyloid deposition by mass
             spectrometry

             amyloidosis is defined as the development of disease progression during therapy with
