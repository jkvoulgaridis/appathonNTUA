  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective case:control study examining the use of adjunctive bezlotoxumab to
      standard C. difficile infection (CDI) treatment compared to standard CDI treatment alone in
      patients with CDI seen in an academic medical center's specialty outpatient clinic.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This specialty clinic is a unique practice setting where patients with â‰¥1 recurrent CDI
      and/or refractory disease are referred. The study will represent real-world data on the
      clinical use of bezlotoxumab as adjunctive therapy in combination with vancomycin or
      fidaxomicin for the treatment of patients with recurrent CDI. Retrospective chart review will
      be conducted for patients who visited the specialty CDI clinic between 1/1/2005 through
      12/5/2019. Case patients will be defined as patients who have received bezlotoxumab 10 mg/kg
      intravenously in addition to standard CDI treatment. Controls will be defined as patients who
      have received only standard CDI treatment and will be enrolled in a 2:1 ratio to cases. The
      primary outcome is recurrence of CDI. Recurrence is defined as a new episode of C. difficile
      infection that occurs after the initial clinical cure of the baseline episode within 12 weeks
      of receipt of bezlotoxumab or standard CDI treatment. Clinical cure is defined as no diarrhea
      for 2 consecutive days after completion of standard-of-care CDI therapy. Recurrent CDI will
      be diagnosed via clinical signs and symptoms and CDI diagnostic assay.
