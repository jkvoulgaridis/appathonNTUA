  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Staphylococcus lugdunensis is a coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CoNS) belonging to the
      normal human skin flora. It is responsible for a wide variety of infections, such as skin and
      soft tissue infections, bone and joint infections, but also bacteraemia and endocarditis.
      Although the implication of S. lugdunensis in infectious diseases is proven, many questions
      remain both in terms of clinical and molecular epidemiology.

      In this context, INHOSTAL is the first prospective, bicentric study, which will
      comprehensively include all patients with S. lugdunensis infection (based on microbiological
      and clinical data) in two French university hospitals. The main objective of this study is
      thus to determine the incidence of S. lugdunensis infections in hospitalized patients.

      Moreover, the originality of this project is to compare the characteristics of S. lugdunensis
      infections with those of infections caused by S. aureus and other species of CoNS. Thereby,
      the clinical epidemiology of these infections will be compared (i.e. types of infection, mode
      of acquisition, host risk factors…).

      Finally, complete genome of all S. lugdunensis strains will be sequenced using Illumina
      technology and analyzed to describe the molecular epidemiology as well as the molecular
      mechanisms of antibiotic resistance (compared to antibiotic susceptibility evaluated by
      minimum inhibitory concentrations determined by Sensititre technique). This will enable to
      identify if predominant clones exist, and if some strains are spreading into the hospital.

      The duration of the study period will be 18 months, to allow the inclusion of a total of 300
      patients: 100 S. lugdunensis infections, as well as 100 S. aureus infections and 100 other
      species of CoNS infections.
