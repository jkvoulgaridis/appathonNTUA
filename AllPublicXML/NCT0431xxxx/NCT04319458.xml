  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although rates of depression are similar in Latinx populations compared to non-Latinx whites
      (NLW), there are significant disparities in service utilization. Mental health literacy -
      one's knowledge and attitudes about mental health and treatment-seeking - is a significant
      predictor of help-seeking behavior and likely contributes to mental health disparities among
      Latinx. Understanding ways to improve mental health literacy in Latinx populations is
      important to reducing these disparities. Health literacy interventions that are engaging,
      dramatic, and culturally-relevant, such as fotonovelas (graphic novels designed to change
      health-related knowledge and attitudes), show promise in changing mental health literacy in
      Latinx populations. However, little is known about how these interventions work and for whom
      they are most effective. Furthermore, although there is some evidence that fotonovelas can
      change mental health attitudes and intent to seek treatment, their impact on help-seeking
      behavior is less understood. The purpose of this study is to examine 1) if narrative and
      cultural elements of a fotonovela for Latinx with depression (i.e., transportation,
      identification, and social proliferation) are important mediators in changing mental health
      attitudes and help-seeking behaviors and 2) if factors such as rurality, acculturation,
      depression severity and logistic barriers to treatment moderate these relationships.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Latinx adults with depression are a particularly vulnerable population; although Latinx
      exhibit similar rates of depression to other racial/ethnic groups, they are less likely to
      seek treatment, are more likely to drop out of treatment, and thus experience greater
      chronicity of depression. This health disparity is likely due to a complex network of
      factors, but mental health literacy is one important contributing factor. Latinx are more
      likely to exhibit lower mental health literacy (including misconceptions, stigma, knowledge
      of treatment, etc.), which contributes to lower rates of treatment-seeking. Understanding how
      to engage Latinx in depression treatment by overcoming health literacy barriers is important
      in reducing health disparities.

      Entertainment-education interventions are those that use popular media to engage consumers
      and deliver health messages. These interventions hypothesized to be useful in targeting
      populations with health disparities in encouraging changes in health-related behavior through
      dramatic and culturally-relevant narrative elements. However, no study has tested these
      theorized mechanisms in helping to explain changes in health literacy and subsequent health
      behavior.

      This study will test the impact of a graphic novel about depression specifically for Latinx
      adults with depressive symptoms on theorized mediators, including transportation (feeling
      emotionally engaged in the narrative), identification (cultural relevance of characters,
      their language, and their appearance), and social proliferation (sharing of health
      information and mutual reinforcement of health behaviors). Furthermore, this study will test
      if these mediators help explain changes in mental health literacy and subsequent health
      behavior. Lastly, this study will test moderators of changes in mental health literacy and
      behavior to determine for whom the fotonovela has the largest impact.

    <description>The measure of help-seeking behavior is a checklist of behaviors that has been modified from the Service Assessment for Children and Adolescents. The measure assesses different sources of treatment, including psychiatrist, psychologist, social worker, spiritual advisors, ER visits, and traditional healers. Participants are asked if in the past 3 months, they have sought services from any of these professionals. Each item is binary (i.e., Yes or No). The total score will be calculated by summing the number of &quot;yes&quot; answers (i.e., the number of services used).</description>
