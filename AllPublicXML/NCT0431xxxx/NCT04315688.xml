    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to collect information on how Tresiba® works in real world
      patients with Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 (type 2 diabetes). Participants will get Tresiba® as
      prescribed by their doctor. The study will last for around 6 to 8 months. Participants will
      be asked questions about their health and their diabetes treatment as part of their normal
      doctor's appointment.
