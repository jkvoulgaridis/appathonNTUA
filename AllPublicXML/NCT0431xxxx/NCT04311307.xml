      Rationale: Glycogen storage disease type I (GSDI) is characterised by severe fasting
      intolerance, hypoketonemic hypoglycaemia, accumulation of glycogen and fat in the liver and
      kidneys. Two major subtypes are recognized: GSD type Ia (GSDIa), due to glucose 6-phosphatase
      defect (G6PC gene variants) and GSD type Ib (GSDIb) due to defect of glucose 6-phosphate
      transporter (SLC37A4 gene variants). Notably, GSDIa patients retain a limited capacity for
      endogenous glucose production (EGP). Despite several mechanisms for residual EGP have been
      proposed, the origin of residual EGP in GSDIa patients is unknown. Data from G6PC-deficient
      hepatocytes suggest that either increased glycogen debranching or lysosomal glycogen
      breakdown accounts for residual EGP in GSDIa.

      Medically prescribed diets are the cornerstone of management, but novel, innovative
      treatments are promising, such as adeno-associated virus vector serotype 8 (AAV8)-mediated
      gene therapy and messenger RNA (mRNA) therapy. Therefore, longitudinal monitoring of outcomes
      after therapeutic interventions in GSD Ia patients becomes warranted, for which nowadays (1)
      assessment of microsomal glucose-6-phosphatase activities ex vivo (necessitating invasive
      liver biopsies) and (2) execution of (invasive, clinical) fasting challenges in vivo are
      available. Theoretically, less-invasive monitoring may include the application of (3) stable
      isotope methods to quantify EGP, and (4) advanced continuous glucose monitoring in the home
      situation, but proper studies are lacking.

      Objectives: The primary objective is to test the feasibility of EGP quantification in adult
      GSDIa patients by stable isotopes after a single oral [6,6-2H2]glucose dose. Secondary
      objectives are to compare EGP assessed by a single oral [6,6-2H2]glucose dose (a) in GSDIa
      patients versus matched healthy participants, (b) in severe versus attenuated GSDIa patients,
      (c) in the pre-prandial state versus the fed state in GSDIa patients, (d) in the pre-prandial
      state versus the fed state in healthy participants, (e) in the controlled hospital setting
      versus the home setting in GSDIa patients, (f) in the controlled hospital setting versus the
      at home setting in healthy participants. In addition, the continuous glucose monitoring data
      from GSDIa patients versus matched healthy participants will be compared Study design: An
      investigator-initiated human pilot-study. Study population: Ten adult patients with GSDIa and
      ten age and gender-matched healthy participants.

      Interventions: Three experiments will be performed for each subject. During the first in
      hospital experiment, two oral [6,6-2H2]glucose loads will be performed 2 hours before
      breakfast and 10 minutes after lunch, respectively. The third oral [6,6-2H2]glucose load will
      be performed at home (random time). A starting dose of 1.25 grams of [6,6-2H2]glucose in the
      first three subjects (1 severe GSDIa, 1 attenuated GSDIa, 1 healthy control) will be
      administered. Based on the enrichment results in this group, the dose may be changed.
      Capillary blood samples will be collected on filter paper 10 times at specific time points
      after each oral [6,6-2H2]glucose load. During the experiments, subjects will be monitored by
      subcutaneous continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). For the GSDIa patients, the regular, strict
      dietary management will not be changed at any moment of the study.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The main study parameter is the EGP quantification assessed
      by measurement of blood [6,6-2H2]glucose enrichment. Secondary study parameters are glucose
      area under the curve, glucose clearance rate, glucose bioavailability, glucose apparent
      volume of distribution and CGM data.

      The trial is considered to be a low-risk study. To minimize the impact on quality of life and
      discomfort due to hospitalization and sample collections, two experiments will be conducted
      under controlled circumstances during a short hospital stay (&lt;24 hours) and one experiment
      will take place at home. The stable isotope that will be used is safe, normally metabolised
      and without any expected adverse effects; the dose of the stable isotope is relatively low
      and does not affect metabolism either. The blood tests will be conducted on capillary blood
      obtained by fingerstick (or fingerprick) and collected on filter paper as dried blood spots
      (DBS), before analysis. To increase safety, CGM will be offered throughout the study. For
      GSDIa patients, the results of this study may develop into methods to quantify glucose
      metabolism in a relative non-invasive mode, to assess outcomes after novel, innovative
      treatments, such as AAV8-mediated gene therapy and mRNA therapy.
