  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to implement a health prevention program for smokers or former smokers
      including early detection of lung cancer, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The clinical activity is completed by a pre-clinical
      evaluation of molecular bio-markers of early diagnosis of these diseases, with the aim of
      strengthening the sensitivity and specificity of the screening program.

      The project also includes a cost-effectiveness assessment to validate the feasibility of the
      program.

      Since lung cancer, CVD and COPD are among the deadliest smoking-related pathologies, the
      program includes actions aimed at raising awareness among primary care physicians, increasing
      the smoking cessation rate of participating subjects to improve quality of life.

    <measure>To implement the screening program combining lung cancer, CVD and COPD prevention</measure>
    <time_frame>from 10 Oct 2018 to 10 Oct 2021</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects with increased risk for lung cancer, selected through an epidemiological questionnaire, sign the informed consent and their blood is collected. They then undergo LDCT and an interview at the anti-smoking center. CTs presenting with at least one non-calcified nodule are managed according to dedicated diagnostic algorithm. Nodules indicative of lung cancer will be studied with preoperative diagnosis, with surgical resection preferably performed with a minimally invasive approach. Multimodality treatment is indicated in advanced stage of disease. Subjects with normal findings are scheduled for annuals CT scan for two additional years. Cardiovascular risk will be assessed with the use of the atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) score, recommended by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association, integrated with Reynold risk score and CAC score. The CAC score, calculated on LDCT, is used to quantify the presence of calcium through the coronary system.</description>

    <measure>Validation of circulating markers to enhance LDCT sensitivity and specificity of the screening for lung cancer, CVD and COPD early detection.</measure>
    <time_frame>from 10 Oct 2018 to 10 Oct 2021</time_frame>
    <description>Ten ml of blood is collected before LDCT, for plasma and white blood cells. For lung cancer patients, blood is collected before treatment, at 1-6-12 months after treatment, to analyse markers for minimal residual disease or early recurrence.
We will perform:
CTC identification and genomic analysis. Patients are considered CTCs positive based on cytopathology of the isolated cells and detection of characteristic malignant features.
Evaluation of Serum of PTX3, measured with an original sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
Circulating microRNA profiling. A custom panel of 6 specific microRNAs identified in a previous study on Karolinska cohort and correlating with increase/reduction risk of CVD Mayor adverse cardiovascular events MACE will be tested in 2000 patients.
IL-2, IL-8, CRP, IL-5 and Eosinophils analyses. Interleukin-2 and-8, C-reactive protein, interleukiine-5 and eosinophils concentrations in blood are measured with ELISA kits.</description>

    <measure>Cost benefit analysis of LC screening program</measure>
    <time_frame>from 10 Oct 2018 to 10 Oct 2021</time_frame>
    <description>Cost-benefit analysis of the prevention program. Direct and indirect costs associated with diagnosis and treatment of smoking-related diseases will be compared to those of a control group with disease detected after the appearance of pulmonary symptoms. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio will be evaluated in terms of QUALYS (quality of life adjusted years saved).</description>
