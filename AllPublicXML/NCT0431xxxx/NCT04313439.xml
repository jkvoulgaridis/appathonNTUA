  <brief_summary>

      obsessive beliefs in patients with aggressive obsessions is feasible and effective as an
      online treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder who presents with aggressive obsessions (also
      known as taboo thoughts e.g. fear of being a pedophile) and mental rituals have shown to
      respond less well to treatment. Thus, there is room for further innovation. The primary
      objective of this pilot study is to investigate if an internet-based cognitive therapy (I-CT)
      is feasible and effective in reducing the frequency and distress of aggressive obsessions.
      The study will also investigate if I-CT is associated with any significant side effects.
      Another objective of this study is to get a power estimate of the treatment effects for a
      subsequent randomized controlled study (RCT). This will be done by using an open pilot study
      with repeated measurements.

    <description>The treatment is an online cognitive therapy consisting of a structured self-help program over ten weeks, divided into eight modules, administered in an encrypted web platform. The program is based on the treatment manual &quot;The treatment of Obsessions&quot; by Stanley Rachman. In this treatment, the participant is recommended to perform daily exercises in order to identify and modify interpretations made about the importance of their obsessive thoughts. A designated therapist have email contact with the participant within the encrypted platform.</description>
