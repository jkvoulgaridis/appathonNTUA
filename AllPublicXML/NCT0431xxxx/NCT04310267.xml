  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate dentoskeletal changes concomitant with different three
      levels of force application for maxillary protraction in growing patients with skeletal class
      3 malocclusion.

      Nanda reported that numerous experimental studies on primates have shown orthopedic changes
      in response to extraoral forces; however, very few studies have made an attempt to analyze
      the different force variables and their relationship to facial sutures. In consideration of
      the variables, experimental and clinical studies were initiated in their laboratory in 1972.
      A study on protraction of midfacial bones on primates reported that the point of force
      application significantly influences the center of rotation of the maxilla in rhesus monkeys.
      Our unpublished data also show that centers of rotation are influenced by the magnitude of
      force. The study showed that the maxilla can be successfully protracted by means of carefully
      controlled forces.

      Based on the aforementioned data, we can hypothesize that the point of force application for
      maxillary protraction in relation to the center of resistance of maxilla could be utilized in
      order to correct skeletal class 3 malocclusions with different vertical dimension
      discrepancies.
