  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Pilot study will be a single-center, randomized, open-label, active-controlled trial.
      After CABG surgery using Radial Artery Grafts (RA-CABG) and signing the informed consent, all
      patients will be screened according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Estimated 100
      patients will be enrolled and randomized by ratio 1:1:1 to receive either Nicorandil (5mg tid
      po, n=34) or Diltiazem (180mg qd po, n=33) or Isosorbide Mononitrate (50mg qd po, n=33).
      Follow-up visits will be conducted at Day 7, 28, 84, 168 after surgery. The last evaluation
      of study endpoints and other adverse events will be at Day 168.

      The pilot study is designed to explore the angiography outcomes of grafts and cardiovascular
      outcomes of patients, as well as safety outcomes among different anti-spastic regimens after
      RA-CABG.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After having signed informed consent (Day 1-3), eligible subjects who have successfully
      received first RA-CABG surgery (Day 0) will be screened for enrollment. All subjects (about
      100 patients) will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio into 3 groups. Group A will receive oral
      Nicorandil (5mg tid) monotherapy; Group B will receive oral Diltiazem (180mg qd) monotherapy;
      and Group C will receive Isosorbide Mononitrate (50mg qd) monotherapy. Three groups will
      continue intervention treatment for 168 days (24 weeks) after RA-CABG surgery. All subjects
      will receive follow-up visits (clinic visit or phone visit) at Day 7, 28, 84, and 168.

      All subjects will receive first CCTA (or CAG) to evaluate the graft outcome at Day 7 and
      second CCTA (or CAG) to evaluate the graft outcome at Day 168 after RA-CABG surgery. And all
      subjects will be evaluated angina relief based on the Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS)
      angina grading and the Seattle Angina Questionnaire. And the time to first major adverse
      cardiovascular event (MACE), which include all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke
      and unplanned revascularization, will be collected. And other safety outcomes will be
      evaluated, including the rate of hypotension, the proportion of concomitant medications with
      ACEI/ARB/ARNI drugs and proportion of SAEs and concerned AEs.
