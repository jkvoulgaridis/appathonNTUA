  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study aiming to investigate the risks and consequences of
      naturalistic tabernanthe iboga exposure in a population with a history of head trauma, combat
      or blast exposure. We will assess the safety profile of the compound through psychological
      and cognitive testing. Participants will also have an MRI before and after their exposure to
      the compound, to examine if there are any brain changes associated with its use. Participants
      must independently schedule to receive this compound in other countries.
