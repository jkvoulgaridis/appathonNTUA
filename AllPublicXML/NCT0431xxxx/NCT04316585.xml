  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Plaque psoriasis is a chronic relapsing inflammatory skin disease that is characterized by
      keratinocyte hyper-proliferation and epidermal hyperplasia. Standard treatment for psoriasis
      generally requires long-term use of topical therapies, psoralen and ultraviolet A (PUVA),
      ultraviolet B (UVB) and/or systemic immunosuppressant therapies to achieve and maintain
      adequate disease control. This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind study conducted in
      participants with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. The study will evaluate the efficacy,
      safety, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics profile of 960 milligram (mg) GSK2982772
      administered as a once daily modified release (MR) formulation. Participants will be
      randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either 960 mg GSK2982772 or placebo for 12 weeks. The
      duration of the study, including Screening and follow-up, will be approximately 21 weeks for
      each participant.

             informed consent..

          -  Diagnosis of plaque psoriasis for at least 6 months before Screening visit.

          -  Evidence of moderate to severe psoriasis, at Screening and Baseline before the first
             dose of study treatment, with: PASI score &gt;=12; Psoriasis plaques involving BSA &gt;=10
             percent and sIGA&gt;=3.

          -  Candidate for systemic therapy or phototherapy (includes na√Øve or previously treated),
             in the opinion of the Investigator.

          -  Agrees to avoid any prolonged exposure to natural or artificial sources of ultraviolet
             (UV) radiation from 28 days before Day 1 until the follow-up visit, which may
             potentially impact the participant's psoriasis in the opinion of the Investigator

          -  Body mass index (BMI) within the range of 18.5 to 40.0 kilogram (kg)/meter square
             (m^2).

          -  Male participants are eligible to participate if they agree to the following during
             the intervention period and for at least 2 days (i.e. 5 terminal half-lives of
             GSK2982772) after the last dose of study intervention: Refrain from donating sperm
             plus either: Be abstinent from heterosexual intercourse as their preferred and usual
             lifestyle (abstinent on a long term and persistent basis) and agree to remain
             abstinent OR Must agree to use contraception/barrier as detailed: Agree to use a male
             condom and will also be advised of the benefit for a female partner to use a highly
             effective method of contraception as a condom may break or leak when having sexual
             intercourse with a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) who is not currently
             pregnant.

          -  A female participant is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant or
             breastfeeding, and at least one of the following conditions applies: Is not a WOCBP OR

             low user dependency, during the intervention period and for at least 28 days (i.e.
             until resolution of potential drug interaction with oral contraceptives) after the
             last dose of study intervention. The Investigator should evaluate the effectiveness of
             the contraceptive method in relationship to the first dose of study intervention. A
             WOCBP must have a negative highly sensitive pregnancy test (urine or serum as required
             by local regulations) within 24 hours before the first dose of study intervention. If
