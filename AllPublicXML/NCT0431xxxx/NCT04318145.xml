      A Multi-Center, Unblinded, Single-Arm Study to Evaluate Sex Differences in the Acute Effects
      of PL-3994 on Myocardial cGMP Enhancement and Hemodynamics in Heart Failure with Preserved
      Ejection Fraction

      Multi-center, unblinded, dose ascending, two-part pilot study involving Part A, up to 15
      subjects for dose ascension and optimization (N=3 per dose level, up to 5 dose levels) and
      Part B, 40 patients (n=20 women, n=20 men), with a single dose of PL-3994 after which
      hemodynamics will be measured by pulmonary artery catheter and pulmonary artery (mixed
      venous) and coronary sinus blood sampling will be performed to measure cGMP levels during a
      15-minute observation period.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the acute effects of a single dose of intravenous
      PL-3994 on hemodynamics and myocardial cGMP expression.

      The following endpoints will be assessed:

        -  Hemodynamics (including blood pressure, right atrial pressure, pulmonary artery
           pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, and cardiac output)

        -  Myocardial cGMP expression via coronary sinus sampling
