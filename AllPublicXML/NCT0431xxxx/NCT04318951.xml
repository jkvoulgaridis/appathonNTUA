  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present controlled, parallel-group, single-center, blinded-assessment, phase-IIA trial
      seeks to explore the feasibility of a study protocol on intensive communicative-pragmatic
      social interaction as a means to promote recovery from post stroke depression in the late
      subacute or consolidation phase of aphasia. The primary hypothesis predicts significantly
      greater progress on self-report and clinician-rated measures of depression severity after (i)
      intensive communicative-pragmatic social interaction combined with standard care, compared to
      (ii) standard care alone. Likewise, secondary hypotheses predict that intensive
      communicative-pragmatic social interaction leads to significantly improved performance on
      measures evaluating self-efficacy and quality of life.

      Background. Individuals with post-stroke aphasia frequently experience a profound loss of
      abilities to engage in social interaction, one major reason for the increased risk of
      depression after a cerebrovascular accident. Impaired communication skills in aphasia often
      prevent classical forms of psychotherapy in post-stroke depression, thus emphasizing the need
      for new rehabilitation strategies alongside antidepressant medication.

      Aims. The present controlled, parallel-group, single-center, blinded-assessment, phase-IIA
      trial seeks to explore the feasibility of a study protocol on intensive
      communicative-pragmatic social interaction as a potential treatment of post-stroke depression
      in the late subacute or consolidation phase of aphasia (1-12 months after a cerebrovascular
      accident). In this period of time, prevalence of post-stroke depression was found to be
      particularly high.

      Methods. Treatment is based on an established protocol that encourages persons with aphasia
      to use neural resources of verbal communication embedded in intensive social interaction. In
      a routine-healthcare outpatient setting, 60 individuals with post-stroke depression and
      aphasia will be allocated to one of two groups in a pseudorandomized fashion: (i) intensive
      communicative-pragmatic social interaction combined with standard care or (ii) standard care
      alone.

      Endpoints and Outcomes. Primary endpoints will be changes on self-report and clinician-rated
      measures of depression severity (simplified version of Beck's Depression Inventory, BDI-V;
      and Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, HAM-D) after a 1-month treatment period (5 hours of
      weekly training). Secondary outcomes include measures evaluating self-efficacy, quality of
      life, and language performance (Self-Efficacy Questionnaire; EuroQol Five-Dimensional
      Descriptive System, EQ-5D; and Aachen Aphasia Test, AAT).

      Hypotheses. The primary hypothesis predicts significant between-group differences on BDI-V
      and HAM-D scores, indicating greater reduction in depression severity with intensive
      communicative-pragmatic social interaction over and above standard care alone. Secondary
      hypotheses predict significant between-group differences on Self-Efficacy Questionnaire and
      EQ-5D scores. Further exploratory analyses will consider progress in language performance
      from onset to end of treatment on the AAT to account for the potential relationship between
      changes in cognitive-affective distress and verbal expression skills.

      Clinical Relevance. The current proof-of-concept trial will investigate the feasibility of a
      study protocol on intensive communicative-pragmatic social interaction as a possible means to
      promote recovery from post-stroke depression in individuals with aphasia. The results
      obtained will determine the design of a subsequent phase-IIB randomized controlled trial.

    <description>This self-report questionnaire was conceived to quantify a person's confidence to overcome obstacles encountered when completing a difficult task. Results are expressed on a Likert scale ranging from 0 (very low self-efficacy) to 3 (very high self-efficacy). Reduced self-efficacy is discussed as one risk factor for depression.</description>

    <description>This self-report questionnaire is used to express perceived health on Likert scales ranging from 0 (very bad) to 4 (best possible health condition), and on a visual analogue scale ranging from 0% (very bad) to 100% (best possible health condition).</description>

    <description>This standardized aphasia test battery was found to be sensitive to treatment-induced short-term progress in language performance. To address the potential relationship between changes in cognitive-affective distress and verbal expression skills, we will use the combined AAT subscales &quot;Repetition&quot; and &quot;Naming&quot; as a covariate in exploratory evaluations.</description>

    <description>ILAT requires individuals with aphasia to engage in social interaction. Groups of three patients and a therapist are seated around a table and provided with picture cards showing different objects (e.g., bottle). Each card has a duplicate that is owned by one of the other players. The goal is to obtain this duplicate from a fellow player by requesting the depicted object (e.g., &quot;Give me the [â€¦]&quot;). If the duplicate is available, the addressee hands over the corresponding card to the person who initiated the request sequence. If the duplicate is not available, the addressee rejects the request. In the event of misunderstandings, the players ask clarifying questions. Throughout the training, participants use formulaic expressions to indicate whether a request is accepted (&quot;Here you are,&quot; &quot;Thank you,&quot; &quot;You're welcome&quot;), rejected (&quot;I'm sorry,&quot; &quot;No problem,&quot; &quot;Too bad&quot;) or unclear (&quot;Pardon me?&quot;). Treatment duration will be four weeks.</description>
