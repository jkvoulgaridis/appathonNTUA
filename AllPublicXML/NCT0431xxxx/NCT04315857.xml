  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over the last years, there has been a progressive increase in the prevalence of diabetes.
      Approximately 3.3 million French adults and approximately 425 million adults worldwide have
      been diagnosed with diabetes. Because of the associated high morbiditiy and mortality, this
      chronic disease is at the heart of public health discussions, and technologies to improve its
      management are constantly progressing.

      One notable innovation is the Freestyle Free blood glucose meter, which enables the
      continuous measurement of interstitial blood glucose levels. This type of device has enabled
      diabetic patients to refine their blood glucose monitoring and improve the balance of their
      diabetes, while reducing the associated constraints.

      To date, the Freestyle Libre meter is only available in patients treated with insulin pumps
      or multi-injections (at least 3 insulin injections per day) due to the risk of significant
      blood glucose variations. However, one can imagine other situations where the Freestyle Libre
      could be of interest to detect significant glycemic imbalances, such as in diabetic patients
      with cancer treated with chemotherapy.

      To our knowledge, no study has been conducted on the relationship between chemotherapy and
      glycemic balance.

      A few studies have looked at the balance of diabetes and chemotherapy in combination with
      corticosteroid therapy, but the analyses were based on fasting blood glucose levels, or some
      capillary blood glucose levels, or glycated hemoglobin - which can be deficient due to toxic
      treatments at the bone marrow level with variations in erythropoiesis. Hypoglycemia
      facilitated by anorexia (related to cancer and chemotherapy) or hyperglycemia facilitated by
      hyperglycemic drugs can be severe for patients with high care utilization and associated
      significant cost.

      However, other studies have looked at the consequences of unbalanced diabetes in the context
      of cancer treated with chemotherapy. The results showed that hyperglycemia could lead to an
      increased risk of toxicity and side effects of chemotherapy. In addition, the choice of
      chemotherapy type or dosage may be different from a non-diabetic patient, which may result in
      a reduced remission and/or cure rate.

      These results are then in contradiction with common practice, as the presence of cancer often
      leads doctors to be less rigorous in controlling blood sugar levels.

      As the prevalence of diabetes in patients newly diagnosed with cancer is quite high (between
      8 and 18% depending on the study) and because it is likely to continue to increase with the
      increasing prevalence of diabetes, particularly type 2 diabetes, closer monitoring of blood
      glucose levels in diabetic patients appears to be essential in the overall management of the
      patient.

      In our study, we therefore focused on the continuous interstitial glycemia of diabetic
      patients entering the Ambulatory Medical Unit of Cancerology to start chemotherapy related to
      their cancer, be it hematological, digestive, cutaneous or gynecological.
