  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preoperative rehabilitation before total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has not been proven to be
      effective. Latest meta-analyzes do not find any improvement of motor performance during gait
      6 months after surgery. However, most of the previous studies did not specifically target
      muscle atrophy to design rehabilitation protocol. Pre-operative muscle atrophy, although not
      systematic, is often observed. The preoperative muscles volumes of thigh muscles have been
      poorly identified and never used to adjust the pre operative rehabilitation strategy.

      As part of the &quot;FOLLOWKNEE&quot; (RHU) project, which attempts to implement a personalized
      management of TKA and its follow-up, this study wants to explore the potential effect of
      adapted treatment to improve muscle force and muscle volume before TKA.

    <measure>Difference of isometric strength D0-W4p</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 to Week 4 postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>Isometric strength of quadriceps (QS) and hamstring (HS) will be measured on isokinetic bench and the difference between D0 and W4 will be calculated as follows : (QSW4p-QSD0)+(HSW4p-HSD0). Personalized rehabilitation will first be compared to classic rehabilitation and if positive to global rehabilitation.</description>

    <measure>Time up and go test (TUG)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0, Week 4, Week 4 postoperative, Week 12 postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>The patient must get up from the sitting position and walk three meters from the chair and then retrace his steps (turn 180 degrees) and sit down again. The time that the person puts to this activity is timed by the evaluator.</description>
