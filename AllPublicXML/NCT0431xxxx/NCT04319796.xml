    <textblock>
      The recent implementation of European Reference Networks for Rare Diseases (ERNs) is an
      unprecedented move to improve the care of patients suffering from rare health disorders by
      transnational collaboration. ERN-RND, the ERN for Rare Neurological Diseases, oversees more
      than 35,000 patients in 31 specialist centers in 13 countries. The ERN-RND registry aims to
      gather information on patient cohorts in the multiple specialist centers and to provide an
      overview on patient numbers principally accessible for translational studies.

      The ERN-RND (European Reference Network on Rare Neurological Diseases) Registry aims to
      establish a demographic platform for collection of relevant core patient information. This
      will be accomplished by the construction and implementation of a single data base
      encompassing all rare neurological diseases in pediatric and adult patients (the ERN-RND
      Registry), which will collect information according to the &quot;Set of common data elements for
      Rare Diseases Registration&quot; as it has been defined by the European Commission.

      The ERN-RND network covers the following six disease groups in patients of all age groups:
      (i) Ataxia and Hereditary Spastic Spinal Paralysis (HSP), (ii) Leukodystrophies, (iii)
      Frontotemporal Dementia, (iv) Dystonia, Paroxysmal Disorders and Neurodegeneration with Brain
      Iron Accumulation (NBIA), (v) Atypical Parkinsonism and (vi) Huntington's Disease &amp; Choreas.

    <ipd_description>The full pseudonymised dataset will be exported once a year as an Excel file that is made accessible in an encrypted form to the coordinators of each specialist center who contribute to the ERN-RND registry. To this end the encrypted dataset will be provided in a specific folder of the Hertie Institute for Clinical Brain Research Tübingen, Germany (HIH) cloud for a limited amount of time (one week). Coordinators of all ERN-RND health care providers will get access to this folder to download the encrypted file. In addition, they will receive a password that enables decryption of the file. Each coordinator needs to confirm a priori with its local institutional review board the issues of data storage. This is part of the local project plan, patient information and consent that is premise for data entry. This procedure enables each center who contributes data to consider studies of their special interest within the ERN.</ipd_description>
