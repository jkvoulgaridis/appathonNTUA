    <textblock>
      This research study is testing the feasibility and acceptability of a 12-week intervention
      that integrates telephone coaching and printed materials about the ACS guidelines and healthy
      lifestyle behaviors in order to manage symptoms after treatment for cancer. We will recruit
      57 dyads (the survivor plus one identified informal caregiver) from the community.

      This research study is testing the feasibility and acceptability of a 12-week intervention
      that integrates telephone coaching and printed materials about the ACS guidelines and healthy
      lifestyle behaviors in order to manage symptoms after treatment for cancer. The study
      population is 36 Latinas who have recently completed treatment for solid tumor cancers and
      their informal caregiver (36 dyads). Research suggests that family members can be
      facilitators to behavior change more specifically, Latinos rely on family support more than
      non-Hispanic Whites.

      Fewer than 20% of Latina cancer survivors meet the American Cancer Society's (ACS) Guidelines
      on Nutrition and Physical Activity. Healthier lifestyle behaviors (such as diet and physical
      activity) would result in an immediate benefit of reduced symptoms and long-term benefit of
      improved health while lowering cancer risk. This pilot study tests an intervention that will
      help in lessening survivors' symptoms to improve adherence to the ACS guidelines for cancer
      prevention ultimately improving overall health. A telephone-based intervention does not
      require any in-person meetings (outside of initial recruitment) and lessens participant
      burden.

      The Specific Aims of this project are to evaluate this intervention among 36 survivors who
      have recently completed treatment for solid tumor cancers and their informal caregivers to 1)
      Determine the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention 2) Establish the preliminary
      efficacy for improvement in diet, physical activity, and quality of life for the dyads, and
      symptom burden for survivors through surveys given at baseline and study completion as well
      as a weekly symptom distress survey.

    <description>The intervention condition will involve weekly symptom assessment and health coaching to manage symptoms and to meet the ACS cancer prevention guidelines provided over the telephone by trained health coaches. Participants will be completing the same forms/assessments throughout the study. The content will be built around the Symptom Management Toolkit. The coaching will be dictated by the symptoms the survivor or the support person is experiencing the week of the intervention call. All calls begin with the symptom assessments, only the intervention arm includes intervention coaching that focuses on physical activity, stress management, or eating a healthy diet to improve adherence to the ACS guidelines for cancer prevention. We anticipate coaching sessions will last approximately 20 - 45 minutes</description>

    <description>For participants randomized to the control condition weekly symptom assessment telephone calls will be completed by staff at the University of Arizona Cancer Center Behavioral Measurements Interventions Shared Resource (BMISR). At week 13 an exit interview will be completed by the study coordinator to record participants feedback regarding study intervention, length, coaches, etcâ€¦ In addition, staff from BMISR will call to repeat all baseline measures with the exception of the demographic questionnaires. Symptom assessment calls will take approximately 15 minutes.</description>
