  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to incorporate feedback from cancer patients and providers to
      adapt, implement, and test an intervention. The intervention aims to prompt screening for
      financial distress, facilitate discussions about care costs with cancer patients, support
      health insurance selection, and ultimately reduce cancer patients' financial toxicity
      associated with cancer care.

    <description>-The investigators will conduct a historic control survey of 80-100 recently diagnosed gynecologic, colorectal, and lung cancer patients. They can complete the survey in-person, over the phone, or online. The survey will take approximately 15 minutes to complete. It will ask about their knowledge of health insurance and confidence communicating about care costs.</description>

    <description>-The investigators will train 15 gynecologic, colorectal, and lung cancer care providers in using I Can PIC and discussing costs with patients in a brief 15 minute presentation that can be delivered in-person or virtually. Providers will complete a survey before and after their brief training at the start of the study. These surveys will take approximately 5-10 mins to complete in total. During the study, at 3- and 6- months, the investigators will give real-time feedback to providers on the percent of time that they screened for financial distress and referred patients to I Can PIC. At the end of the study, the investigators will examine adoption, implementation, and maintenance measures.</description>

    <description>-Approximately 80-100 participants will use I Can PIC. This will take approximately 10-15 minutes. After their next appointment with their provider, they will complete a brief survey about their knowledge of health insurance and confidence communicating about care costs. This will take about 10 mins. Patient participants who choose to complete the study in person may view I Can PIC on a tablet provided in the clinic or at the office. Then after their appointment, they can complete the survey on a tablet provided in the clinic or at the office. If they choose to complete it over the phone, the investigators will email them the link to I Can PIC and then call them when it is time to complete the survey. If they wish to complete it online, the investigators will email them the link to I Can PIC, and then the survey after their appointment. After 3-6 months, participants will receive a 5-10 minute follow-up survey which they can complete in-person, online, or over the phone.</description>
