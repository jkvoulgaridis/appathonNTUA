    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to look at how much tirzepatide gets into the bloodstream and
      how long the body takes to get rid of it. This study will involve a single dose of 14C
      radiolabelled tirzepatide. This means that a radioactive tracer substance, C14, will be
      incorporated into the study drug to investigate the study drug and its breakdown products and
      to find out how much of these pass from blood into urine, feces and expired air.

      Screening is required within 28 days prior to the start of the study. For each participant,
      the total duration of the clinical trial will be approximately 15 weeks, including screening.
