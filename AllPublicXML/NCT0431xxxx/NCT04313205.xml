      This clinical study will be a randomized, open-label, multiple-dose, two-period, crossover
      study in healthy male subjects. After screening, subjects will be randomized to receive
      either JKB-122 tablet or JKB-122 capsule in a 1:1 ratio. There will be two dosing periods
      (Period 1 and Period 2). Subjects who receive JKB-122 capsule during Period 1 will receive
      JKB-122 tablet during Period 2 and vice versa. The 2 dosing periods will be separated by a
      washout period.
