    <textblock>
      Absolut uterine factor, meaning the absence of uterus, represents a cause for sterility
      without the possibility of a present treatment. The uterine factor affects millions of women
      and may be due to congenital problems, such as the Muller anomalies (Mayer Rockitansky
      Syndrome) or acquired by previous hysterectomy or intrauterine adhesions (Asherman's
      Syndrome). The uterine transplant would represent the only possibility for patients with an
      absolute uterine factor to achieve both genetic and gestational maternity.

      To obtain by laparoscopy a viable uterus for transplantation from a living donor is feasible.
      The laparoscopic procedure increases safety and provides the benefits of minimally invasive
      surgery to the grafting technique already described by laparotomy. The objective of the
      present study is to develop a pilot program in the transplant of a living donor. We include 5
      pairs of uterine donor-transplant recipients indicated for sterility by absolute uterine
      factor due to Mayer Rokitansky Syndrome. Patients will undergo surgery for this transplant
      and after 6 months of it with correct function of the graft, embryos will be transferred in
      order to achieve pregnancy. C-section will be performed for delivery. The attempt of two
      gestations (if there are sufficient cryopreserved embryos for a second gestation) and
      withdrawing the graft (hysterectomy) and, therefore, immunosuppression is agreed.

    <description>Patient will undergo surgery in order to transplant the graft (uterus). After that, a follow-up in order to detect early rejection. After 6 months, embryo transfer will be perfomed.
