  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is a disease-modifying, anti-rheumatic drug that regulates immune
      system activity and is typically prescribed to treat rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus
      erythematosus, as well as other immune conditions. Although generally well tolerated, study
      data have demonstrated that long-term use of HCQ may lead to irreversible and potentially
      vision-threatening retinal toxicity. The American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) issued
      guidelines in 2011, and again in 2016 that recommended dosing of HCQ be based on an
      individual's body weight, and also outlined how and when to screen for retinal toxicity.
      While clinicians have been aware of the potential side effects of HCQ for decades, studies
      have shown that many patients continue to receive higher than recommended doses.

      The goal of this study is to conduct a pragmatic trial to assess the utility of a new
      e-prescribing (eRX) interface for prescriptions of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). The
      investigators will measure the effectiveness of the system in reducing the number of
      individuals prescribed HCQ over current guidelines by randomizing clinicians to the new
      interface. Ideally, the eRX interface will result in a lower number of potential adverse
      events (i.e. retinal toxicity) associated with high-dose, long-term use of HCQ.
