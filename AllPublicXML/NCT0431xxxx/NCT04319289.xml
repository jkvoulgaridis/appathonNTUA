  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to investigate whether there will be an effect of adding a program of
      aerobic interval training in managing patients suffering from myalgia associated with vitamin
      D deficiency.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Forty five women complaining from myalgia with vitamin D deficiency participating in this
      study. Their ages are ranged from 30 to 40 years.

      They are assigned randomly into three groups:

        -  Group (A): included 15 patients who are participating in an aerobic interval training
           exercise program with vitamin D supplementation (cholecalciferol 400 IU/day).

        -  Group (B): included 15 patients who are receiving vitamin D supplementation only
           (cholecalciferol 400 IU/day).

        -  Group (C): included 15 patients who are participating in an interval training exercise
           program only.

      The intervention will last for 12 weeks

    <description>The participants in both groups A will be instructed to perform aerobic interval exercises at 70% maxHR for 5 minutes and then decrease activity to 50% for 5 minutes and repeat for the length of the activity (the training will be done by using bicycle ergometer(Biodex LBC, Biodex Inc., New York).• Before starting training ; Maximum heart rate calculated from the following equation: maxHR= 220-age .
Duration: the first five to ten minutes of each session were dedicated to warming up exercise on the bicycle in the form of slow progression exercise (to decrease the risk of hypotension, musculoskeletal injury and cardiovascular complications), followed by the active phase of exercise for 40 min., and finally cooling down phase for ten minutes. with intensity and speed decreased gradually until reaching the resting HR
Frequency: 3 days/week., for 12 weeks
Also all participants in this group are taking gne capsule containing (cholecalciferol 400 IU) every day .</description>
