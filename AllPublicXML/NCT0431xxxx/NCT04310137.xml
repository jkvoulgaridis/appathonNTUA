  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate if how people are told to return to walking after a skin
      injury affects whether or not they develop new (recurrence) skin breakdown on their feet. The
      people in this study will have diabetes and have a recently closed foot ulcer. About half
      will be specifically told how to return to walking and the other half will be told to return
      to walking slowly. How people naturally return to walking will also be established.

      The purpose of this project is to determine the impact of Therapist-directed loading versus
      self-selected loading on ulcer occurrence and to establish natural loading behavior following
      diabetic foot ulcer closure.

      Eligible participants will be randomized into a group given specific directions from a
      Therapist to return to walking (i.e. reloading skin following plantar ulceration closure) or
      a group encouraged to slowly return to walking (self-directed re-loading of the skin
      following plantar ulceration closure). Following randomization and instruction for re-loading
      according to group assignment, participants will be assessed every 6 months for walking
      behavior. Participants will be monitored for ulcer recurrence throughout. Participants will
      be followed for up to 18 months.
