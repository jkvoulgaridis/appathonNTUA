  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are several proposed mechanisms that are thought to contribute to the development of
      cardiovascular diseases. Although the process is extremely complex, it is well-accepted that
      elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and inflammation contribute to
      the systemic vascular dysfunction in cardiovascular diseases. These factors often partially
      contribute to endothelial dysfunction, elevated blood pressure, reduced oxygen utility
      capacity, and reduced muscle function. Therefore, by reducing ROS and inflammation, there may
      be protective effects against vascular dysfunction and thus protection against cardiovascular
      disease manifestation. Intake of natural anthocyanins and polyphenols derived from fruits and
      vegetables has been shown to reduce excessive ROS and inflammation in several populations.

      Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the impacts of a combined berry
      extract supplement (hawthorn berry, tart cherry, and bromelain extracts) on total antioxidant
      capacity, endothelial function, blood pressure, oxygen utility capacity, and fatigue index in
      healthy young adults.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Endothelial function</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Endothelial function was measured using flow-mediated dilation in percents (%). A higher value represents a better outcome. Scale range for endothelial function is approximately 8-12% for healthy populations.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Systolic blood pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Systolic blood pressure was measured as millimeters of mercury (mmHg). Higher values represent a worse outcome. Scale range for systolic blood pressure is approximately 110-129 for most healthy populations.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Diastolic blood pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Diastolic blood pressure was measured as millimeters of mercury (mmHg). Higher values represent a worse outcome. Scale range for systolic blood pressure is approximately 70-79 mmHg for most healthy populations.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Oxygen utility capacity (tissue saturation index)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Oxygen utility capacity was measured as tissue saturation index in percents (%). Higher values represent a better outcome. Scale range for tissue saturation index is approximately 70-100% for most healthy populations.</description>
