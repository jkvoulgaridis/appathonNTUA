  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to examine the effect of hospital-home linkage short-term rehabilitation
      therapy using real-time interactive digital healthcare system (Uincare Homeplus) in
      post-operative patients with breast cancer. This is prospective study. 100 breast cancer
      patients who underwent axillary lymph node diessection or breast reconstruction following
      mastectomy will be examined, and those with limited range of motion (ROM) of affected
      shoulder will be enrolled in the study. Shoulder ROM, Quick-DASH, pain evaluation with NRS,
      quality of life evaluation with FACT-B and EQ-5D will be evaluated on enrollment, 4-week,
      8-week, and 12-weeks after enrollment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The limited range of motion (ROM) of the shoulder occur often after receiving breast cancer
      surgery, which may be due to post-operative pain, stiffness of shoulder girdle muscle, and
      etc. Due to this limited ROM, the patients may have difficulty with activities of daily life
      and quality of life may be reduced.

      Uincare Homeplus is software manufactured in Korea, which uses infrared, kinect camera and
      motion capture technology to track 3D motion of the patients' articulation. Using this
      technology, the patients can receive feedback of their motion immediately.

      The objective of the study is to examine the effect of hospital-home linkage short-term
      rehabilitation therapy using real-time interactive digital healthcare system (Uincare
      Homeplus) in post-operative patients with breast cancer.
