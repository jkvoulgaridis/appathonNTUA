    <textblock>
      This is an open label feasibility trial to learn whether the combination of donepezil and
      cognitive remediation therapy (Donepezil + CRT) may improve neurocognitive functioning and
      decreasing alcohol use in Veterans with alcohol use disorder who have mild cognitive
      impairment (AUD-MCI). The study will determine the acceptability and adherence to treatment
      and preliminary evidence for efficacy. The study will recruit 15 newly recovering Veterans
      individuals with AUD-MCI for a 13-week, open-label, single-arm pilot study with sobriety and
      cognitive assessments at baseline and at 13-week follow-up.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Donepezil is FDA approved for treatment of dementia and recent animal studies have suggested
      that it may reduce craving in rat models of alcohol use disorder. Investigators' previous
      studies of cognitive remediation therapy (CRT) with work therapy have shown efficacy with
      newly recovering Veterans with AUD compared with work therapy alone. The current study
      combines Donepezil and CRT in an open-label trial to learn whether the combination of
      Donepezil + CRT may improve neurocognitive functioning and decrease alcohol use in Veterans
      with alcohol use disorder who have mild cognitive impairment (AUD-MCI). The study will
      determine the acceptability and adherence to treatment and provide preliminary evidence for
      efficacy. The study will recruit 15 newly recovering Veterans individuals with AUD-MCI for a
      13-week, open-label, single-arm pilot study with sobriety and cognitive assessments at
      baseline and at 13-week follow-up. Primary outcome variables will be a Clinical Global Index
      of AUD recovery and a Global Cognitive Composite of MCI related neurocognitive assessment.

    <description>Donepezil: Subjects will take 5 mg/day of donepezil in the evening for first 4 weeks, then 10 mg/day of donepezil in the evening until week 13.
Cognitive remediation therapy (CRT): This study employs a computerized program (BrainHQ) for cognitive enhancement. Participants use their program for one hour per session, up to five sessions per week, over 13 weeks (maximum of 65 sessions). They may training on site or at another quiet location of their choice.</description>
