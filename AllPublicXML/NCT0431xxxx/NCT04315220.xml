  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A total of 52 overweight children aged between eight and sixteen years will be recruited by
      criterion based purposive sampling to participate in the two groups pretest post test
      randomized clinical study. Random allocation of the eligible subjects for treatment will be
      done by the block randomization method with matrix of thirteen rows and four columns (13x4).
      The subject will be allotted to the group randomly, based on the chit selected by the person
      other the primary researcher.Once the block is filled, the next row block will be opened.
      Thus equal distribution of overweight children in the each group will be ensured.

      Group A will be receiving actual core stability training (Level 1 - Mat exercises and Level 2
      - Swiss Ball exercises) for 6 weeks with a frequency of three sessions per week.Group B will
      receive no training. Each session will last for 30 minutes of duration. The static and
      dynamic balance, foot pressure distribution and core strength will be assessed at the
      baseline and at the end of the treatment sessions.

    <description>All overweight children will be asked to walk barefoot along a 5-.metre walkway using Harris mat pressure distribution platform which will be placed on a firm, level surface, in the centre of walkway. Children will be ensured to step on the Harris mat without pause, first with one foot and then repeat the same procedure with the other foot at constant speed.

    <measure>Single limb stance</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline and six weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The children will be instructed to stand on the dominant leg with non dominant leg flexed to 90 degree, and maintain the position. The test will be performed first with eyes open and then with the eyes closed. The time for which participant will be able to maintain balance will be recorded</description>

    <measure>Y- reach set</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline and six weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The participant will stand on one foot in the center of the Y with the most distal aspect of the toes just behind the starting line. While maintaining single-leg stance, the balance will be tested in the anterior, postero-medial and postero-lateral direction with reach foot. The reach distance in all the three directions will be noted.</description>

    <description>The core strength will be measured with the Chattanooga Pressure Biofeedback Unit. The device will be placed under the lumbar spine in crook lying and inflated to a baseline of 40 mmHg. The participants will be instructed to perform drawing-in maneuver on the verbal instructions, maintain it for 10 sec. The change in pressure will be noted</description>

    <description>Core stability training (CST) consists of two levels: level 1- Mat exercises (includes abdominal muscle contraction, bridging,cat stretch,single leg circle and superman) and level 2- Swiss ball exercises (includes abdominal muscle contraction, bridging and squatting by using therapy ball).
There will be three sets of 15 repetitions of each exercises. The first set will consist of 10 seconds hold period, follow by 12 seconds hold in second set and 15 seconds hold in third set respectively. The entire session will last for approximately 30 minutes.</description>
