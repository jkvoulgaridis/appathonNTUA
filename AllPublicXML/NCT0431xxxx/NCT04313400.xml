      This study determines the Maximum Tolerable Dose (MTD) by maximum BSA percentage treated and
      evaluates efficacy of various concentrations of AMTX-100 CF versus placebo (vehicle).

      The study has two parts:

      Phase I (Part 1):

      Approximately Twenty five (25) subjects with various treatable Body Surface Area (BSA)
      involvement of Mild to Moderate Atopic Dermatitis will be enrolled in the study and treated
      with 1.1% w/w AMTX-100 CF.

      Phase II (Part 2):

      Approximately One Hundred Twenty (120) subjects with Mild to Moderate Atopic Dermatitis with
      various treatable BSA involvement of Mild to Moderate Atopic Dermatitis will be randomized to
      be treated with different concentrations of AMTX-100 CF (low concentration (0.11% w/w),
      medium concentration (0.33% w/w) and high concentration (1.1% w/w)) or Vehicle (Placebo) in
      the study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AMTX-100 CF drug product is formulated as a water-based, topical cream incorporating a
      28-amino acid synthetic polypeptide (AMTX-100) as the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API).
      AMTX-100 is a chimeric, cell-penetrating, bifunctional nuclear transport modifier (NTM), that
      is engineered to modulate nuclear transport of transcription factors (NF-κB, NFAT, AP-1 and
      STAT1) involved in activation of gene expression of key mediators of inflammation (TNFα,
      IL-1β, IL-6, IL-17, MCP-1, etc.) and metabolic syndrome (ChREBP and SREBP) by importin α/β
      complex and importin β, respectively. This further leads to a reduction in pro-inflammatory
      cytokine/chemokine production and lipid metabolic products.

      AMTX-100 CF is intended for improvement of symptoms associated with mild to moderate Atopic
      Dermatitis in adults. This Phase I/II study aims to determine the Maximum Tolerable Dose
      (MTD) by maximum BSA percentage treated and to evaluate efficacy of various concentrations of
      AMTX-100 CF versus placebo (vehicle).

Part 1 of the study is an open-label, dose escalation study to determine the MTD of AMTX-100 CF (1.1% w/w) for the highest treated percentage of the BSA affected with AD. Five (5) cohorts will be sequentially enrolled in the Part 1 of the study. Each cohort will include five (5) patients with eligible, treatable percentages of BSA affected with AD.
Part 2 (Phase II):
Part 2 of the study is a multi-center, double-blind, randomized, vehicle-controlled, dose ranging study of the safety and efficacy of topically applied AMTX-100 CF in adult patients with Mild to Moderate AD. One hundred twenty (120) patients will be enrolled in 3 groups of AMTX-100 CF along with a placebo (vehicle) group. The patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio with thirty (30) subjects in each group ((Group A: low dose concentration 0.11%, Group B: medium dose concentration 0.33% and Group C: high dose concentration 1.1%) of AMTX-100 CF) and placebo (vehicle 0% w/w)).</intervention_model_description>
