      This Study evaluates the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of different zamicastat doses in
      Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) patients to find the most promising therapeutic dosage
      range for the treatment of PAH disease

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-centre study in patients with PAH who are currently on stable
      treatment with at least one PAH medication. It is planned to evaluate the PK profile (24 hour
      profile and trough levels) and the safety, tolerability and efficacy of four different
      zamicastat doses. Each patient will start treatment with the lowest dose (50 mg zamicastat
      once daily) and the dose will be up-titrated to the individual highest tolerated dose (HTD)
      i.e. up to 200 mg zamicastat once daily.

      A data safety monitoring board (DSMB) will periodically review the safety data and will issue
      a recommendation if the doses can be used as planned.

      This study will consist of:

        -  A screening period, 5 to 12 days: visit V1

        -  Up to four dose finding periods, 14 days each:

             -  Dose A: visits A1, A2 and A3

             -  Dose B: visits B2 and B3

             -  Dose C: visits C2 and C3

             -  Dose D: visits D2 and D3

        -  Maintenance period, 42 days: visits MPV1, MPV2 and MPV3

        -  Follow-up period, 14 to 28 days: visits FU (down-titration) and FU

         13. For women: Pregnancy or breast-feeding. Women of childbearing potential unable or
             unwilling to undergo pregnancy tests and practice acceptable contraceptive measures
             from the time of informed consent until 30 days after last IMP intake. Acceptable
             methods for women are surgical intervention (e.g. bilateral tubal occlusion),
             non-hormonal implantable intrauterine device, double-barrier methods, true sexual
             abstinence (i.e. when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the
             patient) and vasectomised partner (provided that the partner is the sole sexual
             partner of the patient and the partner has received medical assessment of the surgical
             success). Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
             post-ovulation methods), hormonal contraceptives and withdrawal are not acceptable
             methods of contraception.

             For men: Male patients who are sexually active with a partner of childbearing
             potential must use, with their partner, a condom plus an approved acceptable
             contraceptive measure from the time of informed consent until 90 days after the last
             IMP intake. The following methods are acceptable methods of contraception: partner's
             use of combined (oestrogen and progestogen-containing) hormonal contraception
             associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral, intravaginal, transdermal); partner's
             use of progestogen-only hormonal contraception (oral, injectable/implantable,
             intrauterine hormone-releasing system); partner's use of implantable intrauterine
             device; surgical sterilisation (for example, vasectomy or bilateral tubal occlusion).

         14. Previous participation in any other drug investigational study within the past 30 days
             (or five half-lives of investigational medicinal product [IMP] whichever is longer)
             prior to V1.

         15. Vulnerable patients according to Section 1.61 of the ICH guideline for Good Clinical
             Practice E6.
