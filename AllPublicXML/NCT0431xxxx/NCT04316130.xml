  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to examine the effect of hospital-home linkage short-term rehabilitation
      therapy using real-time interactive digital healthcare system (Uincare Homeplus) in frozen
      shoulder. This is prospective randomized controlled trial and multi-center study. 100 frozen
      shoulder who diagnosed with limited range of motion in 2 more plane of flexion, abduction,
      external rotation of affected shoulder. Shoulder range of motion (ROM), Shoulder Pain and
      Disability Index (SPADI), pain evaluation with Numeral Rating Scale (NRS), quality of life
      evaluation with Short Form (SF)-36 Health Survey and EQ-5D-5L, activity daily living (ADL)
      evaluation with Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) will be evaluated on
      enrollment, 4-week, 8-week, 12-weeks, 18-weeks, and 24 weeks after enrollment.

    <textblock>
      The frozen shoulder is a disease in which severe pain and limited range of motion of the
      shoulder occur as an inflammatory change occurs in the articular capsular surrounding the
      shoulder joint. As a result, it has caused limitation in daily life movement.

      Uincare Homeplus is software manufactured in Korea, which uses infrared, kinect camera and
      motion capture technology to track 3D motion of the patients' articulation. Using this
      technology, the patients can receive feedback of their motion immediately.

      The objective of the study is to examine the effect of hospital-home linkage short-term
      rehabilitation therapy using real-time interactive digital healthcare system (Uincare
      Homeplus) in frozen shoulder.
