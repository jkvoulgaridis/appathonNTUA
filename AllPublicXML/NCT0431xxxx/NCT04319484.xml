      The aim of this study is to observe the efficacy and safety of lenvatinib in preventing
      recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma patients with portal vein tumor thrombus after liver
      transplantation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The research is an open, randomized, single-center study. Patients of hepatocellular
      carcinoma with portal vein cancer thrombus who underwent liver transplantation are included
      according to the criteria of admission. After operation, the regimen of calcineurin
      inhibitors, mycophenolate mofetil, sirolimus or everolimus with glucocorticoids removed at an
      early stage are used. Patients enrolled in the study were randomly allocated in the
      lenvatinib group (54 patients) and the control group (54 patients) after stable condition.
      Patients in the control group are given supportive treatment and regular follow-up. Patients
      in the lenvatinib group are given lenvatinib within 1-2 months after operation (dose: body
      weight &lt; 60 kg: 8 mg/day, body weight ≥ 60 kg 12 mg/day). The baseline data of patients are
      collected before allocation. Serum and imaging examination are checked regularly every month
      to monitor the recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma and the side effects of lenvatinib. The
      efficacy and safety of lenvatinib in patients of hepatocellular carcinoma with portal vein
      tumor thrombus are observed, and the clinicopathological factors affecting the efficacy of
      lenvatinib are analyzed. When side effects of lenvatinib occur, the dosage can be reduced
      according to the patients' condition until discontinuation. When tumor recurrence occurs, a
      multidisciplinary team will draw up specific treatment plans according to the patients'
      condition, including surgical resection, interventional therapy, radiofrequency therapy,
      radiotherapy and targeted therapy (Patients in the control group can add lenvatinib, and
      patients in the lenvatinib group can decide whether to continue using it according to the
      patients' condition).
