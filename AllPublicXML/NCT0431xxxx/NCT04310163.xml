  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GM1 gangliosidosis is a rare disease for which there is a limited understanding of disease
      progression and meaningful outcome measures. In addition, parents report that clinic-based
      assessments are not always well-suited to capture all the disease features and other metrics
      that have an impact on the patient and family. To address the methodological challenges of
      this small, heterogeneous population, this study will collect patient-specific home-based
      video data and qualitative interviews with caregivers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a natural history study, for up to 2 years, during which parents or guardians of a
      GM1 child collect video data of patients doing specific daily life activities at baseline and
      follow-up timepoints throughout the study (3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months) and/or submit videos
      taken in the past through a secure smart phone mobile application. The video assessments
      focus on several hallmarks of GM1 progression. Caregivers participate in qualitative
      interviews to provide context for the videos and discuss any changes they observe during the
      study. Activity videos will be evaluated by expert clinicians using both Clinical Global
      Impression of Severity (CGI-S) and Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C) scales. The
      caregiver interviews and clinician-rated activities will inform the patient-specific disease
      trajectories for each hallmark. There is no treatment or intervention associated with this
      study.

    <description>Caregivers will record GM1 gangliosidosis participants doing some standardized activities. A list of standardized activities will be provided at baseline and the caregiver will select the activities that are relevant to the GM1 gangliosidosis participant. The activities include: gross motor skills, fine motor skills, caregiver interaction, communication, self-care and visual tracking.</description>

    <description>In addition to the scheduled video captures, spontaneously-captured videos may also be submitted by the caregivers at any time. These spontaneous videos should demonstrate any behavior or ability that the caregivers consider to be a meaningful change for the participant.</description>
