  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Biliary tract cancer (BTC) accounts for &lt;1% of all cancers, but remains a highly fatal
      malignancy. Surgical resection is the only hope for cure, but most patients present with
      advanced disease when curative-intent surgery is not possible. The therapeutic options for
      patients with advanced disease are limited, primarily to chemotherapeutic regimens, which are
      based on empiric evidence without the use of biomarkers. These current treatment strategies
      have been largely ineffective in controlling the disease, resulting in poor survival outcomes
      of less than 1 year. An understanding of the molecular characteristics of biliary tract
      cancer may enable stratification of patients into therapies that target specific molecular
      alterations with greater efficacies and improved clinical outcomes. This study aims to
      investigate the feasibility and clinical utility of prospective molecular profiling of
      advanced biliary tract cancer. The primary endpoint of this study is to demonstrate the
      feasibility of returning whole genome sequencing results within 8 weeks of tumour biopsy for
      second-line treatment consideration (n=30 patients). In parallel, tumour whole transcriptome
      sequencing will be performed to identify actionable molecular alterations (e.g., fusion
      transcripts). Once the primary endpoint is met, the study will be expanded. Current funding
      allows expansion to 40 patients in total.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have a histological or radiological diagnosis of inoperable or
             metastatic BTC.

          -  Patient must have a tumour that is amenable to a core needle biopsy.

          -  Patients must have a measurable lesion by RECIST 1.1 in addition to the lesion that is
             going to be biopsied.

          -  Patients must be fit to safely undergo a tumour biopsy as judged by the investigator.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 1.

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 90 days.

          -  Within 14 days of the proposed biopsy date, patients must have normal organ and marrow
             function.

          -  Patients must undergo systemic treatment with gemcitabine-based regimens as first-line
             standard systemic palliative treatment with or without other investigational agents
             within a clinical trial.
