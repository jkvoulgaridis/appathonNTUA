  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep changes rapidly during the first year of life. Brain maturation is accompanied by sleep
      consolidation in several episode during day and night (daytime naps and night sleep) and
      progressive organization during the 24h period (more wake during day et more sleep during
      night). In the first months of life, sleep episodes are frequently interrupted by wake,
      possibly induced by multiple external and internal stimuli. One of this stimulus could be
      bladder voiding that is particularly frequent in babies. Only one team worked on the link
      between sleep and bladder voiding and reported that bladder voiding was associated with
      cortical arousal during a daytime nap in a little group of babies.

      In this study, investigators propose to study the relationship between sleep and bladder
      voiding in a bigger group of infant and during daytime but also nighttime sleep.

    <measure>Occurrence of arousals / awakenings in a timely relation with bladder voiding.</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The occurrence of arousals and awakenings will be determined form polysomnography signals including electroencephalogram (EEG), electrooculogram (EOG) and a electromyogram (EMG). Arousals and awakenings will be scored as defined by the international rules for visual scoring of EEG (AASM manual 2007). Investigators will calculate the percentage of bladder voiding episode leading to arousal / awakening events</description>

    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep stages will be scored as defined by the international rules (AASM 2007). Investigators will determine the proportion of bladder voiding events leading to a change of sleep stage.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>EEG frequencies following bladder voiding episodes</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>EEG will be quantitatively analyzed and the power spectrum in each frequency band will be determined. Investigators will determine the proportion of bladder voiding events followed by a significant change of EEG frequencies.</description>

    <measure>Heart rate following bladder voiding episode</measure>
