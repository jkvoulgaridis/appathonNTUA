  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of palbociclib plus
      fulvestrant after failure of a combined treatment of hormonal therapy (aromatase inhibitor or
      tamoxifen ± LHRHa) plus a CDK4/6 inhibitor, in women with HR+ and HER2- LABC or MBC.

      Primary endpoint:

        1. To assess the clinical benefit rate (CBR) of the combination treatment palbociclib plus
           fulvestrant at progression of a combined treatment of hormonal therapy (aromatase
           inhibitor or tamoxifen ± LHRHa) and a CDK4/6 inhibitor.

           Clinical benefit rate for primary efficacy endpoints derivation will be based on the
           local (treating center's) radiologist's/investigator's tumor assessment.

             -  For patients with measurable disease at baseline, progression will be determined
                according to the RECIST criteria v1.1.

             -  In the absence of measurable disease at baseline, patients with bone only lesions,
                lytic or mixed (lytic + sclerotic), will be allowed to enter the study and the
                following will be considered disease progression among these patients:

             -  The appearance of one or more new lytic lesions in bone,

             -  The appearance of one or more new lesions outside of bone,

             -  Unequivocal progression of existing bone lesions.

           Note: Pathologic fracture, new compression fracture, or complications of bone metastases
           will not be considered as evidence of disease progression, unless one of the
           above-mentioned criteria is fulfilled.

        2. To assess the Quality of Life (QoL) of patients receiving the combination treatment
           palbociclib plus fulvestrant at progression of a combined treatment of hormonal therapy
           (aromatase inhibitor or tamoxifen ± LHRHa) and a CDK4/6 inhibitor.

      Secondary Endpoints:

        1. To evaluate the efficacy of the combination of fulvestrant plus palbociclib at the
           progression of a combined treatment of hormonal therapy (aromatase inhibitor or
           tamoxifen ± LHRHa) and CDK4/6 inhibitors with respect to:

             -  Overall response rate (ORR)

             -  Progression Free Survival (PFS)

             -  Overall Survival (OS)

             -  Safety and tolerability

        2. To assess predictive biomarkers of response/resistance to fulvestrant plus palbociclib
           using metastatic tumor tissue samples and liquid biopsies.

      This study will be performed in pre- and post-menopausal women with HR+/HER2- LABC or MBC
      whose disease is progressing to a CDK4/6 inhibitor in combination with hormonal therapy
      (aromatase inhibitor or tamoxifen ± LHRHa).

      Patients enrolled will receive study medication until disease progression, unacceptable
      toxicity, withdrawal of consent or death, whichever comes first.

      This is a Phase II, multicentre, single-arm study following a Simon's two-stage optimal
      design

      Screening phase At screening, the investigator or his/her authorized designee will assign a
      unique number to patients being considered for the study. The patient should provide a signed
      Informed Consent Form prior to any study screening evaluations. Once the patient Informed
      Consent Form has been signed and eligibility is confirmed (all inclusion/exclusion criteria
      has been verified), the patient can be enrolled. All screening evaluations will be performed
      within 28 days prior to Treatment Day 1. Patients may be re-screened.

      Treatment phase Eligible patients will receive Fulvestrant plus palbociclib. Patients will be
      treated with fulvestrant 500 mg i.m. on Days 1, 15 and 29 and every 28 days thereafter and
      palbociclib125 mg oral day 1 to 21 every 28 days.

      Dose adjustment (reduction, interruption) according to toxicity of study treatment will be
      allowed. Study treatment will continue until one of the following conditions apply -
      whichever comes first:

        -  tumor progression

        -  unacceptable toxicity according to investigator's judgment

        -  death

        -  discontinuation from the study for any other reason Further treatments after
           discontinuation will be at the investigator's discretion. During the study, visits will
           be performed monthly and at the end of treatment. Tumor assessment will be performed
           every 3 cycle of treatment.

      For each patient enrolled in the present study a blood sample (mandatory) at study enrollment
      and at disease progression (mandatory) will be provided. Additionally, a tissue sample from
      the most accessible metastatic site will be collected at study enrollment and at disease
      progression (optional). Blood and tumor samples will be used to investigate the mechanisms of
      response and resistance to therapy with palbociclib in combination with fulvestrant.

    <description>To assess the clinical benefit rate (CBR) of the treatment, the Clinical Benefit Response (CBR) is defined as complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) &gt;24 weeks according to the RECIST version 1.1 recorded in the time period between enrollment and disease progression or death of any cause. CBR with the corresponding 95% Confidence Interval (95% C.I.) will be estimated using the exact binomial method. A Simon optimal two-stage design will be used to exclude a clinical benefit rate (CBR) of 30% (p0 = 0.30) with a clinical relevant target of 40% (p1 = 0.40) using a one-sided alpha-level of 0.05 and a power of 0.80. Fifty-nine (59) subjects will be enrolled in the first phase. If nineteen (19) of fewer CR+PR+SD will be observed, the study will be terminated. Otherwise the treatment will be considered worthy of further investigation and 109 more subjects will be enrolled for a total sample size of 168 subjects.</description>

    <description>Breast cancer-specific quality of life total scale scores and single item scale scores will be summarized by descriptive summary tables at baseline and over time. The mean changes from baseline will also be summarized using descriptive statistics. Longitudinal trajectories of total scale scores will be modelled using linear mixed models with random intercept to account for subject specific baseline assessment; time will be modeled continuously using days since baseline; potential non linear trend will be examined by adding quadratic terms to the model.
