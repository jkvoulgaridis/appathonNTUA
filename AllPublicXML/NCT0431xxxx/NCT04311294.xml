  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol use disorder (AUD) represents a highly prevalent, costly, and often untreated
      condition in the United States. Pharmacotherapy offers a promising avenue for treating AUD
      and for improving clinical outcomes for this debilitating disorder. While developing novel
      medications to treat AUD remains a high priority research area, there are major opportunities
      to refine the process of screening novel compounds.

      A promising novel pharmacology for AUD consists of the ANS-6637 compound which provides novel
      aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) inhibition. Unlike disulfiram, a non-selective and
      irreversible ALDH2 and ALDH1 inhibitor, which produces an aversive flushing response, the
      oral ANS-6637 compound is a selective and reversible inhibitor of ALDH2 that attenuates the
      surge in dopamine (DA). Specifically, a preclinical study found that ANS-6637 blunted the
      surge of DA in ventral tegmental neurons without affecting the basal levels of DA in vivo in
      a rodent model of alcohol seeking behavior. In rodent models, selective and reversible ALDH2
      inhibitors decrease alcohol seeking and taking, prevent operant self-administration, and
      block cue-induced reinstatement. These results suggest that ANS-6637 may be an effective
      treatment to reduce heavy drinking and suppress relapse in individuals with AUD.

      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose response study of ANS-6637. A
      total of 75 men and women with current AUD will be randomly assigned to receive (a) ANS-6637
      (200 mg), (b) ANS-6637 (600 mg), or (c) matched placebo for 7 days. On Day 4, participants
      will complete an fMRI task before and 45-minutes after a priming dose of alcohol (target
      Breath Alcohol Concentration (BrAC) of 0.03 g/dl). On Day 7 participants will return to the
      laboratory to complete an oral alcohol administration paradigm. The successful completion of
      this study will advance medications development for AUD by advancing the development of
      ANS-6637, a novel and promising compound for AUD.

    <description>Participants will complete an oral alcohol challenge and will rate their subjective responses to alcohol at baseline (BrAC = 0.00 g/dl) and at 30, 45, 60, 120, and 180 minutes post alcohol.

    <time_frame>Assessed on Day 4. Scan duration 1 hour.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete a neuroimaging paradigm in which they view alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverage cues and will rate their subjective craving for alcohol.
