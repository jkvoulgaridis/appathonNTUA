  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many patients with neurological diseases suffer from neurogenic lower urinary tract
      dysfunction (NLUTD), which often severely impairs quality of life, due to urinary urgency
      with or without incontinence and voiding dysfunction. In addition, the upper urinary tract
      may be jeopardized because of high intravesical pressure caused by detrusor overactivity (DO)
      with concurrent detrusor-sphincter-dyssynergia and/or low bladder compliance.

      The treatment of NLUTD is a challenge since conventional conservative therapies often fail
      and more invasive treatments such as intradetrusor onabotulinumtoxinA injections, bladder
      augmentation and urinary diversion have to be considered. Neuromodulation therapies including
      tibial nerve stimulation (TNS) may be alternative non-invasive treatment options.

      Indeed, TNS is an effective and safe treatment for idiopathic overactive bladder proven in
      randomised controlled trials (RCTs), but its value in neurological patients is unclear. In a
      recent systematic review, the investigators found evidence that TNS might become a promising
      treatment option for NLUTD, however, more reliable data from well-designed RCTs are urgently
      needed to reach definitive conclusions.

      However, this study will be the first adequately sampled and powered, randomised,
      sham-controlled, double-blind trial assessing transcutaneous TNS (TTNS) for NLUTD. It will
      provide significant insights into the efficacy of TTNS in patients suffering from NLUTD and
      in the case that this treatment is really effective in the neurological population, the
      investigators findings would completely revolutionize the management of NLUTD in daily
      clinical practice. Moreover, this interdisciplinary clinical trial will relevantly influence
      the neurological and urological approach in the management of NLUTD promoting future
      collaborative projects improving patients' medical care and underlying the pioneering role of
      Switzerland in the rapidly developing and ambitious research field of neuro-urology.
