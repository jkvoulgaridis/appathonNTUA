    <textblock>
      Investigators observed the clinical and radiographic healing of periapical lesion using
      Chitosan mixed with calcium hydroxide and compared it with triple antibiotic paste when used
      as intracanal medicament in 3months, 6 months and 12 months.

      Aim: To evaluate and compare the healing of periapical lesions using chitosan mixed with
      calcium hydroxide or Triple Antibiotic Paste at 3,6 and 12 months.

      Methodology:

      20 adult patients having periapical lesions in single rooted teeth were selected in this
      study after being assessed using the PAI index. Patients were randomly assigned to: Group - I
      (n=10) Chitosan with Ca (OH)2 and Group -II (n=10) Triple Antibiotic paste (TAP)

      After access opening and cleaning and shaping were done in the first visit, the pertinent
      intracanal medicaments were placed depending on the patient group. After 4 weeks, on the
      second visit, the medicament was removed andobturation was done in the asymptomatic teeth.
      Both clinical and radiographic endodontic evaluation was done at 0, 3, 6 and 12months using
      the same parameters.

      Radiographic evaluation was done using the PAI Index and was compared at 0, 3, 6, and 12
      months after treatment, Z Test.
