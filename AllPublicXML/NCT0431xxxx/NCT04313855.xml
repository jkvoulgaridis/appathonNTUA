  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic post-operative pain is generally defined by persistent pain more than 2 months after
      surgery. General reviews on chronic post-operative pain describe an overall incidence of 30%,
      of which 5 to 10% are described as severe. Different risk factors have been identified: pain
      and preoperative opioid use, anxiety - depression, catastrophism, type of surgery, intensity
      and duration of postoperative pain, genetic factors.

      If postoperative pain is essentially pain caused by excess nociceptive stimulation,
      investigators realize that a neuropathic component is far from being exceptional and that
      this can be demonstrated quickly after surgery. In addition, these neuropathic pains respond
      little or no to the usual analgesics and in particular to opioids, which can be the cause of
      misuse or death from overdose. Early detection of pain of a neuropathic nature would allow
      appropriate therapy to be put in place and may therefore reduce the risk of chronic
      postoperative pain.

      The concept of ambulatory surgery assumes that postoperative pain will be minimal and can be
      controlled at home by the administration of oral pain relievers. However, following the
      development of surgical techniques and the improvement in the quality of care, the number and
      complexity of procedures that can be performed in ambulatory surgery have increased
      considerably. Consequently, a significant number of patients will probably develop chronic
      post-operative pain without the possibility of early detection. The prevalence of chronic
      post-operative pain in ambulatory surgery has been studied by a single team. The authors
      conclude that it is underestimated and variable depending on the surgery between 15 and 32%.

      For the past few years, the GHPSJ has been using an ambulatory surgery algorithm that sends
      SMS messages to warn and follow up on patients. The principle is simple: patients scheduled
      for outpatient surgery receive text messages the day before their intervention to remind them
      of the instructions to be followed and the meeting times and, the day after the operation,
      the algorithm sends SMS to ask patients if all is well or if they have pain, nausea or
      vomiting, discharge from the scar. In postoperative monitoring, this technology has shown
      promising results.

      This technology has not been used in the screening of persistent pain. The objective of this
      work is to assess the effectiveness of an SMS algorithm in the early detection of
      postoperative neuropathic pain after surgery performed on an outpatient basis.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a prospective case-control diagnostic study nestled in a cohort. The cohort is the set of patients operated on ambulatory surgery on the GHPSJ. In this cohort, pain patients according to the doctor's opinion are the cases. The controls are the patients who are not painful according to the doctor's opinion.
For reasons of available consultation time slots, it is not possible to see all of the patients. It was therefore decided to see all the painful patients and to select by lot the painless patients.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>7 days after the intervention, the patient receives a standardized questionnaire by SMS, to determine whether the patient has pain at the operating site and whether this pain has the characteristics of neuropathic pain. After replying to the SMS, the patient will be contacted by phone to assess: the intensity of pain at the operating site using a numerical scale and the existence of neuropathic pain. Depending on the responses received by SMS and/or phone, a consultation appointment with an anesthesiologist specializing in pain may be offered within a maximum of 2 weeks.
Ninety days after your surgery, the patient receives the same standardized questionnaire by SMS. The patient will be contacted by telephone, in order to assess the intensity of pain at the operating site and the existence of neuropathic pain using. If the patient has post-operative pain, a consultation appointment with an anesthesiologist specializing in pain will be offered to him within a maximum of 2 weeks.</description>
