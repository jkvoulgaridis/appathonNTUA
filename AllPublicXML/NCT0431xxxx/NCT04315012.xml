  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endocrine hormonal therapy (EHT) applied to avoid recurrence and metastasis of the breast
      cancer has also side effects which do not threaten life; however, it does negatively effects
      quality of life. The objective of this study was to determine the effects on quality of life
      of a mobile app-based (e-mobile) education for supportive care of patients with breast cancer
      receiving adjuvant endocrine hormonal therapy. The data were collected to with face to face
      and/or telephone interviews at 2 time points: prior to the initiation (T0) and after the
      completion (T1) of mobile app-based education. Patients were received education via mobile
      app for 12 weeks during which they were contacted in every 15 days; a mobile app-based
      (e-mobile) education was provided, including information about breast cancer definition,
      treatment process, symptoms management, adequate nutrition, regular physical activity and
      coping with stress. In this process, the control group patients were provided with standard
      care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mobile devices have an increasing role for the patient care and its use in the field of
      oncology creates promising opportunities for supportive cancer care and patient education.
      Mobile applications were established for the supportive cancer care but their area of use is
      limited. Although there are many field specific medical mobile applications, there are few
      training programs for the benefit of patients. However, these are innovative tools and
      provide accessibility, individual training and consultancy in order for the patients to be
      able to cope with side effects of the treatment; thus, improving their quality of life,
      symptom management and distress.

    <measure>Functional Assessment for the Cancer Treatment - Endocrine Symptoms Quality of Life Scale (FACT-ES QLS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline Quality of Life at 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The scale includes five sub dimensions and total of 46 items measuring the well-being of patients within the course of the last 7 days. There are sub dimensions for each of the following: physical well-being (7 items, 0-28 points), social/family well-being (7 items, 0-28 points), emotional well-being (6 items, 0-24 points), functional well-being (7 items, 0-28 points) and endocrine symptoms (19 items, 0-76 points). Endocrine symptoms' subdimension contains symptoms related to the side effects of EHT. The range of total points of the scale is 0-184. It shows that quality of life increases as total points of the scale increase. It shows that quality of life decreases as total points of the scale decrease.</description>
