  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this project is to compare the absolute quantification of myocardial
      perfusion done by using CT myocardial perfusion imaging (CT-MPI) and the coronary flow
      measured by using CT Fractional Flow Reserve analysis (CT-FFR) to the gold standard
      represented by PET myocardial perfusion imaging (PET-MPI).

      Participants will be patients who are scheduled to undergo PET Myocardial Perfusion Imaging,
      which is the traditional method for evaluating patients with suspected blockages or narrowing
      of the heart vessels (coronary artery disease) causing impaired blood to flow to the heart
      muscle (myocardium).

      The purpose of the study is to determine and compare the newest heart imaging equipment which
      allows the non-invasive evaluation of coronary anatomy, coronary flow and myocardial
      perfusion in patients with suspected or proven coronary artery disease (CAD) with the actual
      gold-standard for quantitative myocardial perfusion assessment. In order to achieve this aim,
      the study team will compare heart scan results from a computed tomography (CT) Myocardial
      Perfusion Imaging (CT-MPI) scan and CT-Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR) with the actual standard
      clinical care represented by a PET Myocardial Perfusion Imaging (PET-MPI) study.

    <description>For the CT-MPI, dynamic volume CT myocardial perfusion applying the &quot;dynamic shuttle&quot; mode will be used to rapidly cover the entire cardiac anatomy during infusion of a contrast medium bolus for monitoring bolus passage through the left ventricular myocardium. The &quot;dynamic shuttle&quot; mode consists of an image acquisition during rapid, yet smooth back-and-forth movement of the CT scanner table, so that contrast media bolus passage can be evaluated within the entire left ventricle in a time-resolved fashion. This scan acquisition will be performed during pharmacologically induced stress and during rest conditions. CT-MPI studies will be contrast medium enhanced by 50-70 ml of iodinated contrast agent, administered at a flow rate of 5 mL/s.</description>

    <description>Coronary CT angiography (CCTA) will be performed for delineation of the coronary arteries, detection of potential coronary stenosis and FFR calculation. CCTA will be performed at rest following administration of intravenous contrast agent (50-70 mL of iodinated contrast material at a flow rate of 4-5 mL/s). A total radiation dose of approximately 8 millisievert (mSv) has expected to be administered with the stress/rest protocol to the patient. The total amount of contrast agent will not exceed 140 ml.</description>
