    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to record the use of Infliximab (IFX) in the treatment of
      Chinese children with Crohn's disease (CD) in routine clinical practice and to summarize the
      clinical efficacy and safety of IFX in the treatment of pediatric CD.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants with Clinical Response at Week 14</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 14</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants with clinical response at week 14 will be reported. Clinical response is defined as a decrease of PCDAI &gt;=15 and total PCDAI &lt;=30.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AE) as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 102 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical event that occurs in a participant administered an investigational product, and it does not necessarily indicate only events with clear causal relationship with the relevant investigational product.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants with Clinical Remission at Week 14</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 14</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants with clinical remission at week 14 will be reported. Clinical remission is defined as the total PCDAI &lt;=10.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants with Endoscopic Remission at Week 30</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 30</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants with endoscopic remission at week 30 will be reported. Endoscopic remission is defined as a total simple endoscopic sore for CD (SES-CD) 0-2. SES-CD is an endoscopic scoring system for CD. It is based on the score of 0-3 of the following four endoscopic variables: ulcer size, ulcerated and affected surfaces, and stenosis determined in five ileocolonic segment.</description>
