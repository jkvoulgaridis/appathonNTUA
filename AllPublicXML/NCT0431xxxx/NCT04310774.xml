      This is a single institute, single-arm, interventional trial to evaluate the efficacy and
      toxicity of concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) followed by Tegafur, Gimeracil and Oteracil
      Potassium Capsules consolidation chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced cervical
      cancer. The main inclusive criteria are as follows: histology confirmed cervical cancer;
      18-70 years old; 2018 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage
      IIB-IIIC2; ECOG score &lt;=1 point. The estimated enrollment is 200 patients. After enrollment,
      patients will receive CCRT, including external beam radiotherapy, intracavitary brachytherapy
      and concurrent chemotherapy. One month after the completion of CCRT, patients will receive 6
      cycles of Tegafur, Gimeracil and Oteracil Potassium Capsules consolidation chemotherapy. The
      primary endpoint is progression free survival. And the secondary endpoints include overall
      survival, distant metastasis-free survival, local regional recurrence-free survival, acute
      toxicities, late toxicities, and treatment compliance.
