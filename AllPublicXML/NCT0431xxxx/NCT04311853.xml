      The goal of this study is to field test ADA's Type 2 Diabetes Evidence-Based nutrition
      Practice Guidelines (EBNPG) for Adults in 2008 as a tool for registered dietitians (RDs) for
      their patients with with type 2 diabetes who have no evidence of organ damage. A six month
      pilot study will be conducted to determine the feasibility of training RDs in documenting the
      outcomes of implementing Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT) using ADA's evidence-based GL for
      T2D.
