  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to evaluate the detection rate and characteristics of prostate cancer among
      males with PSA values between 2.5 and 4.0 ng/mL in Nanjing, meanwhile, to access the
      effectiveness of conducting multi-parametric MRI (mpMRI) after PSA assay.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are going to collect serum samples and clinical information from men aged
      ≥50 years in community health service centers in Nanjing. The investigators will propose
      mpMRI for those met our criteria of PSA values between 2.5 and 4.0 ng/ml. Transperineal
      systematic biopsy and MRI/ultrasound fusion targeted biopsy will be offered for those who
      scored ≥3 points on the Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System Version 2 (PI-RADS v2).
      Follow-up examinations annually will be offered for those with a PI-RADS score ＜3. Sequences
      obtained while conducting mpMRI included T2‑weighted imaging, diffusion‑weighted imaging, and
      dynamic contrast-enhanced using a 3.0‑T system.
