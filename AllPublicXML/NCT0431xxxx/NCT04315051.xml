      Double-Blind, Randomized, Placebo Controlled Trial of the Safety and Efficacy of DBI-001 Gel
      in Patients with Interdigital Tinea pedis (T. pedis). The primary objective is to observe the
      antimicrobial effect of a daily application of DBI-001Gel for 4 weeks in patients with
      interdigital T. pedis based on the change from culture positive for a dermatophyte to culture
      negative as determined by routine mycology culture.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must meet all of the following criteria to be included in the study:

               1. A signed approved informed consent form by Institutional Review Board/Independent
                  Ethics Committee.

               2. A signed Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
                  authorization form which permits the use and disclosure of subject's individually
                  identifiable health information.

               3. Male or Female Subjects of any race 18 years of age and older.

               4. Women patients of child-bearing potential must: a. Have negative urine pregnancy
                  tests prior to study treatment to rule out pregnancy, and b. Use at least one
                  method of birth control that results in a low failure rate (i.e. less than 1% per
                  year) when used consistently and correctly such as implants, injectables,
                  combined oral contraceptives, some intrauterine devices (IUDs), sexual abstinence
                  or vasectomized partner for the duration of study participation.

               5. Subjects with a clinical diagnosis of interdigital T. pedis T. pedis interdigital
                  defined as lesions localized to the interdigital spaces or predominantly
                  interdigital, but may extend to other areas of the foot (the non-interdigital
                  lesions should not be hyperkeratotic, i.e., characteristic of tinea pedis
                  moccasin).

               6. Provisionally confirmed diagnosis at screening by a positive potassium hydroxide
                  (KOH) wet mount at the clinical site.

               7. A positive dermatophyte culture from the sample obtained at the screening visit.

               8. The sum of the clinical signs and symptoms scores of at least one web space
                  (Target web space) is at least 4 using the Grading of Signs and Symptoms of T.
                  pedis including a minimum score of at least 2 for erythema AND a minimum score of
                  2 for either scaling/fissures or pruritus/burning (on a scale of 0-3, where 2
                  indicates moderate severity).

               9. Target web space should have adequate amount of leading-edge scale to provide
                  enough scale for KOH, fungal culture and molecular diagnostics.

                  Exclusion Criteria:

                  Subjects with the following will be excluded from this study:

               1. Females who are pregnant, planning a pregnancy, breastfeeding or have a positive
                  pregnancy test at the site.

               2. Any dermatological conditions that could interfere with clinical evaluations.

               3. The clinical diagnosis of moccasin T. pedis.

               4. Any underlying disease(s) or some other dermatological condition that requires
                  the use of interfering topical or systemic therapy.

               5. Subjects that have not undergone the specified washout period(s) or subjects who
                  require the concurrent use of specific topical medications applied to the foot.

               6. Subjects that have not undergone the washout periods for systemic medications or
                  who require the use of specific systemic medications.

               7. Treatment of any type of cancer within the last 6 months.

               8. History of any significant internal disease (which contraindicates use of live
                  microbiome e.g. leukemia, liver failure, cardiovascular disease).

               9. Subjects who are known to be allergic to any of the Test Article(s) or any
                  components in the Test Article(s) or history of hypersensitivity or allergic
                  reactions to any of the study preparations as described in the Investigator's
                  Brochure.

              10. AIDS or AIDS related complex by medical history.

              11. Known or suspected immune suppressive medications or diseases.

              12. Diabetes mellitus Type I or II by medical history.

              13. Peripheral vascular disease based on medical history.

              14. Any subject not able to meet the study attendance requirements.

              15. Subjects who have participated in any other trial of an investigational drug or
                  device within 30 days prior to enrollment or participation in a research study
