  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter study investigating
      magrolimab + azacitidine compared to placebo + azacitidine in previously untreated patients
      with intermediate/high/very high risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) by Revised International
      Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R). The Primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of
      magrolimab + azacitidine, compared to that of placebo + azacitidine, in previously untreated
      patients with intermediate/high/very high risk MDS by IPSS-R as measured by Complete
      Remission (CR) and duration of CR.
