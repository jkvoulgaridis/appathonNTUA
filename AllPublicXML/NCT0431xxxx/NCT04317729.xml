  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this trial is to evaluate the performance of the Fujirebio INNOTEST® HCV Ab IV
      using simpler collection methods such as fingerstick and venous whole blood collection on
      dried blood spots (DBS). In order to assess performance in samples with high and low antibody
      titres, performance will be evaluated with undiluted samples of all trial participants and
      serial diluted samples for a subset of HCV antibody reactive samples. Serial dilution of
      reactive samples will provide further insights into the potential difference of sensitivity
      in samples collected on DBS versus plasma.

      Results of this trial will also support the update of the regulatory claims to include DBS as
      an alternative sample type.

      Access to Hepatitis C virus (HCV) screening in resource-limited settings should be enabled
      not only through the provision of point-of-care screening tests, but also through the
      possibility of collecting samples in decentralized settings One possible way of
      decentralizing sample collection is collecting dried blood spot (DBS) specimens, which can be
      easily transported to testing laboratories, not requiring any cold chain or complex sample
      transportation. DBS serology screening is complementary to established point-point-of care
      screening with rapid diagnostic tests, both methodologies being somewhat less cost-effective
      and less sensitive compared to lab-based methods but suitable for settings without
      sophisticated infrastructure.

      To date, no HCV antibody serology test is formally evaluated for the use with DBS, however
      several studies on off-label use of DBS in serology screening assays, suggests that this
      sample type can serve as an alternative to plasma and serum. Fujirebio's enzyme immunoassay
      (EIA) INNOTEST® HCV Ab IV is CE marked and has received pre-qualification by the World Health
      Organization (WHO) for the use with venous plasma and serum, which require special equipment
      for sample collection, sample preparation and temperature controlled transportation.

      Available data on the performance of HCV antibody detection from DBS samples are insufficient
      to introduce their use in clinical practice. Fujirebio is one of the few manufacturers who
      have an EIA test pre-qualified by the WHO for the use with plasma and serum to detect
      anti-HCV antibodies. A prospective diagnostic accuracy trial of the Fujirebio INNOTEST® HCV
      Ab IV assay in fWB and vWB collected on DBS, using EDTA plasma results obtained with the
      Fujirebio INNOTEST® HCV Ab IV assay as reference standard is needed to understand the
      relationship between results generated in plasma and WB samples collected on DBS.
      Furthermore, the data generated can be used by Fujirebio to update their regulatory claims
      and include DBS as an alternative sample type.
