  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial intends to investigate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of ularitide
      on the renal response in patients with liver cirrhosis and refractory ascites for a maximum
      exposure duration of 48 hours, through a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind,
      single-center trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that ularitide infusion is more effective than placebo to
      induce and maintain clinically meaningful natriuresis and diuresis in patients with liver
      cirrhosis and refractory ascites.

      Participants will be given ularitide or placebo intravenously while hospitalized at
      Department of Hepatology and Gastroenterology at Aarhus University Hospital. During the
      hospitalization blood and urine samples are frequently collected.

      30 ng/kg/min is the starting dosage for all participants. Depending on effects and/or side
      effects, ULA04 is designed to individualize treatment doses by up- and/or downtitration of
      the infusion dose within a predefined dose range. Relevant safety precautions are
      incorporated in the study design and treatment will be prematurely discontinued if a
      pre-defined stopping criteria presents.

      Patients will be followed up for the appearance of serious adverse events 30 days after the
      treatment.

      If a separate written consent is given by the participants, additional blood and urine
      samples will be collected and stored in a biobank for future research.
