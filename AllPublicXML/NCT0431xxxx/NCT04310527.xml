  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-center, randomized, three-period, two-sequence crossover study
      in healthy adult subjects to occur at one site in the United States. This study will evaluate
      the relative Bioavailability (BA) of an enasidenib sprinkle formulation, compared to the
      reference tablet formulation, when taken in the fasted state. This study will also evaluate
      the Pharmacokinetics (PK) of the enasidenib sprinkle formulation after a single oral dose in
      the fed state to assess the food effect. The study will consist of a Screening phase, a
      Treatment phase, and a Follow-up phone call. Approximately 28 healthy adult subjects (males
      or non-pregnant females) will be enrolled.

             any study-related assessments/procedures being conducted.

          2. Subject is willing and able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol
             requirements.

          3. Subject is male, or non-pregnant and non-nursing female ≥ 18 and ≤ 55 years of age at

             a. Have been surgically sterilized (hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; proper
             documentation required) at least 6 months before Screening, or be postmenopausal
             (defined as 24 consecutive months without menses before Screening, with a
             follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH] level of &gt; 40 IU/L at Screening).

          5. Females of childbearing potential (FCBP)1 may participate, providing they meet the
             following conditions:

             • Agree to practice true abstinence2 from sexual intercourse or to use highly
             effective contraceptive methods (eg, combined [containing estrogen and progestogen] or
             progestogen-only associated with inhibition of ovulation, oral, injectable,
             intravaginal ring (e.g. vaginal hormonal ring), patch, or implantable hormonal
             contraceptive; bilateral tubal occlusion; intra-uterine device; intrauterine
             hormone-releasing system; or male partner sterilization [note that vasectomized
             partner is a highly effective birth control method provided that partner is the sole
             sexual partner of the Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) trial participant and
             that the vasectomized partner has received medical assessment of the surgical

             within 72 hours prior to the start of study treatment in the Treatment Phase (note
             that the screening serum pregnancy test can be used as the test prior to the start of
             study treatment in the Treatment Phase if it is performed within the 72-hour
             timeframe).

          6. Male subjects must:

             a. Practice true abstinence3 (which must be reviewed on a monthly basis and source
             documented) or agree to use a barrier method of birth control (condoms not made out of
             natural [animal] membrane [latex condoms are recommended]) during sexual contact with
             a pregnant female or FCBP while participating in the study and for at least 2 months
             after the last dose of Investigational product (IP), even if he has undergone a
             successful vasectomy.

          7. Subject has body mass index (BMI) ≥ 18 and ≤ 33 kg/m2 at Screening.

          8. Subject has a satisfactory medical assessment with no clinically significant or
             relevant abnormalities determined by medical history, PE, vital signs, 12-lead ECG,
             and clinical laboratory evaluation (hematology, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis)
             that are reasonably likely to interfere with the subject's participation in, or
             ability to complete the study as assessed by the Investigator.

             a. Subject vital signs are as follows:

             - Tympanic body temperature:35.0 - 37.5°C.

             - Supine blood pressure (BP) after at least 5 minutes supine rest: i. Systolic BP: 90
             - 140 mmHg ii. Diastolic BP: 40 - 90 mmHg b. Supine heart rate (after at least 5
             minutes of rest):

             - 45 - 90 beats per minute (measured during vital sign assessment)

             - Subject has a normal or clinically acceptable 12-lead ECG at Screening.

        In addition:

        i. If male, subject has a QT interval corrected for heart rate using Fridericia's formula

             12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical laboratory evaluation (hematology,
             clinical chemistry, and urinalysis) that would place the subject at unacceptable risk
             or prevent the subject from participating in the study.

          2. Subject has any condition that confounds the ability to interpret data from the study.

                  resections, irritable bowel syndrome, etc. are exclusionary at any time prior to
                  Screening.

               2. Acute conditions such as dysentery or acute gastroenteritis are exclusionary if
                  they resolved less than 14 days before Screening.

               3. Appendectomy and cholecystectomy are acceptable.

             drugs or alcohol.

          9. Subject is known to have any viral hepatitis infection (including carrier state) or
             has a positive result to the tests for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis
             C virus antibody (HCV Ab), or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies at
