  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an effective treatment for MDD, but
      the overall effect sized of the treatment is equivalent to antidepressant pharmacotherapy,
      and responses are highly variable. Given that rTMS is usually given to patients who have
      failed pharmacotherapy, a more effective alternative is needed.

      Therefore, this study will combine computerized cognitive training (CCT) during standard rTMS
      treatments and assess its feasibility, tolerability, and changes in cognitive control
      performance and depression symptoms.

      Participants that agree to the study and meet eligibility will receive standard rTMS
      (generally 25-36 daily treatments) along with CCT (starting on day 5 of treatment until the
      pre-taper treatment). In addition, to CCT participants will be asked to complete assessments
      before and after treatment

      This project will also have a registry for participants that are approached to be in the
      clinical trial with the CCT but don't wish to be enrolled. Although the registry will be
      available for these participants, the information entered into this ClinicalTrials.gov
      registration will reflect the clinical trial portion of this project.

    <description>After having four rTMS sessions without CCT, the patients will perform CCT (starting day 5) during the rTMS session, which typically last from 20-40 minutes. A course of rTMS therapy includes from 25-36 treatments, given daily, until the last 5-6 treatments, given as a 'taper' over 2 weeks. CCT will be paired with rTMS up until the taper begins. In addition, they will have assessments prior to and after the therapy.</description>
