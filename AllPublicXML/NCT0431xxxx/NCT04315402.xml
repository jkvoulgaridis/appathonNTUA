  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The race concordance of providers to their patients impacts a patient's investment and agency
      in the patient-provider relationship. The mistrust of medicine within the African American
      population remains and patients feel unengaged in their care. Race concordant
      provider-patient rela-tionships would improve the equity of patient care in our clinic.

    <textblock>
      The patients of the obstetrics and gynecology resident clinic at Good Samaritan Hospital have
      a poor follow-up rate for their gynecologic and prenatal care visits. In addition, patients
      oftentimes voice frustration over the care that they receive and sometimes remark that they
      feel their provider was &quot;racist.&quot; These patients often have complex social situations that
      cannot be solved in one office visit but perhaps the providers' ability to gain the trust of
      the minority patients is inadequate. The residents in the OB/GYN program are 80% white with
      no African American representation. If patients are unable to connect with caregivers due to
      cross-cultural differences, this could be remedied by training current residents in
      cross-cultural communication or re-cruitment of a resident class more representative of the
      majority African American patient population. This project will provide perspective on the
      minority patients' needs in the provider-patient relationship and allow providers to
      reexamine their ability to gain trust with the ultimate goal to increase follow-up rates.
      Follow-up rates for prenatal care are directly linked to improved maternal and fetal
      outcomes. The investigators goals are threefold: to gain clarity on whether or not a more
      diverse resident group would be helpful in gaining the trust of patients, to assess the
      current state of the well-established historical and generational mistrust of medical care by
      the African American patients of the clinic, and to explore how patient perception of their
      provider impacts their rate of follow up in the large community hospital clinic.
