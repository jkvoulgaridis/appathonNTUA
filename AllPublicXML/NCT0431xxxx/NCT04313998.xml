  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, with the rising prevalence of obesity among children, the incidence of type
      2 diabetes in children and adolescents has continued to be increased. Some studies have found
      that impaired glucose metabolism appeared in 10-20% obese children. A large multicenter study
      project for children and adolescents showed that the prevalence of type 2 diabetes among
      children in the United States increased by 30.5% between 2001 and 2009. In addition, diabetes
      in children and adolescents, especially type 2 diabetes, has become more and more &quot;younger&quot;.
      Diabetes appears in adolescence, which indicates that the damage of diabetes may come
      earlier, and it also has a significant impact on life quality and long-term survival. In
      recent years, more and more studies have shown that many adverse factors in the perinatal
      period would increase the risk of offspring suffering from metabolic diseases such as obesity
      and diabetes. Early life environmental factors would change the transcription and expression
      of obesity and diabetes-related genes through epigenetic regulation without changing the
      nucleotide sequence of the gene, then affecting the function of the gene and leading to
      diseases. Compared with the control group, pre-pregnant obese mothers and gestational
      diabetes mothers had higher DNA methylation levels in placenta leptin, which led to
      differences in the expression of leptin of offspring. A recent meta-analysis shows that the
      exposure to various social and environmental factors (diet, sleep, stress, bad habits, etc.)
      during pregnancy will affect the offspring. Due to the expression or methylation of CpG
      islands, these changes eventually lead to a variety of diseases including diabetes of
      offspring. However, most of previous researches mainly focused on the genetics or
      environmental factors. Meanwhile, most of the research focused on the Caucasian population.
      The differences between Asians and Westerners were few reported.

      Study Design: Prospective observational cohort study. Aim: To explore the effect of maternal
      sleep during pregnancy on offspring's growth and metabolism and the potential epigenetic
      mechanism.

      Participants: Pregnant women with Gestational Diabetes Mellitus(GDM) and their children.

      Study Procedure: Pregnant women with GDM were recruited during late pregnancy, and the
      children were followed up at birth, 42 days after birth, 3month, 6month, 12month, 18month and
      24month. Demographic information, physical examination, developmental and psychiatric
      assessment, diet, and physical activity, as well as biological samples were collected for
      further study.

    <measure>Maternal sleep measured by Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index(PSQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>changes from late pregnancy,3 month, 6month, 9month, 12month, 18month, 24 month,36month,48month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The PSQI total score represents the sum of component scores for subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleep medicine, and daytime dysfunction. A PSQI score &gt;5 defined poor sleep quality. Higher scores implied lower sleep quality or more severe sleep disturbance.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep assessment was a major part of the study. A 7-day assessment of mothers' sleep quality was conducted during the third trimester by using Actiwatch (AMI) and sleep diary. AMI is a sleep assessment system based on monitoring individual activity whose evaluation point is based on the sleep diary.</description>

    <description>Child weight and length/height as well as BMI (calculated by weight divided by the square of length/height) were obtained at each visit. Weight was measured using calibrated scales (Seca 335, Hamburg, Germany) and length was measured from the top of the head to the soles of feet using the same calibrated scale as weight. From 6 month，childrens' arm circumference, triceps and subscapular skinfold thicknesses were also measured.</description>

    <description>Cord blood samples were collected from the umbilical vein immediately after delivery, then were stored at 4 ℃ for a maximumof 4 h. They were then centrifuged, aliquoted, and stored in liquid nitrogen (-80℃) until assayed. DNA methylation was measured on bisulfite-converted genomic DNA in the company using the Illumina Infinium Human Methylation EPIC BeadChip (850k).</description>

    <description>Infant sleep problems reported by the mother and according to Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire (BISQ). It is not a scale. The variables of the questionnaire included 1) nocturnal sleep duration (between the hours of 7 pm and 7 am); 2) daytime sleep duration (between the hours of 7 am and 7 pm); 3) number of night wakenings; 4) duration of wakefulness during the night hours (10 pm to 6 am); 5) nocturnal sleep-onset time (the time when the child falls asleep for the night); 6) settling time (latency to falling asleep for the night); 7) method of falling asleep; 8) location of sleep; 9) preferred body position; 10) age of child; 11) gender of child; 12) birth order; and 13) role of the responder who completed the BISQ. If the child woke up more than 3 times per night, spent more than 1 hour in wakefulness during the night, or spent less than 9 hours in sleep (day and night), then they were considered as poor sleepers.</description>
