    <textblock>
      Background:

      Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is a partial CB1/CB2 agonist and causes its pharmacological
      effects by binding to cannabinoid receptors. CB1 receptors are predominantly located in the
      brain (highest densities at hippocampus, cerebellum and the striatum) and at low levels in
      the brainstem. CB2 receptors are predominantly in the spleen and in hematopoietic cells. THC
      is highly lipophilic and is readily absorbed and distributed to the brain and other organs.

      Most of the neuropsychological studies carried out so far show that the mainly affected
      neurocognitive functions in cannabis users are: memory, attention, psychomotor capacity,
      speed of information processing and alterations of executive functions (resistance to
      interference, planning capacity, decision-making, verbal fluency and working memory). These
      effects are dose-dependent.

      Hypothesis:

      Functional CB1 receptor activation by the THC contained in the cannabis flos will induce
      dose-dependent effects on EEG, physiological functions and behavior:

        1. EEG alterations.

        2. Increase in cannabis subjective effects.

        3. Increase in heart rate.

        4. Increase in psychopathology scale Psychotomimetic State Inventory (PSI) score.

        5. Increase in plasma cortisol concentrations.

      Objectives:

      Main pharmacodynamic objective: To assess the effects of Cannabis flos on
      electroencephalography (EEG) in healthy recreational cannabis users.

      Secondary pharmacodynamic objectives: (i) To assess the effects of Cannabis flos on: cannabis
      subjective effects, heart rate and psychopathology scale; (ii) To establish the
      pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationships between THC plasma concentrations and
      pharmacodynamic endpoints.

      Safety and tolerability objectives: To assess the safety and tolerability of THC in these
      subjects.

      Methods:

      Phase I, prospective, monocentric, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel
      group study to assess the THC effects on EEG neural oscillations in 16 healthy subjects with
      recreational cannabis use.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to either Arm A (Cannabis) or Arm B
      (Cannabis placebo). The subjects, Investigators and designees involved in the conduct of the
      study will be blinded to the identity of the treatment administered during the study.

      In the active group (Arm A) subjects will be administered four single doses of 20 mg THC over
      3 days, equivalent to 285.7 μg/kg. This dose is considered to be sufficient for eliciting the
      psychoactive effects of THC (&gt; 5 ng/mL in plasma) and modify EEG, avoiding subjects to be too
      much behaviorally impaired.

      THC will be administered in the form of medical cannabis (Bedrocan®) inhaled by
      intrapulmonary route. It is featured in flos form (Cannabis sativa dried female flower)
      containing THC 22% and cannabidiol (CBD) &lt;1%. A vaporization system (Mighty® Medic device)
      will be used for cannabis administration. Through this system, the final inhalation of THC is
      comparable to that of smoking cannabis while reducing the inhalation of toxic and irritating
      substances generated in the combustion of herbs.

    <masking_description>The subjects, Investigators and designees involved in the conduct of the study will be blinded to the identity of the treatment administered during the study.
The following precautions will be taken to ensure the integrity of the study blinding during the trial:
The monodose capsules containing the treatment conditions will be prepared by an unblinded technician who will not be involved in any study assessment. The unblinded technician will also maintain records for drug accountability.
Treatment will not be unblinded for an individual subject except for a medical emergency.</masking_description>
