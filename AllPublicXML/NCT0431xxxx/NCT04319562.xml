  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of treating subthreshold
      depression by needle-embedding therapy. On this basis, the investigators will discuss the
      mechanism of needle-embedding therapy improving executive function control system.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The needle-embedding therapy is a method of acupuncture, which inserts the intradermal
      thumbtack needle into skin quickly. The needle will be replaced after 2 or 3 days. This
      treatment has a great efficacy on subthreshold depression (SD) and it is easy to promote.
      However, its clinical effect remains to be studied. In this study, the researchers used this
      method to treat SD by selecting the back shu acupoint and ear acupoint.

      This research aims to evaluate the effectiveness of treating subthreshold depression by
      needle-embedding therapy. On this basis, from the perspective of psychology, this project
      takes the cognitive function of the SD people as the entry point, in order to find the
      scientific indicators to quantify the SD people clinically from the perspective of the
      executive function control system. At the same time, magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) was used
      to compare and analyze the brain executive control system of subthreshold depression group
      and normal group, and to observe the specificity of brain structure, network and function of
      subthreshold depression group. Finally, through the comparative analysis of the brain
      executive control system of the subthreshold depression group with intradermal thumbtack
      needle therapy and shame intradermal thumbtack needle therapy, the neural mechanism of
      needle-embedding therapy promoting the function reset of the brain executive control system
      was speculated based on the evaluation of the efficacy of needle-embedding therapy.

      80 patients will be divided into two groups randomly, intradermal thumbtack needle group or
      shame intradermal thumbtack needle group, and evaluated before and after intervention.

      The primary study outcomes will be depressive symptoms as measured by the PHQ-9. Secondary
      outcomes will be the ability of executive control system, health-related quality of life and
      anxiety symptoms measured as described previously. Tertiary outcomes will be the difference
      between the results of fMRI of SD people and normal brain database, and the difference
      between the treatment group and control group, which can observe the specificity of brain
      structure, network and function in subthreshold depression.

      The results will be analyzed and presented descriptively, as of statistical comparisons of
      pre- and post-treatment and the relationship between the groups.

    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 weeks, 1-, 3-, 6- and 12-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The PHQ-9 questionnaire can directly reflect the subjective feelings of depressed patients and their changes in treatment. As a severity measure, the PHQ-9 score can range from 0 to 27. since each of the 9 items can be scored from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). The higher the score, the more severe the depressive symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Change of attention network test(ANT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Combined with spatial cue task and flanker task, Attention Network Test can effectively measure different Attention Network effects. ANT can represent three different attention networks (alertness effect, orientation effect and executive control effect).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of psychomotor vigilance task (PVT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) is a sustained-attention, reaction-timed task that measures the speed with which subjects respond to a visual stimulus. Research indicates increased sleep debt or sleep deficit correlates with deteriorated alertness, slower problem-solving, declined psycho-motor skills, and increased rate of false responding.</description>

    <description>This questionnaire can reflect the patients' health-related quality of life.SF-12 score ranges from 0 [lowest level of health] to 100 [highest level of health].</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Difference of Functional magnetic resonance imaging scans between two group.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Before the intervention, 40 people were randomly selected to complete the fMRI examination, and the results were compared with the normal brain database. After the intervention, all subjects underwent MR examination, and the treatment group and the control group were compared with each other.
The signal of the function, gray matter fiber and white matter fiber of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) were extracted from the resting-state fMRI data. These signal will be calculated the functional network of the brain based on graph theory. Therefore, the investigator will compare the difference between two groups.</description>

    <description>First group is comprised of Xinshu (BL15), Ganshu (BL18), Juque (CV14) bilaterally, and Xin and Gan of auricular point on the left ear. Second group includes Shentang (BL44), Hunmen (BL47), Jiuwei (RN15) bilaterally, and Xin and Gan of auricular point on the right side.
After skin cleansing with a 75% alcohol swab, intradermal thumbtack needle will be quickly inserted into the skin and embedded at acupoints mentioned above bilaterally. The needles will remain in the acupoints for 3 days and they will be removed by the therapists at next visit. This also can ensure better implementation of the blind method.Participants are required to receive this treatment twice a week. The specification of the needle used in the back shu point is φ9mm 0.20×1.5mm (Seirin® PYONEX; Seirin Corporation, Shizuoka, Japan), that in the auricular point is φ9mm 0.20×0.6mm (Seirin® PYONEX; Seirin Corporation, Shizuoka, Japan).</description>

    <description>The acupoint selection in this group is the same as in the needle-embedding therapy group, except that the shame intradermal needles will be used. After skin cleansing with a 75% alcohol swab, the shame intradermal needles，instead of insert into the skin, it can only stick on the surface of the skin. It also will be removed by the therapists after 3 days. This takes place twice a week. The specification of the shame needle is the same as above.</description>
