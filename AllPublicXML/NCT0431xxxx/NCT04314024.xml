    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the relative bioavailability (rBA) of the intended commercial tablet
      formulation (Test Treatment, TF2) of Evobrutinib compared to the clinical tablet formulation
      (Reference Treatment, TF1) of Evobrutinib and to assess the effect of food on the
      bioavailability of the intended commercial tablet formulation of Evobrutinib.

             such abuse as indicated by the laboratory assays conducted during screening
