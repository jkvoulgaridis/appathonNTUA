    <textblock>
      The objective of the protocol is to test the impact of Omega 3-6 on pre-specified biological
      signatures (IL-1β, IL-2, and IFNγ) and to correlate changes in the biological signatures with
      changes in ASD symptoms.

    <textblock>
      Children with ASD suffer from both mental and physical symptoms that affect quality of life
      and severely disrupt family well-being. The objective of the protocol is to test the impact
      of Omega 3-6 on pre-specified biological signatures (IL-1β, IL-2, and IFNγ) and to correlate
      changes in the biological signatures with changes in ASD symptoms. Fatty acid supplements are
      natural products with anti-inflammatory properties often used for treatment of ASD symptoms,
      but the efficacy remains unproven.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pervasive Developmental Disorder Behavior Inventory (PDDBI) - Autism Composite</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 90 days post randomization.</time_frame>
    <description>Change in PDDBI Autism Composite t-score. Autism Composite t-scores range from 0-100 (mean=50; SD=10). T scores ranging 40-60 are characteristic of most cases of autism. Higher scores indicate greater severity. T scores for the Social Approach Behaviors and Expressive Language domains are summed and subtracted from the sum of the T scores for the Sensory/Perceptual Approach Behaviors, Ritualisms/Resistance to Change, Social Pragmatic Problems, and Semantic/Pragmatic Problems domains to obtain the Autism Composite t-score.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales 2nd ed. (modified timeframe of 90 days)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 90 days post randomization.</time_frame>
    <description>Change in standard adaptive composite score, and communication and socialization subdomain scores. A standard score of &lt;86 is an indication of low adaptive level (characteristic of children with autism)(lower scores indicate lower adaptive level). Mean=100, SD=15, range 20-160.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pervasive Developmental Disorder (PDD) Behavior Inventory (PDDBI) - Aggressiveness Problems</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 90 days post randomization.</time_frame>
    <description>Change in PDDBI Aggressiveness Problems t-score. Aggressiveness domain looks at self-directed aggressive behaviors, incongruous negative affect, problems when caregiver returns from an outing, aggressiveness towards others, and overall temperament problems. Aggressiveness t-scores range from 0-100 (mean 50; SD=10); higher scores are indicative of more aggressiveness.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Preschool Language Scales - 5 (PLS-5)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 90 days post randomization.</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in Auditory Comprehension, Expressive Communication, and Total Language Scale standard scores. Standard score range 50-150 (mean=100; SD=15). Higher scores represent better child comprehension of language and better ability to communicate with others.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS2) (2nd ed.)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 90 days post randomization.</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in Continuous Score. T-scores range 45-54 indicate average level of autism-related symptoms; T-scores &gt;70 indicate extreme level of autism-related symptoms (higher scores indicate greater symptoms)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Autism Impact Measure</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 90 days post randomization.</time_frame>
    <description>The Autism Impact Measure is a newly developed instrument for measuring change in ASD related behaviors. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30968318/ Changes in ASD core symptoms based on the following subscales: Repetitive Behavior, Communication; Atypical Behavior; Social Reciprocity; Peer Interaction; Frequency; Impact. (established norms not yet available) Higher scores represent worse severity of ASD symptoms.</description>
