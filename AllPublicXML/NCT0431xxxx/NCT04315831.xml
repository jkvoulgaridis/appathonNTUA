  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Buprenorphine transdermal patch is newly available in Taiwan in June 2017, the trade name is
      Transtec, and the available dosages are 35 μg/h and 52.5 μg/h. Taiwan is the first Asia
      country which launched Transtec for cancer pain treatment. Although the efficacy of
      transdermal buprenorphine has been demonstrated in some randomized, placebo-controlled
      studies and also conducted a large scale post-marketing surveillance study in Germany,
      therefore the local scientific data is required for Asia experience. Due to above rationale,
      this observational study will be initiated in Taiwan, to build up the first real-world
      scientific data in Asia.

      The objective of this study is to collect the safety and effectiveness of transdermal
      buprenorphine in routine clinical practice, in particular, to collect data in population with
      controlled cancer pain and stable titration from previous opioid analgesics in Taiwan.

      The objective of this observational study is to collect effectiveness and safety data on the
      labelled use of buprenorphine transdermal patches (Transtec 35 μg/h and 52.5 μg/h) under
      regular and routine clinical conditions in Taiwan for cancer patients with moderate to severe
      cancer pain (NRS Score&gt;=4) and strong opioids are needed for their pain treatment.
