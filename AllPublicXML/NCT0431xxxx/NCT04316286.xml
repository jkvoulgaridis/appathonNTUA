  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The TENAR trial is the first randomized controlled trial (RCT) designed to evaluate the
      feasibility, efficacy, safety, and costs of a Telemedicine multidisciplinary approach for the
      management of narcolepsy.

      Open RCT assessing the non-inferiority of the multidisciplinary management of narcolepsy via
      Video Consultation (VC) through Mobile Telemedicine devices compared to usual in-office care.
      202 children and adults with narcolepsy will be randomly allocated in 1:1 ratio to VC or
      in-office usual care for a 12 months follow-up. At baseline, all patients will undergo a
      neurologic, metabolic, and psychosocial assessment. Primary (i.e., excessive daytime
      sleepiness according to the Epworth Sleepiness Scale) and secondary endpoints (i.e., other
      symptoms, metabolic control, quality of life, patient and family satisfaction with care,
      feasibility, safety, and costs) will be measured at 6 and 12 months. The investigators expect
      the Telemedicine approach not only to be non-inferior for sleepiness control but also to
      significantly improve other patient-centred outcomes compared to the usual in-office care.

    <description>Measured by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale is a self-administered form with eight items investigating sleep propensity in different real-life situations during the preceding months. Each item can received 0-3 points, thus the final score ranges from 0 (best score) to 24 (worse score). The proposed range for normal subjects is 0-10</description>

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life - Short-Form 36-Item Questionnaire (SF-36) Changes of SF-36 health related quality of life (HRQOL) scales. This tool presents 36 questions. Eight health domains are assessed (physical activities; social activities; limitations in role activities because of physical health problems; bodily pain; mental health; limitations in role activities because of emotional problems; vitality; general health perceptions). Each domain measures a level of HRQOL with a scale between 0-100, with 0 being bad quality of life and 100 being good.

    <description>Quality of life - Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) Changes of PedsQL health related quality of life (HRQOL) scales. This is a tool of 23 questions comprising four generic domains: physical functioning; emotional functioning; social functioning; school functioning. These domains are measured by a 0-100 scale. Higher scores indicate better HRQOL.
