      Protein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK-9) inhibitors demonstrated efficacy in
      cholesterol reduction and in the prevention of cardiovascular events. The investigators will
      evaluate changes in lipid profile, oxidation markers and subclinical atherosclerosis in
      patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) during 12 weeks of treatment with a PCSK-9
      inhibitor, Evolocumab®.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several studies emphasize the role of high levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol
      (LDL-C) as the main causative factor in atherosclerosis development. Among patients with
      hypercholesterolemia, those with very high levels of LDL-C exhibit increased prevalence of
      subclinical atherosclerosis and a higher atherosclerosis progression, thus leading to a
      significantly higher CV risk. Endothelial dysfunction is the earliest stage of the
      atherosclerotic process and even a trigger of CV events. Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) is
      widely accepted as an accurate and non-invasive method to assess vascular reactivity and, in
      turn, as a surrogate marker of subclinical atherosclerosis and an independent predictor of CV
      events. It's well known that hypercholesterolemia has been associated with decreased
      endothelial function and increased oxidative stress. Although statin treatment represented
      for years the gold standard as lipid lowering therapy, the target LDL-C is not always
      achieved, mainly among patients with very high levels of LDL-C. More recently, PCSK-9
      inhibitors demonstrated efficacy in LDL-C reduction, in the prevention from CV events and in
      atherosclerotic burden regression. Some data showed an effect of PCSK-9 inhibitors on
      endothelial function, but no evidence is available on effect on LDL subfractions. Small dense
      LDL (sd-LDL) are considered an emerging risk factor for cardiovascular disease due to a
      greater atherogenic potential [ ] and are important markers for predicting CV risk.
