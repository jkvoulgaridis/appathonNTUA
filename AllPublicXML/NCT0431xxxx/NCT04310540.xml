  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to know whether 68Ga-PSMA PET/MRI or PET/CT can improve upon
      the diagnosis and management of hepatocellular carcinoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As part of this proposal, we seek to combine the molecular information obtained from PSMA PET
      with high-resolution anatomic and functional information from simultaneously acquired
      contrast-enhanced MRI, the current gold standard for HCC imaging, or contrast-enhanced CT to
      evaluate PSMA as both a diagnostic and therapeutic response imaging biomarker.

        1. Better characterize the uptake of PSMA in HCC. This would be a first step towards
           determining if 68Ga-PSMA PET/MRI (or PET/CT) consisting of focused liver acquisition and
           whole-body acquisition can be a 'one-stop-shop' for evaluating primary intrahepatic and
           metastatic extrahepatic hepatocellular carcinoma.

        2. Establish PSMA as an imaging biomarker for treatment response assessment in HCC for
           translation to practice and to clinical trials

        3. Establish PSMA as a theranostic target for 177Lu-PSMA-radio-ligand therapy as a novel
           therapeutic option for HCC
