  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will find the maximum tolerated dose or the maximum planned dose of CYNK-001 which
      contains natural killer (NK) cells derived from human placental CD34+ cells and
      culture-expanded. CYNK-001 cells will be given after lymphodepleting chemotherapy. The safety
      of this treatment will be evaluated, and researchers want to learn if NK cells will help in
      treating acute myeloid leukemia.

             infusion. Subject must no longer be a participant in the previous interventional study
             at the time of CYNK-001 infusion. (Subjects who are under survival follow-up or
             observation associated with a study are permitted, and if treatment information is
             collected for this period, &quot;Investigational Study&quot; must be used to capture the study
