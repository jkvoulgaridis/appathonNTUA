  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The concern for the opioid use in the total knee arthroplasty continues to rise in recent
      decades. Historically, the total knee arthroplasty consumed high doses opioids in the
      postoperative periods. Compared to the Opioid-Based patient controlled analgesia(PCA), the
      opioid-sparing protocol may have benefits to decrease the concerns of the opioid use and
      opioid-related complication and provides the equivalent efficacy for pain control. The
      purpose of this trial in to provide a novel opioid-sparing protocol (OSP) to evaluate the
      efficacy for pain control and reducing the immediate postoperative opioid consumption.

    <description>After a general anesthesia procedure was performed, an experienced anesthesiologist performed ultrasound guided adductor canal block procedures on both knees. In the opioid-sparing group, a dose of Parecoxib sodium 40 mg was administrated through intravenous route before the incision. After the surgery, Parecoxib sodium 40 mg was given intravenously every 12 hours for 4 more doses. Before the wound closure, the periarticular injection (each side 10 ml of 0.25% Bupivacaine) was done. The total dosage would be recorded in the device. All patients received oral paracetamol 500mg, 4 times a day and oral celecoxib 200mg, 2 times a day after surgery.</description>

    <description>After a general anesthesia procedure was performed, an experienced anesthesiologist performed ultrasound guided adductor canal block procedures on both knees. The patient was informed that the intravenous bolus of rescue morphine (4mg) was available every 4 hours if the pain was intolerable. In the PCA group, the device was applied before incision and the initial setting was 0.01mg/kg*hour, patient-controlled dose 2 mg, lock-out 5 minutes and limited 40mg in each 4 hours. After the surgery, the staff of PCA group would visit the patients and adjusted the dosage. The PCA was removed after 72 hours from the surgery. Before the wound closure, the periarticular injection (each side 10 ml of 0.25% Bupivacaine) was done. The total dosage would be recorded in the device. All patients received oral paracetamol 500mg, 4 times a day and oral celecoxib 200mg, 2 times a day after surgery.</description>
