    <description>Patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer diagnosed by cell / histopathology will receive nano knife treatment if the target lesion is not suitable for surgical resection or the target lesion is suitable for surgical resection but patients give up surgery and choose nano knife combined with chemotherapy. Patients who have not previously received first-line chemotherapy will receive systemic chemotherapy for 4-6 cycles of treatment. Imaging evaluation will be performed every 6-8 weeks (± 7 days) during chemotherapy.</description>
