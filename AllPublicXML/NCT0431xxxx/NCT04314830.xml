  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with stroke have balance and gait deficits. Gait training does improve balance
      and gait abilities, but adding perturbations may have increase these effects. The objective
      was to compare the effect gait training with and without perturbations on balance and gait
      abilities in individuals with hemiparesis due to stroke at a chronic stage.

    <description>Walking on a treadmill with perturbations produced by changes in the speed of one of the belt of the split-belt treadmill during one gait cycle. Changes in treadmill speed were applied on the paretic or non-paretic side, with and increase or a decrease of the speed of the belt in various magnitude. Perturbations were either repeated with the same characteristics or with different characteristics. Outside of perturbations, treadmill speed did not change along the training program.</description>
