    <textblock>
      Local anesthetic administration step is mandatory step for controlling pain before dental
      procedures. The aim of this study was to compare effectiveness of topical Benzocaine 18% gel
      patch form and Benzocaine 20% topical gel in reducing pain during injection of local
      anesthesia in children receiving dental treatment.

      A sample of 50 children ranging in age from 6 to 8 years who need a bilateral dental
      treatment in the same arch participated in this study. They were healthy children rated 3 or
      4 according to Frankl behavioral rating scale. They were selected from the clinic of
      Pediatric Dentistry Department, Faculty of Dentistry, Alexandria University.

      A randomized split mouth design was done in which each child received both tested topical
      anesthetics on each side of the arch. The topical anesthetic gel patch or the topical gel
      application was randomly used at the first or second visits. Pain or discomfort was evaluated
      during injection using sound, eye, motor (SEM) scale, and after injection using faces pain
      scale- revised (FPS-R).

    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The aim was to reduce pain and discomfort during injection of local anesthesia in pediatric dental patients. Pain or discomfort was evaluated during injection using sound, eye, motor (SEM) scale
Sound, Eye, Motor scale:
Grade 1: Comfort
Sound: No sound
Eye: No signs
Motor: Relaxed body and hand
Grade 2: Mild discomfort
Sound: Non specific sound
Eye: Dilated without tears
Motor: Muscular contractions of hand
Grade 3: Moderate discomfort
Sound: Verbal compliant, louder sound
Eye: Tears, sudden eye movement
Motor: Sudden body and hand movements
Grade 4: Severe discomfort
Sound: Verbal compliant shouting, crying
Eye: Crying, tears all over face
Motor: Hand movement for defense, Turning the head to opposite side</description>

    <description>Pain or discomfort was evaluated after injection using faces pain scale-revised (FPS-R).
2- Face Pain Scale- Revised: Scoring the chosen face 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10, counting left to right, so &quot;0&quot; = &quot;no pain&quot; and &quot;10&quot; = &quot;very much pain&quot;.</description>
