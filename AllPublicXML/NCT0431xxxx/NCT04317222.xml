  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatoencephalopathy (HE) is a common severe decompensation in end stage liver diseases and
      resulted to the need of liver transplantation (LT). Pretransplant HE markedly impacts
      recipient outcomes after liver transplantation. HE in acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF)
      is categorized to type C HE. Hyperammonemia and systemic inflammation have been reported to
      contribute its development. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) has been shown great
      benefits in ACLF patients with HE. Intraoperative CRRT in LT also showed benefits but
      feasibility was much concerned. Our preliminary retrospective data showed that early CRRT
      (eCRRT) after LT reduced consciousness recovery time, ventilation days and post-transplant
      infection rate.

      This open label, parallel randomized trial will observe the effect on consciousness recovery
      when initiating CRRT early (eCRRT) in the post-transplant period in recipients with ACLF and
      overt HE.

      The CRRT safety and ventilation days, infection, mortality and ICU stay will also be
      measured.
