  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In radiotherapy, tumour tracking allows us to ensure the radiation beam is accurately
      targeting the tumour while it moves in a complex and unpredictable way. Most tumour tracking
      techniques require the implantation of fiducial markers around the tumour. Markerless Tumour
      Tracking negates the need for implanted markers, enabling accurate and optimal cancer
      radiotherapy in a non-invasive way.

      We will perform a phase I observational trial investigating the feasibility of the Markerless
      Tumour Tracking technology. Markerless Tumour Tracking will be integrated with existing
      treatment machines to provide real-time monitoring of tumour motion during treatment
      delivery. Eligible patients are implanted with fiducial markers, which act as the ground
      truth for evaluating the accuracy of Markerless Tumour Tracking. The patients will undergo
      the current standard of care radiotherapy, with the exception that kilovoltage x-ray images
      will be acquired continuously during treatment delivery to enable Markerless Tumour Tracking.
      Markerless Tumour Tracking determines the mean tumour position calculated over the most
      recent 15 seconds and displays shifts exceeding 3 mm.

      The trial will be a single-institution study recruiting only at RNSH radiation oncology
      department.

      As this trial investigates feasibility our focus will be on estimating the proportion of
      treatment time in which the Markerless Tumour Tracking is within acceptable limits.
