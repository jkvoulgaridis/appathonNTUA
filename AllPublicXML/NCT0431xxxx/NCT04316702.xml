  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have previously studied the efficacy of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) as
      a treatment for Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) in a prospective, active control, crossover
      clinical trial. The results demonstrated significant amelioration of all FMS symptoms, with
      significant improvement in life quality; furthermore, the investigators were able to
      demonstrate significant neuroplasticity on SPECT imaging, with a decrease of the
      hyperactivity in posterior regions and elevation of the reduced activity in frontal areas.

      In this study, the investigators intend to both repeat and expand the investigator's previous
      findings, treating FMS patients with history of emotional trauma with HBOT, while performing
      an extensive of evaluation both before and after treatment.

      In the current study, the investigators plan to compare HBOT to current standard of care of
      FMS (pharmacological and non - pharmacological).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will include 60 fibromyalgia patients in whom emotional trauma, such as childhood
      abuse, could be considered as the trigger for FMS. Each participant will be examined at the
      time of recruitment and a diagnosis of FMS will be verified, based on the updated 2016
      diagnostic criteria. In the current study the investigators will recruit patients not
      currently being treated with the target medications (Lyrica or Cymbalta).

      Patients will undergo randomization upon recruitment to one of the two study groups. One
      group will proceed to a course of HBOT treatment while the second group will commence with
      standard treatment for FMS, as outlined in the Israeli guidelines for the diagnosis and
      treatment of FMS .

      HBOT protocol: a total of 60 daily hyperbaric oxygen treatment sessions will be administrated
      5 days per week. 60 sessions will include exposure of 90 minutes to 100% at 2 Absolute
      atmospheres (ATA), with 5 minutes air breaks every 20 minutes.

      Pharmaceutical protocol: patients will be offered pharmacological treatment with one of the
      two medications currently licensed for the treatment of FMS in Israel, i.e. Cymbalta and
      Lyrica. Treatment with Lyrica will start at a dose of 75 mg twice a day, at morning and at
      bedtime, while treatment with Cymbalta will start at a dose of 30 mg a day (in the morning).
      After a period of 2 weeks, patients will be evaluated and dose will be adjusted as necessary
      and tolerated, up to the maximum dosage recommended for FM. Patients may also be switched
      from one medication to the other according to clinical judgment of the physician.

    <measure>Heat pain threshold</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Heat pain threshold is determined as the minimum temperature causing pain. Thermal pain is induced with thermal electrode (thermode). Thermode temperature will initially be set at 32.0Â°C and gradually increase at a rate of 0.3Â°C/sec. Participants will be instructed to report when the sensation produced by the thermode changed from heat sensation to pain (heat-pain threshold). This procedure will be conducted three times for every subject and the mean of the trials will be calculated.</description>

    <measure>conditioned pain modulation using Heat test-stimulus (HTS)</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Following heat pain thresholds assessments, the thermode will be applied on the forearm for 120 seconds at constant temperature. The temperature will be individually adapted to induce a mean pain intensity of 50/100, Participant's pain intensity will be evaluated by numeric pain rating scale (NPRS) ranging from 0 (no pain) to 100 (most intense pain tolerable). The 120-second HTS will be done before and during cold water immersion of the contralateral hand in 10 Celsius degrees, using the same thermode temperature to measure conditioned pain modulation (CPM). CPM efficiency will be evaluated by computing the difference in mean pain intensity induced by the pressure stimulus and the Heat test-stimulus (HTS) before and during the Cold water immersion of the opposite hand. Thus, effective pain inhibitory mechanisms are represented by higher (positive) values</description>
