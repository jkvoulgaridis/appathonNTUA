      The CD123+ CAR therapy is a new treatment that is being investigated for treatment of AML.
      The purpose of this study is to find the maximum (highest) dose of CD123+ CAR cells that is
      safe to give patients with AML. This would include studying the side effects of the
      chemotherapy, as well as the CD123+ CAR product on the recipient's body, disease and overall
      survival.

      Primary Objective

      To determine the safety of one intravenous infusion of escalating doses of autologous,
      CD123-CAR T cells in patients (≤21 years) with recurrent/refractory CD123+ AML after
      lymphodepleting chemotherapy

      Secondary Objectives

      To evaluate the antileukemia activity of CD123-CAR T cells.

      Exploratory Objectives

        -  To assess the immunophenotype, clonal structure and endogenous repertoire of CD123-CAR T
           cells and unmodified T cells

        -  To characterize the cytokine profile in the peripheral blood and CSF after treatment
           with CD123-CAR T cells

        -  To characterize AML blasts post CD123-CAR T-cell therapy

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and maximum tolerated dose of CD123-CAR T cells.

      This study contains 2 phases.The first part is the called the &quot;Collection and Manufacturing
      Phase&quot; and the second is the &quot;Treatment Phase&quot;.

      The Collection and Manufacturing Phase refers to your blood cells being collected and
      possibly frozen, via a process called apheresis. These cells will then be changed to improve
      their ability to recognize and kill cancer cells.

      The Treatment Phase refers to the portion of the study in which you receive an infusion of
      the CD123+ CAR cells that were made in the Collection and Manufacturing Phase; chemotherapy
      is often given for several days prior to the cellular infusion. You are then monitored for
      any possible side effects.

      Chemotherapy is typically given to get your body ready to accept the CATCHAML treatment.

      Treatment Schedule:

      Patients will receive lymphodepleting chemotherapy followed by infusion of CD123-CAR T cells

      Fludarabine on day -4, -3 and -2

      Cyclophosphamide on day -2

      REST DAY on day -1

      CD123+CAR cell infusion on day 0 or +1
