  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of e-cigarettes is often permitted in otherwise smoke-free areas causing passive vape
      exposure for present individuals. Little is known about the potential adverse health effects
      of passive vape, and people with respiratory diseases may be more susceptible.

      The aim of the present study was to investigate local and systemic effects of short-term
      passive exposure to vape from e-cigarettes among patients with mild or moderate chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease COPD in a randomized controlled double-blinded cross-over
      study.

      Introduction: The use of e-cigarettes is often permitted in otherwise smoke-free areas
      causing passive vape exposure for present individuals. Little is known about the potential
      adverse health effects of passive vape, and people with respiratory diseases may be more
      susceptible.

      Aim: to investigate local and systemic effects of short-term passive exposure to vape from
      e-cigarettes among patients with mild or moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
      (COPD).

      Design: In a randomised double-blinded cross-over study non-smoking COPD patients were
      exposed for four hours at two different exposure conditions separated by 14 days; A) clean
      filtered air and B) passive vaping under controlled environmental conditions.

      Measurements: TSI P-TRAK Ultrafine Particle Counter was used for particle counts. Health
      effects, including lung function (FEV1/FVC) and fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) were
      evaluated in relation to local and systemic effects prior to, right after and 24 h. after
      exposure.

      Analysis: Mixed methods approach taking both time and exposure into account.

    <measure>Change in nasal volume (using Acoustic rhinometry)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline (0 hour), after exposure (4 hours), and the day after exposure (24 hours)</time_frame>
    <description>Is used to assess the nasal cross sectional area and volume. The left and right nasal cavity were studied alternatively until three reproducible measurements were obtained. The minimum cross sectional cavity area was calculated from the means of the measurements. By integration of the area-distance curve, the sum of the volume 2 to 4 (vol2-4) from the nostril was determined on both sides.</description>

    <measure>Change in Symptom questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 30 min during 4 hours of exposure.</time_frame>
    <description>In the exposure chamber participants were asked to fill out a symptom questionnaire every 30 min. regarding their well-being and experienced symptoms in eyes, nose and mouth.</description>

    <measure>Change in biomarkers in Saliva Sample</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline (0 hour), after exposure (4 hours), and the day after exposure (24 hours)</time_frame>
    <description>An oral svap from Salivette was placed in the mouth of the participant to collect saliva by gently chewing the swab for one minute. Afterwards the saturated swab was removed to the suspended insert and closed firmly with a lid. Then the sample was transferred to a freezer and stored for -80 C until further analysis. The sample will be analyzed for biomarkers (amylase, cortisol, substance P, lysozyme and secretory IgA.)</description>
