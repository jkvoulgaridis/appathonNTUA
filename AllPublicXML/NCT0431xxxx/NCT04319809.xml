  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed project seeks to provide object recognition as a feature in a retinal implant
      system. Participants will be able to direct an object recognition application to find a
      desired object in the field of view of the head-mounted camera, and to direct the
      participant's view towards it through the presentation of a recognizable icon. A prototype
      system will be developed and evaluated in human subjects in phase I. A full system
      implementation and a second phase of the trial will be completed in phase II.

    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to add an object-finding feature to a retinal prosthesis system. To
      use this feature, the participant will enable a special mode and input the desired object
      from a set of pre-programmed object types. Imagery from the visible light camera in the
      system eyeglasses will be processed using object recognition software as the participant
      scans their head across the room scene. When the object is identified in the scene by the
      processor, a flashing icon will be output to the epiretinal array in the appropriate position
      to guide the participant to the physical location of the object. Once located, the system
      will track the location of the object.

      There will be two phases to the human subjects evaluation, each run initially through
      simulations in sighted human subjects, followed by tests in Argus II participants. In phase
      1, system evaluation in human subjects at Johns Hopkins UNiversity (JHU) will explore
      performance in representative tasks and compare prosthetic visual performance without and
      with the new object finding feature. An important aspect of the evaluation will be the
      comparison of different icons and presentation modes to assist participants in locating and
      reaching objects. In phase 2, the system will be integrated into the Argus II video
      processing unit (VPU), and JHU will conduct human trials that include functional testing of
      the integrated prototype in representative environments and optimizing the ergonomics of the
      system, e.g. simultaneous finding and tracking of multiple objects/icons.
