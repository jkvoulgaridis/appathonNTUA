  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Regorafenib and nivolumab are proven effective agents for the management of unresectable
      hepatocellular carcinoma patients. As preclinical studies have suggested potential synergism
      between antiangiogenic agents and immune checkpoint inhibitors, regorafenib and nivolumab may
      have synergism in terms of efficacy. Herein, this study investigates the combination of
      regorafenib and nivolumab as first-line therapy in patients with unresectable hepatocellular
      carcinoma.
