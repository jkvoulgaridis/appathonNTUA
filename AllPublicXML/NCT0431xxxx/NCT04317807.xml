  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 12 week study of Levetiracetam in conjunction with a second generation
      antipsychotic in medication-free first episode psychosis participants. Treatment with
      antipsychotics has been shown to be associated with loss of volume in the hippocampus. Brain
      chemicals, called neurotransmitters, that might be associated with this loss are glutamate
      and dopamine. The drug levetiracetam reduces excessive amounts of these neurotransmitters,
      which may help protect against this loss when taken with antipsychotics.

      Participants will complete screening and baseline visits before being randomized in a 2:1
      ratio of levetiracetam or placebo. They will complete weekly study visits for the first 4
      weeks (Baseline, Weeks 2-4) and then additional visits at Week 6, 8, and 12. Participants
      will be studied both by assessing change in symptom severity and cognitive performance over
      the 12 weeks as well as using a measure of Hippocampal Volume Integrity at baseline and week
      12. After completing Week 12 or decision to withdraw prematurely from the study, participants
      will complete a 9 day medication tapering regimen.

    <description>The efficacy of levetiracetam 500 mg bid vs. placebo on symptoms will be measured by the BPRS total score. Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) is an 24-item scale that measures positive symptoms, negative symptoms, general psychopathology and affective symptoms. Individual items are scored on a seven point likert scale. Scores range from 24-216. A higher score on the BPRS items indicate increased severity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Compared to placebo, levetiracetam will improve psychotic symptoms measured by the BPRS psychosis subscale.</measure>

    <time_frame>Baseline visit (week 0), Week 12 visit</time_frame>
    <description>Scale for Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) will be the instrument for measurement of negative symptoms. Factor analysis has revealed good construct validity for all items of the SANS scale except the Attention subscale which clusters with measures of cognitive impairment rather than negative symptoms. Two, three and five domain models have been proposed based on factor analysis; this research will use the total score (minus the Attention Subscale) and the two factor solution (avolition and affective expression) to measure negative symptoms.</description>

    <description>Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS) Consensus Cognitive Battery is the standard tool for assessing cognitive change in trials of cognitive-enhancing agents in schizophrenia. It will be administered at baseline, week 6 and at week 12 to measure whether cognitive function has increased.</description>

    <description>Participants in this group will receive 500 mg of levetiracetam twice daily for 12 weeks. After 12 weeks, levetiracetam will be gradually decreased and stopped over the next 9 days. Questionnaires will be administered at each visit to examine how participants are responding to the treatment. In addition, a brain scan and cognitive testing will be performed when feasible at the beginning and the end of the study.</description>

    <intervention_name>Levetiracetam Pill</intervention_name>
    <description>Levetiracetam is an atypical anticonvulsant that is frequently used in children and adults due to its superior tolerability, ease of use and excellent safety profile. It is rapidly absorbed and rapidly crosses the blood-brain barrier. Maximal blood levels, brain concentrations and antiepileptic efficacy occur approximately 1 hour after oral administration in rodents and in humans. Levetiracetam is a well-tolerated agent that does not affect metabolism of antipsychotic drugs and normalizes hippocampal hyperactivity by decreasing excessive glutamatergic and dopaminergic transmission, thereby making it an ideal agent to enhance treatment of early psychosis and to prevent antipsychotic toxicity. The levetiracetam drug will be administered in 500 mg capsules twice a day.</description>

    <description>The placebo pill (sugar pill) will look just like the levetiracetam pill but does not contain levetiracetam. This medication will be taken along with one of the newer antipsychotic medications selected by either the outpatient provider or the hospital staff responsible for the participant's care. They will be instructed to take the placebo pill twice daily for 12 weeks.</description>
