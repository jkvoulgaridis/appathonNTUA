  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AFFIRM is an 8-session manualized group coping skills intervention focused on reducing sexual
      risk behaviours and psychosocial distress among SGMY. AFFIRM is delivered by two facilitators
      (primarily social workers and peers) through a combination of education and rehearsal (i.e.,
      simulation of real-life experiences) in a manner that affirms participants' sexual and gender
      minority identities and experiences. AFFIRM is being tested in a five-year trial using a
      stepped wedge waitlist crossover design, where all participants receive the intervention in
      clusters.
