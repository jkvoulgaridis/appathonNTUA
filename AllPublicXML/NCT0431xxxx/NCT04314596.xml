  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thirty active male and female athletes will be recruited for the study. Subjects will be
      examined at baseline for VO2max performance. Subjects will then be stratified and randomly
      divided equally (50% - 50%) into an Oceanix (supplemental) or placebo condition such that
      baseline VO2max match. Once randomization, subjects will be baseline tested for multiple
      measures of muscle force capacity, muscle soreness, immune function, and endocrine function.
      Upon completion of baseline testing, subjects will all complete a one-day, cross-training
      course in Tampa, Florida. The training course is known to be extremely vigorous and causes
      significant muscle damage. Subjects will then be retested for muscle function at 24, and 48
      hours following the course. At 24- and 48-hours subjects will be asked to repeat a simulated
      time trial race. In this way, we will measure repeated race performance, recovery from
      intense exercise, muscle damage from exercise, and immune function during multiple races.
