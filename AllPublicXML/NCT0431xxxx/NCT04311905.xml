    <textblock>
      Study is a Randomized clinical trial conducted at Endodontic department- Ain Shams university
      Cairo. Egypt. 24 eligible patients were selected and included in the study to compare healing
      ability of diode laser activated irrigation versus conventional root canal treatment using
      CBCT

      Sample size is 24 , 24 Patients were randomly distributed in 2 groups , one group of patients
      received laser activated irrigation LAI during root canal treatment and the other group
      received no treatment just conventional RCT. â€¢ Patients were equally divided into 2 groups
      (n=12 in each group ) The study in a Single blinded RCT , Numbers for patients will be
      generated and distributed randomly in a table on an Excel sheet, and in front of each number
      either a letter (C) for control or (I) for intervention will be typed After patients were
      selected in the study they will be asked to fill in a consent form , that states that they
      are part of a clinical trial and that they may or may not receive a laser activated
      irrigation Group A LAI :Disinfection were done by using 5 ml of 2.5% sodium hypochlorite
      irrigation for 1 minute. Irrigation will be performed with a 30-gauge needle side vented The
      irrigation needles were introduced passively up to 2 mm away the working length. After
      irrigation Laser treatment will be performed with a diode laser, at a wavelength of 980 nm
      with a repeated pulse mode using a pulse duration of 5sec per canal and a pulse interval of
      0.2 ms. The laser irradiation were delivered for 1 minute into the canal up to 1 mm short of
      the working length, with circling movements from the apical part moving towards the coronal
      part Group B : received mock laser intervention , conventional Root canal treatment with 2.5%
      sodium hypochlorite CBCT was taken pre-operative and another one was taken after 12 month ,
      both volumetric and linear measurements were calculated
