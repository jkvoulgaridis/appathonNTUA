  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to develop, refine, and complete preliminary feasibility testing of
      a smoking cessation electronic visit (e-visit) for implementation in primary care/family
      medicine. The investigators will conduct a feasibility RCT (N=51) of the smoking cessation
      e-visit as compared to treatment as usual (TAU), delivered via primary care, with primary
      objective to provide effect size estimates for a larger RCT. Primary outcomes cluster around:
      1) treatment feasibility, 2) treatment acceptability, 3) treatment satisfaction, 4)
      evidence-based cessation treatment utilization, and 5) cessation-related outcomes (quit
      attempt incidence, abstinence). It is hypothesized that participants randomized to the
      e-visit condition as compared to those randomized to the TAU condition will have higher rates
      of cessation treatment utilization (medications, counseling) and superior cessation-related
      outcomes.
