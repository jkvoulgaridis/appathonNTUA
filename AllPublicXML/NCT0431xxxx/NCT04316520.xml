  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the tolerance of one year of ketogenic diet
      associated with vitamin supplementation in patients treated for a metastatic renal cell
      carcinoma.

      This research study is a pilot study evaluating the tolerance of a ketogenic diet associated
      with a standard of care in patient with metastatic renal cell carcinoma.

      The drugs involved in this study could be NIVOLUMAB + IPILIMUMAB, PEMBROLIZUMAB + AXITINIB,
      SUNITINIB or PAZOPANIB.

      Cancer cells are known to have an increased glycolytic activity that allows them to product
      energy from anaerobic degradation of glucose. A ketogenic diet places the body in ketosis
      state. It forces the body to burn fat instead of glucose. Fat metabolism occurs via the
      mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. By reducing sugar intake and regulating energy
      metabolism, the ketogenic diet could contribute to limit tumor progression.

      This diet will be introduced during one year, patient will be monitored closely with
      biological tests and radiological assessments every three month.
