  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People nowadays tend to have irregular diet and routine due to the stress at work. This
      condition may cause intestinal microflora imbalance, and in the long term may lead to
      constipation, diarrhea, gastroenteritis, gastric ulcer and other gastrointestinal diseases.
      Helicobacter pylori infection, which can trigger gastrointestinal inflammation and ulcer, is
      commonly treated by antibiotics. This treatment, however, can reduce the diversity of the
      intestinal microflora, causing diarrhea, flatulence and nausea. Clinical trials showed that
      probiotics and prebiotics supplementation could regulate gastrointestinal function, including
      alleviating constipation, ameliorating antibiotic-associated diarrhea and flatulence,
      enhancing the effect of H. pylori treatment, and restoring the balance of intestinal
      microflora. This Probiotics product is a supplement containing several types of probiotics
      and prebiotics which has been marketed for years. This project aims to observe the
      effectiveness of Probiotics product consumption by H. pylori-infected patients in relieving
      the gastrointestinal symptoms and restoring their intestinal microflora.
