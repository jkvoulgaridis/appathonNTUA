  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized trial compares the efficacy of switching to a fixed-dose combination of
      B/F/TAF versus continuing a boosted protease inhibitor (bPI) regimen in HIV-1 infected
      participants who are virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA &lt;200 copies) on a second-line bPI
      regimen. Half of participants will receive B/F/TAF and half will continue a bPI regimen. We
      hypothesize that B/F/TAF will have efficacy that is non-inferior to the boosted PI regimen.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The second generation integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) dolutegravir (DTG) and
      bictegravir (BIC) are widely prescribed for the treatment of HIV, due to their favorable
      tolerability and toxicity profile, durable efficacy, and high barrier to resistance. However,
      there are limited data to guide the management of patients who are already virally suppressed
      on a second-line bPI regimen.

      Though bPIs have a high barrier to resistance and durable virologic efficacy, they have
      several important drug-drug interactions, are associated with unfavorable long-term metabolic
      effects, and may be poorly tolerated. For these reasons, a second-generation INSTI would be
      preferable to a boosted PI regimen, as long INSTIs are demonstrated to have non-inferior
      efficacy for patients who are already suppressed on a second-line bPI regimen.

      In the proposed study, we will compare the efficacy of continuing the bPI regimen, versus
      switching to B/F/TAF.
