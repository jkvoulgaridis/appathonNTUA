  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous research has suggested that high levels of systemic inflammation can contribute to
      cognitive deficits and additional health problems; consumption of polyphenols have been shown
      to have an anti-inflammatory effect. Resveratrol, a polyphenol found primarily in red grape
      skins, has previously been shown to improve brain blood flow and possibly brain function and
      may potentially reduce systemic inflammation, however there is limited research into this.

      This study will investigate the effects of 4 weeks daily consumption of resveratrol on
      inflammation and cognitive function in healthy adults.

      Each participant will be required to attend the laboratory on three occasions. The first of
      these will be an initial screening/training visit, this will take place in the afternoon and
      last 2 1/2 hours in total. During the initial visit participants will be asked to provide
      written informed consent. They will provide lifestyle and demographic data and screened
      regards to physical health (height, weight, blood pressure, waist to hip ratio). They will
      then complete a food frequency questionnaire and be trained on the computerised cognitive and
      mood tasks. Participants will also be trained on completing the cognitive assessment battery
      on their mobile phone, they will complete a further 5 assessments on their phone, once the
      day before their first visit and every 7 days during the supplementation period.

      Study days 1 and 2 (4 weeks apart) :

      Participants will arrive at the laboratory at an agreed time in the morning (7am, 8.30am or
      10am) having fasted for 12 hours, avoided caffeinated products for 18 hours, alcohol and over
      the counter medication for 24 hours and oral antihistamines for 48 hours prior to the session
      commencing.

      Participants will provide a blood sample, they will then complete a short computerised
      cognitive assessment (~20 minutes in length), followed by measurements of blood pressure and
      heart rate. Following this the participants will consume their treatment for the day,
      followed by a 40 minute absorption period and then will complete the second cognitive
      assessment. Participants will then provide a second blood sample. At the end of the first
      study session participants will be provided with their treatment and treatment diary, they
      will be instructed to take one tablet twice a day (30 minutes after breakfast and dinner).
      Both study visits will be identical and will take place 29 days (+/- 2 days) apart.

    <description>This will be assessed using a computerised cognitive battery (administered using COMPASS cognitive assessment program). Changes in episodic memory, working memory, spatial memory, executive function and attention as compared to pre-treatment performance on day 1. All tasks have the same x3 outcome measures; accuracy (% correct), errors (% incorrect) and speed (milliseconds) and the individual task scores will therefore be collapsed into global cognitive domains.</description>

    <description>This will be assessed using a computerised cognitive battery, this will be administered using 'Cognimapp'mobile phone program, participants will complete this battery away from home using their own mobile phone. Changes in attention, executive function, working memory and episodic memory as compared to performance on Day -1.

    <description>Assessed using Visual Analogue Mood Scales at each assessment during each cognitive assessment. Participants will complete 27 separate visual analogue mood scales that load onto 3 mood outcomes: Alertness, Stress and Tranquillity (the individual scale results are averaged to create this score). A score between 0 and 100 can be obtained, where a higher value indicates that the participant felt more Alert, Stressed or Tranquil.</description>
