  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in total neuropsychological performance after axi-cel therapy - Memory</measure>
    <time_frame>Prior to therapy, then at 30, 90 and 360 days</time_frame>
    <description>Memory changes will be assessed with the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Status (RBANS) which assesses immediate memory (list learning and story memory), visuospatial/constructional abilities (figure copy and line orientation), language (picture naming and semantic fluency), attention (digit span and coding), and delayed memory (list recall, list recognition, story recall, and figure recall) domains. Both total scores and scaled/percentile group scores are calculated for each test and total scores are derived for each cognitive domain. Total scores for each cognitive domain are then summed together to create a total scale score.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in total neuropsychological performance after axi-cel therapy - Attention and Concentration</measure>
    <time_frame>Prior to therapy, then at 30, 90 and 360 days</time_frame>
    <description>Attention and concentration are will be assessed using Part 1 of the Color Trails Test (CTT-1) and the Connors Continuous Performance Test Third Edition (CPT3). The CTT is an analogue of the original Trail Making Test without significant influence of language. CTT-1 consists of a page with scattered circles numbered from 1 to 25.
Even numbered circles are colored yellow and odd-numbered ones are colored pink.
Respondents are instructed to connect the circles in consecutive numeric order with a continuous line as quickly as possible. The alternating colors are not mentioned in the instructions. A total score is determined by recording the number of seconds required to complete the task.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in total neuropsychological performance after axi-cel therapy - Executive Functioning</measure>
    <time_frame>Prior to therapy, then at 30, 90 and 360 days</time_frame>
    <description>Executive Functioning will be assessed using Part 2 of the Color Trails Test (CTT-2) and the Stroop Color and Word Test. The CTT-2 consists of a page containing 25 pink circles and 25 yellow circles numbered 1 - 50. Participants connect the circles in consecutive order while alternating colors (1 pink, 2 yellow, 3 pink, etc.). A total score is determined by recording the number of seconds required to complete the task. The Stroop Color and Word Test consists of three tasks, a Word Task, a Color Task, and a Color-Word Task. In the Word Task, participants are required to read a list of color words printed in black ink. In the Color Task, participants are presented with rows of X's printed in colored ink, and asked to name the color of each set of X's. In the Color-Word Task, color names are presented in different color ink, and participants are asked to identify the color ink in which each color name is printed. The Stroop yields a score on each task as well as an interference score.</description>

    <description>The Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (WTAR) is a neuropsychological assessment tool used to provide a measure of Intellectual function. Participants are presented with 50 irregularly spelled words and prompted to pronounce each; the irregular grapheme-to-phoneme translations (such as the &quot;gh&quot; in the word tough) in the prompts make it difficult to pronounce without having previously learned the word. A high WTAR score is correlated with higher general intelligence as measured by the Wechsler intelligence scales.</description>

    <intervention_name>Neuropsychological Assessment -Stroop Color and Word Test</intervention_name>
    <description>The Stroop Color and Word Test is based on the observation that individuals can read words much faster than they can identify and name colors. The test-taker reads color words or names ink colors from different pages as quickly as possible within a time limit. The test yields three scores based on the number of items completed on each of the three stimulus sheets. An Interference score is useful in determining the individual's cognitive flexibility, creativity, and reaction to cognitive pressures.</description>
