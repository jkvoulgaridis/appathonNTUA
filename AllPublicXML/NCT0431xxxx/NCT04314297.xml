    <description>At the end of chest radiotherapy (c2d1), the simultaneous administration of androtinib hydrochloride capsule and PD-1 / L1 inhibitor was started. L
Arotinib hydrochloride capsule, 12 mg, Po, QD, was taken orally for two weeks, one week, three weeks as a cycle, completed in the first 14 days until the disease progress;
Durvalumab injection, 1500mg, IV, once every three weeks, completed on the first day until the disease progresses.
Tetraprizumab injection, 240mg, IV, once every three weeks, completed on the first day until the disease progresses.
The choice of durvalumab / trepril mAb was at the discretion of the researchers.</description>

        good compliance and cooperated with the follow-up; Patients between 18-75 years old;
        Extensive small cell lung cancer confirmed by histopathology (according to Veterans
        Administration lung study group, Valg stage) and did not progress after 4-6 cycles (21 days
        as a cycle) of first-line standard chemotherapy platinum combined with etoposide [complete
        remission (CR), partial remission (PR) or stable (SD) according to recist1.1 standard]; The
        time interval between the first TRT and the end of the last chemotherapy should be less
        than or equal to 6 weeks; The life expectancy shall be at least 3 months; ECoG score: 0-1

        Exclusion Criteria:

        - Small cell lung cancer patients with other pathological types of tumor species; Patients
        with pathological fracture in bone metastasis of small cell lung cancer; Patients with
        central nervous system metastasis; Patients who have received chest radiotherapy before;
        Patients who have used vasotargeted drugs (such as bevacizumab, sunitinib, etc.) including
        enrotinib and immunosuppressive agents before; Imaging (CT or MRI) showed that the distance
        between the tumor focus and the large blood vessel was less than or equal to 5 mm, or there
        was a central tumor invading the local large blood vessel, or there was an obvious cavitary
        or necrotic tumor in the lung;
