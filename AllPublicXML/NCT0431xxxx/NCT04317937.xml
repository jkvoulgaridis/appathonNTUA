      Treatment assignment (allocation):

      In this study, the treatment assignment will be completed using randomization technique.

        -  In this study, based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, required numbers of sample
           size participants will recruit first as mentioned earlier using non probability sampling
           technique.

        -  Estimated total 80 patients (40 patients per group including dropout rate) (makes at
           least 32 patients per group) will be selected.

        -  Total 80 study population will be divided further out in two groups based on gender for
           giving equal opportunity to participate in this study. 40 male patients (20 for
           experimental and 20 for control group) and 40 female patients (20 for experimental and
           20 for control group) via simple randomization technique using computer generated
           Microsoft Excel sheet.

        -  The above mentioned process will be run for male and female parallel or separately
           depending on the frequency of the patients.

      Patients will not be selected in this study based on inclusion criteria, refer to the
      physiotherapy OPD for assessment and treatment.

      Blinding:

        -  Physiotherapist with minimum two years job experience will be selected and
           physiotherapist will receive training on how to perform the assessment.

        -  Treatment blinding will be achieved by asking physiotherapist to complete initial
           assessment forms with all outcome measures (pre- intervention) to all subjects (referred
           patients) with non specific chronic neck pain and dysfunction. The physiotherapists will
           remain unaware about who will be selected as research sample participants including
           unaware about experimental and control groups.

        -  At the time of getting consent, patients will be made aware of the relevant details
           about the research study, however they will remain unaware of their own group
           allocation.

        -  The principal investigator alone will administer the treatment.

        -  The outcome measurements will be taken at day 0 (pre-intervention) and then week 6
           outcome measurements (post intervention) will be recorded by physiotherapist.

      INTERVENTION:TREATMENT REGIMES FOR EXPERIMENTAL AND CONTROL Experimental group A: Jaw
