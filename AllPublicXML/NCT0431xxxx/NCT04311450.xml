      The purpose of this research study is to examine how well an existing weight loss treatment
      works for individuals with food addiction. Treatment will consist of a preliminary 12-week
      RCT pilot of the feasibility and effectiveness of behavioral weight loss (BWL) compared to a
      waitlist control.
