  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People spend up to 90% of their life indoor, and the way we live and behave in our homes has
      substantial effects on our health and well-being. Particle contamination is suggested to have
      substantial negative effects on health, with candles and cooking emitting the largest amount
      of particles, thus being the largest contributors to indoor air pollution.

      The overall aim of the present project is to contribute to increased understanding of the
      association between indoor particulate air pollution and health and well-being.

      Introduction: People spend up to 90% of their life indoor, and the way we live and behave in
      our homes has substantial effects on our health and well-being. Particle contamination is
      suggested to have substantial negative effects on health, with candles and cooking emitting
      the largest amount of particles, thus being the largest contributors to indoor air pollution.
      Little is known about the potential adverse health effects of candles and cooking, and people
      with asthma may be more susceptible.

      Aim: To investigate local and systemic effects of short-term exposure to lit candles and
      cooking among young asthmatics.

      Design: In a randomised double-blinded cross-over study non-smoking asthmatics (18-25 years)
      were exposed for five hours at three different exposure conditions separated by 14 days; A)
      clean filtered air, B) lit candles and C) cooking emissions under controlled environmental
      conditions.

      Measurements: TSI P-TRAK Ultrafine Particle Counter was used for particle counts. Health
      effects, including lung function (FEV1/FVC) and fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) were
      evaluated in relation to local and systemic effects prior to, right after and 24 h. after
      exposure.

      Analysis: Mixed methods approach taking both time and exposure into account.

    <time_frame>At baseline (0 hour), after exposure (5 hours), and the day after exposure (24 hours)</time_frame>
    <description>Is used to assess the nasal cross sectional area and volume. The left and right nasal cavity were studied alternatively until three reproducible measurements were obtained. The minimum cross sectional cavity area was calculated from the means of the measurements. By integration of the area-distance curve, the sum of the volume 2 to 4 (vol2-4) from the nostril was determined on both sides.</description>

    <description>An oral svap from Salivette was placed in the mouth of the participant to collect saliva by gently chewing the swab for one minute. Afterwards the saturated swab was removed to the suspended insert and closed firmly with a lid. Then the sample was transferred to a freezer and stored for -80 C until further analysis. The sample will be analyzed for biomarkers (amylase, cortisol, substance P, lysozyme and secretory IgA.)</description>
