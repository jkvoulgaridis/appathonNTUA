  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteosarcoma is the most common primary highly malignant bone tumor in children and young
      people. Incidence rates are bimodal, with the first peak occurring in adolescence and the
      second peak in patients over 60 years of age. The 5-year survival rate of patients with
      osteosarcoma is less than 20%. This study aims to improve the prognosis of patients and
      change the outcome of patients with osteosarcoma.

      This project intends to conduct a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-controlled
      clinical trial of ganoderma spore powder and doxorubicin combined with cisplatin chemotherapy
      in the treatment of osteosarcoma patients. The combination therapy of traditional
      chemotherapeutics has not played a good effect and has large side effects. The Ganoderma
      lucidum spore powder group is a natural botanical drug that has a good anti-tumor auxiliary
      effect in regulating the tumor immune microenvironment. The investigators' previous research
      showed that Ganoderma lucidum spore powder can inhibit the growth and metastasis of
      osteosarcoma in the body without obvious toxic and side effects, which indicates that this
      research scheme has strong feasibility.
