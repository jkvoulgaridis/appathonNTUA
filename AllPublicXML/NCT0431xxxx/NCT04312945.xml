  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this experiment is to determine the mechanisms through which parental
      buffering of stress physiology during aversive conditioning diminishes with pubertal
      development and whether this diminution of effectiveness extends to social buffering by peers
      (best friends) and/or other unfamiliar social partners (e.g., experimenters).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      On visit one, the participant will 1) be seen by a nurse who will complete a pubertal
      assessment exam, 2) complete questionnaires, including ones on pubertal development,
      screening for MRI safety, and quality of relations with parents and friends. The participant
      will also have a chance to experience a simulated MRI in order to determine whether they will
      be comfortable in an actual MRI.

      Within 2 weeks the participant will return to the University where they will undergo the
      following protocol. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of 4 conditions that differ
      by who is with them in the scanner room: Primary Parent, Close Friend, Experimenter, No
      Social Partner. (N=50 per condition, 25 male, 25 female).

      Once at the Center for Magnetic Resonance Research, participants and the individual who will
      be with the participant in the scanning room will undergo an MRI safety screening (the repeat
      of what was completed over the phone). Girls will be shown to a changing room where the
      investigators will privately question them about any possibility of pregnancy. All
      participants will provide a urine sample for oxytocin assessment. Then participants will be
      shown into the scanning control room and one more safety check will be performed before they
      enter the scanner room and the scanner. If they are in one of the social buffering
      conditions, the social buffering partner will also enter the scanning room and will sit to
      the side of the scanner.

      The scanning bed will then be moved into the barrel of the MRI machine. The participant will
      be wearing head phones to protect his/her hearing and to receive instructions from the
      control room. The participant will then complete two aversive (fear) conditioning paradigms,
      none using a social and one using a non-social stimulus. The investigators will use a 3T
      Siemens Prisma scanner with a standard 32-channel phased array head coil.

    <measure>Change Heart Rate Response</measure>
    <time_frame>2 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Heart rate will be derived from the EKG signal collected during periods of stress (social evaluation) and non-stress (no evaluation) during the course of the assessment. The variable, heart rate response, is a numeric output (beats per minute) from validated software (BIOPAC). The outcome measure will be reported (in beats per minute) as the difference between heart rate response during the period of stress and period of non-stress.</description>

    <time_frame>2 hours</time_frame>
    <description>For each participant, signal intensity (unitless measure) will be measured using fMRI in the bilateral amygdala over a five-minute recording period. Signal intensity will also be measured using fMRI in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) over the same period of time. A bivariate correlation will be conducted for these two data sets to determine functional connectivity, which will be reported as the r value of the correlation. This outcome measure will be reported as the mean functional connectivity value (r, or correlation coefficient) for each task condition/group.</description>

    <measure>Change in Self Report of Stress</measure>
    <time_frame>2 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The Self Report of Stress is an 8-item questionnaire assessing participant level of stress at various time points across the session. Items are rated on a 5 point Likert scale. Total score is the unweighted mean of item scores. Total scores range from 0 to 40, with higher scores indicating greater stress. The assessment will be administered at baseline (no stress) and during a period of stress. The outcome will be reported as the difference between the baseline period and experimental stress period.</description>
