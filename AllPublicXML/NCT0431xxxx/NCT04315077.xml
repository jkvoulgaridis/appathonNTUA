  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study will be to examine the effects of Oceanix supplementation on full
      body strength, velocity, and mechanics following an overtraining cycle meant to mimic the
      stress faced by strength and power athletes during intense tournaments. Twenty active males
      and females will be recruited for the study. Subjects will be randomly divided by 50% into an
      Oceanix supplement or placebo condition.

      Following randomization, subjects will be baseline tested on lower body anaerobic power,
      lower body power and strength, full-body power, force, and velocity, and overall body
      mechanics. Subjects will also be assessed for their immune function, endocrine function, and
      oxidative stress. After baseline testing is complete, the participants will be asked to
      refrain from exercise, and supplement for 7 days with their specified condition (Oceanix
      supplement or placebo). Following those initial 7 day supplementation, subjects will then be
      put on an intensified overreaching protocol for 5 days and retested 24 hours following
      completion of the 5 days. Subjects will then be given 48 hours to recover (from completion of
      the 5-day overreaching protocol) and be retested again.
