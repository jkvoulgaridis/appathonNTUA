  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well cemiplimab before surgery works in treating patients
      with skin cancer that is high-risk and has not spread to other parts of the body (localized),
      has come back locally (locally recurrent), or has spread regionally (regionally advanced),
      and can be removed by surgery (resectable). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as
      cemiplimab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the
      ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess the pathological partial response (PPR) rate in patients with potentially
      resectable cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) treated with neoadjuvant cemiplimab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the pathological complete response rate (PCR). II. To estimate the Response
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (version [v]1.1) 9 week objective response rate
      (ORR).

      III. To estimate the RECIST (v1.1) 12 month progression free (PFS). IV. To assess the
      toxicity among patients with CSCC treated with neoadjuvant cemiplimab.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate tumor mutational burden (TMB) and correlate with response to PD-1 blockade
      therapy.

      II. To evaluate PD-L1 expression on CSCC tumor cells and correlate with response to PD-1
      blockade.

      III. To evaluate CD8+ T cell infiltration into CSCC tumors and correlate with response to
      PD-1 blockade.

      IV. To assess other adaptive immune resistance mechanisms in CSCC tumors.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive cemiplimab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats
      every 21 days for up to 3 cycles (or up to 4 cycles for patients whose disease is
      unresectable after 3 cycles) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Within 6 weeks of last dose of therapy, patients with potentially resectable tumors undergo
      surgical resection.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 24 months.

             composition to cemiplimab or any other PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor

             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac

             with study requirements

          -  Positive pregnancy test, active pregnancy or nursing / breast-feeding, due to the
             potential for congenital abnormalities and the potential of this regimen to harm
