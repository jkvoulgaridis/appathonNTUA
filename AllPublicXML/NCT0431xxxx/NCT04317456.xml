  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is high variability in outcomes in children with hearing impairment. Existing
      literature focus mainly on subpopulations (children with hearing aids, children with CI) and
      is usually not epidemiological. Often children with additional needs (intellectual
      disability, visual impairment, autism spectrum disorder, complex syndromes) are excluded from
      the studies. This subgroup of children makes up around 1/3 of the population of children with
      hearing impairment.

      What factors contribute to the unexplained variance in language development in children with
      hearing loss? (including children with additional needs, multilingual) There is a lack of
      European epidemiological studies that evaluate the effects of Newborn Hearing Screening and
      early intervention.

      Aims:

        -  to collect population based data on children born in Upper Austria with a significant
           hearing impairment and to describe this population in detail regarding audiological,
           etiological (including geno- and phenotypical correlations), neurodevelopmentally,
           psychological, psychiatrically and linguistically with a special interest is in children
           with additional needs

        -  collecting child development outcomes (language, communication, psychosocial) and family
           outcomes (quality of life, stress)

        -  to investigate possible effects of the Newborn Hearing Screening, early intervention and
           specific parent behaviors targeted in early intervention

        -  collecting developmental trajectories of the total sample and subgroups of the sample
           (particularly audiological, etiological and cognitive). This data should help identify
           red flags

        -  investigating predictors of developmental trajectories regarding the child and the
           intervention (e.g. time and

      Hypothesis:

        -  It is expected that .2% of the total population of preschool children have a
           sensorineural hearing loss (bilateral and unilateral)

        -  a significantly higher prevalence of intellectual disabilities (up to 20%), visual
           impairment, autism spectrum disorder and motor impairment

        -  it is expected that for at least 50% of the children, there is a genetic explanation for
           the hearing impairment and 30% out of them are expected to be syndromal

        -  it is expected that there is a higher proportion of children with psycho-social problems
           (especially peer problems and behavioral-/emotional problems)

        -  Due to a change in the environmental conditions over the past two decades, better child
           outcomes, compared to previous ones are expected. Nevertheless around 30-50% of the
           children are expected to not be reaching their nonverbal cognitive potential.

        -  expected intervention effects, particularly for provision with and use of hearing
           technology family-child interaction self-efficacy and wellbeing of the family regulated
