    <textblock>
      This trial compares two different types of ventilation for the prevention of partial or
      complete collapsed lung (atelectasis) in patients undergoing bronchoscopy under general
      anesthesia. Ventilatory strategy to prevent atelectasis (VESPA) may work better than standard
      of care mechanical ventilation to reduce the intra-procedural development of atelectasis
      during bronchoscopy under general anesthesia.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine if our ventilatory strategy to prevent atelectasis (VESPA) can reduce the
      intra-procedural development of atelectasis during bronchoscopy under general anesthesia when
      compared with conventional mechanical ventilation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe proportion of VESPA-induced complications. II. To describe and compare
      proportion of bronchoscopy-induced complications in VESPA and control arms.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients receive anesthesia using a standard short breathing tube called laryngeal
      mask airway (LMA) and then undergo standard of care bronchoscopy.

      GROUP II: Patients receive anesthesia using a longer breathing tube called an endotracheal
      tube and then undergo standard of care bronchoscopy.

    <description>The proportion of patients identified as developing intraprocedural atelectasis by radial probe endobronchial ultrasound (RP-EBUS) and its 95% confidence interval will be estimated. The proportion of patients developing intraprocedural atelectasis will be compared between treatment and control arms, utilizing a 2-sided Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test to accomplish primary objective. Locations of atelectasis will be summarized in a frequency table, allowing for multiple locations in the same patient. The proportion of segments identified as developing atelectasis among all evaluated segments will be calculated for each patient, and the distribution of the proportion will be summarized by the mean, median, and range.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Presence or absence of atelectasis within each of the 6 bronchial segments</measure>
    <time_frame>During preoperative computed tomography (CT)</time_frame>
    <description>Will be determined using RP-EBUS. A segment will be identified as having a new atelectasis if there is an indication of solid- or semisolid-appearing lesion by RP-EBUS without a corresponding indication of solid tumor or atelectasis on the preoperative CT. If any of the two subsegments of any specific center has atelectasis, that segment will be considered atelectatic. The outcome of the reading will be defined by whatever pattern 2 or all 3 readers agree on. Locations of atelectasis will be summarized in a frequency table, allowing for multiple locations in the same patient. The proportion of segments identified as developing atelectasis among all evaluated segments will be calculated for each patient, and the distribution of the proportion will be summarized by the mean, median, and range.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Presence or absence of atelectasis for each patient</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>After identifying the presence or absence of new atelectasis for each segment, patients with at least 1 segment containing a new atelectasis will be determined to have atelectasis. Patients without atelectasis in any of the 6 segments will be determined to not have atelectasis. Patients with atelectasis and patients without atelectasis will be compared in terms of patient characteristics using a t-test or Wilcoxon test for continuous variables and Fisher's exact test or Chi-squared test for categorical variables.</description>
