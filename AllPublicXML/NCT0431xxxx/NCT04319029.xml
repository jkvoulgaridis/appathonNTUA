    <textblock>
      A randomized, parallel two-arm interventional study, the patients were divided into 1:1
      ratio, in which both groups offered optimal pharmacological therapy also one group
      (interventional) offered predesign pharmaceutical care plan aimed to improved patients
      knowledge, adherence, satisfaction, and quality of life, while the other group
      (non-interventional) received conventional pharmaceutical care plan.

    <description>The design of the intervention was based on a stepwise approach to address the following point in each participant: set priorities for patient care, assessment of patient's educational needs, and development of a comprehensive and achievable pharmaceutical care plan.
The participants will be educated about their illness and informed about the proper use of their medication in a structured manner (it involved the following items: dyslipidemia as a disease, complications, who therapy reduces its risk and complications, goal of therapy). Behavioral modifications will involve the following: physical exercise, diet, smoking cessation. Patients will obtain this information verbally and provided in a written manner through a brochure that design for this study.</description>
