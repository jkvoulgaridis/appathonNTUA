  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to analyze cardiac biomarkers, electrocardiograms and
      cardio-pulmonary exercise test (CPET) results in children with cardiomyopathies.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study group will consist of children that have been diagnosed with DCM, HCM or LVNC. The
      control group will be composed of healthy children. Examination of cardiac biomarkers (in the
      study group), ECG, 24-hour- ECG monitoring, CPET will be performed.

      Patients in the study group will be invited for 2 consecutive visits (in 6-10 months
      intervals). During the first and the last visit CPET will be performed. The control group
      will not be invited for consecutive visits.
