      Aim of Study:

      To determine the optimal duration of voice rest following phonosurgery for patients who
      undergo phonosurgery due to benign vocal cord lesions IE: vocal fold nodules, cysts, polyps,
      granulomas, leukoplakia, and subepithelial edema.

      Optimal Duration of Voice Rest Voice Following Phonosurgery for benign vocal lesions:
      Prospective Randomized Study

      Background:

      Phonosurgery is performed in order to improve voice quality in patients with various vocal
      fold pathologies including nodules, cysts, polyps, granulomas, leukoplakia, and subepithelial
      edema. It is customary to order the patients voice rest following vocal fold surgery,
      however, according to the current literature, it is not well known how long patients should
      remain in voice rest following phonosurgery (regardless of the type of benign lesion) in
      order to achieve the best voice quality results. In the literature, there is one preliminary
      study that shows that when voice quality was assessed at 15 days post-surgery, patients with
      voice rest of 10 days had better voice outcomes compared to patients with 5 days voice
      rest(1). A contradicting study, that measured voice outcomes in patients at 1, 3, and 6
      months post-operatively, shows that a short voice rest of 3 days lead to better voice results
      compared to a 7 days voice rest(2).

      The aim of our study is to determine the optimal duration (3 versus 7 days) of voice rest
      following phonosurgery for patients who undergo phonosurgery due to benign vocal cord lesions
      in order to achieve better voice quality post-operatively. In this study, patients will be
      randomly assigned into one of 2 different groups of voice rest durations: either 3 or 7 days
      following surgery. Patients will undergo pre and post (at 1, 3 and 6 months) operative voice
      testing. Voice quality testing will include: perceptual voice analysis using the GRABS
      (grade, roughness, asthenia, breathiness, and strain) scale, Voice Handicap Index-10 (VHI)
      questionnaire, measurement of maximum phonation time (MPT), and computerized voice analysis
      including voice intensity, fundamental frequency (F0), jitter, shimmer, and dysphonia
      severity index (DSI).

    <intervention_model_description>Prospective Study. In this study, patients will be placed into one of two different groups of voice rest duration. The voice rest durations will last either 3 or 7 days. Voice recording results of the different groups will be examined and analyzed. At the conclusion of this study, we hope to provide some clarity as to the optimal duration of voice rest following phonosurgery.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The first days will take place in hospitalization to assess patient complience to voice rest. Patients will be instructed to continue voice rest at home up to 7 days accourding to group allocation in the study. The confirmation of voice rest will relay on patient report (telephonic approval), after the voice rest period will end.</description>
