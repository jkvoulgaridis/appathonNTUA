  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) represents the most common type of lymphoid neoplasm,
      over 30% of patients experience disease progression or relapse with a poor prognosis. Early
      identification of high-risk patients is important for patient management. According to the
      National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines, the International Prognostic Index
      (IPI) is recommended as a prognostic model in DLBCL. However, IPI is inaccurate in predicting
      refractory disease. 18F-FDG PET/CT has been applied as a routine imaging tool for the
      pretreatment evaluation, staging and response assessment of lymphoma. Recently, radiomic
      analysis has been introduced to reflect the intratumoral heterogeneity. Thus, the
      investigators hypothesized that radiomic features could provide incremental predictive value
      beyond the IPI score and conventional PET parameters in DLBCL.

        The target study population of this retrospective study is patients with DLBCL who have
        undergone pre-treatment 18F-FDG PET/CT prior to the R-CHOP or R-CHOP like chemotherapy. The
        study will assess the relationships between PET-derived radiomic features with the patient
        outcome data.
