      Participants will undergo screening for study, if eligible, participants will be dosed with
      15 million or 30 million cells will be administered via IA delivery with interventional
      radiology. Participant study visits after study intervention includes visits on: Day 1, Week
      1, Week 2, Week 8, Week 24, Week 52, and Week 104.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males and Females 18-65 years of age.

          -  Moderate to Severe medically refractory inflammatory ulcerative colitis:

               -  as defined by a an Adapted Mayo Score of 5to 9 points

               -  including an endoscopic sub-score of 2 or 3

          -  Concurrent therapies with corticosteroids, 5-ASA drugs, thiopurines, MTX, antibiotics,
             anti-TNF, and anti-integrin therapy are permitted.

          -  To meet the definition of refractory UC, all patients must have failed at least 2
             standard FDA approved medications for the treatment of UC

               -  Current standard therapy includes 5-ASA products, thiopurines, anti-TNF therapy,
                  ustekinemab, vedolizumab, and tofacitinib (i.e. all FDA approved therapies for
                  UC).

               -  Refractory and failure to response is defined as continued symptoms despite 12
                  weeks of therapy at FDA approved doses by product necessitating change in medical
                  strategy or referral for colectomy.

          -  All patients should have undergone a colonoscopy in last 12 months to rule out
             malignant or premalignant condition

          -  Female subjects that are of child bearing potential must to agree to use effective
             contraception method(s) for the duration of the study

          -  Hemoglobin must be greater than 8

          -  INR must be less than 1.5

          -  Ability to comply with protocol

          -  Competent and able to provide written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability to give informed consent.

          -  Clinically significant medical conditions within the six months before administration
             of MSCs: e.g. myocardial infarction, active angina, congestive heart failure or other
             conditions that would, in the opinion of the investigators, compromise the safety of
             the patient.

          -  Specific exclusions; Known history of hepatitis B, C, or HIV

          -  Patients that have had a partial colectomy

          -  Patients that have underlying vasculitis or have been diagnosed with an underlying
             condition that predisposes to developing blood clots.

          -  History of cancer including melanoma (with the exception of localized skin cancers)

          -  Investigational drug within thirty (30) days of baseline

          -  History of clinically significant auto-immunity (other than UC) or any previous
             example of fat-directed autoimmunity. Note that auto-immmunity is defined as a
             systemic immune mediated disease for which the antigen is known or unknown. Autoimmune
             diseases other than UC are excluded. Extraintestinal manifestations of UC
             (specifically joint inflammation, eye inflammation, PSC, skin manifestations- i.e.
             pyoderma gangrenosum, erythema nodosum) will be allowable.

          -  Allergic to local anesthetics

          -  Pregnant patients or trying to become pregnant or breast feeding.

          -  Neoplasia of the colon and preoperative biopsy

          -  C. Difficile infection within 30 days of study injection

          -  Diagnosis of indeterminate colitis or suspicion of CD

          -  Subjects with fulminant colitis, toxic megacolon, with ostomy, or ileoanal pouch

          -  History or demonstration of pathology related to adipose tissue

          -  Any other indication determined by the PI to be counter indicated for participation on
             this trial.
