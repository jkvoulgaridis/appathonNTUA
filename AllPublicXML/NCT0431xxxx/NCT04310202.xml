    <textblock>
      This multi-centre study funded by Oticon Medical AB will be conducted at seven hospitals
      across Europe (UK, Spain, Denmark). Patients with a hearing loss and that are already planned
      for treatment with a percutaneous (through the skin) bone-anchored hearing system (BAHS) will
      be included in the study. A total of 50 patients will be included in the study.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the rate of successful BAHS use after
      implantation of the Ponto Biohelix (BHX) Implant system.

      This multi-centre study funded by Oticon Medical AB will be conducted at seven hospitals
      across Europe (UK, Spain, Denmark). Patients with a hearing loss and that are already planned
      for treatment with a percutaneous (through the skin) bone-anchored hearing system (BAHS) will
      be included in the study. A total of 50 patients will be included in the study.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the rate of successful BAHS use after
      implantation of the Ponto BHX Implant system. The implant, coupled to a skin-penetrating
      abutment, is implanted in the bone behind the ear and is later loaded with a sound processor
      which transforms sound waves to sound vibrations that can be sent directly to the inner ear
      via the skull bone. The primary objective of this study is to investigate the proportion of
      implant/abutment complexes providing a reliable anchorage for a sound processor, 3 months
      after implantation/surgery.
