  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Volunteers take 50 g of glucose in 250 ml of water in 5 minutes.Then, they are tested blood
      glucose levels (taken from the fingertips) at 15, 30 ,45, 60, 90, and 120 minutes. There is 3
      days for wash out period. These tests will be repeated for 3 times for baseline glucose
      calculation. After that, volunteers take 50 g of longan syrup in 250 ml of water in 5
      minutes.Then, they are tested blood glucose levels (taken from the fingertips) at 15, 30 ,45,
      60, 90, and 120 minutes. Glycemic index of longan syrup is calculated from area under the
      curved of blood glucose after longan syrup taking divided to mean of area under the curved of
      blood glucose after glucose taking.
