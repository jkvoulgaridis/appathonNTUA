  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People experiencing psychosis might find social interactions stressful and avoid them. This
      can result in isolation and can affect relationships, employment and quality of life.
      Improving social functioning is a really important aspect of recovery. Facing social
      situations after the first episode of psychosis can be very difficult and provoke intense
      anxiety. However, research has shown that the earlier intervention is offered, the better the
      outcome. Therefore, improving therapies for people experiencing their first episode of
      psychosis is a key target for research. Virtual Reality presents a unique opportunity to
      bring real-life-type environments into a therapy session to help people to overcome their
      distress in social situations and make them feel less anxious. Virtual Reality assisted
      Therapy (VRT) provides a 'safe space' to practice strategies and techniques to help people
      work towards improving their social functioning, build new ways of coping with stress and
      assist them in their recovery.

      The study uses a standard CBT model and integrates a Virtual Reality environment into it to
      support exposure and behavioural experiments for social difficulties, which are a key
      component of treatment.

      Participants will be offered up to 10 sessions including a pre and post assessment session.
      Each participant will set one or more SMART goals for therapy (e.g. be able to use public
      transport, attend a social gathering or to feel less anxious in social situations) which are
      worked on both in the therapy sessions and through homework tasks.

      This is a feasibility study. The aim is to recruit between 6-10 participants to pilot the VRT
      with. The results of this study will inform future research and practice, by helping to
      assess if service-users find the new VRT acceptable (e.g. recruitment, retention, drop out
      rates, participant experiences), and if it is effective (e.g. reduction in symptoms or
      distress, and improvement in social functioning).

      It is really important that the clinical care of anyone who chooses to participate in the
      study is not affected by their participation in this study. The researchers will work closely
      with clinical teams to ensure this. Clients who engage with the study will still be eligible
      for all aspects of TAU including psychological interventions, should this be appropriate.

      The VR technology and environment has been used extensively before in research studies, which
      have proved that it is safe and effective. However, it has not been used within the NHS
      context before or embedded within a therapy course before.
