  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial is a single arm, single-center, non-randomized phase I clinical trial which is
      designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of EXP039 in treatment of relapsed or refractory
      NHL patients

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study plans to enroll 10 patients to assess the safety and efficacy of EXP039. Subjects
      who meet the eligibility criteria will receive a single dose of EXP039 injection.

      The study will include the following sequential phases: Screening, Pre-treatment (Cell
      product preparation; Lymphodepleting Chemotherapy), Treatment and follow-up.
