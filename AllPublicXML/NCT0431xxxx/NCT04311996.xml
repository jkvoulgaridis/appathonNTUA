  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this experiment is to determine whether social buffering by friends of stress
      physiology remains effective later in puberty when friends share the load versus when they
      provide support but are not undergoing the stressor with the target child. There are four
      conditions: (1) Friend and Target both undergo the stressor, (2) Friend provides support but
      does not undergo the stressor, (3) Unfamiliar Peer and Target undergo the stressor, and (4)
      Alone (no partner).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adolescents experience social evaluation stress frequently. However, it is likely that often
      they are not alone, but with friends who are also going through the same experience. Thus, it
      is possible that under these conditions, social buffering by friends does not wane over the
      peripubertal period. Participants will be assigned to social conditions while engaging in an
      evaluative stressor task.

    <measure>Change in Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia (RSA)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 hours</time_frame>
    <description>RSA is a measure derived from ECG that examines variability in heart rate that can be attributed to respiration; software performs the calculations. RSA will be calculated during periods of stress (social evaluation) and non-stress (no evaluation) during the course of the assessment. Outcome is reported as the difference between condition scores.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self Report of Stress</measure>
    <time_frame>2 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The Self Report of Stress is an 8-item questionnaire assessing participant level of stress at various time points across the session. Items are rated on a 5 point Likert scale. Total score is the unweighted mean of item scores. Total scores range from 0 to 40, with higher scores indicating greater stress. The assessment will be administered at baseline (no stress) and during a period of stress. The outcome will be reported as the difference between the baseline period and experimental stress period.</description>
