    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effectiveness of virtual reality (VR) therapy in the treatment of
      depression and anxiety symptoms in patients undergoing second stage of cardiac
      rehabilitation. Half of the study group will receive VR therapy (VR group) as an addition to
      cardiologically monitored physical training. The other half of the group (control group) will
      receive Schultz Autogenic Training as a standard supplement to cardiological training

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiologically monitored physical training in second stage of cardiac rehabilitation leads
      to the improvement in the physical capacity and overall fitness of the patients with
      cardiovascular diseases, allowing restoration of independence in daily functioning.
      Psychological support is required in order to reduce the negative psychological symptoms
      related to the heart disease. In this study the investigators want to assess the
      effectiveness of the virtual reality (VR) therapy compared to standard psychological support
      (Schultz Autogenic Training).Thanks to using head mounted display (VR goggles) and the
      phenomenon of total immersion VR therapy allows to completely separate the patient from the
      hospital environment, provides an intense visual, auditory and kinesthetic stimulation.
      Depending on the stage of therapy it can have a calming and mood-improving effect or, in
      another part of the therapy, it can motivate the patient to the rehabilitation process. The
      additional aim of the VR therapy is to help the patients regain their emotional balance, let
      them recognize their psychological resources and trigger the natural recovery mechanisms.

      The aims of the project:

        1. The evaluation of the influence of VR therapy on the depressive symptoms and the anxiety
           level of the patients undergoing second stage of cardiac rehabilitation.

        2. The evaluation of the influence of VR therapy on the stress level of the patients
           undergoing second stage of cardiac rehabilitation.

    <description>The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) is a fourteen-item scale scoring from 0 to 3 for each item. The first seven items relate to anxiety (HADS-A), and the remaining seven items relate to depression (HADS-D). The global scoring ranges from 0 to 42 with a cut-off point of 8/21 for anxiety and 8/21 for depression. The higher the score, the greater anxiety or depression symptoms. HADS will be performed at the beginning and after four weeks of treatment.</description>

    <measure>Change in perception of stress from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and after 8 sessions of VR therapy (week 3)</time_frame>
    <description>The Perception of Stress Questionnaire (PSQ) is a 27-item scale scoring from 1 to 5 for each item. 21 items examine the level of stress in the area of emotional tension, external stress and intrapsychic stress, and 6 items refer to the lie scale. The global scoring for perception of stress ranges from 21 to 105 with a cut-off point of 60 for high level of perceived stress. The higher the score, the greater the sense of stress. PSQ will be performed at the beginning and after four weeks of treatment.</description>

    <description>8 sessions of VR therapy (each of them 20 minutes long). As a virtual reality source, VR Tier One device (Stolgraf®) were used. Thanks to using head mounted display and the phenomenon of total immersion VR therapy provides an intense visual, auditory and kinesthetic stimulation. It can have a calming and mood-improving effect or help the patients recognize their psychological resources and motivate to the rehabilitation process. In the virtual therapeutic garden there are a rich set of symbols and metaphors based on Ericksonian Psychotherapy approach.</description>
