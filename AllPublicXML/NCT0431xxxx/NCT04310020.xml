  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial studies the side effects of radiation therapy followed by atezolizumab in treating
      patients with stage II or III non-small cell lung cancer. Hyperfractionated radiation therapy
      delivers smaller doses of radiation therapy over time and may kill more tumor cells and have
      fewer side effects. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help
      the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells
      to grow and spread. The purpose of this study is to test the safety and effectiveness of
      radiation therapy followed by atezolizumab and find out what side effects, if any, it has on
      patient's non-small cell lung cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the rate of grade 3-5 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) in patients who
      are not candidates for surgery or concurrent chemoradiation and who have either performance
      status 0-2 and stage II or performance status 2 and stage III non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC), treated with hypofractionated thoracic radiotherapy followed by atezolizumab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate response rate (confirmed and unconfirmed, complete and partial by Response
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] 1.1) from Registration Step 2 in the subset of
      patients with measurable disease.

      II. To evaluate response rate (confirmed and unconfirmed, complete and partial by RECIST 1.1)
      during radiation therapy in the subset of patients with measurable disease.

      III. To evaluate progression free survival (PFS) from Registration Step 2 by RECIST 1.1.

      IV. To evaluate overall survival (OS) from Registration Step 2. V. To evaluate the frequency
      and severity of toxicities.

      ADDITIONAL OBJECTIVE:

      I. To bank blood and archival tissue for future research.

      OUTLINE:

      RADIATION THERAPY: Patients undergo hypofractionated radiation therapy 5 days per week for 3
      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      CONSOLIDATION: Patients receive atezolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on day 1.
      Cycles repeat every 21 days for up to 12 months (maximum of 17 cycles) in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 weeks, every 12 months for
      the 1 year, then every 6 months until 3 years after study start.
