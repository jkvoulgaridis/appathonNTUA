        3. Age and Reproductive Status

          1. Men and women aged ≥ 18 years old

          2. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy
             test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 24 hours prior to

          4. WOCBP must agree to follow instructions for method(s) of contraception for the
             duration of treatment with atezolizumab plus 5 half-lives of atezolizumab (5 x
             half-life = 135 days) plus 30 days (duration of ovulatory cycle) for a total of 165
             days or 24 weeks post-treatment completion.

          5. Males who are sexually active with WOCBP must agree to follow instructions for
             method(s) of contraception for the duration of treatment with atezolizumab plus 5
             half-lives of the study drug (135 days) plus 90 days (duration of sperm turnover) for
             a total of 32 weeks post-treatment completion.

          6. Azoospermic males and WOCBP who are continuously not heterosexually active are exempt
             from contraceptive requirements. However, they must still undergo pregnancy testing as
             described in this section.

        Investigators shall counsel WOCBP and male subjects who are sexually active with WOCBP on
        the importance of pregnancy prevention and the implications of an unexpected pregnancy.
        Investigators shall advise WOCBP and male subjects who are sexually active with WOCBP on
        the use of highly effective methods of contraception. Highly effective methods of
        contraception have a failure rate of &lt; 1% when used consistently and correctly.

        At a minimum, subjects must agree to the use of 2 methods of contraception, with 1 method
        being highly effective and the other method being either highly effective or less effective
        as listed below:

        HIGHLY EFFECTIVE METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION

          -  Male condoms with spermicide

          -  Hormonal methods of contraception including combined oral contraceptive pills, vaginal
             ring, injectables, implants, and intrauterine devices (IUDs) such as Mirena® by WOCBP
             subject or male subject's WOCBP partner. Female partners of male subjects
             participating in the study may use hormone-based contraceptives as one of the
             acceptable methods of contraception since they will not be receiving study drug.

          -  Non-hormonal IUDs, such as ParaGard®

          -  Tubal ligation

          -  Vasectomy

          -  Complete abstinence NOTE: Complete abstinence is defined as complete avoidance of
             heterosexual intercourse and is an acceptable form of contraception for all study
             drugs.

        Subjects who choose complete abstinence are not required to use a second method of
        contraception, but female subjects must continue to have pregnancy tests. Acceptable
        alternative methods of highly effective contraception must be discussed in the event that
        the subject chooses to forego complete abstinence.

        LESS EFFECTIVE METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION

          -  Diaphragm with spermicide

          -  Cervical cap with spermicide

          -  Vaginal sponge

          -  Male condom without spermicide

          -  Progestin only pills by WOCBP subject or male subject's WOCBP partner

          -  Female condom

          -  NOTE: A male and female condom must not be used together

        a) Target Disease Exceptions i) Subjects with ECOG PS ≥ 2 ii) Subjects with untreated CNS
        metastases are excluded. Subjects are eligible if CNS metastases are treated or subjects

        doses &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune
        disease.

        iii) Subjects who received prior therapy with anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, anti-CT137
        or anti-CTLA-4 antibody including ipilimumab or any other antibody or drug specifically

        medical disorder or active infection that, in the opinion of the investigator, may increase
        the risk associated with study participation, study drug administration, or would impair
        the ability of the subject to receive protocol therapy viii) All toxicities attributed to
        prior anti-cancer therapy other than alopecia and fatigue must have resolved to Grade 1
        (NCI CTCAE version 5) or baseline before administration of study drug ix) Subjects must
