    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to review the performance and success rate of an FDA approved
      cementless hip replacement part called the Trident II Tritanium Acetabular Shell. The study
      will specifically look at the need to revise the hip replacement after 5 years. This will be
      compared to how much this happens in patients who have hip replacement with similar
      cementless acetabular shells.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        A. Patient has signed an IRB approved, study specific Informed Patient Consent Form.

        B. Patient is a male or non-pregnant female age 18-85 years of age at the time of study
        device implantation.

        C. Patient is a candidate for a revision of a failed acetabular component with a cementless
        acetabular component.

        D. Patient is willing and able to comply with postoperative scheduled clinical and
        radiographic evaluations.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        E. Patient has a Body Mass Index (BMI) &gt; 45. F. Patient is diagnosed with Inflammatory
        Arthritis. G. Patient has a non-Stryker retained stem. H. Patient has an active or
        suspected latent infection in or about the affected hip joint at time of study device
        implantation.

        I. Patient has a mental or neuromuscular disorder which would create an unacceptable risk
        of prosthesis instability, prosthesis fixation failure, or complications in postoperative
        care.

        J. Patient has compromised bone stock which cannot provide adequate support and/or fixation
        to the prosthesis.

        K. Patient is diagnosed with a systemic disease (e.g. Lupus Erythematosus) or a metabolic
        disorder (e.g. Paget's Disease) leading to progressive bone deterioration.

        L. Patient is immunologically suppressed or receiving steroids in excess of normal
        physiological requirements (e.g. &gt; 30 days). M. Patient has a known sensitivity to device
        materials. N. Patient is a prisoner.
