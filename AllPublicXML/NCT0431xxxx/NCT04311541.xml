      The primary purpose of the study is to evaluate effect of Dexilant treatment among GERD
      participants in the Russian Federation.

      This is an observational, prospective non-interventional study of participants with GERD.
      This study will evaluate the effect of dexlansoprazole treatment among participants with
      GERD.

      The study will enroll approximately 1500 participants. Due to non-interventional design of
      the study, the decision about GERD treatment strategy for the participant is taken by
      attending treating physician. All participants will be enrolled in one observational group:
      dexlansoprazole.

      Prospective data will be collected for a period of 2 months. The frequency of the visits will
      be assigned by each physician according to their routine practice.

      The multi-center trial will be conducted in Russia. The overall duration of study will be
      approximately 2 months.

    <measure>Change From Baseline (Visit 1) in GERDq Score on Dexilant Treatment Among GERD Participants at Month 1 (Visit 3)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Visit 1), Month 1 (Visit 3)</time_frame>
    <description>GERDq is a self-completed participant questionnaire that is used to assess the frequency of following symptoms: heartburn, regurgitation, stomach pain, nausea, sleep disturbance and use of additional medication due to heartburn/regurgitation. Symptom frequency will be assessed for the week passed using following answers: 0 days, 1 day, 2-3 days, and 4-7 days. Each answer will be assigned a score from 0 to 3 (heartburn, regurgitation, sleep disturbance and use of additional medication due to heartburn/regurgitation) or from 3 to 0 (stomach pain, nausea). Total score will be calculated as a sum of 6 individual scores. GERDq score was calculated as sum of these scores, giving a total score ranging from 0 to 18. When GERDq greater than or equal to (&gt;=)8, the participants could be symptom based diagnosed as GERD. Total score of 0 to 2 points=0 percent (%) likelihood of GERD; 3 to 7 points=50% likelihood of GERD; 8 to 10 points=79% likelihood of GERD; 11 to 18 points=89% likelihood of GERD.</description>

    <measure>Changes From Baseline (Visit 1) in Daytime Severity GERD Symptoms by Likert Scale on Dexilant Treatment Among GERD Participants at Months 1 (Visit 3) and 2 (Visit 4)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Visit 1), Month 1 (Visit 3) and Month 2 (Visit 4)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants collected GERD-associated symptoms of daytime regurgitation, dysphagia, stomach pain, in daily symptom diary. Daytime episodes are defined as those that occurred after arising in the morning until retiring in the evening. The severity score was calculated was based on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (no symptom) to 4 (very severe symptom); higher scores indicated greater disease activity.</description>
