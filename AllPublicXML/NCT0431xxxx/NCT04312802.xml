  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients being assessed for Kidney Pancreas transplantation often have pre-existing co-morbid
      disease that contributes to structural cardiac and vascular disease. There is no consensus on
      optimal pre-listing cardiac assessment to reliably minimize risk of peri-operative cardiac
      events. Functional status using the cardio-pulmonary exercise test (CPET) has been used in
      cardiac and abdominal surgery, including abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair and kidney
      transplantation, but high risk patients with diabetes are often lacking from these studies.
      This study will investigate the correlation between function, measures using CPET and
      standard cardiac assessment, and determine the variation in usual measures of anaerobic
      threshold and VO2 max in this population.

      20 participants will be recruited to a blinded observational study. Patients referred for
      pancreas kidney transplantation assessment will be provided information about the study. They
      will subsequently be approached at their initial assessment visit and informed consent will
      be taken.

      Participants will have standard clinical assessment which includes:

        1. Clinical history and examination

        2. 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG)

        3. Chest X-ray (CXR)

        4. Myocardial perfusion imaging (MPS)

        5. If MPS imaging is suggestive of stress induced ischaemia, or severe left ventricular
           (LV) dysfunction, the participant will undergo coronary angiography as part of standard
           assessment protocol.

      In addition, study participants will undergo CPET testing. This will take place within 1 week
      of the standard peri-operative cardiac assessment. The results of this investigation will be
      recorded against a unique identifier on a secure Oxford University Hospital computer.
      Information about the study or participants' individual results will not normally be
      disclosed to the participant or clinical team, and so will not influence clinical management.
      However if, when the results are analysed, the research team note a CPET result that suggests
      a clear and significant impairment of functional reserve such that the participant should not
      be listed, this result will be disclosed to the individual and their medical team so that the
      information can be used in order to make the safest decision about transplant listing. There
      will be no further clinical visits but participants will consent to collection of their
      clinical data until 3 months post-transplant, or until they are removed from the waiting
      list.

      At the end of the study, the results of CPET testing will be correlated to measures from
      standard cardiac investigations and to peri-operative cardiac events.

    <description>The participant will undergo a cardio-pulmonary exercise test (CPET) on a cycle ergometer (Ergoline) connected to a 12-lead electrocardiogram, oxygen saturation monitor and continuous non-invasive blood pressure cuff. Respiratory gas exchanged will be measured from a tight fitting facemask. An initial 2-min period of baseline data will be collected at rest before a 180-s period of unloaded cycling. A ramp protocol will then be applied and the participant will be instructed to continue cycling at a constant cadence of 60 rpm as long as they can. The test will be terminated if the participant indicates that:
they cannot continue
cadence falls to &lt;55 rpm due to fatigue or dyspnoea
they develop abnormal cardiac signs or symptoms, such as ischaemia and arrhythmia.</description>
