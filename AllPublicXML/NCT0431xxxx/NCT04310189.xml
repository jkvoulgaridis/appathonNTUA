  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interleukin 22 (IL-22) is known to be regulated by IL-22 binding protein (IL-22BP), a
      soluble, inhibitory receptor. The potential role of IL-22BP in atopic dermatitis (AD) is
      mostly unknown and deserves further investigation. The main objective of this study is to
      better understand the potential protective role of IL-22BP through the assessment of its
      expression at the Messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA) and protein levels in skin and serum
      which will be correlated to the severity of the diseases and through the identification of
      its cellular sources in lesions. The results of this study will help to correctly interpret
      the levels of IL-22 in AD and will potentially allow identifying biomarkers for patient
      stratification and predicting clinical outcomes to targeted therapeutic agents.

      This is a single-visit study. All patients will have a blood sample and 2 skin biopsies (2 mm
      diameter) in lesional and non lesional area

      . It is planned to include 45 patients (15 patients per severity group: SCORAD ]25-50] ,
      ]50-65]; 50-65; &gt;65).The first 20 patients included will be group 2 and 3 patients (SCORAD &gt;
      50).

      The patients will be adults with AD recruited from the cohort of patients followed up in the
      Dermatology department of Nantes University Hospital. A refusal rate of 4/5 is expected.
      Recruitment can therefore be envisaged in 18 months (2.5 patients/month). Patients will be
      recruited during follow-up consultations or at the first consultation in the department.
      Recruitment will be coordinated by the clinical research team (CRT). Blood samples will be
      taken by the CRT Nurse. The skin and blood samples will be sent to the CIMNA/ Immunology
      Laboratory Nantes University hospital

    <description>To compare the expression levels of IL-22 at the transcriptomic level in non lesional and lesional skin between the different groups of AD patients included in the study.
Three groups of patients will be defined based on the SCORAD score . The score is out of 103 and is higher the greater the severity of the disease:
Group 1: SCORAD score between ]25-50]
Group 2: SCORAD between ]50; 65]
Group 3: SCORAD greater than 65.</description>
