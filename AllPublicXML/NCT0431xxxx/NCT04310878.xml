      A web-based survey to the members of the Colorectal Chapter of 10 Spanish Associations of
      surgical nurses and surgeons of different specialities. A link to the web page containing the
      survey will be disseminated via email, newsletter and Twitter.

      A board from the Surgical Infection Section did a review of evidence and previous guidelines
      to be used in the evaluation of the results. The most recent clinical practice guidelines
      have been analysed. According to the review, the preventive measures analysed in the survey
      have been distributed into two groups: high or low level of evidence.

      The survey aim to assess knowledge, beliefs, and practices of attending nurses and surgeons
      on preventative measures. Furthermore, the questions address the level of accordance between
      their beliefs and the protocols or the usual practice of their units. The agreement rate
      between the beliefs and usual practice of all respondents will be calculated on a scale from
      0 to 100. For discussion, the responses on the implementation of major surgical site
      infection (SSI) prevention measures will be compared with the recommendations of the expert
      group.

      The results will be expressed in percentages on the total answers obtained. Responses will be
      entered into a computerized database that will be analysed using an specific program. The
      results will be analysed using the chi-square test with statistical significance defined as p
      &lt;0.05.
