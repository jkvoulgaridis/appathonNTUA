  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stress is important for health. As emergency departments (EDs) are often stressful places, a
      better understanding of the human stress response is important for understanding how and why
      patients respond as they do when they come to the ED. Since the investigators cannot take up
      space in the ED for research, the investigators will instead recruit 20 methamphetamine-using
      participants who are not currently in treatment to the simulated ED room in the University of
      Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) Simulation Center. The investigators will have
      participants perform a stressor task involving public speaking and a simple arithmetic task.
      The investigators will see if this experiment can be made to be like being in an actual ED by
      varying what participants speak about in the task. By doing this, the investigators hope to
      find out several important things: 1) Is a stressor task feasible and acceptable to
      participants? 2) What does the stress response -- as measured by cortisol and alpha-amylase
      -- look like in these participants? 3) Does varying what participants talk about make the
      experiment seem more like an actual ED? 4) Do participants under stress show even mild
      symptoms of agitation as measured by clinical scales? If so, how often?

      Aim 1: Determine the feasibility and acceptability of an ED-relevant stressor task as
      compared to a standard social stressor task. The investigators hypothesize that an
      ED-relevant stressor task will be feasible, as measured by the ability to
      recruit/randomize/retain participants, and as acceptable to participants as a standard social
      stressor task.

      Aim 2: Measure the stress response (alpha-amylase, cortisol, vital signs) in participants who
      undergo an ED-relevant stress task compared to a standard social stress task. The
      investigators hypothesize that norepinephrine release will be adequately assessed by salivary
      alpha-amylase and that an ED-relevant stressor task will elicit similar or greater
      physiological responses as a standard social stress task.

      Aim 3: Evaluate the ED-representativeness of an ED-relevant stressor task compared to a
      standard social stressor task. Although both tasks will be performed in a simulated ED room
      in the UAMS Simulation Center, the investigators hypothesize that an ED-relevant task will be
      rated as more representative of an actual ED visit.

      Aim 4: Evaluate ethological ratings of non-verbal behavior thought to indicate assertion and
      ratings of agitation using rating scales commonly employed in the clinical environment for
      this purpose. Participants undergoing stress sometimes display symptoms of assertion or
      agitation, but it is unknown when or how often this occurs. The investigators hypothesize
      that ethological ratings will be correlated with agitation scale scores and physiological
      changes.

    <measure>Determine the feasibility and acceptability of an ED-relevant stressor task as compared to a standard social stressor task.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Measure feasibility and acceptability in the following ways: participant recruitment; the number of participants completing the experiment; and the acceptability ratings of the task after completion. The 9-point acceptability responses will be analyzed by calculating the mean and 95% confidence intervals for each question, then calculating a chi-square goodness of fit test across the 3 ranges of the scores.
Answers to open-ended questions about participant experiences will be coded using conventional content analysis, as per Hsieh and Shannon. In this analysis, two research associates separately read through all the participants' qualitative responses and highlight key words which reflect the overall idea of the patient's response. After multiple reviews, 3-5 main categories will be identified which reflect responses of a similar nature. After categorization, a third research associate will make final decisions on the placement of individual responses.</description>

    <description>Participants will be given 4.5 minutes to prepare a 4.5-minute public speech on three standard scenarios presented in counterbalanced order. This will involve approximately 30 minutes of public speaking stress given expected transitions. The public speeches will be presented in front of 1-2 individuals who are evaluating their presentations. Immediately after the public speaking task, participants will be asked to complete a mental arithmetic task for 15 minutes.</description>

    <description>Participants will be given 4.5 minutes to prepare a 4.5-minute public speech on three experiences surrounding their most stressful ED visit. These experiences are presented in counterbalanced order. This will involve approximately 30 of public speaking stress given expected transitions. The public speeches will be presented in front of 1-2 individuals who are evaluating their presentations. Immediately after the public speaking task, participants will be asked to complete a mental arithmetic task for 15 minutes.</description>

    <description>Participants will be asked to imagine and then describe both feelings and bodily sensations experienced at their most stressful ED visit, in order to help them more fully re-experience the situation. In this regard, the second condition is more similar to stress imagery employed by Sinha et al, which elevated cortisol to a greater degree than a social stressor task. Participants may be prompted by an experimenter. However, the participant will receive no verbal nor nonverbal feedback.</description>
