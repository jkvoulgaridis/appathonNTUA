      TThis is a comparative clinical study which will be conducted in OMFS department of DIKIOHS,
      DUHS Ojha Karachi. In this study the investigators will be comparing the effect of
      dexamethasone on pain and edema when administered pre-operatively vs post-operatively
      following surgery of impacted lower 3rd molars. Time duration of this study will be 2 months.
      A total of 100 patients will be considered in this study which will be equally divided into
      two groups; group A and group B (50 in each group).Group A will receive dexamethasone 1 hour
      pre-operatively while group B will receive the same post-operatively. All surgeries will be
      performed by the same maxillofacial surgeon and duration of surgery will be around 30-45
      mins.

      To compare the effect of dexamethasone (IM; 8mg) administered pre-operatively versus
      post-operatively on pain and edema following surgical extraction of mesio-angularly impacted
      mandibular 3rd molars.

      This is a comparative clinical study. This study will be conducted in Oral Maxillofacial
      Surgery department of DIKIOHS, DUHS Teaching Hospital, Ojha, Karachi, Pakistan. Time duration
      of this study will be 2 months. A total of 100 patients will be considered in the study (50
      in each group). Sample size was calculated through OpenEpi, taking mean values of
      post-operative 3rd day swelling (cm) of group A (12.15±0.78), group B (13.85±0.78) [Ref #],
      95% confidence interval (two sided) and 80% of the power of the test. The sample size came
      out to be 8 patients (4 in each group). The sampling technique is Convenience Sampling.
      Patients will be randomly distributed into two groups; Group A &amp; Group B. Group A will
      receive dexamethasone 8mg Intra-muscularly 1 hour pre-operatively while Group B will receive
      the same immediately after surgery. All surgeries will be performed by the same maxillofacial
      surgeon and duration of surgery will be around 30-45 minutes.

    <time_frame>Change in the intensity of pain will be assessed from baseline to 1st, 3rd and 7th day post-operatively.</time_frame>
    <description>Pain will be assessed using Visual Analog Scale (VAS). VAS is a psychometric response scale which can be used as a measurement instrument for subjective characteristics or attitudes that cannot be directly measured. It is graded from 0 to 10; 0 indicating &quot;No pain&quot; while 10 indicating &quot;excruciating/ unbearable pain&quot;</description>
