  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Real-CHOICE - designed as a prospective, longitudinal, observational, non-interventional
      study - will investigate the attitude of patients and physicians towards IV (intravenous)
      iron therapy in general and IIM (iron isomaltoside 1000) treatment particularly before and
      after IIM treatment in iron deficient patients with or without anemia in the real-world
      clinical setting after commercial availability of this product in Switzerland.
