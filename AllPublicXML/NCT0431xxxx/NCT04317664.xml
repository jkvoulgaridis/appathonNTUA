  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the effects of an in-vehicle driving feedback
      technology, with and without parent communication training, on risky driving events, unsafe
      driving behaviors, and subsequent traffic violations among teens who have recently received a
      moving traffic violation.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For this study, 240 teen and parent/guardian dyads will be randomized into one of three study
      groups for six months. Teens will be aged 16-17 who committed a moving-related traffic
      violation and their parent/legal guardian who is most involved with their driving.
      Researchers will aim to determine the effects of the intervention on teens' risky driving
      events, unsafe driving behaviors, and traffic violation recidivism. Additionally, researchers
      will aim to determine the effects of the intervention on frequency and quality of parent-teen
      communications about safe driving practices.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Parent-teen Communication</measure>
    <time_frame>Six months/study period</time_frame>

    <description>The Feedback and Parent Communication Group will have the in-vehicle devices in the teen's car and download the smartphone app on the teen's smartphone. Researchers will provide instructions on how teens and parents can review their driving data. The parent will also receive communication training on how to motivate their teen to adopt safe driving habits via online modules and a video call with a motivational interviewing professional. A second booster session will also occur two months after the initial training. Both teens and parents will receive a biweekly cumulative driving report.</description>
