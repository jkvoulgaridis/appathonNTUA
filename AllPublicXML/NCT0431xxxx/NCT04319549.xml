      Endodontic post-treatment pain management is one of the most challenging problems in the
      clinical practice of endodontics. Although this pain is decreased after root canal treatment,
      there may be residual symptoms due to inflammation. It has been reported that up to 80% of
      patients with preoperative pain, will report pain after endodontic treatment, which might
      range from mild to severe. Management of endodontic pain should involve all steps of
      treatment including preoperative pain control through accurate diagnosis and reduction of
      anxiety, intraoperative pain control through effective and profound local anesthetic,
      operative techniques and that can be achieved through a variety of pharmacologic agents. Many
      mechanisms have been proposed to explain the reason for postoperative pain including the
      sensitization of nociceptors by inflammatory mediators. Among these chemical inflammatory
      mediators are the prostaglandins which is the terminal product of arachidonic acid
      metabolism, through the cyclooxygenase (COX) pathway. Endodontic treatment can cause the
      release of inflammatory mediators (e.g. prostaglandins, leukotrienes, bradykinin, platelet-
      activating factor and substance P) into the surrounding periapical tissues, causing pain
      fibers to be directly stimulated (by bradykinin for instance) or sensitized (by
      prostaglandins). In addition, the vascular dilation and increased permeability as a
      consequence of periradicular inflammation, cause edema and increased interstitial tissue
      response. Single-visit root canal treatment is common in some endodontic practices. However,
      one of the main concerns with this approach has been the fear of post- operative pain.
      Mechanical, chemical and microbiological injuries to the peri- radicular tissues during root
      canal treatment have been suggested as possible causes of post-operative pain. The role of
      irrigating solutions used during root canal treatment to help control post-operative pain is
      unclear. While certain studies have observed a reduction in post-operative pain with
      particular types and concentrations of irrigating solutions, other studies have reported no
      difference in post-operative pain with the different irrigating solutions .

      When the treatment itself appears to initiate the onset of pain and/or swelling, the result
      can be very distressing to both the patient and the operator.

      Patients might even consider postoperative pain and flare-up as a benchmark against which the
      clinician's skills are measured. Prevalence of postoperative pain or flare-up is, therefore,
      one of the influencing factors when making a clinical decision. Better management of
      postoperative pain increases the patients' confidence in dentist's skills and gives positive
      attitude toward dental profession. The major cause of this pain is thought to be because of
      the release of inflammatory mediators that stimulate sensitive nociceptors surrounding the
      tooth. The resultant stimulation of both central and peripheral mechanisms is described as
      hyperalgesia which is defined as an increase in the perceived degree of a painful stimulus.
      One of the many inflammatory mediators, IL-8 has been extensively considered as a potential
      marker for irreversible pulpitis. Increased expression of IL-8 is correlated with increased
      polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) within the pulp because IL-8 induces neutrophil
      chemotaxis and release of degradation enzymes during degranulation. Substance P was the
      initial neuropeptide identified in the dental tissues. The released substance P further
      promotes the release of short-lived inflammatory mediators providing a fresh supply of
      prostaglandins (iPGE2), leukotriene (iLTB4) and bradykinins. These sustained effects of the
      released inflammatory mediators are part of a local positive feedback cycle. Neuronal
      responses in the dental pulp due to caries have been shown to alter the anatomical
      distribution of nerve fibers, leading to increases in neuropeptide expression and increased
      pain sensitivity as a result of peripheral sensitization. Prostaglandin construction in this
      inflammatory process is via the cyclooxygenase pathway. Ketorolac tromethamine, a potent
      NSAID available in both oral and injectable forms, is over 400 times more potent as a
      selective inhibitor of COX-1 over COX-2 than many other drugs. When ketorolac tromethamine
      was used as an intracanal medicament in teeth with irreversible pulpitis undergoing root
      canal treatment, it contributed to significant post operative pain relief.

    <description>NaOCl is the gold standard and the most commonly used root canal irrigant. NaOCl is able to dissolve the organic tissues inside root canal due to its alkalinity (pH11), which causes amino acid degradation and hydrolysis through the production of chloramine molecules. In addition, it possesses highly antibacterial effect and its low cost makes it the most frequently used root canal irrigant. Dual rinse is considered an effective time saving root canal irrigant with a better antibacterial property in comparison to NaOCl alone. In addition to its effectiveness on smear layer removal and reduction in the debris accumulation during root canal instrumentation.</description>
