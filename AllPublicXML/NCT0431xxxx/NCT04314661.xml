  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The clinical trial will be carried out at the Gatot Soebroto Army Central Hospital, Jakarta
      and planned from October 2019 to April 2020. Clinical trials of UC-MSCs and CM UC MSCs
      against OA were designed in three groups with arthroscopy and without arthroscopy with each
      of the groups 1 and 2 were given 5 million UC-MSCs cells then continued with 2 cc UC-MSCs CM
      given twice at 2-week intervals, while group 3 were given 2cc CM-MSCs and continued with 2-cm
      CM-MSCs administration at intervals 2 weeks. The study subjects each group amounted to 5
      patients suffering from osteoarthritis. Once a week, all subjects were given physiotherapy by
      a doctor. Patients were evaluated for 6 months after injection.

      The hypothesis are

        1. There is an optimum improvement to the arthroscopy compared to without arthroscopy using
           UC-MSCs and CM UC-MSCs in osteoarthritis sufferers

        2. Reduced pain during joint rehabilitation and inflammation using UC-MSCs and CM UC-MSCs
           in patients with osteoarthritis.

        3. There are differences in functional scores of the knee joint after therapy using UC-MSCs
           and CM UC-MSCs in patients with osteoarthritis.

        4. There are differences in levels of inflammatory enzymes after therapy using UC-MSCs and
           CM UC-MSCs in patients with osteoarthritis.

        5. There is a significant relationship between improvement in functional score of the knee
           joint with levels of inflammatory enzymes in osteoarthritis
