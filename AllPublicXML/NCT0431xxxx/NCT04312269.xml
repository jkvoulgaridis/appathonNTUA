  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the combination of myoelectric computer interface (MyoCI) training
      with targeted memory reactivation (TMR) in chronic stroke survivors. The study aims to
      determine whether this training-plus-sleep combination will generalize to improve arm motor
      function over an extended training protocol in stroke survivors.
