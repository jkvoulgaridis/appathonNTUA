      The objective of the study was to compare the effects of Buteyko breathing technique and
      pursed lip breathing technique in the management of asthma. A randomized controlled trial was
      conducted on 60 asthmatic patients randomly allocated to Buteyko technique group and pursed
      lip breathing group. Both the groups received 4 weeks of treatment, 3 times per week. Data
      was collected at base line, 2nd week and 4th week. Outcome measurements included FVC, FEV,
      PEFR and Asthma Control Test Questionnaire scores. Data analysis was carried out on
      Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) v.21.0. Confidence interval was kept at
      95% and a p-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is an inflammatory condition in which narrowing and swelling of the airways occur,
      accompanied with extra mucus production. This results in difficulty in breathing and triggers
      coughing, wheezing and dyspnea. In some cases asthma is a minor irritation, but on the other
      end of the spectrum it may interfered with activities of daily living and can even become
      life threatening in severe asthma attacks. According to a study conducted in Pakistan, the
      prevalence of asthma in adults was found to be 10.8% in adults, working in tanneries with
      5.3% of them reporting their symptoms to be work related.

      Non-pharmacological management of asthma includes patient education, guidance and
      physiotherapy. It is suggested that physical therapy may have positive effects in patients
      with asthma, as they possess dysfunctional breathing patterns accompanied with poor physical
      condition. Numerous reviews by Cochrane have been published in the recent years regarding the
      effects of physical therapy in patients with asthma, focusing on the effects of numerous
      techniques including Alexander technique, manual therapy, physical training, breathing
      exercises and inspiratory muscle training. In terms of specific effects of different physical
      therapy treatment techniques in patients with asthma, in light of the existing literature,
      breathing exercises have found to improve quality of life, reduce symptoms of anxiety,
      depression and hyperventilation, and decrease respiratory rate and medication use. Moreover,
      inspiratory muscle training is found to improve symptoms, decrease medication use and also
      improve inspiratory pressure.

      Buteyko technique is a specialized breathing technique developed to reduce chronic
      hyperinflation.

      A pre and post design quasi experimental study conducted was conducted in 2014 to determine
      the effects of Buteyko breathing technique on asthma control and QOL in school aged children
      with asthma where Buteyko breathing technique group showed significant improvements terms of
      asthma control and quality of life.

      Based upon the review of the literature, evidence is inadequate in terms of comparison of
      Buteyko breathing technique with pursed lip breathing technique in the management of patients
      with asthma except for a single randomized controlled trial. For this reason the purpose of
      the current study is to compare the effects of Buteyko technique with pursed lip breathing in
      the management of patients with asthma.

    <description>Peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) measured through digital spirometer. Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEFR) measured through digital spirometer. Three zones of measurement are commonly used to interpret peak flow rates. Normal value of PEFR is (80-100%). Green zone indicates 80 to 100 percent of the usual or normal peak flow reading, yellow zone indicates 50 to 79 percent of the usual or normal peak flow readings, and red zone indicates less than 50 percent of the usual or normal peak flow readings.</description>

    <description>Asthma Control questionnaire is a self-reported subjective outcome measurement tool that is used to measure the sufficiency of asthma symptom control and changes in asthma symptoms. It is 5 point scale with scores ranging from 0 to 5 for each item. The greater the score of Asthma Control questionnaire, the better the prognosis and outcome.</description>

    <description>Buteyko breathing technique was performed by asking the patient to take a small breath in and then out and hold his/her breath and count the time in seconds, as long as he or she can, until first signs of air hunger start to appear, followed by normal breathing once again. This procedure was repeated 15 times, three sets of 15 repetitions were given to the patient per day, 3 days per week and the treatment was continued for 4 weeks.</description>
