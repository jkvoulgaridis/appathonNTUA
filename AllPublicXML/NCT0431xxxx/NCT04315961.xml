  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This non-treatment study will examine how different dietary conditions may affect a person's
      response to commonly used drugs.

      Volunteers (aim is 36 completers) will participate in a double-blind study conducted over a
      period of about 10-12 weeks including sessions for screening, food and beverage diary review,
      and drug exposure sessions. During screening, participants will be asked questions about
      participants' general characteristics including demographic information, mood, and
      personality. Participants will also be examined to determine medical eligibility. Eligible
      participants will complete diary sessions (4 total), experimental sessions (12 total) and end
      of study sessions (2 sessions). At food diary sessions, participants will be asked to
      eliminate certain foods and beverages from participants' diet, record daily food and beverage
      consumption and attend the laboratory approximately two times to discuss participants' food
      diaries. At these sessions, participants will orally ingest capsules containing commonly
      prescribed medications, over-the-counter medications, and/or placebo and will receive study
      capsules in blister packs which participants will take three times daily throughout the
      study. During experimental sessions, food and beverage restrictions will remain in place,
      participants will continue thrice daily capsule administration and will also be exposed to
      experimental test sessions. Participants will report to the laboratory 2-3 times weekly in
      order to ingest study capsules, receive blister packs and fill out questionnaires. After
      leaving the laboratory, participants will be asked to fill out surveys remotely in order to
      describe the effects of that session's capsules on mood and preference. After completing the
      first six sessions, participants will receive a mid-study bonus and have a 1-week break from
      attending sessions, during which participants will continue to swallow capsules thrice daily.
      Participants will return to the lab and complete two food diary sessions. After this,
      participants will complete experimental test sessions 7-12, where participants will again
      swallow capsules and complete questionnaires. After completing experimental test sessions
      1-12, participants will complete a final experimental test session to facilitate the study
      assessment of subjective monetary value of drug conditions. Finally, participants will return
      to the laboratory to receive a bonus payment for study completion and to complete an
      end-of-study questionnaire.

    <intervention_model>Single Group Assignment</intervention_model>
    <intervention_model_description>This is a within-subjects design. Participants are not assigned to different groups/arms. This study involves administration of drug conditions in different dose sequence orders. All participants will receive the same drug conditions, but the order in which the participants receive the drug conditions will be different across participants. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of several different dose sequences. As part of instructions during the informed consent process, volunteers will be given a list of drugs volunteers may receive rather than informing volunteers only of the specific drugs being administered. More drugs are listed than will be administered to increase the degree to which volunteers are &quot;blind&quot; to the drugs being studied. Researchers will be blind to the drug conditions on any given session because a pharmacy member with no participant interaction will assign the randomized dose sequence and prepare the study drugs.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Please note: This is a double-blind study. The investigators indicated &quot;None (Open Label)&quot; above because this clinical trials website form does not allow masking in a single arm study. As part of instructions during the informed consent process, volunteers will be given a list of drugs volunteers may receive rather than informing volunteers only of the specific drugs being administered. More drugs are listed than will be administered to increase the degree to which volunteers are &quot;blind&quot; to the drugs being studied. Researchers will be blind to the drug conditions on any given session because a pharmacy member with no participant interaction will assign the randomized dose sequence and prepare the study drugs.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Peak participant subjective ratings of drug liking</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 hours after capsule ingestion during experimental test session</time_frame>
    <description>Primary outcome will be peak change in participant ratings of drug liking relative to pre-drug ratings within 4 hours post-administration during experimental test sessions. Participants rate drug liking on a scale from -4 (dislike very much) to 4 (like very much) where 0 = Neutral or No Effect. This is not a treatment study, and higher or lower ratings of drug liking do not represent better or worse outcomes.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Participant subjective ratings of drug value</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 hours after capsule ingestion during experimental test session</time_frame>
    <description>Secondary outcome will be subject rating of monetary drug value as assessed post-administration during experimental test sessions. Participants will rate the subjective value of the drug on a scale from -$30 (i.e., they would prefer to lose $30 rather than take the drug) to $30 (i.e., they would prefer to take today's drug instead of receiving $30). This is not a treatment study, and higher or lower ratings of drug value do not represent better or worse outcomes.</description>

Thus, comparisons of the drug conditions on mood and choice will be compared within-subjects (e.g., between drug and placebo) and not between arms.</description>
