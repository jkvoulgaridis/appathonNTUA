  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mycobacterium abscessus (MABS) is a group of rapid-growing, multi-drug resistant
      non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) causing infections in humans. MABS pulmonary disease
      (MABS-PD) can result in significant morbidity, increased healthcare utilisation, accelerated
      lung function decline, impaired quality of life, more challenging lung transplantation, and
      increased mortality. While the overall numbers affected is small, the prevalence of
      infections is increasing worldwide. The Finding the Optimal Regimen for Mycobacterium
      abscessus Treatment (FORMaT) trial aims to produce high quality evidence for the best
      treatment regimens to maximise health outcomes and minimise toxicity and treatment burden, as
      well as developing biomarkers (serology, gene expression signatures, and radiology) to guide
      decisions for starting treatment and measuring disease severity in patients with MABS PD
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mycobacterium abscessus (MABS) are a group of non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) found in
      water and soil habitats that exhibit high levels of intrinsic multi-drug resistance. They are
      recognised opportunistic human pathogens capable of causing chronic pulmonary disease
      (MABS-PD), predominantly in individuals with underlying inflammatory lung diseases

      Finding the Optimal Regimen for Mycobacterium abscessus Treatment (FORMaT) is a platform
      trial evaluating microbiological, functional, radiological and quality of life outcomes of
      currently used antibiotic therapies along with health care costs and cost effectiveness for
      treating MABS PD in all age groups in both Australia and Internationally.

      We aim to build an iterative, experimental clinical trial platform with adaptive properties.
      This will include two different cohorts recruited; an observation cohort and intervention
      cohort. Multiple treatment combinations will be evaluated in people with MABS-PD
      (intervention cohort) investigating different MABS subspecies, and strains with macrolide
      resistance. The platform will enable future novel treatments to efficiently enter the trial
      as they become available. The trial platform will include the current standard of care as a
      comparator arm; as evidence is accumulated new comparators may be incorporated. The trial
      platform will facilitate the evolution of optimal management for MABS lung disease with the
      primary outcome of microbial clearance with tolerance.

    <intervention_model_description>There are 2 different phases of treatment; intensive therapy (IT) followed by consolidation therapy (CT). Intervention cohort participants will be randomised to 1 of 3 treatment arms for 6 weeks of IT. After the first 6 weeks of IT participants who are culture positive for MABS are randomised to either prolonged IT (additional 6 weeks of IT) then CT, or to commence CT. If, at week 6 participants are MABS culture-negative they will commence CT. Participants commencing CT are randomised to one of two treatment arms for 50 weeks. There are 12 possible paths through the trial. This standing platform trial design enables assessment of short IT, prolonged IT, and CT components individually as well as the overall combination of IT and CT. After 100 patients have completed short IT an interim analysis will be conducted, and Bayesian adaptive randomisation (BAR) will be implemented. New interventions may be added or stopped in the future due to lack of benefit at interim analyses.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>None (Open Label)</masking>
    <masking_description>The FORMAT trial may include placebo controlled double blind randomised interventions in the future, but the initial intervention program is randomised but open label.
There will be three stages of randomisation in the intervention program of this study, dictating the treatment the participant will receive. Randomisation at each level will be conducted using the method of minimisation. Each randomisation level will be planned to enable flexibility via pre-planned adaptations.</masking_description>
