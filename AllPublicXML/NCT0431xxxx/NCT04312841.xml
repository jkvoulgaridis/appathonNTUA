    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well letermovir works for the prevention of cytomegalovirus
      reactivation in patients with hematological malignancies treated with alemtuzumab. Patients
      receiving treatment with alemtuzumab may experience cytomegalovirus reactivation. Letermovir
      may block cytomegalovirus replication and prevent infection.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To estimate the rate of cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation in patients treated with
      letermovir at 3 months after completion of alemtuzumab therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the tolerability of letermovir in combination with alemtuzumab.

      II. To evaluate the efficacy of letermovir for the prevention of clinically significant CMV
      disease.

      III. To estimate the progression free survival of patients in the study population.

      IV. To estimate the overall survival of patients in the study population.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate mechanisms of antiviral resistance in letermovir prophylaxis failures.

      OUTLINE:

      Beginning within 7 days of the first administration of standard alemtuzumab, patients receive
      letermovir orally (PO) (or intravenously [IV] over 1 hour if patient is unable to take PO for
      an extended period of time) daily on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days for up to 3
      months after the last dose of alemtuzumab in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.

               -  Note: Subjects who meet this exclusion criterion may, at the discretion of the
                  investigator, have one repeat testing done. If the repeat value does not meet
                  this criterion, they may continue in the screening process. Only the specific out

                  mL/min, as calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault equation

          -  Cytopenias are NOT an exclusion criteria in this trial as cytopenias are common in
             this patient population and letermovir has no known adverse effects on blood counts.
             Patients will be treated per institutional standard of care with as needed
             transfusions and growth factor support

                  every 2 weeks. Those with evidence of reactivation (detectable viral load) will
                  be treated with entecavir or lamivudine. Upon resolution of detectable viral
                  load, the patient will be allowed to continue on trial assuming adequate liver
                  function as defined above. Alternatively, patients may be put on prophylactic
                  entecavir or lamivudine to prevent hepatitis B reactivation at the investigator's
                  discretion

               -  Hepatitis C if no prior or current curative antiviral therapy. For those
                  currently on curative antiviral therapy, they will be allowed on trial if

             after the last dose of study therapy

          -  Currently participating or has participated in a study with an unapproved
             investigational compound or device within 28 days, or 5X half-life of the
             investigational compound (excluding monoclonal antibodies), whichever is longer, of
             initial dosing on this study. Subjects previously treated with a monoclonal antibody
             will be eligible to participate after a 28-day washout period

          -  Previous participation in a study using letermovir

          -  Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, lab abnormality, or other
             circumstance that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the
             subject's participation for the full duration of the study, or would be put at undue
             risk as judged by the investigator, such that it is not in the best interest of the
             subject to participate in this study
