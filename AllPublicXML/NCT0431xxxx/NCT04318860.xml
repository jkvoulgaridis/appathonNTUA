    <textblock>
      This study aimed to evaluate pain after elective colorectal surgery and to identify risk
      factors for postoperative pain.

      Patients:All elective colorectal surgeries at the department of surgery, Umeå university
      Hospital, Umeå, Sweden from March 2013 to April 2017

      Primary outcome:The primary outcome measurement is the numeric rating scale (NRS), graded
      from 0-10, on day of surgery, postoperative (POD) 1, 2, 3. The patients are questioned by
      nurses each morning on four postoperative days to score the maximum pain during the previous
      24 hours using the NRS.

      This study aimed to quantify pain after elective colorectal surgery and to identify risk
      factors for postoperative pain.

      Patients: This prospective cohort study includes all consecutive patients undergoing elective
      colorectal surgery at Umeå University Hospital in Sweden between March 2013 and April 2017.

      Exclusion criteria: Patients who do not score pain at any of 4 postoperative days.

      Primary outcome:The primary outcome measurement is the Numeric rating scale (NRS), graded
      from 0-10, where 0 = no pain and 10 = the worst imaginable pain [18]. Moderate pain is
      defined as NRS 4-6 and severe pain as NRS 7-10. The patients are questioned by nurses each
      morning after day of surgery, postoperative day. 1, postoperative day 2 and postoperative day
      3 to score the maximum pain during the previous 24 hours using the NRS.

      All data are registered in Enhanced recovery after surgery database (EISA)

      Clinical variables: Baseline clinical variables are assessed preoperatively. They included
      age, gender, body mass index (BMI), smoking, a diabetes mellitus diagnosis and American
      Society of Anesthesia (ASA) class. The postoperative course is registered prospectively in
      Enhanced recovery after surgery register (EIAS) and include preoperative oncological
      treatment, a histopathologically verified cancer diagnosis, the length of hospital stay and
      complications, including any complication, Clavien-Dindo 3b or more and anastomotic leakage
      within 30 days after surgery High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) is measured every
      postoperative morning.
