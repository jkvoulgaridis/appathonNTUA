    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well FDG-PET/CT works in assessing the response of patients
      with breast cancer that has spread to the bones or mostly to the bones (bone-dominant
      metastatic breast cancer). Diagnostic procedures, such as FDG-PET/CT, may work better in
      measuring breast cancer activity before and after treatment compared to other standard
      imaging tests.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Evaluate the performance of fludeoxyglucose F-18 (FDG)-positron emission tomography
      (PET)/computed tomography (CT) response criteria (modified PET Response Criteria in Solid
      Tumors [PERCIST] complete, partial and stable metabolic disease versus progressive metabolic
      disease) as a binary predictor of progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with
      bone-dominant (BD) metastatic breast cancer (MBC) treated with systemic therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the ability of FDG-PET/CT modified PERCIST criteria (complete versus [vs] partial
      vs stable vs metabolic progression) to independently predict PFS in patients with BD MBC.

      II. Evaluate the ability of FDG-PET/CT modified PERCIST criteria (complete, partial, and
      stable versus progressive metabolic disease) to predict time to skeletal related events (SRE)
      and overall survival (OS) in patients with BD MBC.

      III. Evaluate the ability of FDG-PET/CT metrics (percent change in peak standardized uptake
      value corrected for lean body mass (SULpeak), maximum standardized uptake value corrected for
      body weight (SUVmax) as continuous variables in index or up to 5 lesions) to predict PFS,
      time to SRE and OS in patients with BD MBC.

      IV. Assess the utility of FDG-PET/CT to identify disease progression by identification of new
      lesions not identified by standard CT and bone scan.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Define criteria for selection of FDG-avid bone lesions for analysis based on thresholds
      for SULpeak or SUVmax.

      II. In collaboration with National Cancer Institute (NCI) Quantitative Imaging Network (QIN),
      explore alternative methods for measuring metabolic response with FDG-PET/CT (e.g., total
      lesion glycolysis, quantitative total bone imaging, MD Anderson bone criteria, and radiomics)
      to predict clinical endpoints in patients with BD MBC.

      III. Evaluate automated image analysis of FDG-PET/CT by AutoPERCIST.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive FDG intravenously (IV) and undergo PET/CT scan over 15-30 minutes at
      baseline (within 21 days before start of standard systemic treatment) and at 12 weeks after
      start of standard systemic treatment in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up periodically for up to 3 years after
      study registration.

               -  BD defined as disease involving bone with or without limited measurable
                  metastases by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1, with &gt;=
                  1 non-irradiated bone metastasis on bone scintigraphy

                    -  NOTE: Limited measurable metastases includes lymph nodes and the soft tissue
                       components of lytic or mixed lytic/blastic bone metastases. Any number of
                       lymph nodes &lt; 3 cm and up to 2 lymph nodes &gt; 3 cm will be allowed. Up to 5

                  scintigraphy

          -  Patients must have no contraindication to FDG-PET imaging

          -  Patients must have one of the following systemic therapies:

               -  Plan to receive either 1st or 2nd line endocrine therapy for metastatic breast
                  cancer. Endocrine therapy may include selective estrogen receptor modulators
                  (SERMs), aromatase inhibitors, and/or fulvestrant that may be combined with Food
                  and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved biologic agents (palbociclib, ribociclib,
                  abemaciclib, everolimus, alpelisib)

               -  Chemotherapy per National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) or institutional
                  standard. Use of colony stimulating growth factor must be suspended for &gt;= 14
                  days prior to FDG-PET/CT scans at baseline and 12-weeks

               -  Plan to receive HER2-targeted therapy per ASCO, NCCN, and/or institutional
                  guidelines as indicated for patients with HER2 positive disease. When
                  HER2-targeted therapy is used with chemotherapy, use of colony stimulating growth
                  factors is NOT expected or should be suspended for a minimum of 2 weeks, but
                  preferably for at least 3 weeks prior to the required FDG-PET/CT scan time points

          -  The use of bone-stabilizing agents (bisphosphonates or denosumab) is permitted

          -  Patient must meet institutional guidelines for renal function for MRI and CT scanning

          -  Patient's life expectancy must be estimated at &gt;= 24 weeks

          -  The patient is participating in the trial at an institution which has agreed to
             perform the imaging research studies, completed the ECOG-American College of Radiology
             Imaging Network (ACRIN) defined PET/CT scanner qualification procedures and received
             ECOG-ACRIN PET/CT scanner approval

          -  Patients must complete the baseline (T0) FDG-PET within 28 days prior to registration
             or within 28 days after registration

               -  For patients completing the baseline (T0) FDG-PET AFTER registration all
                  parameters must be met

               -  For patients who completed the baseline (T0) FDG-PET prior to registration the
                  following tests are exempt:

                    -  Pregnancy testing documentation prior to FDG-PET (T0 time point)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with RECIST 1.1 measurable lesions in viscera, active central nervous system
             (CNS), leptomeningeal carcinomatous or pleural or peritoneal disease will not be
             eligible. Patients with prior CNS metastases treated with radiation or resection and
             without evidence of clinical or radiographic progression within 28 days of
             registration are eligible

          -  Patients who have received greater than 3 lines of cytotoxic chemotherapy for
             metastatic breast cancer are not eligible

          -  Patients currently participating in or have participated in a study of an
             investigational agent or using an investigational device within 3 weeks of study
             registration are not eligible

          -  Patients with known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active
             treatment are not eligible. Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin,
             squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or in situ cervical cancer that has undergone
             potentially curative therapy

          -  Women must not be pregnant because FDG is a radiopharmaceutical with the potential for
             teratogenic effects and PET/CT involves additional radiation exposure. In addition,
             because of radiation exposure to a nursing infant from FDG, women who are
             breastfeeding are also excluded from this study. All females of childbearing potential
             must have a blood test or urine study within 7 days prior to FDG-PET/CT to rule out
             pregnancy. Patients are excluded from this if baseline FDG-PET/CT scan met study
             parameters and was completed within 28 days of study registration
