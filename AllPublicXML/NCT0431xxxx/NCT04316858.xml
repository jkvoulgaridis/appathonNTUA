  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective randomized trial will be conducted in all patients undergoing elective
      colonoscopies from February 2020 to August 2020 in Dowites Operation Theater Endoscopy suite
      by surgical unit III, Civil Hospital Karachi. Patient will be select randomly based on
      inclusion criteria. Patients will be advised to take 90ml of sodium phosphate in 800ml
      solvent ( zero calorie soft drink and water). Patients will be nil per oral from midnight
      aside from clear liquids. Serum electrolytes, urea, creatinine will be measured after and
      before bowel preparation. Bowel preparation will be assessed by consultant during endoscopy.
      Questionnaire will be filled by PI for palatability, tolerance of solution, adverse effects,
      and willingness to repeat the preparation.

      Questionnaire will be filled by PI for palatability, tolerance of solution, adverse effects,

      90ml of sodium phosphate will be added to 800ml of solvent and taken in divided doses one day
      prior to procedure. Whole solution will be finished 3 -4 hours before colonoscopy. The
      instructions about how to take the solution will be clearly explained at the time of booking.
      Complete Blood Count and hepatitis B and C screening as routine shall be done. All procedure
      will be carried out under monitored sedation by trained colorectal surgeon from the faculty
