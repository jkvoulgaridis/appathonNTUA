    <textblock>
      The purpose of this single center, randomized, control, open-labeled study is to evaluate the
      effect and safety of RCA versus no anticoagulation for CRRT in hyperlactatemia patients with
      increased bleeding risk.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) patients with shock and muscle hypoperfusion,
      which characterised by tissue hypoxia and hyperlactatemia, the Kidney Disease Improving
      Global Outcomes (KIDIGO) guideline recommended no use of regional citrate anticoagulation
      (RCA) considering the potential increased citrate accumulation (CA) risk. In the condition of
      increased bleeding, no-anticoagulation was recommended for these patients. However, CRRT
      processed without anticoagulation was proved to be associated with shorter filter lifespan.
      Therefore, the purpose of this single center, randomized, control, open-labeled study is to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of RCA versus no-anticoagulation for CRRT in hyperlactatemia
      patients with increased bleeding risk.
