  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the adhesion performance of ZTlido (lidocaine
      topical system) 1.8% in normal, healthy volunteers.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this open-label, single-treatment, single-period, single-application adhesion performance
      study, 54 healthy, adult male and female subjects are treated with one lidocaine topical
      system to their back for 12 hours. Adhesion will be monitored throughout the wear time and
      skin irritation will be assessed after the topical system is removed.

    <measure>Mean Cumulative Adhesion Score</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 3, 6, 9, 12 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Adhesion of the topical system to the skin is assessed by FDA 0-4 scoring system. The scoring for adhesion of topical systems is indicated as follows: 0 = ≥ 90% Adhered (essentially no lift off the skin), 1 = ≥ 75% to &lt; 90% Adhered (some edges only lifting off the skin), 2 = ≥ 50% to &lt; 75% Adhered (less than half of the patch lifting off the skin), &gt; 0% to &lt; 50% Adhered but not detached (more than half of the patch lifting off the skin without falling off), and 4 = 0% adhered (patched completely detached). The mean cumulative adhesion score is calculated as the sum of scores at each assessment time point divided by the total number of observations.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dermal Response Score</measure>
    <time_frame>12.5 and 14 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Product tolerability is assessed by Dermal Response Score. The application site is evaluated 30 minutes and 2 hours after product removal (12.5 and 14 hours post-dose, respectively). Response score from 0 to 7; 0= No evidence of irritation, 1= Minimal erythema, barely perceptible, 2= Definite erythema, readily visible; minimal edema or minimal papular response, 3= Erythema and papules, 4= Definite edema, 5= Erythema, edema and papules, 6= Vesicular eruption, 7= Strong reaction spreading beyond test (i.e., application) site.</description>
