    <textblock>
      Background:

      Proteus syndrome is a rare overgrowth disorder. Most people begin to have symptoms between 6
      months and 2 years of age. There are very few living adults with this disease. There is also
      no known treatment for it. Researchers want to see if a new drug can slow down or stop
      overgrowth in people with Proteus syndrome.

      Objective:

      The learn if miransertib is a safe and effective treatment for Proteus syndrome.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 3 25 years with Proteus syndrome

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with a medical checkup. They will answer questions about their
      medical history and current health. They will have a physical exam with vital signs. They
      will have an electrocardiogram to measure their heartbeat. They will give blood and urine
      samples. They will repeat the screening tests during the study.

      Participants will take a miransertib pill once a day. They will bring their empty pill
      bottles with them to the NIH when they visit. If they can t swallow a pill, researchers will
      try to find other ways for them to take the drug.

      Participants will have X-rays, ultrasounds, and imaging scans. Photos may be taken of their
      feet and other parts of the body that have or develop signs of Proteus syndrome.

      Participants will have lung function tests to measure how much and how fast air moves out of
      their lungs.

      Participants will complete surveys about their levels of pain, physical functioning, and
      quality of life.

      Participants may have additional tests performed to assess their individual disease. They may
      have consultations with other specialists.

      Participation lasts about 4 years. Participants will have 20 30 visits at the NIH.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Proteus syndrome is a rare mosaic overgrowth disorder caused by a somatic gain of function
      variant, c. 49G&gt;A, p.(Glu17Lys) in the oncogene AKT1, encoding the AKT1 kinase. The disorder
      is progressive, with high morbidity and mortality - there are very few living adults with
      this disease. Tissues and cell lines from patients with Proteus syndrome harbor admixtures of
      mutant alleles that ranged from &lt;1% - 50%. This variant causes constitutive activation of
      AKT1, through Ser473 and Thr308 phosphorylation. This activation stimulates the AKT/PI3K
      pathway, mediating processes including increased cell proliferation and decreased apoptosis.
      The progressive nature of the disorder and the mechanism of disease (gain of function) make
      AKT1 an excellent target for therapeutics, specifically repression. The AKT/PI3K pathway is
      mutated in numerous cancers as well. Because it is commonly mutated in cancer, pharmaceutical
      companies are interested in targeting this molecule with inhibitors.

      ArQule Inc. has developed a small molecule, ARQ 092 [miransertib], that inhibits AKT, with an
      IC50 for AKT1, AKT2, and AKT3 that is orders of magnitude lower than other kinases. This
      agent has undergone significant development with animal toxicity studies and is currently in
      phase I trials in adult participants with different types of cancer. In addition, we have
      performed in vitrotesting with miransertib in cells from patients with Proteus syndrome and
      demonstrated reduction in AKT1 phosphorylation at doses in the range of achievable blood
      levels in humans with low toxicity. We have completed a phase 0/I study of miransertib in
      adults and older children with Proteus syndrome (NIH protocol 16-HG-0014). In this study, we
      demonstrated that 5 mg/m m^2/day was a well-tolerated dose which resulted in tissue drug
      levels consistent with our pre-clinical data-based pharmacodynamic target. As well, one of
      the participants from the phase I study felt so strongly about the benefits of the drug, both
      from a pain relief standpoint plus evidence of improvement in one of his skin lesions, that
      he and his family have requested continuation of the drug in that trial, as was offered to
      participants who felt that they had received significant benefit. This initial Cohort of
      participants was dosed at levels well below those tested previously in the oncology setting.
      In summary, with our phase 0/1trial, we gained invaluable experience with a number of
      therapeutic endpoints and showed some evidence of efficacy in two of six participants.

      We now propose a phase II non-randomized observation study assessing the efficacy of
      miransertib through assessment of the hallmark skin lesion of Proteus syndrome, the
      cerebriform connective tissue nevus (CCTN). The primary objective of this study is to
      determine the response rate of miransertib as measured by a change in CCTN lesion size
      relative to total plantar area from baseline, using blinded independent centralr eview of
      lesional photography in at least 10patients with Proteus syndrome (Cohort 1). Cohorts 2 and 3
      will enroll up to 30 additional patients whose non-plantar CCTN Proteus syndrome- associated
      lesions will be evaluated to address the secondary and exploratory study objectives. All
      participants will be treated with miransertib in continuous, 28-day cycles. Participants in
      Cohorts 1 and 2willreceivemiransertib at the starting dose of 15 mg/ m^2QD for the first
      three cycles, and then the dose will be increased to 25mg/m^2QD, provided no clinically
      significant drug-related toxicity is observed. Participants in Cohort 3 will receive
      miransertib at the dose they were on at the time of enrollment if continuing use of
      miransertib or at the starting dose for Cohorts 1 and 2 if resuming use of miransertib, not
      to exceed 25 mg/m m^2QD. Safety and toxicity data will be gathered on all participants.
      Participants will stay on treatment for up to 52 cycles. The final clinical safety follow-up
      will be performed 30 days after the last dose.
