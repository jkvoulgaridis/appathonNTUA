  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this prospective study of 60patients, we tested the hypothesis That markedly elevated
      levels of plasma von Willebrand factor (VWF) a marker of endothelial cell injury might
      predict the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (A.R.D.S) in risky patients.
      We compared our result to IL.6 as control biomarker for A.R.D.S development.

      Acute lung injury was quantified on two -point scoring system (Berlin definition of ARDS and
      Murray score of acute lung injury).

      Plasma levels of both vWF and IL.6 were be measured on T=0 i.e. (at start of the study once
      the patient considered to be risky for A.R.D.S development to obtain their baseline levels),
      T=48 (after 48 hours), and T=72 (after 72 hours).
