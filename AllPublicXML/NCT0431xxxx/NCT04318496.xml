    <textblock>
      Introduction:

      Chest blunt trauma accounts in up to 65% of polytrauma patients. In patients with 0-2 rib
      fracture, the treatment is relatively limited to oral pain killer and breathing exercise. The
      patients will suffer two weeks of severe pain accompanied with poor sleep and inability to
      preform simple daily live activities. In this double blind randomized control study, the
      investigators offer acupuncture as an additional treatment option.

      Methods:

      The study is a double blind randomized control trial. the study will include the press needle
      acupuncture (Acu) and placebo (Con) group. Both groups will receive one treatment, following
      the first visit to the clinic after chest trauma accident.

      Introduction:

      Chest blunt trauma accounts in up to 65% of polytrauma patients. In patients with 0-2 rib
      fracture, the treatment is relatively limited to oral pain killer and breathing exercise. The
      patients will suffer two weeks of severe pain accompanied with poor sleep and inability to
      preform simple daily live activities. In this double blind randomized control study, the
      investigators offer acupuncture as an additional treatment option.

      Methods:

      The study is a double blind randomized control trial. the study goal is to examine the effect
      of acupuncture on patients with chest trauma. the study will include totally 72 patients and
      divide them to two group; the press needle acupuncture (Acu) and placebo (Con) group. Both
      groups will receive one treatment, following the first visit to the clinic after chest trauma
      accident. Follow up time will be 3 months.

      Expected outcome:

      The results of this study can potentially provide a simple and cost effective provide
      analgesic solution to blunt chest trauma patients. The study design can serve as supporting
      evidence for future double blind studies in acupuncture.

      Other information:

      The study will be conducted in thoracic surgical department and acupuncture department in
      China medical university hospital, Taichung, Taiwan. The study is conducted on blunt chest
      injury patients and is anticipated to have minimum risk for adverse events. Enrollment of the
      patients and data collection will start after March 2020. The study expected completion time
      will be March 2022.

    <masking_description>Study nurse 1 will be responsible to randomize and prepare the needles in the envelopes. Outside the envelopes, there will be a number belonged to one patient, and inside the envelopes, there will 14 separate sterile needle which can be either placebo or true press tack needles. The envelopes and the pouches of needle will look the same. The acupuncturist will be asked not to check the needles when they insert them. At the time of acupuncture, a nurse will accompany the acupuncturist and will verify that he is not examining the needles closely. Study nurse 2 will do the measurement. The acupuncturist, patients and study nurse 2 will be blinded.</masking_description>
