    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well dabrafenib, trametinib, and spartalizumab works in
      treating patients with BRAF V600E or V600K mutation positive stage IIIB/C/D melanoma, who do
      not achieve a pathologic complete response after 8 weeks of dabrafenib and trametinib
      treatment. Patients who achieve a pathologic complete response after 8 weeks of neoadjuvant
      dabrafenib and trametinib will receive adjuvant dabrafenib and trametinib. Dabrafenib and
      trametinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell
      growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as spartalizumab, may help the body's
      immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow
      and spread. Giving dabrafenib, trametinib, and spartalizumab may help to control melanoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the 12-month relapse free survival (RFS) rate in stage IIIB/C/D melanoma
      patients who, after 8 weeks of neoadjuvant dabrafenib and trametinib, do not achieve a
      pathologic complete response (pCR) and receive adjuvant dabrafenib, trametinib and
      spartalizumab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety of neoadjuvant dabrafenib and trametinib and adjuvant dabrafenib,
      trametinib and spartalizumab.

      II. To determine the 12-month relapse free survival (RFS) rate in stage IIIB/C/D.

      III. Melanoma patients who, after 8 weeks of neoadjuvant dabrafenib and trametinib, achieve a
      pCR and receive adjuvant dabrafenib and trametinib.

      IV. To assess the recurrence patterns, distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), and overall
      survival (OS) in all patients treated on protocol.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess immunological and molecular features of treatment response and resistance.

      II. To assess circulating markers and correlate them with treatment response and relapse and
      toxicity III. To assess the impact of neoadjuvant therapy on surgical resectability.

      OUTLINE:

      NEOADJUVANT TREATMENT: Patients receive dabrafenib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) and
      trametinib PO once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 2 cycles in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      SURGERY: Patients undergo surgical resection of melanoma.

      ADJUVANT TREATMENT OF pCR PATIENTS: Patients receive dabrafenib PO BID and trametinib PO QD
      on days 1-28. Cycles repeats every 28 days for 44 weeks in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      ADJUVANT TREATMENT OF NON pCR PATIENTS: Patients receive spartalizumab intravenously (IV)
      over 30 minutes on day 1, dabrafenib PO BID and trametinib PO QD on days 1-28. Cycles repeats
      every 28 days for 44 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-4 months for 2 years.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form

          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed clinically detected, node
             involved Stage IIIB/C/D melanoma by American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) version
             8 and surgically resectable disease. The definition of resectability can be determined
             by the patient's surgical oncologist and verified via discussion at multidisciplinary
             tumor conference attended by melanoma medical and surgical oncology staff. Resectable
             tumors are defined as having no significant vascular, neural or bony involvement that
             would preclude complete resection or necessitate the use of adjuvant radiation. Only
             cases where a complete surgical resection with tumor- free margins can safely be
             achieved are defined as resectable

          -  BRAF mutation-positive melanoma (V600E or V600K) based on report from a Clinical
             Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA) certified laboratory

          -  Patients must have measurable disease, defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in
             Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1

          -  Patients who have been previously treated in the adjuvant setting with ipilimumab or
             interferon alpha or investigational vaccines for melanoma will be eligible for
             treatment after a 28 day wash-out period

          -  Patients who have previously received anti PD-1 in the adjuvant setting will be
             allowed if it has been six months or longer since previous drug exposure

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1

          -  Women of childbearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of
             becoming pregnant will be required to use highly effective methods of contraception
             during dosing and for 150-days after stopping treatment with spartalizumab. Highly
             effective contraception methods include:

               -  Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of
                  the subject). Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
                  contraception.

               -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without
                  hysterectomy), total hysterectomy, or tubal ligation at least six weeks before
                  taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive
                  status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment.

               -  Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). The vasectomized male
                  partner should be the sole partner for that subject

               -  Placement of a non-hormonal intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system
                  (IUS) with a documented failure rate of less than 1% per year

               -  Notes:

                    -  Double-barrier contraception: condom and occlusive cap (diaphragm or
                       cervical/vault caps) with a vaginal spermicidal agent
                       (foam/gel/cream/suppository) are not considered highly effective methods of
                       contraception.

                    -  Hormonal-based methods (e.g., oral contraceptives) are not considered as
                       highly effective methods of contraception due to potential drug-drug
                       interactions with dabrafenib.

          -  Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have
             had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile
             (i.e. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral
             oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy), total hysterectomy, or tubal ligation at
             least six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive
             status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she
             considered not of childbearing potential

          -  Sexually active males must use a condom during intercourse while on treatment and for
             150 days after stopping treatment with spartalizumab and should not father a child in
             this period. A condom is required to be used by vasectomized men as well during
             intercourse in order to prevent delivery of the drug via semen

             x institutional ULN
