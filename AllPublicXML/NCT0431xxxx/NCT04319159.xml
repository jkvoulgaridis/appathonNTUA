    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of the parent drug
      5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and its active metabolite protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) during
      photodynamic therapy with 3 tubes of BF-200 ALA 10% gel (Ameluz®) in combination with the
      BF-RhodoLED® lamp in the systemic circulation of diseased individuals presenting with actinic
      keratosis (AK) on the face/scalp or in the periphery (neck/trunk/extremities) along with
      subjects' safety/tolerability during and after treatment.

             (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (gamma- GT).

         14. Impaired renal function (Glomerular filtration rate below 50 mL/min/1.73m² estimated

         20. A member of study site staff or sponsor staff directly involved in the conduct of the
             protocol or a close relative thereof.

         21. Simultaneous participation in a further clinical study.

        Reassessment of subjects is allowed once if sunburn, wounds, irritations, bleeding or skin
        infections detected at Visit 1 are expected to resolve within the screening period.

        Reassessment can be done on the day of the actual treatment.

        Dosing day exclusion criteria:

          1. Febrile or infectious illness within 7 days prior to Visit 2.

          2. Subjects with sunburn, wounds, irritations, bleeding or other confounding skin

             NSAIDs within 7 days prior to Visit 2.

        rescheduled once within 14 days. Meeting any of the dosing day exclusion criteria on the
        rescheduled visit will lead to discontinuation of the trial.
