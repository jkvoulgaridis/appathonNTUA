      The aim of this study is to investigate whether ingestion of curcumin will prevent hepatic
      insulin resistance (assessed by homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR))
      induced by short-term oral glucocorticoid (prednisolone) administration in overweight and
      obese participants. As a secondary endpoint it will be investigated if prednisolone
      administration induce or worsen the degree of NAFLD in overweight or obese participants using
      magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy (MRS), and if curcumin can ameliorate this effect. Also,
      the possible anti-inflammatory effect of curcumin will be elucidated as a range of
      inflammatory markers before and after intervention will be measured. Thus, prednisolone
      treatment is used as a model of development of pre-diabetes.

      AIMS OF STUDY The aim of this study is to investigate whether ingestion of curcumin will
      prevent hepatic insulin resistance (assessed by homeostatic model assessment of insulin
      resistance (HOMA-IR)) induced by short-term oral glucocorticoid (prednisolone) administration
      in overweight and obese participants.

      BACKGROUND The increasing incidence and prevalence of obesity and its comorbidities calls for
      research in preventing these diseases. The progression to insulin resistance and increased
      blood sugar levels (i.e. prediabetes) and ultimately type 2 diabetes (T2D) in obesity is
      believed to be caused by various factors of which low-grade inflammation in adipose tissue
      and skeletal muscle tissue seems to inflict insulin resistance initiating metabolic
      deterioration towards the type 2 diabetic phenotype. Curcumin, a polyphenolic compound that
      can be extracted from the turmeric root, have been shown to exert anti-inflammatory
      properties in both in vitro and animal studies. Furthermore, animal studies indicate that
      curcumin is a modulator of gut microbiota composition in a metabolic beneficial direction.
      Studies have shown positive results in terms of lowering hepatic insulin resistance with
      curcumin in rodents and humans (measured by HOMA-IR), and another clinical trial has shown
      that curcumin can prevent worsening of HOMA-IR and development of T2D in a prediabetic
      population.

      Glucocorticoids is a group of frequently used compounds, prescribed for a wide range of
      diseases. Glucocorticoids have severe metabolic side effects and can cause insulin
      resistance, T2D and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Interestingly, curcumin, a phenolic
      compound extracted from the turmeric root, and curcumin analogues have been shown to
      ameliorate glucocorticoid-induced 'dysmetabolism' in rodent studies, but no human data exist.
      Also, results from both in vitro and in vivo (animal) studies with curcumin have shown
      promising effects in preventing NAFLD development, but solid human data are missing. Because
      of the temporary effects on glucose metabolism, short-term treatment with glucocorticoids can
      be used as an investigative model of these metabolic changes. Previous studies from the
      research unit performing the current study, used this setup to investigate changes in glucose
      homeostasis, incretin hormones and insulin resistance. Two different mouse studies indicate
      that curcumin could be beneficial in terms of preventing the metabolic changes associated
      with systemic glucocorticoid treatment, but no human studies have investigated if curcumin
      can prevent glucocorticoid-induced increase in HOMA-IR.

      The aim of the study is to investigate the effects of curcumin of the metabolic changes
      caused by short-term systemic prednisolone in a double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial in
      overweight and obese individuals.

      STUDY DESIGN

      Endpoints: See elsewhere

      Participants 36 overweight and obese individuals without diabetes using inclusion and
      exclusion criteria.

      METHODS

      Overview In this randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial, eligible participants
      will undergo baseline assessments before being randomised to one of the following
      interventions: 1) Two tablets of curcumin (each tablet containing 100 mg curcumin) twice
      daily in 11 days and 50 mg of prednisolone once daily in 10 days (capsule); 2) two tablets of
      placebo-curcumin twice daily in 11 days and 50 mg of prednisolone once daily in 10 days
      (capsule); 3) two tablets of placebo-curcumin twice daily in 11 days and one capsule of
      placebo-prednisolone once daily in 10 days. In the end of the 11-day intervention period,
      end-of-intervention assessments (similar to baseline assessments) will be performed. If
      necessary, a follow-up visit will be made. An overview of the trial is presented in Fig. 1
      and details of visits, procedures and assessments are outlined below.

      Information meeting and screening Prior to any protocol-related procedures, an information
      meeting at Center for Clinical Metabolic Research at Gentofte Hospital will be arranged, and
      participants will be informed of the possibility of bringing a person of own choice to the
      visit. The information meeting is performed in undisturbed and confidential surroundings. The
      room is reserved for this purpose, and nobody will interfere during the meeting. It is not
      possible for other employees in the department to look into the room. During this meeting, a
      member of the research group will explain the purpose, procedures and possible risks of the
      study. The member of the research group will have proper qualifications in terms of medical
      knowledge, insights in the specific project and communications skills. It is firstly pointed
      out that the project is a biomedical trial. After this, an oral information about the project
      is given based on the written information. Questions will be answered as thoroughly as
      possible. The participant will be informed that it is possible to have a minimum of 48 hours
      to evaluate participation from oral information is given. If he does not want time to
      evaluate the participation, the informed consent can be obtained. If he wants time to
      evaluate participation, a new meeting will be arranged with a minimum of 48 hours from the
      information meeting. When the informed consent has been obtained, screening can be done,
      either the same day or another day, but with a maximum of four weeks after obtaining the
      informed consent. The participant will be informed that it is possible to withdraw the
      written consent at any time prior to or during the study. In the case that significant
      information about the participants health is found during the trial, the participant will be
      able to decline having this information. Information about this choice is confirmed in the
      informed consent form.

      If the participant wants to know about the results of the trial and the possible consequences
      for the participant, he will have the rights to get this information after the end of the
      study At screening, height and body weight will be measured, medication and medical history
      will be recorded, blood will be sampled for assessment of plasma/serum concentrations of
      thyroid-stimulating hormone, creatinine, creatine kinase, electrolytes, aspartate
      aminotransferase (ASAT), alanine aminotransferase (ALAT), lactate dehydrogenase, alkaline
      phosphatase, albumin, bilirubin, gamma-glutamyltransferase, viral hepatitis markers, platelet
      count, ferritin and haemoglobin, and albumin-creatinine ratio in the urine will be measured.
      A physical examination will be made including evaluation of blood pressure and pulse rate.
      Alcohol habits will be evaluated based on The Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test
      (AUDIT) questionnaire and quantification of the weekly amount of alcohol. An MR safety
      checklist will be completed, and an MR information sheet will be given. If all inclusion
      criteria and none of the exclusion criteria are met, dates for baseline assessments and
      randomisation visit will be planned within 6 weeks from the screening visit. The participant
      will be instructed not to consume curcumin-containing food on a daily basis from screening
      until end of trial.

      Baseline assessments and randomisation visit Included individuals will undergo an MRS of the
      liver, which will be scheduled as close as possible to the randomisation visit. Before
      intervention start, both randomisation visit and MRS will be performed. Participants will
      meet at the Department of Radiology at Herlev Hospital and be placed in a horizontal position
      during the scan (duration: approximately 30 minutes). During the MRS, a spectroscopy of the
      liver will be assessed, and an estimation of visceral adipose tissue and subcutaneous adipose
      tissue will be done.

      During the last week before randomisation, the subject will be asked to collect a stool
      sample for the determination of gut bacteria count and subtype. The participant will receive
      sample kits consisting of cooler bag, freezer packs and stool sample tubes. Stool samples
      will be collected by the participant at home. Prior to defaecation a disposable collector
      will be placed in the toilet from where stool will be transferred to a tube that immediately
      is transferred to a transport container and placed at -20°C in the patient's freezer. Prior
      to transport to Gentofte Hospital, the transport container is transferred to the cooler bag
      and at arrival at Gentofte Hospital the transport container (with the sample tube) is
      immediately stored in at -80°C for later analysis. This entails DNA extraction, library
      preperation, MiSeq 16S rRNA sequencing and microbiota analysis (relative abundance,
      alpha/beta diversity, link to phenotype of interest).

      On the randomisation visit, the participant will meet in the laboratory around 8 a.m. after
      10 hours of fast (including any medication) and refrainment from tobacco or nicotine
      supplements use. The participant is allowed to drink water until 8 hours before meeting in
      department. Furthermore, the participant will be requested to avoid heavy alcohol intake
      (more than 5 units of alcohol per day) and strenuous exercise two days prior to the visit and
      instructed to use non-strenuous methods of transportation to the research facility. The
      following procedures will be conducted:

        1. A fasting urine sample will be collected, and the participant is kindly asked to empty
           the urinary bladder completely

        2. Fasting blood samples will be collected (bone markers, serum markers of muscle
           breakdown, biomarkers of NASH and fibrosis, fibroblast growths factors, triglycerides,
           cholesterols, liver parameters, HbA1c, inflammatory markers, adipokines, creatinine,
           haemoglobin) amounting 25 ml.

        3. FibroScan: The participant will be lying in a supine position for approximately 10
           minutes during which a probe using shear-waves and ultrasound is applied in the right
           side of the body below the ribs.

        4. Measurement of blood pressure, heart rate, body weight and hip and waist circumference.

        5. A questionnaire is handed out regarding calorie intake and physical activity the day
           prior to randomisation

        6. IOP is measured with icare ic100 tonometer.

        7. One cannula will be inserted in the cubital vein for collection of blood samples. The
           forearm from which blood samples are drawn will be wrapped in a heating blanket (42°C)
           throughout the experiment (for arterialisation of venous blood).

        8. Blood samples (for analysis of total amino acids, gut hormones, glucose, glucagon,
           insulin, C-peptide, urea, FFA) will be measured throughout the OGTT (see Table 1).

        9. At time 0 min, the participant will ingest 75 g of water-free glucose dissolved in 300
           ml water over a period of 5 minutes.

       10. At time 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, 240 and after the ad libitum meal, hunger,
           satiety, fullness and prospective food consumption will be measured by VASs (see
           enclosure 4 &quot;VAS&quot;).

       11. During the last hour (time 180 min - 240 min), REE will be measured in a supine position
           by indirect calorimetry to determine oxygen consumption (V02) and carbon dioxide
           production (VC02). A flow-through canopy gas analyser will be used, as previously
           described.

       12. At time 240 min, the subject will be asked to provide a new urine sample for measurement
           of urea concentration. The participant will be asked to empty the urinary bladder
           completely. Urine volume will be measured.

       13. At time ~250 min, the participant will ingest a standardised ad libitum meal consisting
           of minced meat, pasta, corn, carrots, peppers, cream, salt and pepper (50 energy (E)%
           carbohydrate, 37 E% fat, 13 E% protein). The participant will be instructed to eat as
           much as possible until feeling comfortable saturate. The meal should be consumed within
           a maximum of 30 minutes and by the end of the meal, time spent eating, weight of the
           meal and the total amount of energy consumed will be noted.

       14. A continuous glucose monitor will be applied on the upper arm of the participant. The
           sensor is blinded which means that the participant cannot see his blood glucose
           excursions during the 14 days period of measurements.

      At the end of the randomisation visit, the participant will be randomly assigned to one of
      three interventions (1:1:1):

        1. Two tablets of curcumin (corresponding to 200 mg) twice daily from day 1 to day 11 and
           prednisolone capsule 50 mg (oral) once daily from day 2 to day 11

        2. Two tablets of placebo-curcumin twice daily from day 1 to day 11 and prednisolone
           capsule 50 mg once daily from day 2 to day 11, or

        3. Two tablets of placebo-curcumin twice daily from day 1 to day 11 and
           placebo-prednisolone capsule once daily from day 2 to day 11 The tablets with curcumin
           and placebo-curcumin will appear identical, and the capsules with prednisolone or
           placebo-prednisolone will appear identical.

      The supplier of curcumin will also produce placebo-curcumin tablets (Indena Aps, Milan,
      Italy). The pharmacy of Region H will be responsible of production and delivery of
      prednisolone and placebo-prednisolon. Unblinded site-staff will be responsible for labelling
      and blinding of the curcumin and placebo-curcumin tablets and prednisolone and
      placebo-prednisolone capsules before the beginning of the intervention period. A person not
      otherwise involved in the study will generate a randomisation code using a random list
      generator. A randomisation list with randomisation numbers and corresponding treatment will
      be made by the unblinded site-staff. A list with randomisation number and corresponding
      packages with numbers will be made by unblinded site-staff, so that blinded site staff is
      only allocating a randomisation number at the day of randomisation. The list with the
      information about randomisation number and corresponding treatment will be kept at Center for
      Clinical Metabolic Research at Gentofte Hospital. If a participant develops adverse events
      (AEs) that demand knowledge of the content of the intervention, the list will show if the
      patient is having any active ingredients. If a participant is excluded of the trial before
      end-of-intervention visit, a new subject will be included in the same treatment-arm by taking
      over the randomisation number.

      The interventional period The intervention will start soon after the baseline MRS and
      randomisation visit. During the entire intervention period, each participant will fill out a
      dairy to keep track of any new concomitant medication, compliance and possible AEs. The
      participant will be asked to keep the alcohol and smoking habits they might have had before
      screening and, thus, not to consume more than 21 units of alcohol per week. Furthermore, they
      will be asked to consume no more than 5 units in one night. The participant will be requested
      to maintain the level of physical activity from before intervention during the interventional
      period. The participant will be informed that if he feels more hungry than usual, he is
      allowed to eat extra. At day 5, 6 or 7 in the intervention period, the participant will
      receive a telephone call from the investigator or other delegated site staff, checking on
      AEs, concomitant medication and compliance, and to answer any questions from the participant.
      Furthermore, participants are instructed to contact investigator or other delegated site
      staff in case of any questions or intolerable side effects.

      The tablets and capsules are preferably ingested with a meal and a small glass of water.
      Should the participant forget/miss to take a dose of curcumin/placebo curcumin, it can be
      ingested until 6 hours before the next planned dose. If a dosage is missed, and the next one
      is planned within 6 hours, the dosage should be passed, and the incident must be noted in the
      diary. Should the participant forget/miss to take a dose of
      prednisolone/placebo-prednisolone, it can be ingested until 12 hours prior to the next dose.
      If a dosage is missed, and the next one is planned within the next 12 hours, the dosage
      should med passed, and the incident must be noted in the diary.

      End-of-intervention assessments and visit The end-of-intervention visit will be planned on
      day 12 after start of intervention. Stool sample collection and MRS will be performed in the
      period around end-of-intervention visit, and will be performed as described above under
      &quot;baseline assessments and randomisation visit&quot;. Procedures during the end-of-intervention
      visit are similar to the ones described above under &quot;Baseline assessments and randomisation
      visit&quot;. Also, during this day, to check for any effect of curcumin intervention, physical
      examination will be performed by a physician from the research team and additional blood
      samples (identical with the samples at the screening visit, except viral hepatitis markers)
      will be collected (which adds another 5 ml blood samples compared to randomisation visit) and
      albumin-creatinine ratio in the urine will be measured. The continuous glucose monitor sensor
      is removed from the upper arm of the participant, and the data from the sensor is transferred
      to a suitable software program. Again, the questionnaire is handed out regarding calorie
      intake and physical activity the day prior to the End-of-intervention day, but a few
      questions about the last 4 days are added. Compliance will be evaluated (if compliance is
      insufficient (missed more than ¼ of planned doses), the participant will not go through
      end-of-intervention assessments.

      Follow-up phone call and visit Between two and four days after last day on treatment, the
      participant will receive a telephone call, where the participant is asked about withdrawal
      symptoms. If the participant feels any kind of withdrawal symptoms (tiredness, weakness,
      abdominal pain, anorexia, nausea or vomiting), or has had any symptoms of an ongoing
      infection after End-of-intervention, a plan of action is made. Judged from the physical
      examination, blood tests, results from continuous glucose monitoring, MRS and FibroScan at
      End-of-intervention visit, a follow-up visit will be arranged, if it - judged by the
      investigator - is necessary. At this follow-up visit (3-4 weeks after End-of-intervention)
      the investigator can do any or all of the following tests; physical examination, FibroScan,
      measurement of IOC, standard OGTT and blood tests, whichever is judged to be necessary to
      look into any late effects of the intervention, and if necessary, another follow-up visit
      after another 1-3 months. If the participant had steatosis on both MRS's, the participant
      will be offered a referral to the Department of Gastroenterology for further evaluation and
      treatment.

      BIOBANK A research biobank will be established at at Center for Clinical Metabolic Research
      at Gentofte Hospital, DK-2900 Hellerup, Denmark, during the experiments to store the blood
      tests until analyses. All participants are assigned with a trial number and will on data
      sheets and tubes only appear with the trial number. The full name, social security number and
      trial number will be stored separately. After the project is completed the biobank will be
      terminated. Excess plasma and white blood cells will be stored in another biobank for up to
      10 years after the completion of the study, in case of need of re-analyses or need for
      further analyses. In the latter case, a new approval by the Regional Health Research Ethics
      Committee is required. The biobanks will be registered with Datatilsynet.

      CALCULATIONS AND STATISTICS Data will be processed and presented with the use of standard
      descriptive statistics. Areas under the curves (AUCs) are calculated by use of the trapezoid
      rule. Comparison of normally distributed data is carried out by means of repeated
      measurements analysis of variance using linear mixed modeling with &quot;individual&quot; as random
      factor. Freidmans test will be used for analysis of non-normally distributed data. P values
      ≤0.05 are accepted as statistically significant (significance level, α = 5%). Power of the
      study (1-β) is set to 80%, where β (20%) is the risk of accepting a hypothesis that is false.

      Power calculation: Hansen et al. studied a prednisolone-treated group of healthy individuals,
      and found an increase in HOMA-IR of 1.6 (1.3±0.1 vs. 2.9±0.3). The difference is 1.6±SD, but
      the value of this SD we unfortunately do not have. Best guess is that it is (maximum) 0.5. It
      is hypothesized that the intervention group receiving two different kinds of placebo is
      comparable to the baseline values in KB Hansens study, both before and after intervention, as
      placebo expectedly will not change HOMA-IR. And it is hypothesized that the prednisolone
      treated group is comparable with KB Hansens cohort after treatment with prednisolone. The
      wish is to achieve a reduction in the increase in HOMA-IR of 50% when ingesting curcumin,
      which gives a minimal relevant difference of 0.8.

      P values ≤ 0.05 are accepted as statistically significant (α = 5%) and the power is set to
      80%. This results in a sample size of 7 in each of the three treatment groups. Based on
      this,12 participants will be included in each group, as it is suspected that the participants
      have bigger changes and greater variance in HOMA-IR in the population in this study compared
      to the study of KB Hansen, as we are including overweight and obese people who are more
      likely to get increased HOMA-IR. In case of drop-outs, we will include new participants until
      we have 12 completers in each group.

      The continuous glucose monitoring will provide data for up to 14 days with glucose measures
      with frequent intervals 24 hours per day. The CGM will be recording for at least 24 hours
      before start of intervention with prednisolon. CGM recordings are regarded successful if at
      least 80% of the sensor data are available for analysis. Before analysis, all data will be
      reviewed for pressure induced sensor attenuations. From these data, the following
      calculations will be made: 1) The risk of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia will be calculated
      as the low blood glucose index (LBGI) and the high blood glucose index (HBGI) using the
      EasyGV workbook (www.phc.ox.ac.uk/research/technology-outputs/easygv) 2) coefficient of
      variability (SD/mean interstitial glucose level), 3) SD, 4) percentage of time in
      normoglycemic range (3,9-7,8 mmol/l), 5) percentage of time in three hyperglycemic ranges
      (7.9-10 mmol/l, 10.1-13.9 mmol/l, &gt;13.9mmol/l) and 6) percentage of time in hypoglycemia
      (&lt;3.9 mmol/l).

      SIDE EFFECTS, RISKS AND DISADVANTAGES FOR PARTICIPANTS Curcumin is a polyphenolic compound
      extracted from the turmeric root with a very low bioavailability. Many approaches have been
      employed to enhance bioavailability. Meriva® is a food supplement in which curcumin is coated
      with EpiKuron 130 P (a de-oiled, powdered soybean lecithin enriched with 30%
      phosphatidylcholine). This has been shown to enhance bioavailability of curcumin ~5 times in
      rats, but even higher for demethoxycurcumin; one of the more potent curcuminoids found in
      Meriva®. High doses of Meriva® have been well tolerated in human trials. However, most
      studies have been performed with non-formulated traditional curcumin with lower
      bioavailability. Nevertheless, high doses of non-formulated curcumin have not been associated
      with severe side effects, and are generally very well tolerated in clinical trials. Panahi et
      al did a study with NAFLD patients, with ~50 patients receiving Meriva® 1000 mg daily for 8
      weeks (corresponding to 200 mg of curcumin). There were no reports of side effects, but 7
      withdraw because of the perception of lack of effects. Antiga et. al. did a study with
      Meriva® 2000 mg daily for 12 weeks, with only one participant having one adverse event
      (diarrhoea), but presumably not caused by Meriva® because of other signs of viral genesis67.
      Mazzolani did a study with 12 patients receiving 1200 mg Meriva® per day for 1 year with no
      reports of AEs. Di Pierro et al. did a study on overweight participants, with a high dose of
      phosphatidylserine (a product very similar to Meriva®) with reports of no side effects, and
      good tolerability and compliance.

      Prednisolone side effects are very well described. The most common side effects are weight
      gain, skin abnormalities, increased serum glucose levels, increased insulin resistance,
      oedema, electrolyte derangement, myopathy, osteoporosis, infections, reduced symptoms of
      infections, haematological abnormalities, psychiatric diseases, mood changes, sleep
      disorders, hyperlipidaemia, hypertension and heart failure. But if the participants will
      experience side effects, they are unlikely to get severe, when treating only with 50 mg daily
      for 10 days, as they are dose and time-dependent, and with the relevant inclusion and
      exclusion criteria applied. Furthermore, they are all regarded as fully reversible after end
      of intervention.

      A side effect from treatment with oral corticosteroids (e.g. Prednisolone) is elevated IOP
      which in rare cases can cause the sight-threatening condition, glaucoma. In most cases
      elevated IOP is asymptomatic, which is why, it is important to measure in the patient. IOP
      can simply and easily be measured with a icare ic100 tonometer. The device is based on a
      rebound measuring principle that requires no drops, air or specialized skills for its use,
      and therefore not associated with any risk or complications. IOP is measured 3 times in each
      eye and the mean is calculated. If this is elevated the patient will be seen by an
      ophthalmologist.

      During and right after prednisolone treatment, the participants are more prone to infections
      and are likely to have fewer symptoms of infections. Participants will be asked about their
      wellbeing and symptoms of infections at day 5, 6 or 7 in the intervention period, when they
      receive a phone call from study staff and when they meet for End-of-intervention visit, and
      also at the phone call two to four days after last day on treatment, and if relevant, actions
      will be made.

      Withdrawal symptoms (after prednisolone treatment) are most commonly tiredness, weakness,
      abdominal pain, anorexia, nausea or vomiting. Due to the short treatment period and
      relatively low dose, it is very unlikely these symptoms will occur, but participants will be
      asked about these symptoms at the telephone call two to four days after last day on
      treatment.

      MRS is safe and not coupled with discomfort or pain. The scanner will be making loud noise
      while scanning, but the participant will wear proper ear protection provided by staff at
      Herlev Hospital. Some participants may experience claustrophobia during the scan. If the
      participant has steatosis on both MRS, he will be offered a referral to the Department of
      Gastroenterology to further evaluation and treatment.

      Penetrations of skin (blood puncture and intravenous catheter insertion and insertion of
      sensor for continuous glucose monitoring) are associated with mild discomfort and risk of
      hematomas. A theoretical complication to skin penetration is superficial phlebitis. The
      condition is not dangerous and will be treated with antibiotics should any sign of infection
      be present. The risk of superficial phlebitis is small and minimized by following clinical
      standards for the insertion of intravascular catheters including double wiping of the
      involved skin with disinfectant alcohol and other sterile procedures.

      The total blood loss will amount to approximately 365 ml distributed over a minimum of 2
      weeks, which is not in any way harmful for the participant. Only participants with
      haemoglobin &gt;7.5 mmol/l can participate, and all participants are offered iron treatment
      after the trial.

      PARTICIPANTS PHYSICAL AND MENTAL INTEGRITY AND PRIVACY Information regarding participants of
      the project will be protected in accordance with the applicable laws of Denmark including the
      law concerning the processing of personal data. We will seek approval of the protocol by the
      Danish &quot;Datatilsynet&quot; via the The Capital Region of Denmark. The trial will follow the rules
      in European Union's General Data Protection Regulation.

      The protocol complies with the Helsinki Declaration (Seventh revision 2013).

      OPERATING COSTS AND ECONOMY The project is currently not supported by any medical companies
      and the responsible physician of the project has no economical affiliations with private
      companies, foundations or the like with interests in the research project. When funding for
      the project is in place the Research Ethics Committees will be notified.

      AVAILABILITY OF DATA FOR PARTICIPANTS All participants are guaranteed access to more
      information about the project. Contact: Dr. Pernille Høgh Hellmann, MD, Center for Clinical
      Metabolic Research, Gentofte Hospital, DK-2900 Hellerup; e-mail:
      pernille.hoegh.hellmann@regionh.dk; Phone: +45 20911792.

      ADJOURNMENT OF TRIAL Any participant can be withdrawn from the trial at any time, in case
      investigator finds it unsafe for the participant to continue. Also, the participant can be
      withdrawn if the participant meets any of the exclusion criteria, if compliance is
      insufficient (if participant has missed more than ¼ of planned doses, controlled at telephone
      call at day 5, 6 or 7 in the intervention period and at the end-of-intervention visit)
      evaluated by investigator, or in case exceptional circumstances make it impossible to
      complete the study. Likewise, any extraordinary event that makes it impossible to finish the
      project will result in termination of ongoing experiments. In all cases, the participant will
      be informed about the decision and the reason why. The participant may, at any time during
      the trial, voluntarily discontinue participation. In case of drop-outs, we will include new
      participants until we have 12 completers in each group.

      RECRUITMENT OF PARTICIPANTS Participants are recruited through the following methods: 1)
      Advertisement in newspapers or local newspapers or at www.forsøgsperson.dk. 2) Advertisement
      through flyers and posters. 3) Participants who participated in studies in the department in
      the past and gave consent that they would like to be contacted again in regard to
      participation in new studies in the department.

      Participants who responded on advertisements will receive written information on e-mail or
      regular mail, whatever is preferred. All participants will also receive the leaflet
      &quot;Forsøgspersonens rettigheder i et sundhedsvidenskabeligt forskningsprojekt&quot; from the Ethical
      Committee in Denmark, august 2014.

      After at least two days, the participant will be contacted by telephone and asked if he wants
      to participate in the study. If the participant has any questions, these will be answered as
      thoroughly as possible. If the participant is interested in participation, a time and place
      for the information visit will be scheduled. During the phone call, the participant is
      informed about the possibility to be accompanied by a person of own choice to all the visits
      during the trial.
