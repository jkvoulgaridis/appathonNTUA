      Researchers are gathering information on the feasibility of treating e-cigarette users with
      12-weeks of varenicline (Chantix®) in assisting with stopping the use of e-cigarettes.

    <textblock>
      Because the process of developing nicotine dependence and the reinforcing mechanisms of
      nicotine delivered in high concentrations are similar between tobacco cigarettes and newer
      generation electronic cigarettes, the investigators hypothesize that evidence based treatment
      approaches used in treating tobacco dependence should be effective in treating dependence on
      electronic cigarettes. Since there is no existing evidence base for treatment of electronic
      cigarette dependence, preliminary evidence is needed from feasibility and open label studies
      to guide in the development of future randomized clinical trials. In this study, vaping
      participants will be treated with a 12 week course of varenicline as well as have nicotine
      dependence counseling through a certified tobacco treatment specialist followed up 12 weeks
      post end of medication.
