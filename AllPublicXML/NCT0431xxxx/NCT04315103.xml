  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intraarticular hyaluronan or platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is each effective in the treatment
      for knee osteoarthritis (OA). The efficacy of combined hyaluronan with PRP for knee OA
      remained unclear. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of a single intraarticular
      hyaluronan (HYAJOINT Plus) combined with a single PRP versus a single intraarticular PRP in
      patients with knee OA.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intraarticular HA or PRP has been used for knee OA for years. Combined HA and PRP has not
      been widely used for OA because of lack of clinical evidence. Based on in vitro and animal
      studies, combining HA and PRP may benefit from their dissimilar biological mechanisms for
      tissue repair and have potentials to synergistically promote cartilage regeneration, inhibit
      OA inflammation, modulate the disease process, and improve joint homeostasis in OA.
      Combination of HA and PRP has much potential for the treatment of OA, but the clinical
      evidence of this combination remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate
      the efficacy and safety of combined a single crosslinked HA (HYAJOINT Plus) with a single PRP
      versus a single PRP alone in patients with knee OA.

    <measure>VAS pain score change from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>1,3 and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>. The patient rated the average severity of knee pain on knee movement over the previous week on a 0-100 mm VAS (0=no pain to 100=worst possible pain)</description>

    <measure>The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC, Likert Scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>1,3 and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>a 24-item questionnaire with 3 subscales measuring pain, stiffness, and physical function. Total score is 96 and higher scores indicate worse outcomes.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Lequesne index</measure>
    <time_frame>1,3 and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>used to assess severity of knee symptoms during the last week. It includes the measurement of pain, walking distance, and activities of daily living. Maximal score is 24 and higher scores represent worse function.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Single-leg stance test (SLS)</measure>
    <time_frame>1,3 and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>done by raising one foot up without touching it to the supported lower extremity with target knee and maintain balance for as long as possible. Each participant performed 3 trials, and the best result of the 3 trials was recorded.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>1,3 and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patients were asked to rate their treatment satisfaction compared to the preinjection condition, using a 100 mm VAS (0= completely dissatisfied, 100=completely satisfied).</description>

    <description>Acetaminophen (500mg; maximum daily dose, 4 g) was the only rescue medication allowed for knee pain. Acetaminophen was not permitted during the 24-hour period prior to each study visit. Use of rescue medication during the study period was recorded in a patient diary.</description>
