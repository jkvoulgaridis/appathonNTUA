  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized, single center, 2-treatment, 3-period, 3-sequence
      reference-replicated, crossover trial in healthy subjects to compare the PK of glepaglutide
      (ZP1848) after a single SC administration by vial/syringe and by autoinjector.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 72 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive 10 mg glepaglutide SC
      via vial/syringe (Reference) twice or autoinjector (Test) in one of the 3 treatment
      sequences.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Significant medical history or clinical manifestation of any metabolic, allergic,
