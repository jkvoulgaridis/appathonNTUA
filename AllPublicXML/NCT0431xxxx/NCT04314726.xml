  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Prevention of periodontal defects after the extraction of lower third molars
      remains a challenge. Various methods have been proposed in the literature, but there are no
      studies which evaluated the effectiveness of amelogenins.

      Methods: A single-blind split-mouth randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT) was performed
      on 5 patients to verify if amelogenins had some benefits in improving lower second molar
      periodontal healing after adjacent third molar extraction. A PPD ≥ 8 mm associated with a
      radiographic bone defect of at least 5 mm were the main inclusion criteria.

    <description>The study involved enrolling 5 periodontitis free patients, to which the extraction of both lower third molars was prescribed. A bone defect at the distal surface of the second molar ≥ 5 mm, had to be present on the intraoral periapical radiography, bilaterally. Amelogenins effect was evaluated by applying them only in the test site and comparing healing results with those obtained on the contra-lateral site</description>
