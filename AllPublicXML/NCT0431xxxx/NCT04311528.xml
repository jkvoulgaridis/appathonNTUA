      This study will evaluate the immunogenicity of the 9-valent HPV vaccine in post-partum women
      age 16-45.

      Women age 16-45 who are pregnant or who have just delivered will be eligible to participate
      in a study involving the 9-valent HPV vaccine. For clarification, women who are pregnant are
      eligible to sign consent, but the first vaccine will not occur until after delivery. Vaccine
      # 1 must occur within seven days of delivery.

      The main objective of the study is to determine the immunogenicity of the vaccine in
      postpartum women. The immunogenicity results will be compared to that of non-postpartum women
      of the same age, 16-45.

      Women will participate for approximately 12 months and will complete a total of 4 visits
      during that time frame.

          -  Judged to be in good health on the basis of medical history and physical examination

          -  Able to fully understand study procedures, alternative treatments available, the risks
             involved in the study and voluntarily agrees to participate by giving written informed
             consent

          -  Able to read, understand, and complete the questionnaires

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has a known allergy to any vaccine component, including aluminum, yeast, or BENZONASE™

          -  Has thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder that would contraindicate
             intramuscular injections

          -  Is currently immunocompromised or has been diagnosed as having a congenital or
             acquired immunodeficiency, HIV infection, lymphoma, leukemia, systemic lupus
             erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory
             bowel disease, or other autoimmune condition.

          -  Is receiving or has received in the year prior to enrollment the following
             immunosuppressive therapies: radiation therapy, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine,
             methotrexate, any chemotherapy, cyclosporin, leflunomide, TNF-α antagonists,
             monoclonal antibody therapies (including rituximab), intravenous gamma globulin
             (IVIG), antilymphocyte sera, or other therapy known to interfere with the immune
             response. With regard to systemic corticosteroids, a subject will be excluded if she
             is currently receiving steroid therapy, has recently (within 2 weeks of enrollment)
             received such therapy, or has received 2 or more courses of high dose corticosteroids
             (orally or parenterally) lasting at least 1 week in duration in the year prior to
             enrollment. The use of inhaled, nasal, or topical steroids are considered eligible for
             the study

          -  Has received any immune globulin product (including RhoGAM™) or other blood- derived
             product within 3 months prior to Day 1 vaccination or plans to receive such product
             during the study

          -  Has received a marketed HPV vaccine

          -  Has had a fever of &gt; 100° within 24-hour period prior to the Day 1 vaccination
