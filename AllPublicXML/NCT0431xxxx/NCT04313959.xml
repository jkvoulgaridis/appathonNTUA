  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Open cardiac surgeries are characterized by the increased use of opioids and longer
      extubation times, being post-sternotomy pain one of the causes of greater patient discomfort,
      plexus blockages have been used more frequently given the good results of anatomical studies
      and case series that are just beginning to be published. however, there is not enough data to
      convince the scientific community of its advantages, continuing to carry out its performance
      due to lack of evidence. Dexamethasone also shows an excellent result blocking the
      inflammatory chain and it was evidenced that it prolongs the time of blockages when used
      perineurally in the plexus blockages. This study wants to show the improvement of pain in
      patients who undergo this type of surgery and also show the advantages of a longer blockage,
      which can reduce the congestions of analgesic and opioids, as well as decrease the time of
      hospitalization This is a double-blinded, randomized, clinical trial designed to determine
      the efficacy of spine erector whit dexamethasone gives more duration of the blockage and less
      pain after cardiac surgery.
