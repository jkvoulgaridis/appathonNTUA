      Research study to look for bio markers in epilepsy patients on ketogenic diet
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by the recurrence of unprovoked seizures
      that affects approximately 3.4 million people in the United States (1.2% of the total United
      States population) and more than 65 million people globally. The most commonly used
      treatments for epilepsy are antiepileptic drugs (AEDs); however, approximately 25% to 30% of
      the epilepsy population is considered pharmaco-resistant (characterized by the failure of ≥2
      appropriately chosen and dosed AEDs).

      Recent research suggests that the intestinal microbiota plays a central role in human health,
      and may play a role in a variety of central nervous system disorders, including seizure
      susceptibility. The microbiota has been shown to be associated with changes in factors
      relevant to neurotransmission, including neurotransmitter signaling, synaptic protein
      expression, long-term potentiation, and myelination. In addition to the microbiota's
      potential role in general neurotransmission, research suggests that the gut microbiome may
      differ between patients with pharmaco-resistant and pharmaco-sensitive epilepsies. Diet has
      been explored as an alternative form of therapy for patients with epilepsy, with the
      ketogenic diet showing promise as an alternative treatment for patients with drug-resistant
      epilepsy.

          -  Study participant has a surgically remediable cause for refractory epilepsy.

          -  Study participant has a suspected mitochondrial disorder or has been diagnosed with a
             disorder in which a high-fat diet is contraindicated.

          -  Study participant has previously received a ketogenic diet or modified Atkins diet.
