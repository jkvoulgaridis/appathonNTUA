  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The New York City (NYC) Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) has implemented
      Relay, a novel program that engages and intervenes with individuals in the ED following an
      opioid OD and for the next 90 days, with the goal of preventing subsequent OD events. The
      proposed randomized controlled trial will evaluate the impact of Relay on preventing
      subsequent opioid-related adverse events. A total of 350 eligible individuals with nonfatal
      opioid OD presenting to one of five participating EDs will be enrolled and randomized to one
      of two arms: 1) site-directed care (SDC) or 2) Relay—peer-delivered OD education and
      treatment linkage, including 90 days of peer navigation. Outcomes will be measured for 12
      months through interviews and administrative health data.

      Relay is a novel program that engages and intervenes with individuals in the ED following an
      opioid OD and for the next 90 days, with the goal of preventing subsequent OD events. Relay
      is delivered by trained peer navigators, who are DOHMH staff with lived substance use
      experience. Relay navigators provide counseling, linkage to services, and OD prevention
      education.

    <measure>Number of opioid-related adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome is &quot;opioid-related adverse events,&quot; which will include fatal and non-fatal opioid-involved overdose as well as substance use-related emergency department (ED) visits. ED visits and fatal overdoses in the 12-month period after baseline will be captured in administrative data sources. Other non-fatal opioid-involved overdose events will be captured by self-report in follow-up interviews through six months after baseline, and estimated for the second half of the 12-month follow-up period.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Initiation of medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>MOUD initiation will be measured at each study visit. MOUD is defined as use of methadone, buprenorphine, or naltrexone that is prescribed by an office-based provider or provided by a treatment program as treatment for OUD. Initiation is defined as receiving MOUD within the 90 days following the index visit, for individuals who received no MOUD for at least 2 weeks prior to the index visit.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Overdose risk behaviors</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month, 3 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Overdose risk behaviors will be measured using questions that measure the frequency in a period of 3 months at which participants engaged in a one or more of several different known risk behaviors for opioid overdose. The total risk score is an aggregation of responses to the individual questions.</description>
