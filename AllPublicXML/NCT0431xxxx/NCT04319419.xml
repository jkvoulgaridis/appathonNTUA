  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Milk proteins and micronutrients could be beneficial in the prevention and treatment of
      obesity.

      The objective was to evaluate a supplement with milk proteins and multivitamins and minerals
      with nutrition education on anthropometry, body composition, micronutrient status, blood
      pressure, lipid profile, systemic inflammation, leptin and insulin resistance in obese
      children at baseline and after 6 months.

    <textblock>
      Obese children were selected in elementary schools from 5 rural communities of the State of
      Querétaro. One hundred fifty two obese children (Z-score &gt;2 standard deviations) aged 6-11y
      were randomly assigned to receive one of two treatments: 1) 237mL/day of milk proteins and
      multiple micronutrients supplement (MPMS) plus Nutrition Education (NE) program or 2) NE
      alone for 24 weeks.

      Children in both groups were evaluated at baseline and 6 months after treatment initiated. At
      both times the following variables were evaluated:

      Visit 1 (Screening): Mothers and parents received oral and written information regarding all
      aspects of the study. Informed consent, medical history, demographic information, weight and
      height were obtained.

      Visit 2 (Clinical Laboratory testing): A blood preasure and sample was taken by an
      specialist. Blood test included Glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol
      and LDL cholesterol, Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and
      interleukin-10 (IL-10), C reactive protein, insulin and leptin.

      Visit 3 (Nutrition Clinic at UAQ): body composition was determined by DEXA. The NE were given
      at Nutrition Clinic and school to the children's parents each week.
