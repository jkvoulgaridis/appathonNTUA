  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intensive care unit-acquired weakness (ICU-AW) is the most common neuromuscular impairment in
      critically ill patients. It affects more than 50 % of patients in the intensive care and is
      related to many problems as difficult weaning from mechanical ventilation, prolonged hospital
      stay and increased mortality.Thyroid disorders are also associated with neuromuscular
      abnormalities and may decrease the threshold for the development of any type of myopathy.
      However, no previous study investigated the direct relationship between thyroid dysfunction
      and ICUAW.This study aims at evaluation of the association between thyroid dysfunction and
      intensive care unit acquired weakness.

    <textblock>
      Intensive care unit acquired weakness refers to muscle weakness encountered in the intensive
      care unit as a consequence of critical illness. It affects more than 50 % of patients in the
      intensive care and is related to many problems as difficult weaning from mechanical
      ventilation, prolonged hospital stay and increased mortality.

      There are three distinct entities for ICUAW that can only be differentiated by
      neurophysiological studies. These are critical illness myopathy (CIM), critical illness
      polyneuropathy (CIP) and critical illness neuromyopathy (CINM).

      Identification of risk factors responsible for the development of ICUAW is the first step in
      the prevention and management of this disorder. Till time septic shock, hyperglycemia, high
      dose steroid therapy, prolonged mechanical ventilation and the use of neuromuscular blocking
      agents are the main accused.

      Thyroid disorders are also associated with neuromuscular abnormalities. Unfortunately, the
      prevalence of thyroid dysfunction in the intensive care is high reaching 90%. Moreover,
      patients with severe critical illness, who are typically prone to the development of ICUAW,
      show changes in their thyroid biochemistry namely low T3 levels (with or without low T4
      levels) in the presence of normal TSH levels. These changes are collectively known as
      Non-Thyroidal illness syndrome (previously low T3 syndrome and Euthyroid sick syndrome) which
      is the most common form of thyroid dysfunction in the intensive care unit.

    <description>Blood samples will be withdrawn from patients admitted to the intensive care for more than 7 days to measure Thyroid hormones (Free T3: Tri-iodothyronine and Free T4:thyroxine) and TSH ( Thyroid Stimulating Hormone) using ELISA kits. Reference ranges will be as follows: TSH 0.4-4mU/L, Free T3 2-4.4 mU/L, Free T4 0.8-1.9 mU/L. Patients will be then categorized into one of the following categories
Euthyroid ( Normal TSH, FT3 and FT4)
Hyperthyroid (Low TSH) either overt (increased FT3 and /or FT4) or subclinical (normal FT4 and FT3).
Hypothyroid (Elevated TSH) either overt (Low FT3 and FT4) or subclinical (Normal FT3 and FT4)
Non-thyroidal illness syndrome : normal or low TSH in addition to low FT3 Â± Low FT4 levels.</description>

        Clinical criteria for Intensive care unit acquired weakness :

          1. . Weakness developing after the onset of critical illness

          2. . Generalized (Proximal and distal), symmetrical and flaccid weakness with sparing of
             cranial nerves

          3. . MRC) score&lt; 48 (or mean score &lt;4 in all tested muscles on more than two occasions
             more than 24 hours apart) .

          4. . Mechanical ventilator dependence

          5. . Cause of weakness not related directly to the underlying critical illness

               -  Final Diagnosis of ICUAW :

                    1. Presence of criteria (1), (2) and (5) + (3) Or (4)
