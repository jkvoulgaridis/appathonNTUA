  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators evaluated the effects of neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES)
      therapy on functional capacity and oxidative stress in patients hospitalized for an episode
      of acute heart failure (AHF). The NMES therapy was used on top of the conventional
      rehabilitation program. After randomization the investigators followed the patients by
      measuring the evolution of functional capacity, oxidative stress and adverse events.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this program the investigators will include patients with acute heart failure (AHF) with
      left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) lower than 50%, admitted to our clinic.

      Patients prior to being included in this research will sign an informed consent form in two
      samples, one remaining with the patient. This form will contain the study protocol, risks,
      potential benefits as well as assuring patients that personal data will be used strictly for
      research purposes. The inclusion and exclusion criteria are presented below. The patients
      will be randomized into two groups: neuromuscular electrostimulation (NMES) therapy and
      conventional rehabilitation or a conventional rehabilitation program alone (respiratory
      gymnastics and strength / endurance exercises in bed).

      Patients will receive optimal medical therapy for AHF according to current management
      guidelines. Patients will complete different questionnaires (Kansas, Beck for Depression). In
      the first phase, patients will be given a form with questions regarding notions about heart
      failure and cardiovascular recovery to assess the level of knowledge about their disease.

      All patients included will perform the following:

        -  Clinical evaluation

        -  ECG

        -  Biological samples (including NT pro BNP, CK, oxidized LDL plus standard samples)

        -  Cardiac ultrasound

        -  6-minute walk test (6MWT) The duration of NMES therapy will be equal to the duration of
           hospitalization. At the time of discharge, all patients will undergo a 6MWT and
           biological samples (NT pro BNP and oxidized LDL) and receive a cardiac rehabilitation
           program that they will follow at home. They will be given advice on initiating and
           maintaining a healthy diet, as well as discontinuing smoking if this risk factor is
           identified.

      There will be a telephone visit at 30 days and the investigator will note the vital status
      and rehospitalizations.

    <intervention_model_description>The study team conducted a prospective randomized study to investigate the effects of NMES versus standard therapy on a hospitalized population with AHF. After the patients with AHF were stabilized they were included in the trial and were randomized by a blinded investigator to control group or NMES therapy. At the time of enrollment, patients were clinically evaluated and their associated comorbidities and drug therapy were noted. ECG, echocardiography, 6-minute walk test (6MWT) were performed and laboratory samples were collected including oxidized LDL, NT- proBNP, CK, uric acid, lipid profile and PCR. At the time of discharge, all patients underwent a 6MWT and laboratory samples such as oxidized LDL and NT-proBNP were collected again. During the hospitalization period we monitored any adverse events and tolerance to NMES therapy. At the time of inclusion in the study, patients signed an informed consent form in two copies, one remaining with the patient.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>After the patients were evaluated for inclusion in the study and after signing the informed consent form, they were randomized using the website www.randomization.com (1 complete randomized block). Considering our intervention protocol, it was not possible to blind the patients and/or the investigator who performed the electrostimulation. However, the other investigators who conducted the 6MWT and performed the randomization were blinded.</masking_description>

    <description>For patients who underwent NMES therapy, four electrodes (two 50/100 mm and two 50/50 mm, Compex Performance) were placed on the skin above the quadriceps muscle approximately 5 cm below the inguinal fold and 3 cm above the upper patella border.
The electrical stimulation protocol consisted of electrical current at frequency of 10 Hz, 20 seconds stimulation time (time on) and 20 seconds resting time (time off) with variable intensity (until visible muscular contraction) for one hour per day until discharge (Compex).The NMES therapy was on top of conventional rehabilitation described below.</description>
