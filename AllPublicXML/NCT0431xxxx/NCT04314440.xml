  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several positive physiological and behavioural outcomes have been observed in preterm infants
      exposed to music therapy during their stay at Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICU). There is
      ample evidence in the literature showing that brief exposure to music can lead to superior
      performance on a host of cognitive tasks in laboratory settings in children, adolescent and
      adults. However, till date no study has examined the cognitive benefits of NICU music therapy
      in preterm infants. Further habituation tests have been employed to examine cognitive
      functioning in infants in laboratory setting but the same test have not been employed as a
      measure to examine early cognitive functioning in preterm infants.

      This project will be carried out to examine the benefits of NICU music therapy on the
      cognitive functioning of preterm infants born at 27- 33 weeks of gestational age. A
      randomized controlled research design will be employed to compare cognitive functioning
      between the treatment and control group at 18 - 24 months of corrected gestational age. The
      treatment group will be exposed to music therapy during their stay in NICU and the controlled
      group will be exposed to all standardized care available at our institution except music
      therapy. Habituation tests will be used to examine cognitive functioning of the preterm
      infants in groups at 18 - 24 months of gestational age.

      Following previous research, our hypothesis is that infants in the experimental group will
      display significantly more positive scores on a collection of physiological and behavioural
      measurements. The stimuli used at each age will be targeted to the infants' developmental
      level. Bayley Scales of Infant Development will also be administered at 18 - 24 months as
      part of high risk infant follow up. These data will be included in the analysis for outcome
      measurement. While seated in a high-chair or their parent's lap, infants will be habituated
      to a series of images of a particular shape (e.g., a triangle), while their looking time to
      each stimulus is measured. Each image during habituation will be a unique token of the
      category (i.e., all different triangles). Habituation will be individually determined, and
      defined as cumulative looking across three successive trials that is 50% than cumulative
      looking across the first three trials. Following habituation, infants will be shown a novel
      token of the habituation shape (e.g., a new triangle) and a novel shape (e.g., a square), in
      counterbalanced order. If infants recognize the category change, they should look longer at
      novel category compared to the novel token. For each test, two dependent measures will be
      sampled: rate of habituation and amount of dishabituation to the novel category. Mixed ANOVA
      and paired t-tests will be used to analyze the data. As preterm infants have been shown to be
      delayed on these kinds of tasks, we hypothesize that the experimental group will habituate to
      each category faster, and/or display stronger dishabituation scores compared to the preterm.
      We will also use multiple regression analyses to examine relations between the NICU
      physiological and behavioural measures and the cognitive measures. We hypothesize that
      infants who most strongly benefited from their therapies in the NICU will display the most
      advanced cognitive abilities. An intention-to-treat- analysis will be performed for cognitive
      measures as well. The cognitive assessment at 2 and 4 months that were to be carried out at
      the Developmental Lab at University of Regina is now canceled due to feasibility concerns.

    <description>After the initial warm up session music therapy will be delivered three times a week for 15-20 minutes. All babies in the experimental group will be exposed to three weeks of music therapy sessions that is a total of 9 music therapy session prior to discharge from the hospital. The baby will be placed at the bassinet 15 minutes before music therapy begins. The baby will be in the bassinet during music therapy and 15 minutes post music therapy to allow measurement of physiological indicators. If parents are present during music therapy they will not engage in kangaroo care during the music therapy session or when physiological measurements are being taken pre and post music therapy, but can do so at other times.</description>

    <description>An accredited music therapist will deliver 15-20 minutes of music therapy every day, 4-5 days in week one and remaining in week two to all MT participants. All participants in music therapy group will get a total of nine sessions. The lullaby &quot;twinkle twinkle little star&quot; will be sung for ~5 minutes, followed by the same songs played on acoustic guitar for ~5 minutes and another ~5 minutes of the same song sung in voice. This protocol will be followed in all 9 sessions for all infants in the experimental arm. The sound levels will be maintained at 55-65 decibels (dB) using appropriate meters. If MT is interrupted within 10 minutes then a make-up session will be delivered, assuming no discharge. In case of missed sessions and interrupted session infants will receive a maximum of 12 session.</description>
