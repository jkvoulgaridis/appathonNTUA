      This study will evaluate the efficacy of a therapeutic treatment, Deep Brain Reorienting
      (DBR), for PTSD (Post-traumatic Stress Disorder). Participants will be randomized to either
      the DBR treatment, or wait-list condition.

      This study will evaluate the efficacy of Deep Brain Reorienting (DBR) in reducing PTSD
      symptoms. DBR was designed by Dr. Frank Corrigan, a Scottish psychiatrist interested in the
      brain mechanisms underlying effective trauma psychotherapy. For this study, participants will
      be randomized to either the DBR treatment or wait-list study conditions. Trauma processing
      through DBR involves bringing up a traumatic memory and encourages the client to focus on
      tensions arising in the muscles of the shoulders, neck, head and face (i.e., those involved
      in orienting toward a threatening person/event). It is believed that this approach will allow
      the participant to process the traumatic memory in an emotionally manageable way, changing
      how it is represented/accessed in the brain's innate defensive system. Online Stream -
      Assessments will include clinical interviews (pre/post treatment, and follow-up). In-Person
      Stream - Assessment will include clinical interviews (pre/post treatment and follow-up), and
      fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) scans (pre/post treatment).

    <description>Trauma processing through DBR involves bringing up a traumatic memory and encouraging the client to focus on tensions arising in the muscles of the shoulders, neck, head and face (i.e., those involved in orienting toward a threatening person/event). The rationale is as follows: Physiologically, orienting to a stimulus, whether external or in the mind's eye, comes before any affective response to it. Here, it is hypothesized that there is activity in certain midbrain structures , i.e.,Superior Colliculi (SC) and Periaqueductal Gray (PAG). The deep layers of the SC bring on a brief (orienting) tension in the neck as well as preparing for eye movements, which is later followed by the processing of raw affect in the PAG. In session, if we can attend to this tension - even if we have to backtrack from the emotion that follows - we can establish an anchor in the body that precedes the affect and is hypothesized to protect against emotional overwhelm.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  English speaking

          -  age: 18-65

          -  meets diagnostic criteria for PTSD (as determined by study assessment)

          -  may benefit from short-term trauma therapy (as determined by study assessment)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Individuals with any implants, conditions, etc. that do not comply with 7-Tesla fMRI
             research safety standards (e.g., certain implants, pregnancy), this is applicable to
             the in-person stream only

          -  history of significant head injury/lengthy loss of consciousness (e.g., a Glasgow Coma
             Scale Score &lt; 15 at the time of incident assessed retrospectively by participant)

          -  significant untreated medical illness

          -  history of neurological disorder

          -  history of any pervasive developmental disorder

          -  history of bipolar disorder

          -  history of psychotic disorder

          -  alcohol/substance abuse or dependence within the last 3 months

          -  extensive narcotic use

          -  current participation in counselling more extensive than supportive therapy (e.g.,
             exposure therapy, Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy would be an exclusion)

          -  a degree of mental distress that is unlikely to benefit from a short-term therapy (for
             our participants' well-being, it will be necessary that we believe it possible to
             safely address the issues/triggers brought up in treatment within the 8 sessions).
