  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted to evaluate and compare the single oral dose bioavailability of
      Paroxetine tablets 20 milligram (mg) manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Pharmaceuticals
      S.A. for GlaxoSmithKline México, S.A. de C.V. with that of PAXIL® (Paroxetine) tablets 20 mg
      of GlaxoSmithKline, México, S.A. de C.V. in healthy, adult, male and female participants
      under fasting conditions. Maximum 38 participants will be randomized and dosed. The expected
      duration of this study will be 12 days including 7 days of washout period in-between each
      dosing. PAXIL is a registered trademark of GSK group of companies.
