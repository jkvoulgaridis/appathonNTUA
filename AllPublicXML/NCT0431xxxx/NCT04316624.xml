  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, non-randomized and dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of C-CAR066 in treatment of r/r DLBCL who received CD19 CAR-T therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study plans to enroll 10 patients to assess the safety and efficacy of C-CAR066.
      Subjects who meet the eligibility criteria will receive a single dose of C-CAR066 injection.

      The study will include the following sequential phases: Screening, Pre-Treatment (Cell
      Product Preparation, Lymphodepleting Chemotherapy), C-CAR066 infusion and Follow-up Visit.
