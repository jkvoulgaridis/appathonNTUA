    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare efficacy of brigatinib and other 2nd-generation ALK
      tyrosin kinase inhibitor (TKI) in 1st and 2nd line treatment and to explore resistance
      patterns according to treatment and molecular properties of the tumors

             Directive) given by the patient

          2. Male or female ≥ 18 years of age NOTE: There are no data that indicate special gender
             distribution. Therefore, patients will be enrolled in the study gender-independently.

          3. Histologically confirmed locally advanced (stage III) and not suitable for curative
             treatment, i.e. R0 operation or definitive chemo-/radiation, or metastatic (stage IV)

             immunohistochemistry (IHC), NGS, fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH)] must be
             available at baseline. Treatment can already be started based on a local ALK+ test
             result, but subsequent central testing of the baseline biopsy for molecular profiling,
             incl. determination of ALK variant and TP53 status, should be made possible for all
             patients.

          4. No prior therapy for metastatic ALK+ NSCLC including therapy with ALK inhibitors.
             However, 1 or 2 cycles of chemotherapy as well as cerebral irradiation before

             should receive adequate anti-hypertensive adjustment.

             *Please note: In case of treatment, at least 3 anti-hypertensive drugs should have
             been used with the intention to control hypertensive disease

                  prior to randomization

             control symptoms within 7 days prior to randomization.

             NOTE: If a patient has worsening neurological symptoms or signs due to CNS metastasis,
             the patient needs to complete local therapy and be neurologically stable (with no
             requirement for an increasing dose of corticosteroids or use of anticonvulsants) for 7
             days prior to randomization.
