  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human study to evaluate the feasibility, safety and preliminary antitumor
      efficacy of autologous T cells genetically engineered with a novel B-cell Maturation Antigen
      (BCMA)-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) and manufactured with a new process. CAR-T
      cells will be investigated as a single agent in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with MM who are relapsed and/or refractory to at least 2 prior treatment
             regimens, including an IMiD (e.g. lenalidomide or pomalidomide), a proteasome
             inhibitor (e.g. bortezomib, carfilzomib), and an approved anti-CD38 antibody (e.g.
             daratumumab), if available, and have documented evidence of disease progression (IMWG
             criteria)

          -  Measurable disease as defined by the protocol

          -  ECOG performance status that is either 0 or 1 at screening

          -  Adequate hematological values

          -  Must have a leukapheresis material of non-mobilized cells accepted for manufacturing

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior administration of a genetically modified cellular product including prior BCMA
             CAR-T therapy. Patients who have received prior BCMA-directed bi-specific antibodies
             or antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) are not excluded.

          -  Autologous HSCT within 6 weeks prior to enrollment or any prior history of allogeneic
             hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT)

          -  Chemotherapy or any concomitant anti-cancer therapies (other than protocol prescribed
             lymphodepletion (LD) chemotherapy) within 2 weeks prior to apheresis

          -  Treatment with small molecule targeted antineoplastics within 2 weeks of apheresis
             collection or 5 half-lives whichever is shorter

          -  Have received antibodies or immunotherapies (other than daratumumab) within 4 weeks
             prior to apheresis collection. Daratumumab within 3 weeks prior to apheresis
             collection.
