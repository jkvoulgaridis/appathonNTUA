  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the possibility to properly discriminate between healthy bladder tissue and BCa
      with a multimodal fiber optic spectroscopy (MFOS) technique, in order to possibly introduce a
      more objective way to detect BCa, thus reducing inter-observer variability and maybe to
      determine urothelial carcinoma stage and grade with a comparable accuracy, specificity and
      sensibility of the current gold standard histopathological analysis

    <textblock>
      Observational single center study on human biological samples to evaluate the possibility to
      discriminate between healthy and tumor tissue on urothelial bladder samples. Aim of the study
      is to provide a fast, reliable and label free aid/alternative to current histopathology

        Patients are enrolled at hospitalization in our Urology Ward for surgical operation.
        Patients in surgical note for TURBT for bladder cancer or for Trans-Urethral Resection of
        Prostate (TURP) for Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) are prospectively enrolled.

        Age, history of bladder cancer, smoke habit and anamnesis are recorded before surgery.
        During time of bladder or prostate resection, freshly excised cold cup biopsies of both
        bladder cancer or healthy bladder mucosa are taken and sent for inspection through
        label-free multimodal fiber optic spectroscopy (MFOS) within 30 minutes.

        Specimens are sent to standard histopathological analysis. MFOS data are then compared to
        current gold standard methodology in order to develop a classification algorithm based on
        the spectral information provided by each technique.
