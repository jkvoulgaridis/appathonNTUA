  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glioma is a tumor of the central nervous system. These lesions are sorted with the WHO
      ranking regarding the tumoral oncotype. The tumoral MRI assessment is the first step before
      any medical decision. Currently, only anatomical biopsy can give the tumor grade definition
      and help to define the most adapted treatment.
