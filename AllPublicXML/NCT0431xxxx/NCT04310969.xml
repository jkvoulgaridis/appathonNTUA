  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this prospective study is to compare the changes between the patients receiving
      traditional treatment and the patients with MiBoFlo, evaluating the effectiveness of MiBoFlo.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The MiBoFlo Thermoflo uses a proprietary thermoelectric heat pump to help meibum maximize
      liquefaction, improving the preservation and function of the tear film's evaporative
      component. It supplies continuous controlled heat to the outer skin of the eyelids, absorbing
      deep into the tissue and breaks down the hardened oils in the meibomian glands. We are trying
      to find a effective, safe and economical therapy for dry eye patients.

    <measure>subjective symptom score</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI©) questionnaire was chosen to assess subjective symptoms of dry eye, which can demonstrate sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing between normal subjects and patients with dry eye disease.</description>

    <measure>Meibomian Glands Yielding Liquid Secretion (MGYLS)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The total number of MGYLS was counted for both upper and lower lid of each eye.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Corneal Fluorescein Staining(CFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Fluorescein was applied in the lower conjunctival sac of each eye with a fluorescein sodium ophthalmic strip (Jingming New Technological Development Co., Ltd, Tianjin, China), and corneal erosion assessed by CFS was scored using the following grading system: grade 0 indicated no corneal erosion, grade 1 indicated 1-5 punctate epithelial erosions seen inferiorly, grade 2 indicated 6-30 punctate epithelial erosions, grade 3 indicated more than 30 punctate epithelial erosions</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tear Meniscus Height(TMH)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The lower eyelid tear meniscus was photographed under a white light source by Oculus Keratograph 5M, and TMH was measured with the built-in ruler in order to estimate tear secretion.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Non-invasive Keratograph Break-up Time(NIKBUT)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The NIKBUT was used to evaluate tear film stability and assessed by Oculus Keratograph 5M. The average NIKBUT was recorded into the statistical result.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Meibography</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Meibography was performed using Meibo-Scan attached to the Oculus Keratograph 5M. Structural changes of meibomian were observed with infrared light source. Partial or complete loss of the meibomian glands was scored using the following grading system: grade 0 indicated no loss of meibomian glands, grade 1 indicated lost area less than one third of the total area of meibomian glands, grade 2 indicated lost area between one third and two thirds of total area, grade 3 indicated lost area more than two thirds of the total area</description>

    <description>Each treatment for each eye takes 10 minutes and is treated every two weeks for a total of three times. The device was preheated to 42.2℃ and the eyelid was cleaned and smeared with a small amount of ultrasound gel in order to reduce friction between the device and eyelid skin. Then massage the outer skin of the upper and lower eyelids for a period of 10 minutes. The patient's eyes keep closed during therapy.</description>
