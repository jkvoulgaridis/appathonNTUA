      The primary objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of sub-tenon aflibercept in
      combination with either saline or hyaluronidase (HA) in patients with acute Thyroid Eye
      Disease (TED) as assessed by the incidence and severity of adverse events from baseline to
      day 45.

      The study is an exploratory investigation to evaluate use of sub-tenon injected HA or saline
      followed by sub-tenon injection of 4 mg aflibercept for the treatment of acute thyroid
      disease. The study will prospectively and sequentially enroll a total of twenty-four patients
      who meet the study enrollment criteria and will be randomized to one of three treatment arms:

        1. Group 1: Sub-tenon's injection of saline followed by injection of 4 mg aflibercept
           (total volume 1.1 ml) in the worse eye

        2. Group 2: Sub-tenon's injection of HA followed by injection of 4mg aflibercept (total
           volume 1.1 ml) in the worse eye

        3. Group 3: HA injection alone (total volume 1.1 ml) in the worse eye

      Study subjects will receive bi-weekly sub-tenon injections on day 1, day 14 and day 28 for a
      total of 3 treatments. Subjects will be followed for an additional 62 days (until the 90-day
      visit) after the last injection.

      At the time of enrollment, patients will undergo a full ophthalmologic examination including
      external photography, a 30-2 automated Humphrey visual field, intraocular pressure, ocular
      motility and alignment, calculation of the CAS score, smoking status, measurement of blood
      pressure, a pre-treatment CT scan, and laboratory work-up (including plasma testing of TSI,
      thyroglobulin antibodies, thyroid peroxidase antibodies, cytokine levels (IL-6, IL-8, IFN-g,
      TNF-a, IL-1B, TGF-B) and a baseline measurement of systemic VEGF levels). The CAS is a
      7-point clinical activity score and includes 1 point for the presence of each of the
      following: Redness of eyelids, spontaneous pain, pain when moving the globe, redness of
      conjunctiva, swelling of plica and/or caruncle, swelling of eyelid, and chemosis.

      Careful clinical monitoring will follow initial injection including a complete re-evaluation
      on day 4 (CAS, motility exam, photos, patient questionnaire, measurement of blood pressure,
      and repeat thyroid antibodyand cytokine levels). Patients will be re-evaluated in the same
      way on day 14, day 28, day 45, and day 60. A post-treatment CT scan will be obtained at day
      45. A long-term follow-up visit will occur at day 90.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Active Thyroid Eye Disease

          2. Clinical Activity Score (CAS) 3 and 5

          3. Phakic and pseudophakic eyes are allowed in the study.

          4. Willing and able to provide written informed consent after the nature of the study has
             been explained, and prior to any research-related procedures

          5. Willing and able to comply with clinic visits and study-related procedures

          6. Only one eye will be enrolled. The worse eye (demonstrating any of these features:
             worse HVF results, worse restricted motility, worse visual acuity, worse edema, worse
             proptosis, worse eyelid retraction) will be enrolled. If both eyes are equivalent, we
             will enroll the non-dominant eye.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of orbital, strabismus, or eyelid surgery or orbital radiation

          2. Optic neuropathy or other vision-threatening signs

          3. Patients currently on systemic or topical steroids. If they received steroids in the
             past, they would require a 6 week washout period and the cumulative dose of steroids
             must be less than 1 gram of methylprednisolone (or equivalent). During the washout
             period we will contact patients by phone weekly to monitor their safety and address
             any concerns they may have related to no longer taking steroids .

          4. Systemic steroid therapy within 6 weeks of Day 0

          5. Patients who have received intraocular anti-VEGF medications within 1 year of

          7. Presence of other retinal vascular diseases (diabetic retinopathy, vein occlusion)
             that could affect the VEGF levels within the eye

          8. History of stroke or prior myocardial infarction

          9. Known hypersensitivity to aflibercept

         10. Infectious conjunctivitis, keratitis, or endophthalmitis of either eye

         11. Presence of a glaucoma shunting or filtration device that is subconjunctival

             preceding Day 0

         13. Any clinically significant acute or chronic medical condition that would preclude
             participation in a clinical study

         14. Pregnant or breast-feeding women

         15. Sexually active men* or women of childbearing potential** who are unwilling to
             practice adequate contraception during the study (adequate contraceptive measures
             include stable use of oral contraceptives or other prescription pharmaceutical
             contraceptives for 2 or more menstrual cycles prior to screening; intrauterine device
             [IUD]; bilateral tubal ligation; vasectomy; condom plus contraceptive sponge, foam, or
             jelly, or diaphragm plus contraceptive sponge, foam, or jelly)

         16. History of hyalronidase (HA) injection after the diagnosis of thyroid eye disease
