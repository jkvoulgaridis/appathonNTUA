  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ankle osteoarthritis (AOA) is a typical long-term complication of an ankle injury. Pain
      during walking is the main symptom that limits walking distance. Non-surgical treatments
      could be used to decrease pain. The gold standard treatment for end-stage OA is definitive
      surgical ankle arthrodesis.

      The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of a rigid ankle-foot orthosis
      (R-AFO) for walking pain in a population suffering from AOA.

      This study used the SCED introduction/withdrawal methodology to assess the efficacy of R-AFO
      on pain and walking distance in the 2-minute walk test (2MWT). Each patient is his or her own
      comparator. During phase A, considered as the baseline, the patient performs the 2MWT without
      R-AFO. During phases B, considered as the introduction phases, the patient performs the tests
      with R-AFO. These tests are performed repeatedly and at regular intervals. The time of
      transition between phases has been randomized to have a minimum of 3 trials per phase.

      At the end of each test, an visual analogue scale for the pain and the walking distance
      travelled during the 2MWT were recorded.

    <description>According to the SCED methodology, patients were fitted with ankle foot orthosis intermittently, during 4 phases, in the following order : without orthosis (A1), with orthosis (B1), again without orthosis (A2) and again with orthosis (B2).
All the phases were carried out over one day.</description>
