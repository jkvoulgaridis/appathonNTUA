  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to explore if the valve-gated pump requires less drug to manage
      subject pain than the prior standard peristaltic pump in the same subject. The newly
      implanted valve-gated pump will be programmed to deliver a minimum dose reduction of 20% of
      the same medication that was delivered in the peristaltic pump prior to explant. The drug
      therapy will be evaluated and pain scores will be evaluated over time (3 refill cycles
      prospectively for the valve-gated pump and 6 months retrospectively for the peristaltic
      pump).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will employ a single-blind where study participants will not be told about the
      dose reduction of at least 20% when the valve-gated pump is implanted. A study participant
      has a significant potential to bias when informed they will get less drug with the new pump
      than they were receiving in the old pump this could subjectively affect pain scores as well.
      After valve-gated pump implant and dose reduction, the appropriate pain therapy will be
      provided to adequately address pain management in the opinion of the study investigator using
      standard of care processes and VAS scores.

      Once subjects have been implanted with the valve-gated pump they will be started on a minimum
      20% dose reduction (same medications and concentrations prior to explant). If at any time
      during the subjects' treatment it is determined by the investigator that the subjects'
      treatment dose needs to be increased, the dose can be increased in increments not to exceed
      5% (no change to concentration) based on VAS scores at current and last visits.
