  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to survey a sample of adults who have recently made a decision
      about treatment of high cholesterol or high blood pressure or a decision about screening for
      colorectal cancer, breast cancer, or prostate cancer. The main goal is to gather evidence of
      the validity and reliability of the Shared Decision Making Process scale. Secondary goal is
      to gather evidence on the quality of decisions for these common medical situations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study staff worked with a national sampling firm to recruit subjects for five different
      medical decisions. The five decisions are (1) treatment of high cholesterol, (2) treatment of
      high blood pressure (3) when to start breast cancer screening (4) whether or not to have
      prostate cancer screening and (5) which test to have for colorectal cancer screening.
      Respondents complete a survey about their experiences talking with health care providers
      about the specific clinical decision. The survey measured the amount of shared decision
      making, knowledge, preferences, decisional conflict and decision regret. The study will
      obtain 500 responses total, or 100 for each decision.

      Sample is an online non-probability panel of adults living in the United States. In the
      survey, participants were screened to meet specific qualifications. After 1 week, a random
      selection of 50 respondents are invited to complete the retest instrument.

      All analyses will be conducted separately for each group, and results may be pooled across
      cancer screening and medication contexts. First, study staff will examine the descriptives
      for the Shared Decision Making Process items. Study staff will also test several hypotheses
      to examine validity of the scores such as whether higher shared decision making process
      scores are associated with less decisional conflict and less regret. Staff will also examine
      retest reliability of the Shared Decision Making Process scale.
