    <textblock>
      Rollover study designed to evaluate long-term safety in subjects with metastatic solid tumors
      that are benefiting from continued treatment with sacituzumab govitecan.

      Patients currently receiving, clinically benefiting from, and tolerating sacituzumab
      govitecan in an Immunomedics-sponsored parent study planned for closure will be considered
      for enrollment.

      This is an open-label, longitudinal cohort, rollover study. Eligible participants will
      receive sacituzumab govitecan therapy at the dose they were receiving in the parent study. No
      participant will receive more than 10 mg/kg dose of sacituzumab govitecan. Treatment with
      sacituzumab govitecan will be uninterrupted as eligible participants rollover/transition from
      the parent study to the rollover study. Participants may continue to receive sacituzumab
      govitecan until they experience toxicity, disease progression, loss of clinical benefit, lost
      to follow-up, or upon participant withdrawal of consent or Sponsor termination of the study.

          -  Experienced a toxicity from sacituzumab govitecan that resulted in permanent
             discontinuation of therapy

          -  Have other concurrent medical or psychiatric conditions that, in the Investigator's
             opinion, may be likely to confound study interpretation or prevent completion of study
