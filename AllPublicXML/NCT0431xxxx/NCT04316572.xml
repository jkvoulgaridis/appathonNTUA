  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Even in Western health care systems, most people with mental disorders, including those with
      severe and chronic disorders, are treated solely by their general practitioner (GP). Notably,
      the accessibility of mental health specialist care is mainly complicated by (a) long waiting
      times for specialists, (b) long travel distances to specialists, particularly in rural and
      remote areas, (c) patients' reservations about mental health specialist care (including fear
      of being stigmatised by seeking such care). To mitigate those barriers, technology-based
      integrated care models have been proposed. The purpose of this study is to measure the
      effectiveness of a mental health specialist video consultations model versus treatment as
      usual in patients with depression or anxiety disorders in primary care. In an individually
      randomized, prospective, two-arm superiority study with parallel group design, N = 320
      patients with anxiety and/or depressive disorder will be recruited in GP practices.

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure the effectiveness of a mental health specialist video
      consultations model versus treatment as usual in patients with depression or anxiety
      disorders in primary care. In total, the investigators plan to enrol 320 patients who will be
      randomly allocated to the experimental condition (mental health specialist video
      consultations) or the control condition (treatment as usual from their GP) in a 1:1 ratio.
      General practitioners will recruit patients during their regular clinic hours. If the patient
      is interested in participation, the patient will receive the informed consent form and the
      baseline questionnaire from the GP. The practice team will send the patient's contact details
      to the study team who will screen the patient with respect to the eligibility criteria.

      Patients will be randomly allocated to one of the two study conditions (video consultation
      model vs. treatment-as-usual, TAU) in a 1:1 ratio by central randomisation.

      The evaluation of the primary outcome will be performed according to the intention-to-treat
      principle.

      The health economic evaluation will be carried out from the perspective of society. A
      cost-effectiveness and a cost-utility analysis will be carried out.

Session 3-4: Focused brief interventions e.g. psychoeducation, promotion of social resources, activation of health-promoting lifestyles (sleep hygiene, eating diary, relaxation etc.), work on personal problems and, if necessary, initiation of further specialised treatment.
Session 5: Ending the intervention, stabilisation, subsequent treatment plan and communicating a case summary to the general practitioner</description>
