  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates safety and efficacy of the use of audiovisual consultations of
      emergency medical service (EMS) doctor by paramedics for low urgency events in areas covered
      with paramedic crews only from emergency medical service stations with distant access to
      hospital.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be realized on Karlovy Vary EMS areas covered with paramedic crews only from
      emergency medical service stations with distant access to hospital. Each call on emergency
      line during 6 weeks study period will be assessed for eligibility. If deemed as low urgency,
      the event will be randomised into 3 groups. CONTROL group: routine operation of paramedic
      crew with optional consultation with a doctor over the phone. In the PHONE group and in the
      VIDEO group, there will be a mandatory consultation of a doctor over the phone or by
      audiovisual constultation, respectively. The primary outcome of the study is the percent of
      patients treated on site without the need of hospital transfer. The secondary safety outcome
      is to evaluate repeated ambulance trips within 48 hours after the patient had been treated at
      home. Moreover, a qualitative analysis of subjective perception of the event by the patients,
      paramedic and consulting doctor using the Likert scales will be performed by survey at the
      end or immediately after the event.

    <intervention_model_description>Low urgency emergency calls are randomised by call-taker of dispatching center to 3 groups: routine prehospital emergency care without optional phone call consultation (1), with mandatory phone call consultation with base physician (2), with mandatory audivisual consultation with base physician (3). Power analysis. Based on available data prior to the initiation of the study, 10% of patients after low acuity calls were treated on site. The hypothesis that the video consult would lead to doubling this percentage will be investigated. In order to have 80% probability to confirm this at p &lt; 0.05, we would need 200 subjects per group. Planned interim analysis will be after 4 weeks of study (aprox. after 600 eligible cases) .</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Based on Karlovy Vary EMS audit data, there is 10% of low urgency cases treated and left on site by paramedics so far. So the primary outcome is to evaluate the rate of non-transports in common daily routine, when the doctor provides phone call consultation on request of paramedics (based on Karlovy Vary EMS protocol) to mandatory phone call consultation and audiovisual consultation with a EMS doctor. Therefore, the primary objective is to evaluate potential benefit audiovisual consultation with EMS doctor on the rate of patients left at home after treatment on site by paramedics.</description>

    <time_frame>until 200 cases per group are collected, estimated time 6-8 weeks from the beginning of the study</time_frame>
    <description>This analysis of subjective perception of each event in all 3 groups will be evaluated. The inevstigators will use Likert scales (1-excellent, 2-good, 3-sufficient, 4-insufficient) to compare phone and audivisual consultation in following parameters: clinical information transfer, situational context, safety of care. Surveys have to be filled and the patient opinion should be asked at the and of an transport or befere the crew leaves the patient on site. The EMS doctor will fill the survey immediately after the phone or audiovisual consultation is provided.</description>

             site),

          2. the case is determined for and will be served by one of 11 for study dedicated of
             total 19 paramedic crews in Karlovy Vary EMS,

          3. dedicated doctor of Karlovy Vary EMS will be available for consultation during his
             shift.

        Exclusion criteria are:
