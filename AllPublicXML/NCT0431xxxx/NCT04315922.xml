  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preclinical research has established a convincing connection between changes in the gut
      microbiota composition and stroke outcome. However clinical data on the gut-brain axis, and
      its chronic characteristics, is sparse. Additional investigations in the context of ischemic
      stroke regarding the relationship between dysbiosis and functional changes of the microbiome,
      as characterized by the metabolome, are still required. The StrokeMicroBiomics study will
      offer insight into these mechanisms and offer new potential targets for therapeutic
      interventions.

      The primary objective is the characterisation of gut dysbiosis in ischemic stroke patients in
      the acute phase after stroke and during a 3 month follow-up period.

      The secondary objectives include the identification of dysregulated gut microbiome
      metabolites and key immune cell populations in addition to the clinical progression of the
      study participants during the 3 month follow-up period after disease onset.

    <textblock>
      Results of experimental, preclinical studies suggest that microbiome-targeted may improve
      stroke outcome as well as stroke-related comorbidities. Yet, clinical trials describing the
      extent and time course of microbiome changes after stroke are currently not available.
      Moreover, the impact of post-stroke dysbiosis on metabolic changes and the systemic immunity
      are unexplored.

      Therefore, the primary objective of this trial is the characterization of gut dysbiosis
      progression in ischemic stroke patients during a 3 month follow-up period .

      The secondary objectives include the identification of dysregulated gut microbiome
      metabolites and key immune cell populations in addition to the clinical progression of the
      study participants during the 3 month follow-up period after disease onset.

      In order to elucidate the differential impact of lesion size on immune and microbiome
      homeostasis, separate patient cohorts with mild and severe stroke will be studied.

      Furthermore, to control for the effects of temporary focal neurological deficits and stress
      induced microbiome and immune changes, patients with stroke mimics and transient ischemic
      attacks (TIA) are being recruited to the control group.
