    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical study is to answer the questions:

        1. Is the proposed intervention safe?

        2. Is the proposed intervention effective in improving the health of subjects with aging
           frailty?

    <textblock>
      Aging frailty is a clinical syndrome, characterized by a decrease of homeostatic reserves and
      enhanced vulnerability to endogenous or exogenous stressors, exposing individuals to an
      increased risk of adverse health-related outcomes. The human umbilical cord (HUC) is a
      promising source of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), compared to embryonic stem cells, HUC-MSCs
      are noncontroversial with a painless collection procedure and faster self-renewal properties.
      HUC-MSCs can differentiate into the different germ layers and modulate immune responses. One
      possible mechanism for the onset and development of aging frailty is the depletion of stem
      cells. Hence, intravenous infusion of HUC-MSCs is attractive therapy against aging frailty.

      This is a randomized, multicenter,double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. The
      participants from two centers (n = 30) will be randomly distributed into two groups. The
      HUC-MSCs Group (n = 15) will receive intravenous infusion of mesenchymal stem cells (80
      Million) twice over a month (30 days interval), the Control Group (n = 15) will receive the
      same protocolized intervention with normal saline. Follow-up duration is 6 months after first
      intervention. The reported serious adverse events（SAEs）will be observed within one month post
      infusion. The short-item from health survey（SF-36), EuroQol five dimensions questionnaire
      (EQ-5D) and Fried phenotype scale will be evaluated. Short physical performance battery
      (SPPB) and plasm biomarkers will be assessed.The assessments will be performed at baseline, 3
      months and 6 months.

      The intent of this study is to explore domains of efficacy of HUC-MSCs through the reduction
      of signs and symptoms of aging frailty and to evaluate the safety of HUC-MSCs in subjects
      with aging frailty.

    <description>Safety were assessed by incidence of reported serious adverse events (SAEs) within one month after infusion. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that:
Results in death
Is life-threatening (stroke or non-fatal pulmonary embolism, etc.)
Requires inpatients hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization
Results in clinically significant abnormal laboratory test results or abnormal vital signs, based on clinical judgment.</description>

    <description>Difference in rate of decline of Frailty assessed using Fried phenotype scale:
Slowing of Mobility (assessed via a 4-meter gait speed test; Timed up and go (TUG) test and Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) assessment)
Weight Loss (assessed via weighing scale)
Reduced Activity (assessed via Minnesota Leisure Time Activities (MLTA) questionnaire)
Diminished handgrip strength (assessed via dynamometer)
Exhaustion (assessed by two items from the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression, CES-D):&quot; I felt that everything I did was an effort? and I could not get going.&quot;</description>
