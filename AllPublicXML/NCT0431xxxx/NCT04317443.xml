  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ESWL and PNL are the two treatment modalities for kidney stones greater than 20 mm in the
      pediatric population. ESWL is non-invasive, does not require anesthesia and inexpensive, but
      its success rate may be lower, and require multiple treatment sessions. On the contrary, PNL
      has a higher success rate, does not require multiple sessions but is an invasive method.
      Compared to standard PNL, miniaturized PNL systems have been shown to decrease complications
      with comparable success rates. SMP is a unique miniaturized PNL system with integrated active
      irrigation and suction systems. The current literature lacks studies comparing SMP and ESWL
      prospectively in the pediatric population. In this study, the effectiveness, reliability, and
      reusability of ESWL and SMP will be compared.

      To compare the success and complication rates of super-mini-percutaneous nephrolithotomy
      (SMP) and Extracorporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy (ESWL) for the treatment of renal stones ≥20
      mm in children.An international multicentre, prospective, observational study. Pediatric
      cases with renal Stones ≥20 mm who undergo ESWL or SMP will be evaluated and compared
      proespectively. The total number of departments planned to be included in the study is 10 and
      the number of cases is 180.

    <description>SMP will be performed under general anesthesia in prone/supine position. Renal puncture will be performed under ultrasound/fluoroscopy guidance based on the preference of the participating surgeon. Tracts will be dilated to 14 Fr. Stone fragmentation will be performed with holmium laser and fragments will be extracted with the active suction system. For the exit strategy, placement of a nephrostomy tube or JJ stent will be decided by the participating surgeon.</description>

    <description>ESWL will be performed under sedation/analgesia, shock wave lithotripsy parameters will be determined based on the device and the settings of local center. For patients requiring multiple sessions, maximum 3 (or more) sessions will be allowed. Ureteral stenting prior to ESWL will be performed based on the decision of the participating center.</description>
