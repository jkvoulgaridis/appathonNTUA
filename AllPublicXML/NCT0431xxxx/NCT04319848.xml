      Assessment of safety and efficacy of tissue-engineered corneal endothelial graft material
      generated using cultured human corneal endothelial cells for tissue-engineered endothelial
      keratoplasty (TE-EK).

      The specific aim of this clinical trial is to assess the clinical efficacy and safety
      outcomes of patients receiving Tissue-Engineered Endothelial keratoplasty (TE-EK) graft
      material generated from human corneal endothelial cells (HCEnCs) propagated in a
      regulatory-approved dual media approach. Post-operative follow-ups and visits will follow
      current EK protocols of Singapore National Eye Centre. Clinical assessments include
      postoperative visual acuity, intraocular pressure, keratometric astigmatism, spherical
      equivalent, endothelial cell density, anterior segment optical coherence tomography (ASOCT),
      contrast sensitivity, as well as any postoperative complications such as graft dislocation or
      primary graft failure.

    <description>The TE-EK surgery will be performed by the Principle Investigator with a standard DSAEK technique. The PI has performed over 300, EK surgeries and we have previously shown that the corneal endothelial loss rates from the PI are 16% at 1 year with a primary graft failure rates of &lt;1.5%. A patient's participation in the study or not will not change the treatment strategy in any manner.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients who have mild to moderate corneal endothelial decompensation or bullous
        keratopathy, but with minimal corneal stromal scarring resulting from a variety of
        conditions including:

          -  Fuchs' endothelial dystrophy

          -  Post-surgical corneal decompensation (irreversible) - all forms of pseudophakic or
             aphakic bullous keratopathy

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Severe forms or late stage presentation of corneal decompensation with severe corneal
             stromal scarring, unsuitable for TE-EK surgery as opposed to penetrating keratoplasty

          -  Patients with complex anterior segment complications precluding a successful TE-EK
             procedure

          -  Patients who have other forms of endothelial dystrophy, traumatic corneal
             decompensation, or post-inflammatory corneal decompensation

          -  Post-laser iridotomy or glaucoma related corneal decompensation

          -  Patients not keen to participate in the clinical trial

          -  Patients who are below 21 years of age or above 80 years of age
