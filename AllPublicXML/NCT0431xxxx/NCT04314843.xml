      The primary objectives of this study are:

      Phase 1: To evaluate the safety of sequenced therapy with lenzilumab and axicabtagene
      ciloleucel in participants with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma and identify the
      most appropriate dose of lenzilumab for Phase 2.

      Phase 2: To evaluate the incidence of neurologic events with sequenced therapy given at the
      recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of lenzilumab in participants with relapsed or refractory
      large B-cell lymphoma.
