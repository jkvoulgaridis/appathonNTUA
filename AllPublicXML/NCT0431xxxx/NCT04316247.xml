    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is one of the most common malignancies in females, which is the second leading
      cause of cancer death throughout the world after lung cancer . The incidence of breast cancer
      has been increasing over the past decades , especially in young women (≤ 35 years old). There
      is approximately 182,000 women with breast neoplasm annually in the United States, accounting
      for about 26% of all incident cancers among women.

      In Asia, the morbidity rate is as high as 9.5%-12% . Even worse in China, the average onset
      age of breast cancer might be 8-10 years younger than that in Western countries which account
      for upto 4% in total breast cancer patients .

      In Egypt, breast cancer is the commonest type of female malignancy represented about 38.8%
      among common cancer sites in females.Although The unclear etiology of the majority of breast
      cancer, but there are numerous risk factors for the disease. Screening and early detection
      when combined with adequate, efficient treatment is considered the hope for a reduction of
      mortality in breast cancer as postulated by World Health organization (WHO).
