  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-centered, three-armed, randomized, double-blinded, controlled study,
      namely, the oral trial drug favipiravir tablets plus chloroquine phosphatetablets tablets
      group (combined group), the oral trial drug favipiravir tablets group (pirovir group), and
      the oral placebo treatment group (control group). The total number of enrolled cases in this
      study was set at 150.

      During the treatment, the clinical data of the subjects were collected, the changes of viral
      load and biochemical indicators were detected, and the outcome of the subjects was monitored.

      The main indicators of efficacy include improvement or recovery of respiratory symptoms and
      viral nucleic acid shedding. The rate of progression to severe disease, duration of fever,
      peripheral blood index and improvement time of pulmonary imaging were the secondary
      indicators to evaluate the efficacy.

      Statistical analysis was performed at the middle and final stages of the study to evaluate
      the efficacy and safety of favipiravir tablets combined with chloroquine phosphatetablets
      tablets in the treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia.
