  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-arm randomized, controlled trial during the postoperative period after major
      abdominal surgery for cancer, including for example radical cystectomy, nephrectomy,
      colectomy, comparing a control group that uses a wearable device to track physical activity
      to an intervention group that uses the same wearable devices and receives a supportive social
      incentive-based gamification intervention to adhere to a step goal program.

    <description>At the beginning of each week, starting from postoperative day 3, the participant receives 70 points (10 points for each day that week). If the participant does not meet their daily step goal, they lose 10 points from their balance. This leverages loss aversion, which has been demonstrated to motivate behavior change more effectively with losses than gains. At the end of each week if the participant has at least 40 points, they will move up a level (levels from lowest to highest: blue, bronze, silver, gold, platinum). If not, the participant will drop a level. All participants begin at the silver level. Each week, participants get a fresh set of 70 points. Participants will receive daily feedback for the step counts, and weekly feedback for their levels. Participants in the intervention arm will be asked to identify a family member or friend to be their support sponsor. A weekly report will be sent to this person with the participant's performance (points and level).</description>
