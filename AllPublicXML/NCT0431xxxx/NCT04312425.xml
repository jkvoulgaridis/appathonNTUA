  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Induction of anesthesia induces a loss of protective upper airway reflexes and is associated
      with gastric content regurgitation. Emergency surgery bears a higher risk of gastric content
      regurgitation because of full stomach, delayed gastric emptying, intestinal obstruction,
      stroke or other factors. Rapid sequence induction (RSI) of anesthesia was recommended to
      minimize the risk of regurgitation and aspiration. Classic RSI scheme mainly includes the use
      of short-acting sedatives and muscle relaxant, together with a manual pressure to the cricoid
      cartilage (Sellick maneuver) which aims at compressing the esophagus to avoid regurgitation.
      Though widely recommended, the scheme has been controversial for years. Our department
      modified the scheme and put it into use in day shift emergency surgery since March 1, 2018.
      This retrospective analysis is aimed at comparing the effect of classic and modified rapid
      sequence induction in prevention of gastric content regurgitation in emergency surgery under
      general anesthesia.
