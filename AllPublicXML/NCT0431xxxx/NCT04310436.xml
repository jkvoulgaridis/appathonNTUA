  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot randomised controlled trial investigating whether using modification of
      saccadic eye movements can control lateral unconscious tongue positioning and enhance fluency
      in adults with a confirmed developmental stammer. This study is being conducted as part of an
      MSc by research qualification at the Institute of Technology Sligo in Ireland with a view to
      extending to PhD. The setting is home setting with all assessments either taking place at
      home via video link or in the institute. The study is being conducted in conjunction with the
      Community Speech and Language Therapist and has attained ethical approval through Sligo
      University Hospital (SUH) Ethics Committee.

      Participants will be assessed for stammering severity either on line via video link or in the
      Institute of Technology Sligo Health Science &amp; Exercise Physiology Lab (B2004) at three time
      points: before intervention, after a five-week trial period and three months post completion.
      Participants will complete two assessments at each time to cater for &quot;off&quot; days. Participants
      will be required to practice quick eye movements at the start of words / syllables where
      dysfluencies are predicted for 10 minutes twice a day for the treatment period. Training in
      eye movement (saccade) modification will occur following the initial assessment in IT Sligo,
      or video link.

      Participants will be assigned to one of two treatment arms. An experimental arm, and a
      control (placebo) arm. All participants will be assessed regarding their premonitory
      awareness of anticipated dysfluencies both before training and at the three month Based on
      advice from Community Speech and language Manager (Ms Sinead Carthy), participants will
      voice/video message the principle investigator once per week for this five-week period to
      confirm compliance.

Outcome assessor was blinded to treatment allocation. Participants Stammering behaviour to be assessed using SSI-4 a reliable validated objective measure of stuttering severity. Participants stammering behaviour is to be recorded via video link or in a separate lab and the assessor will be asked asked not to discuss the technique prescribed given to patients. Even if the patient mentioned the trials they would not discuss the intervention</masking_description>

    <description>Measures the anticipation effect in stuttering. 14 items assessing premonitory awareness of stuttering sensation to assess the individual's capacity, manner and style of anticipation. Each item consists of a 4-point Likert scale ranging from &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;very much&quot;. A higher score indicates a larger anticipation of stuttering by the participant.</description>
