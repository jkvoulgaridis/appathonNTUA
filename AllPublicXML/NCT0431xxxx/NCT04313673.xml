  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sonographically, cervical length measurement is widely used in obstetrics. Studies have
      revealed that early detection of short cervix can be a predictor of predicting preterm labor.
      Transvaginal ultrasonography has been shown as a reference method for the recognition of the
      short cervix, as well as it may be useful in the transabdominal evaluation in the studies
      conducted. In addition to the advantages of transvaginal evaluation, it is time consuming and
      disadvantages of some women during anxiety and discomfort during this procedure.
      Transabdominal ultrasonography, which provides a non-invasive evaluation, is more preferred
      by some patients than transvaginal. The aim of this study is to investigate the value of the
      cervical length measured by transabdominal route, which is a more acceptable method for
      pregnant women, in predicting preterm birth.

      Births that occur before 37th gestational week are an important cause of perinatal morbidity
      and mortality. Preterm birth accounts for about 12% of all births. Early screening and
      correct management of pregnant women at risk of preterm birth is essential in reducing
      perinatal mortality and morbidity associated with prematurity. But the precise prediction and
      prevention of preterm birth is still an important research topic.
