  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate association between mutational load (ML) from esophageal biopsy specimens in
      pre-endoscopic eradication therapy (EET) in Barrett's Esophagus (BE) or Intramucosal
      adenocarcinoma (IMC) patients and treatment resistance (treatment resistance will be defined
      as disease recurrence and/or need for additional intervention such as increased acid
      suppression, need for anti-reflux surgery, or use of alternate ablative modality).

      Potential subjects will be identified via protocol and Institutional Review Board (IRB)
      methods prior to obtaining written informed consent. Once written informed consent is
      obtained, subjects will continue with planned routine care upper endoscopy. During the first
      study visit an upper endoscopy will be performed. At this visit, research specimens will be
      obtained for mutational load (ML) analysis and gastroenterologist (GI) pathologist diagnosis
      for the presence of adenocarcinoma or degrees of dysplasia. ML will be correlated to the
      pathology diagnosis on this research biopsy. Subjects will then undergo EET per routine
      standard of care at the treating institution until CEIM achieved. Subjects will be followed
      (data collection only) during treatment period until CEIM is achieved. After subjects reach
      CEIM, four additional research biopsies will be collected, from the midpoint of previous BE
      site.

    <intervention_model_description>Subjects will undergo a standard of care (SOC) esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). At this visit, research biopsies will be obtained - 4 research biopsies at the midpoint of current Barrett's Esophagus (BE) OR slides will be cut from clinical Endoscopic Mucosal Resection (EMR). Slides will be analyzed for mutational load (ML) analysis and gastroenterologist (GI) pathologist diagnosis for the presence of adenocarcinoma or degrees of dysplasia. ML will be correlated to the pathology diagnosis on this research biopsy. Subjects will then undergo (Endoscopic Eradication Therapy) EET per routine standard of care at the treating institution until Complete Eradication of Intestinal Metaplasia (CEIM) is achieved. Subjects will be followed (data collection only) during treatment period until CEIM is achieved. After subjects reach CEIM, four additional research biopsies will be collected, from the midpoint of previous BE site.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Treatment resistance will be assessed as a dichotomous variable and defined as those with one or more of the following features: disease recurrence, need for increased acid suppression, need for anti-reflux surgery, or use of alternate ablative modality. The association between pre-EET ML and treatment resistance will be calculated using the difference between the two mean ML values.</description>

    <description>Subjects will undergo standard of care (SOC) standard esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) for the treatment of their condition (BE or IMC). Four (4) research biopsies will be taken from the midpoint of current disease. In cases where EMR (Endoscopic Mucosal Resection) is performed clinically, no research biopsies will be taken. Following CEIM, four (4) additional research biopsies will be collected, from the midpoint of previous BE site.
