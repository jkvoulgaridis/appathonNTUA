  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to explore the ability of Oral activated charcoal to adsorb uremic toxins
      limiting the progression of chronic kidney disease and delaying the need for hemodialysis in
      patients with CKD stages III and IV.

      To compare its effect with the effect of dry seeds as absorbents of uremic toxins

    <textblock>
      In recent years, chronic kidney disease(CKD) has become a worldwide public health issue.

      The main factors affecting the prognosis of patients with chronic kidney disease are its
      complications, including cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, malnutrition,
      inflammation, atherosclerosis syndrome, and anemia.

      The accumulation of uremic toxins, such as indoxyl sulfate and p-cresyl sulfate, is
      implicated in the progression of renal failure and cardiovascular disease.

      For many patients, chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a progressive condition marked by
      deteriorating renal function ultimately leading to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and many
      patients refuse to start chronic hemodialysis.

      Therapeutic approaches that decrease the level of uremic toxins are a rational method for
      inhibiting this progression.

      Many researches have been done aiming to find alternatives for chronic hemodialysis either
      for economic issues or psychological issues especially in elderly patients, as example:

        -  Gum Arabic in the remedy and amelioration of kidney dysfunction and end-stage renal
           disease

        -  skin as excretory root for urea, increasing sweat from sweat glands can support kidney
           function by excreting a good amount of what kidneys naturally excrete.

        -  The oral charcoal adsorbent reduces serum levels of indoxyl sulfate through adsorption
           of indole converted from dietary tryptophan in the gastrointestinal tract decreasing
           serum creatinine and urea level .

      In this study, the clinical data supporting the role of oral activated charcoal in a dose of
      30gm/ day for slowing the progression of CKD will be reviewed.

      In this study, a trial will be done using dry seeds (lentils as an example) as an absorbent
      for uremic toxins comparing its effect with the effect of oral activated charcoal.
