  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer (PC) has a dismal prognosis. Approximately 10% of PC patients carry a
      germline pathogenic variant in a cancer susceptibility gene, whose identification can lead to
      better treatments for the patient and participation in cancer prevention programs for their
      family members. Conventional genetic testing for PC patients is based on the family history
      of cancer, and may take up to six months from the point of meeting with the treating
      physician to receiving the results from a genetic counsellor. The median overall survival for
      these patients is 6 - 12 months, which may prevent them from having the genetic testing in
      the first place, or from receiving further targeted treatments. Patients with PC need a more
      comprehensive knowledge of their disease for better treatment planning. This includes genetic
      testing in absence of family history of cancer.

      The investigators designed a one year study to assess the feasibility of medical oncologist
      initiated cancer genetic testing for all newly diagnosed PC patients unselected by family
      history.

      For patients with negative genetic testing, no further testing will be ordered after the
      disclosure of results. Patients with positive genetic testing results will be informed and
      referred to Cancer Genetics Clinic. The investigators expect to enroll 100 patients in 1
      year. Patients will be asked to complete satisfaction questionnaires according to the
      Satisfaction with Genetic Counseling Scale in multiple time points (pre-testing,
      post-testing, at 6 months and at 12 months). Designated oncologists will be asked to evaluate
      the process using the Oncologist Satisfaction Survey after every five counseled patients.

      Three primary objectives will include 1) assessment of the turnaround time for genetic
      testing results; 2) assessment of patient satisfaction; 3) assessment of oncologist's
      satisfaction. Secondary objectives will include assessment of association between genetic
      testing results and types of treatment and overall survival.
