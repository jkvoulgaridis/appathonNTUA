  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mood disorders including bipolar disorder and depression are common disabling disorders with
      depression affecting 11.2 to 16.0% of the general population and the lifetime prevalence of
      bipolar disorders at an estimated 4.4%. Although treatment with antidepressants medications
      is common and effective in some patients, 42.7% of patients show inadequate response to
      treatment with antidepressants and a large proportion (55.3%) continue to have ongoing
      depressive symptoms. Psychological and behavioural interventions such as cognitive
      behavioural therapy (CBT) and behavioural activation (BA) are effective treatment for
      depression alone or in combination with antidepressants. Depression can also occur in the
      context of bipolar disorder which is characterized by recurrent episodes of depression and
      mania (DSM-5). The depressive episodes within bipolar disorder may be similar to depressive
      disorder, however the management of these episodes is fraught with the challenge that
      antidepressant pharmacotherapy may precipitate manic episodes and lead to further
      destabilization of bipolar disorder. Therefore, an alternative to antidepressants and
      additional therapies are needed to support patients' recovery and mood stability, as well as
      to achieve better treatment response and remission. BA is not currently available in a
      structured format and has not been tested for its effectiveness in bipolar disorders in a
      specialized hospital-based program. The evidence for BA has been investigated in depression
      however the evidence for bipolar disorder is lacking, therefore this study aims to assess the
      effectiveness of BA as treatment for bipolar disorder.

      This study is a pragmatic randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness of
      behavioural activation in bipolar disorder. The pragmatic randomized controlled trial study
      design is a parallel 1:1 allocation comparing behavioural activation plus treatment as usual
      to waitlist control group plus treatment as usual. For this study the investigators will
      adopt the following principals simulating naturalistic real life clinical setting to test the
      study question based on the pragmatic design:

      No restrictive inclusion criteria will be used. Adults with bipolar disorder will be asked to
      participate in this study Clinicians will deliver the BA program to participants randomized
      to receive the intervention The intervention will be an add-on to treatment as usual The
      comparison group will receive treatment as usual that may include medications, CBT and other
      therapies as required and decided by their clinical care The primary outcome is clinically
      relevant (improvement in depressive and manic symptoms)

      Both the intervention and control groups will be assessed as intention to treat analysis with
      no measures to improve adherence to the study intervention or the comparator.

      Patients with a diagnosis of bipolar disorders attending the mood disorders clinic, referred
      for assessment of bipolar disorder at the clinic or referred from community or other hospital
      services to the mood disorders clinic will be approached for participation in the study. In
      addition, family practices in the community will be informed of the study and asked to refer
      directly to the trial. Following initial screening for eligibility, potential participants
      will be asked to provide written informed consent prior to any study related procedures.

      The investigators will employ a parallel group design to evaluate the effects of behavioural
      activation intervention to improve bipolar disorder-related outcomes. Eligible and consenting
      patients will be randomly allocated to the intervention or control arms using a 1:1
      allocation ratio. Allocations will be generated using the computerized system. The
      randomization will use a block randomization system of block sizes of 2, 4 and 6. Allocation
      will be conducted by a research personnel who is not a clinician and will not know the
      participant clinical status to maintain allocation concealment.

      This trial is an open label trial as blinding is not possible for participants (behavioural
      activation intervention) or the clinician administering the intervention.

    <description>The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) is administered to measure the effectiveness of BA on depressive symptoms. Items in the BDI are scored on a scale of 0-63, where 63 is the maximum score and higher scores are associated with more severe symptoms.</description>

    <description>Quality of Life, as measured by the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire - Short Form (Q-LES-Q-SF), Short-Form 12 Health Survey (SF-12), and the Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS). The Q-LES-Q-SF is a 14-item questionnaire scored between 0% and 100%, where higher percentages are indicative of a higher QOL. WSAS scores items between 0 (indicating no impairment) and 8 (indicating severe impairment); total scores greater than 20 indicate severe psychopathology and symptomology. The SF-12 generates two summary scores, the physical component score (PCS) and the mental component score (MCS); scores range between 0 and 100, where 100 is associated with the highest level of health state.</description>

Each of 5 items are scored between 0 to 4; the maximum score of the EQ-5D-5L is 1, with higher scores being associated with poorer health.</description>
