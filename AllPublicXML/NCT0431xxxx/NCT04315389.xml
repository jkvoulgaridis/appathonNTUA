  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Robots are commonly used in many settings to help with transportation needs, reduce human
      injuries, and assisting clinicians during surgeries. These applications could provide direct
      benefits to patients in the clinical rehabilitation field.

      In this study, the feasibility of 2 CARE robot prototypes in facilitating dependent transfers
      and assisting patient mobility in their daily living activities will be studied.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An exploratory proof of concept study involving the development and usability of 2 CARE robot
      prototypes will be validated in a hospital environment, in a broad range of patients.

      The findings from this study will then be used to further refine and develop the robot
      prototypes for future deployment in other hospitals, nursing homes and homes.
