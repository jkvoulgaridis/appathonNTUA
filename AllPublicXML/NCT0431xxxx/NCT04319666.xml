    <textblock>
      The IVL Left Main study is a prospective non-randomised pilot study to investigate the
      mechanical and procedural outcomes and safety of distal left main stenting with coronary
      lithotripsy in addition to standard techniques in patients with calcific left main disease
      and a clinical indication for revascularisation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is ≥ 18 years old.

          -  Unprotected distal LM (or equivalent) disease defined as:

               1. &gt;70% diameter stenosis (DS) on angiography in the distal LM; or

               2. ≥50% DS in the distal LM with a) non-invasive evidence of ischaemia referable to
                  a hemodynamically significant left main lesion, and/or b) FFR ≤0.80; or

               3. &gt;70% diameter stenosis in either the ostial left anterior descending (LAD) or
                  ostial left circumflex (LCX) that is within 10 mm of the ostium and requires
                  stenting back into the LM (distal LM equivalent); or

               4. &gt;50% diameter stenosis in either the ostial left anterior descending (LAD) or
                  ostial left circumflex (LCX) that is within 10 mm of the ostium and requires
                  stenting back into the LM (distal LM equivalent) with a) non-invasive evidence of
                  ischaemia referable to its myocardial territory and/or b) FFR ≤0.80

          -  Clinical indication for revascularisation by PCI

          -  Viability of the treatment vessel as determined by echocardiography, cardiac MRI or
             other equivalent imaging modality.

          -  ≥ 270° arc of calcification within at least one stenotic segment demonstrated on
             intravascular imaging.

          -  Ability to pass a 0.014&quot; guide wire across the lesion.

          -  Ability to provide informed consent and comply with all study procedures, including
             follow-up at 30 days.

          -  Lesions not related to the distal LM requiring PCI can be treated:

               1. at the time of the study procedure if completed prior to distal LM PCI and the
                  procedure was successful and uncomplicated (defined as a final lesion
                  angiographic diameter stenosis &lt;30% and TIMI 3 flow (visually assessed) for all
                  non-target lesions and vessels without perforation, cardiac arrest or need for
                  defibrillation or cardioversion or hypotension/heart failure requiring mechanical
                  or intravenous hemodynamic support or intubation. In situations where the distal
                  LM lesion is critical, the LM can be ballooned or treated first so long as the
                  study protocol is not deviated.

               2. as a staged procedure either within the same hospital admission or within 30
                  days. Any staged procedure must be declared at the index procedure otherwise it
                  will be recorded as an event.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is participating in another research study involving an investigational agent
             (pharmaceutical, biologic, or medical device) that has not reached the primary
             endpoint.

          -  Daughter vessel reference diameter &lt; 2.5 mm.

             device.

          -  Evidence of aneurysm in target vessel within 10 mm of the target lesion.

          -  Prior PCI of the LM or PCI of the proximal LAD or proximal LCX within 10 mm of the
             ostium.

          -  Prior coronary artery by-pass graft (CABG) surgery.

          -  Untreated pre-procedural haemoglobin &lt; 8 g/dL.

          -  Renal failure with serum creatinine &gt; 2.5 mg/dL and not on chronic dialysis.

          -  Uncontrolled diabetes defined as a HbA1c &gt;10%.

          -  Coagulopathy manifested by platelet count &lt; 50,000/ mL or International Normalized
             ratio (INR) &gt; 1.7 (INR is only required in patients who have taken warfarin within 2
             weeks of enrolment).

          -  Cardiogenic shock.

          -  Ongoing ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).

          -  History of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within 3 months.

          -  NYHA class IV heart failure or LVEF &lt; 20%.

          -  Patients with a life expectancy of less than 1 year.

          -  Visible thrombus (by angiography) at target lesion site.

          -  Patient has active systemic infection on the day of the index procedure with either
             fever or requiring intravenous antibiotics.

          -  Patient has vascular connective tissue disease (e.g. Marfan's syndrome).

          -  Patient has a hypercoagulable disorder.

          -  Patient has allergy to imaging contrast media for which they cannot be pre-medicated.

          -  Allergy to Aspirin.

          -  Allergy to Clopidogrel, Ticagrelor and Prasugrel.

          -  Allergy to any component of the drug eluting stent that is planned for use.

          -  Patient has any other severe comorbidity that is felt to preclude enrolment by the
             investigator.

          -  Subject is pregnant or nursing (a negative pregnancy test is required for women of
             child-bearing potential within 7 days prior to enrolment).
