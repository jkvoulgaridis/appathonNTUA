  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The 2010 Child Nutrition Reauthorization provided funding to test innovative strategies to
      end childhood hunger and food insecurity. Demonstration projects were funded in Chickasaw
      Nation, Kentucky, Navajo Nation, Nevada, and Virginia. This study focuses on Chickasaw Nation
      and the diet quality of child participants.

      School districts were matched, and then one was randomly assigned to either a treatment
      (n=20) or control group (n=20). Treatment households received one food box per eligible
      child, per month, delivered to the household, which contained (1) shelf-stable foods,
      including 6 protein-rich items, 2 dairy items, 4 grain foods, 4 cans of fruit, and 12 cans of
      vegetables; (2) a nutrition education handout (e.g., a recipe); and (3) a $15 Fresh Check for
      frozen or fresh fruits and vegetables that participants could redeem at any of 38 Special
      Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC)-authorized stores or
      farmers' markets in the study counties. Control households did not receive the treatment
      benefits but still could participate in other available nutrition assistance programs.

      Objective: To reduce childhood food insecurity and hunger, increase families' consumption of
      nutritious foods, increase the diversity of foods in the home, and ultimately improve diet
      quality and well-being among children.

      Target Population: 40 school districts (115 schools) in 12 counties within the Chickasaw
      Nation territory in Oklahoma. Within these districts, households with school-age children
      (both Native American and non-Native American) who were eligible for free school meals or
      attended a school that participated in the community eligibility provision were eligible to
      participate in the project.

      Intervention School districts were matched, and then one was randomly assigned to either a
      treatment (n=20) or control group (n=20). Treatment households received one food box per
      eligible child, per month, delivered to the household, which contained (1) shelf-stable
      foods, including 6 protein-rich items, 2 dairy items, 4 grain foods, 4 cans of fruit, and 12
      cans of vegetables; (2) a nutrition education handout (e.g., a recipe); and (3) a $15 Fresh
      Check for frozen or fresh fruits and vegetables that participants could redeem at any of 38
      Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC)-authorized
      stores or farmers' markets in the study counties. Control households did not receive the
      treatment benefits but still could participate in other available nutrition assistance
      programs.

    <description>The dietary measures used the food frequency questions developed for the 2009-2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) Dietary Screener Questionnaire. For these questions, parents or guardians were asked how often (per day, per week, or per month) a randomly selected child (age 2 or older) in the household consumed food and beverages from 19 categories during the last 30 days.
The National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) Dietary Screener Questionnaire data processing and scoring procedures were used to convert parent and caregiver reports of their child's daily, weekly, and monthly consumption into standardized daily amounts. Higher scores indicate higher consumption of the food item.</description>
