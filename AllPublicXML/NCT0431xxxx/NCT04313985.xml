  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to apply Avazzia micro-current stimulation to patients with
      chronic, non-healing wounds to determine if this therapy is effective in perfusion and
      bacterial measurements.

      Investigators hope to learn if micro-current stimulation to a chronic, non-healing wound can
      be lead to healing. Perfusion studies and bacterial measurements will be assessed before and
      after treatment on this cross-over study.

      Avazzia microcurrent stimulation was applied to patients with chronic, non-healing wounds in
      Malaysia and was presented at the international wound conference. In 2015 a poster
      presentation was presented with a 10-patient case series, and in August 2016, a presentation
      was made by Dr. Nair, keynote speaker about his 100- patient case series showing that the
      treatment was safe and effective. Dr. Nair followed this study with a 5-patient study looking
      at perfusion images using SPY- LUNA imaging equipment. The 5-patient study looked at
      different methods of applying the therapy.

    <description>Treat the patient's wound area:
Place self-adhesive, conductive electrode pads on either side of the wound on the skin where the pads are not placed in the open wound itself, but rather in the surrounding area with one pad on each side of the wound.
Connect the pads to the lead wire to the Avazzia device. Turn on the Avazzia device and change modes to the RSI mode. Increase power to maximum comfortable power level for the patient. If the patient cannot feel the output, then increase power to 250.
Instruct the patient to reduce the power level if it begins to feel too strong. (sometimes as the microstimulation is applied, the tissue will become more sensitive to the stimulation. In this case the power should be reduced for patient comfort.) Allow to run unattended for 15 minutes. Take a picture of the pad placement and display on the device to document location, power setting, and treatment mode while the treatment is running for the 15 minutes.</description>
