  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients at risk of developing respiratory dysfunctions, such as patients with severe forms
      of muscular dystrophy, need a careful respiratory assessment, and periodic follow-up visits
      to monitor the progression of the disease. Continuous monitoring of respiratory activity
      pattern at home could give additional understandings about disease progression, flanking
      traditional, intermittent, cardiopulmonary evaluations, allowing prompt clinical
      intervention, and anticipating respiratory dysfunction. The main objective of the present
      study is thus to investigate the feasibility of using an innovative wearable device for
      respiratory monitoring, especially breathing frequency variation assessment, in patients with
      muscular dystrophy. The comparison between the measurements of breathing frequency obtained
      by using the IMU-based device and by using the reference method provided optimal results, in
      terms of accuracy errors, correlation and agreement. Participants positively evaluated the
      device for what concerns ease of use, comfort, usability and wearability. Moreover,
      preliminary results confirmed that breathing frequency is an interesting breathing parameter
      to monitor, at the clinic and at home, because it strongly correlates with the main indexes
      of respiratory function

    <description>Comparison between the measures of respiratory rate by using the device and by using already validated instrumentation: Optoelectronic Plethysmography (OEP), optoelectronic movement analysis system.
Chest wall movements during breathing are simultaneously recorded by the RespirHó device and by Optoelectronic Plethysmography (OEP), in static conditions, and in particular, in supine and seated positions.
OEP allows assessment of ventilatory and breathing pattern by measuring chest-wall movements related to breathing, by using motion capture principles.
Using OEP as reference method it is possible to compare the data recorded with the thoracic and abdominal units of the device RespirHó with those obtained by using OEP for the thoracic and abdominal compartments</description>

    <description>The system is a wearable, unobtrusive inertial-sensor-based device for long-term breathing pattern monitoring, also during daily life activities. It consists of three IMU-sensor units (3-axis accelerometer, 3-axis gyroscope, 3-axis magnetometer), positioned respectively on the patient's abdomen and thorax, and on a body area integral with thorax but not affected by espiratory movements. The peripheral units, placed on thorax and abdomen are used to record orientation changes during respiratory movements. The third unit is a central reference unit (hereafter CRU) that receives data from the other two units, save them on an SD card and communicate via Bluetooth with a smartphone / tablet / PC. Moreover, this unit detects only non-respiratory movement, representing not only a pure source of &quot;noise&quot; that must be removed from the thoracic and bdominal signals, but also a pure source of additional information regarding the state of ctivity of the subject .</description>
