  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Targeting of post-cataract refraction depends mainly on the prediction of the post-operative
      lens position, but also on the post-operative refraction itself. Hence, aim of this study is
      to evaluate the agreement and variability of subjective refraction performed by two
      independent examiners, autorefraction, and wavefront aberrometry in pseudophakic patients
      after uneventful cataract surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One of the main goals of modern cataract surgery, beside removing the cataractous lens, is to
      achieve the patient's desired post-operative refraction. Targeting this post-operative
      refraction depends mainly on the prediction of the post-operative lens position and the
      post-operative refraction itself. Reason for the contributing effect of post-operative
      refraction in the error-propagation analyses is that refraction in phakic patients was shown
      to have only moderate reproducibility.

      In the past, different studies evaluated refraction methods. However, there is no study that
      included reproducibility of subjective refraction in pseudophakic patients and compares it
      with objective refraction methods (autorefraction, wavefront aberrometry).

      100 eyes of 100 patients, which underwent uneventful cataract surgery, will be included in
      the study. Refraction of one eye of each patient will be tested using subjective refraction
      by two different examiners, autorefraction, and wavefront aberrometry at two separate
      occasions.
