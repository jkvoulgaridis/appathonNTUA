  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Latino families with dementia experience substantial disparities in access to caregiver
      support compared to their non-Latino white peers, putting them at an increased risk for
      negative emotional, physical and financial outcomes. This R21 will address this research gap
      by 1) Developing a culturally and linguistically appropriate text message intervention for
      caregiver support among Latino family caregivers of individuals with dementia and 2) Testing
      the feasibility and acceptability of CuidaTXT, a multicomponent text message caregiver
      support intervention culturally and linguistically tailored for the Latino community.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Latino relatives of individuals with dementia are less likely than non-Latino whites to have
      access to caregiver support. Text messaging can dramatically enhance the reach of effective
      culturally and linguistically tailored caregiver support interventions. However, to our
      knowledge, no text message interventions exist to provide caregiver support among caregivers
      of individuals with dementia. Text message interventions can capitalize on the fact that
      Latinos own cellphones and use them to text at a higher rate than non-Latino whites. The
      overall aim of this proposal is to develop and test the first text message intervention for
      caregiver support of individuals with dementia among Latinos. This intervention, CuidaTXT
      [Spanish for self-care and texting], will be available in English and Spanish, incorporate
      two-way messaging and will tailor text messages to the preferences of Latino caregivers.
      CuidaTXT will be multicomponent and based on the Stress Process Framework as supported by
      evidence. The intervention will incorporate social support and coping components including
      dementia education, problem-solving skills training, social network support, care management
      and referral to community resources. This research corresponds with Stage 1 of the NIH Stage
      Model for Behavioral Intervention Development. In Aim 1, researchers will develop a
      culturally and linguistically appropriate text message intervention for caregiver support
      among Latino family caregivers of individuals with dementia using user-centered design
      methods. In Aim 2, researchers will test the feasibility and acceptability of CuidaTXT during
      six months.

    <ipd_description>The final dataset will include caregivers' demographic and behavioral data from interviews as well as metrics, direct observation and survey data on feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy of CuidaTXT. Along with the dataset, the team will create a code book documenting all variables. Although the data analytic files will not have direct identifiers (only study identification numbers), the possibility of deductive disclosure of subjects with certain clinical characteristics may remain. To safeguard against the unlikely event of deductive disclosure, the team will only make the data files and codebook available to other researchers on a case-by-case basis.</ipd_description>
