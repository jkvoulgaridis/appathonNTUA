    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, observational registry study involving secondary and tertiary
      hospitals across China. The objective is to study the disease burden, disease progression,
      comorbidities, treatment pattern and real-world cost, effectiveness and safety of different
      therapy options for COPD patients in Chinese clinical practice in China.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COPD is the most common chronic respiratory disease in China and has caused significant
      economic and humanistic burden. Patient reported outcomes (PRO) have been widely used to
      assess disease activity and quality of life for COPD patients. Wearable devices enable
      recording activity data of patients continuously and automatically. The objective of the
      study is to study the disease burden, disease progression, comorbidities, treatment pattern
      and real-world cost, effectiveness and safety of different therapy options for COPD patients
      in Chinese clinical practice in China. This is a multi-center, observational registry study
      involving secondary and tertiary hospitals across China. 3000-5000 participants are planned
      to be recruited. Each participant will be followed-up at baseline and every 3 months.
      Clinical assessment data, laboratory examination data and cost data are captured from
      electronic medical records (EMR). Patient-reported outcome (PRO) data are collected via
      smartphone app. Part of patients will receive wearable devices to record digital health
      technology (DHT) data. As the first ever observational registry focused on COPD stable-period
      management, this study can provide more information on these following issues. (1) Annual
      changes in COPD prevalence, treatment pattern and economic burden in China. (2) Assessing the
      real-world effectiveness and safety of different treatment patterns of COPD via EMR, PRO and
      DHT. (3) Cost-effectiveness and budget impact to the public healthcare funds of different
      treatment patterns of COPD.
