  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Validation of biomolecular markers in the circulation and radiomic features are the focus of
      this project.The aim is to assess the role of molecular and cellular biomarkers (exosomes
      antigens, Circulating tumor cells - CTCs, panel of mutations in circulating free DNA) and
      radiomic signature, as complementary to assist early detection of lung cancer by LDCT.
