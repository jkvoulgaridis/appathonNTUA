  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims o investigate the effect of a diversified community-based reablement on motor
      function, cognitive function, performance in activities of daily living (ADL), and physical
      performance of older people living in remote areas. Older adults who are mobile but unstable
      were recruited from 6 public elderly day care centers in remote areas of the New Taipei City.
      Experimental group received a 10-wk diversified community-based reablement service including
      group exercise, cognitive training, health education for 1.5 hours, and individualized
      reablement for 1.0 hour, while control group received 1.5-hr group intervention and 1.0-hr
      placebo intervention. The de Morton Mobility Index (DEMMI), Saint Louis Mental Status
      Examination (SLUMS), Barthel Index (BI), Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM),
      and the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) including balance, gait speed, chair stand
      tests were evaluated twice before and after interventions. The results of the current study
      are expected to provide evidence in supporting a novel and diversified community-based
      reablement in remote areas.
