      The aim of this study is to determine the clinical spectrum and natural progression of
      Cerebral Small Vessel Disease (CSVD) and in a prospective multicenter study, to assess the
      clinical, genetic and epigenetic features of patients with CSVD, , to find independent
      imaging markers, and to optimize clinical management.
