  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep disturbance is very common in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD),and closely
      associated with their core symptom, social deficit.This trial investigates the effects of
      Cognitive behaviour therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) in children with autism spectrum disorder
      with sleep problems through synchronized eye-tracking and functional near-infrared
      spectroscopy (fNIRS). This is a 1:1 parallel single-blind randomized controlled trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      sleep disturbance is significantly associated with social deficit of ASD and but the
      congnitive-neural mechanism underlying this association remains unclear. Cognitive behaviour
      therapy for insomnia (iCBT-I) is considered as an evidence-based treatment for insomnia.
      After 5 consecutive sleep interventions is a 2-year following up study, the above issue is
      further tested with emphasis on progressive trajectory from a developmental perspective. we
      examine the influence of sleep disturbance on face processing and neural response during
      naturalistic social behavior of ASD children using synchronized eye-tracking and functional
      near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to uncover the neural mechanism for that sleep disturbance
      influences social deficit.

    <description>Different sleep parameters, such as sleep onset latency (SOL) and wake after sleep onset (WASO) will be determined using wrist actigraphy. Participants will be provided with an actiwatch at baseline, 6 months after the intervention , 12 months after the intervention and when children 6 year olds . The actiwatch will be worn on the non-dominant arm 24 hours a day, except for while bathing, during the 1-week screening periodmovement and nighttime sleep parameters.</description>
