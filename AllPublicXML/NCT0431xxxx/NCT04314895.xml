      This study evaluates the use of NanoPac injected directly into tumors in the lung of people
      with lung cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NanoPac is very small (submicron) particles of the chemotherapy drug, paclitaxel, which is
      administered intravenously in a number of types of cancer. These submicron particles are
      injected directly into solid tumors to target cancer at the site of disease with less
      systemic exposure than intravenously administered chemotherapy. In this study, the submicron
      particle paclitaxel will be injected directly into tumors in the lungs of people with small
      cell or non-small cell lung cancer. All subjects in this study will receive NanoPac and will
      be evaluated to see if NanoPac is safe and has an effect on the tumor within the lung.

    <intervention_name>NanoPac (sterile nanoparticulate paclitaxel) Powder for Suspension</intervention_name>
    <description>NanoPac is manufactured using a Precipitation with Compressed Antisolvent (PCA) technique that employs supercritical carbon dioxide and acetone to generate paclitaxel nanoparticles within a well-characterized particle-size distribution. Following PCA, NanoPac is filled into a clear 60mL Type 1, USP, clear-glass vial (306 mg/vial) as a powder fill of nanoparticulate paclitaxel, closed with a bromobutyl rubber stopper and aluminum crimp seal, and sterilized by gamma irradiation. Prior to administration at the hospital/clinic, NanoPac will be reconstituted with 1% Polysorbate 80, NF in 0.9% Sodium Chloride for Injection, USP, to form a suspension. The suspension will be further diluted with 0.9% Sodium Chloride for Injection, USP to achieve the final clinical formulation.</description>
