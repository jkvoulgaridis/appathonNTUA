  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The placenta accreta spectrum (PAS) which includes accreta, increta, and percreta represents
      a significant obstetric challenge. PAS complicates as many as 1 per 500 pregnancies and this
      risk is increased with prior cesarean deliveries. Antenatal diagnosis of PAS allows for
      multidisciplinary planning and delivery before the onset of labor and/or vaginal bleeding.
      This approach has reduced maternal morbidity rates, including less blood loss, fewer
      transfusion requirements and, intraoperative urologic injuries as well as improve fetal
      outcome.

      Ultrasound evaluation, with grayscale and color Doppler imaging, is the recommended
      first-line modality for diagnosing PAS. Grayscale ultrasound features suggestive of placenta
      accreta include an inability to visualize the normal retroplacental clear zone, irregularity,
      and attenuation of the uterine-bladder interface, retroplacental myometrial thickness,
      presence of intraplacental lacunar spaces, and bridging vessels between the placenta and
      bladder wall when using color Doppler.

      The placenta accreta index (PAI) score (a nine-point score) was proposed in 2015 to predict
      PAS based on US parameters in a high-risk population by retrospective data analysis. The
      probability of histological invasion was found to increase with increasing the PAI score.
      This study aimed to prospectively evaluate the diagnostic performance of the PAI in the
      prediction of PAS in relation to histopathological findings.

    <description>In pregnant women with previous CS and anterior low-lying or placenta previa, the following three sonographic criteria were assessed: (i) the smallest myometrial thickness in the sagittal plane; (ii) presence of placental lacunae and its grade from 0-3; (iii) bridging vessels using color Doppler. The PAI score (up to 9) was calculated for every patient as described by Rac et al.2015.</description>
