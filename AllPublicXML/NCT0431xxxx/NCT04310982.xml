  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gait analysis is an effective tool used for a variety of purposes, including assessing
      neurological diseases, risk of falling, orthopedic disability and progress during
      rehabilitation.The analysis of gait and jump performance must be applicable in a clinical
      setting. Thus; it needs to be easy to apply in a variety of life situations.The measurements
      should be reproducible, stable, accurate, capable of distinguishing between normal and
      abnormal conditions, and cost-effective. Jump measures can predict injury risks, serve as
      talent identification, and replicate explosive competitive activities of athletes.
      Furthermore, the performance in vertical jumping can be associated with neuromuscular
      fatigue.The purpose of this study was to confirm the test-retest reliability of the G-walk
      wearable sensor system for gait and jump parameters in healthy adults.

      The G-Walk determines spatiotemporal parameters as well as pelvic rotations during gait and
      allows objective and precise analysis of movements with its wearable inertial sensor. It also
      enables 3D kinematic analysis of the pelvis, providing a functional analysis of disorders in
      gait caused by neuromuscular diseases The device is placed on an elastic belt and worn on the
      waist of the person being evaluated, with the center of the device at the fifth lumbar
      vertebrae. To ensure correct placement of the device, the L4-L5 intervertebral space was
      palpated via the posterior superior iliac spines.

      After the accelerometer was placed, the participants were asked to walk calmly at normal
      speed, on a 10 m track, and to return to the starting position.

      The values and gait characteristics of acceleration in the anteroposterior and mediolateral
      axes were transferred to the computer software program.

      The tilt of the pelvis in the sagittal plane in the flexion-extension direction, the oblique
      displacement in the coronal plane, the angles of the rotation of movement in the transverse
      plane and the symmetry values of the right and left sides are obtained. While the symmetry
      index ranges from 0 to 100, a value closer to 100 indicates that the gait is more symmetrical
      Following gait assessment, Countermovement jump, static squat jump and Countermovement jump
      with arms thrust was measured using the device.

    <description>Gait parameters will be assessed via the G-Walk on two separate occasions. The G-Walk is a device that is worn on the waist via an elastic belt. The G-Walk is built with a triaxial accelerometer 16 bit/axes with multiple sensitivity, a triaxial magnetometer 13 bit and a triaxial gyroscope 16 bit/axes with multiple sensitivity. This hardware is capable of acquiring and transmitting data to a computer through a Bluetooth connection and at the end of each analysis an automatic report containing the gait assessment results is ready to be analyzed.
Gait symmetry values of the right and left sides are obtained within this report. While the symmetry index ranges from 0 to 100, a value closer to 100 indicates that the gait is more symmetrical.</description>

    <description>Forty-nine healthy participants (30 females, 19 males) completed the test-retest protocol with 7 days between tests. Participants were; 23,58±2,65 years of age, 62,9±10,08 kg of weight and 168,76±8,31 cm of height. Participants included in the study did not have any musculoskeletal, neurological or other pathology potentially affecting their gait and jump performance.</description>

    <description>The G-Walk is a wireless sensor device which is placed on an elastic belt and worn on the waist of the person being evaluated. The device is placed with the center of the device at the fifth lumbar vertebrae and the patient is completely free to walk, run and jump wearing this device. The gait and jump performance of the participants was assessed with the participants wearing this device two times to investigate the test-retest reliability. The second being 7 days after the first.</description>
