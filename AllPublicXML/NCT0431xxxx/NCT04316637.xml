  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      NPC is a rare, relentlessly progressive, neurological disease and associated with serious
      morbidity and shortened life expectancy.

      The purpose of this Expanded Access Program is to provide early access to arimoclomol for
      patients with Niemann-Pick Type C disease who, in the opinion and the clinical judgement of
      the treating physician, may benefit from treatment with arimoclomol.

      Participants will receive treatment with arimoclomol until their doctor finds it does not
      help them anymore, they withdraw, or the study is stopped for any reason.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Confirmed diagnosis of NPC (NPC1 or NPC2) and at least one neurological symptom.

          -  The patient is two years of age or above.

          -  The patient is a permanent resident of US.

          -  If taking miglustat (ZavescaÂ®), the patient must have been on the target dose for the
             past six weeks.

          -  Confirmed negative urine pregnancy test for sexually active female of child-bearing
             potential (post-menarche).

          -  If the patient has a history of seizures, the condition must be adequately controlled,
             i.e., the pattern of seizure activity must be stable, and the patient must be on a
             stable dose and regimen of antiepileptic medication during one month prior to
             screening.

          -  Patient or parent/guardian must provide written informed consent to participate in
             EAP.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Severe liver insufficiency.

          -  Renal insufficiency.

          -  Known or suspected allergy or intolerance to arimoclomol or its constituents.

          -  The patient is pregnant, planning to become pregnant (while on the study) or is
             currently breastfeeding.

          -  The patient will undergo treatment with another investigational drug, whilst
             participating in the program or in the 4 weeks prior to commencing treatment with
             arimoclomol.

          -  The patient is either eligible and able to participate in or is currently
             participating in an active interventional clinical trial within the indication.

          -  The patient, in the opinion of the clinician, is unable to comply with the treatment
             or has a medical condition that would potentially increase the risk to the patient by
             participation.

          -  The patient has a medical condition which hinders the clinician's assessment of
             arimoclomol safety and efficacy (e.g. certain epileptic conditions or severe
             cataplexy).
