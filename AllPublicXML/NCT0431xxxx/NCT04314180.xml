  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Slit-lamp images are widely used in ophthalmology for the detection of cataract, keratopathy
      and other anterior segment disorders. In real-world practice, the quality of slit-lamp images
      can be unacceptable, which can undermine diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. Here, the
      researchers established and validated an artificial intelligence system to achieve automatic
      quality assessment of slit-lamp images upon capture. This system can also provide guidance to
      photographers according to the reasons for low quality.
