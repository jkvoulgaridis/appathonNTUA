  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this project is to evaluate the effect of enhanced psychological
      well-being on sleep quality. This study will demonstrate whether combining an intervention
      designed to promote psychological well-being with sleep hygiene education improves sleep
      quality in a non-clinical population of distressed adults reporting poor sleep in the absence
      of a diagnosed sleep disorder. The investigators expect an intervention combining elements of
      psychological well-being and sleep hygiene education to result in significant improvements in
      sleep quality measures from baseline to post-intervention, and greater improvements in sleep
      quality measures at post-intervention as compared with sleep hygiene education alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Psychological distress is often associated with poor sleep quality. The role of psychological
      well-being has often been neglected and most interventions for sleep improvement have focused
      primarily on sleep disorders. This approach is limited to those individuals who have specific
      conditions and little resources have been directed to the promotion of sleep quality in the
      general population.

      This study will be a pilot parallel-arm, randomized controlled trial to assess the baseline
      associations between psychological well-being and different measures of sleep outcomes,
      determine the effect of elements of a psychological well-being promoting intervention on
      sleep quality, and examine effect size estimates of key sleep-related outcomes (duration,
      efficiency, quality) to provide essential data to inform a main efficacy trial.

    <measure>Change in sleep quality: Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), a 19-item self-rating scale for the assessment of sleep quality over a 1-month time interval. The PSQI yields 7 component scores and one global score. The component scores consist of subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction. Each item is given a score from 0-3. The global score is calculated by summing the seven component scores, providing an overall score ranging from 0-21, where lower scores indicate a higher sleep quality.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in psychological distress</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by the Symptom Questionnaire (SQ), a 92-item self-rating scale for the assessment of psychological distress over a 1-week time interval. The SQ yields 4 main scales: anxiety, depression, somatization, and hostility. Each scale can be further divided into 2 sub-scales: one concerned with symptoms (17 items) and the other with well-being (6 items). Answers on each item are dichotomous (i.e., yes/no or true false). Scales and subscales can be scored separately, and the sum of the 4 main scale scores yields a total distress score. A response of yes/true for a symptom item gives 1 point, and a response of no/false for a well-being question gives 1 point for a score ranging from 0-23 for each main scale and 0-17 for each subscale, where a higher score indicates greater distress. If the well-being score is calculated separately the raw score can be subtracted from 6 for a score ranging from 0-6, where a higher score indicates greater well-being.</description>

    <description>Measured by the Psychological Well-being scale, a 42-item self-rating scale for the assessment of 6 dimensions of psychological well-being: self-acceptance, positive relations with others, autonomy, environmental mastery, purpose in life, and personal growth. Each of the 42 six-point response items are given a score from 1-6, with questions phrased in the negative reversed (e.g., 1 to 6, 6 to 1). The total score in each dimension ranges from 7-42, and all the dimensions scores are summed to give a final total ranging from 42-252, with higher scores indicating greater psychological well-being.</description>

    <description>The main aim of the well-being intervention is to reduce levels of distress through the promotion of psychological well-being. Key components of the intervention are self-monitoring of instances of well-being and what leads to their interruption (i.e., thoughts and behaviors), cognitive restructuring of interfering thoughts, and homework assignments to address dysfunctional behaviors and increase exposure to optimal experiences. Participants will become aware of their functioning based on six different dimensions of psychological well-being (i.e., self-acceptance, positive relations with others, autonomy, environmental mastery, purpose in life, and personal growth), and will be guided in finding a balance within each dimension.</description>

    <description>The main aim of sleep hygiene education is to provide participants with a set of behavioral and environmental recommendations intended to promote healthy sleep. During the intervention, participants will become aware of their own sleep patterns, will learn about healthy sleep habits, and will be encouraged to follow a set of recommendations to improve their sleep. Key components of the intervention are sleep hygiene and education.</description>
