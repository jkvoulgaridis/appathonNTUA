    <measure>Health Utilities Index-III</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Health Utilities Index (HUI; Feeny et al., 2002; Horsman, Furlong, Feeny, &amp; Torrance, 2003) is a 17-item measure designed to assess health related quality of life.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The THI (Newman, Jacobson, &amp; Spitzer, 1996; Newman, Sandridge, &amp; Jacobson, 1998).is a 25 items measure of the impact of tinnitus on daily life that includes three subscales. The subscales cover functional (mental, social/occupational and physical functioning), emotional impact and catastrophic responses to tinnitus.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS; Zigmond &amp; Snaith, 1983).</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The HADS is a widely used measure of psychological distress in people experiencing a concurrent physical health condition. It has 14 items and respondents use a Likert-type scale to indicate how often they have had a particular feeling in the previous week (e.g. &quot;I feel tense or wound up&quot;).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tinnitus Catastrophizing Scale (TCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Tinnitus Catastrophizing Scale (TCS; Cima, Crombez, &amp; Vlaeyen, 2011). The TCS was used to assess the degree to which people thought or expected the worst about tinnitus (i.e. catastrophizing). The TCS is a 13-item measure based on the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (Sullivan, Bishop, &amp; Pivik, 1995) and respondents use a five point scale to indicate the degree to which statements applies to them (e.g. It's terrible and I think it's never going to get any better). The total score on the TCS ranges from 0 to 65.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fear of Tinnitus Questionnaire (FTQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The FTQ is a 17-item self-report measure intended and designed to assess respondents' level of fear regarding their tinnitus. Items in the questionnaire are presented as a series of statements (e.g. &quot;I am afraid that my tinnitus will become worse&quot;) from which respondents are asked to indicate if it is applicable to their current situation. Each statement receives a score of 1 when applicable. The total score is the sum of all applicable statements and provides an overall rating of fear of tinnitus and ranges from 0 to 17.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tinnitus Questionnaire (TQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>

It has 52 items and uses a three-point scale to indicate levels of distress on six subscales. The total possible score on the TQ ranges from 0-84.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Tinnitus Disability Index (TDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Tinnitus Disability Index (TDI; Cima, Vlaeyen, Maes, Joore, &amp; Anteunis, 2011) is a seven-item self-report questionnaire that assesses the level of interferences in daily activities (such as occupational, social, and recreational) attributed to tinnitus. Respondents use an 11-point scale to indicate the level of interference ranging from 0 no disability, to 10 total disability. The total score ranges from 0 to 70 with higher scores indicating higher levels of interference.</description>
