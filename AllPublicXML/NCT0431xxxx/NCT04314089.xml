          -  Patients receiving chronic, systemic treatment with corticosteroids or another
             immunosuppressive agent with the following exceptions:

             completed radiation at least 2 weeks prior to day 1 and has been off steroids for at
             least 2 weeks prior to day 1 of study drug. Stable (MRI or CT with contrast performed

               1. Active (acute or chronic) infections requiring treatment with antibiotics.

               2. Liver disease such as cirrhosis, chronic active or persistent hepatitis B or C or
                  HIV.

               3. Age related macular degeneration, atypical hemolytic uremia syndrome,
                  glomerulonephritis, or known autoimmune diseases.

          -  Female patients who are pregnant or breast feeding, or adults of reproductive
             potential who are not using effective birth control methods. See Section 6.3.1.1 for a
             complete list of medically acceptable birth control methods.

          -  Corrected QTc interval &gt; 480 msec. If QTc interval is &gt; 480 msec, then 2 additional
             ECGs should be obtained over a brief period (e.g., within 15-20 minutes) to confirm
             the abnormality. The average QTc interval will be determined from the 3 ECG tracings
             by manual evaluation and will be used to determine if the subject will be excluded
             from the study. The same method of QTc determination must be used throughout the
             subject's participation in the trial.

          -  Patients unwilling to or unable to comply with the protocol.
