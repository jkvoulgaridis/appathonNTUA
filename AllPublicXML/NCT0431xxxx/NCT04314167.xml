  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dyslipidemia is characterized by low levels of HDLs, hypertriglyceridemia as well as an
      increases proportion of small dense LDLs. Changes in lipoprotein particles and its
      concentrations, especially increased levels of pro-atherogenic LDL particles play an
      important role in the development of cardiovascular diseases. It is well established that
      statin/PCSK9-inhibitor treatment is very effective in lowering LDL cholesterol levels and
      therefore in preventing cardiovascular events. Besides the beneficial effects on
      cardiovascular system, these therapies are unfortunately linked to increased risk for type 2
      diabetes.

      However underlying mechanisms for the association between LDL cholesterol levels and the risk
      for type 2 diabetes remains largely unknown.Type 2 diabetes is especially characterized by
      insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion from pancreatic beta-cells. Insulin
      resistance alone is insufficient to cause type 2 diabetes, as long as the ÃŸ-cell is able to
      compensate for the increased demand for insulin. Once this compensatory mechanism reaches its
      physiological limits, individuals progress to type 2 diabetes. Accordingly we aimed to
      investigate the associations between LDL cholesterol concentrations and the key issue in the
      pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes, insulin secretion before and after lowering cholesterol
      concentration by treatment with Evolocumab for 12 weeks in patients with medical indication
      for a treatment with a PCSK9-inhibitor. Therefore, patients will either undergo a
      hyperglycemic clamp or a oral glucose tolerance test in randomized manner.
