    <textblock>
      Thirty-three healthy elderly people, who were classified into two age groups, participated in
      this study. All participants had not practiced yoga before and were asked not to perform any
      sports activities while the research was ongoing. In the experimental group, participants (n
      = 18) had to participate in 10 weeks of yoga classes. In the control group, participants (n =
      15) did not perform any exercises or other changes in their daily living life.

    <measure>Brunel mood scale (BRUMS)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Lithuanian translated version of the Brunel Mood Scale (BRUMS) was used in the present study. It was based on the originally developed to serve as a brief measure of mood before and after yoga intervention. The BRUMS (1) scale has 24 items arranged into six subscales: anger, confusion, depression, fatigue, tension and vigor. Each subscale has a numerical rating scale (0 = not at all, 1 = a bit, 2 = moderate, 3 = enough; 4 = extremely) from which research participant select the one best represents at that time. The results within subscale is summed and a score range from 0 to 16</description>

    <measure>Hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To determine the level of anxiety and depression of subjects was used HADS scale. The scale consists of totally 14 questions with the answers valued from 0 to 3. Half of questions addressed to estimate anxiety and rest - depression. The total scoring and conclusion for the both categories of questions: 0-7 = Normal; 8-10 = Borderline abnormal (borderline case); 11-21 = Abnormal (case)</description>

    <measure>Perceived stress scale -14</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The purpose of this scale is to assess the degree of stress in subjects' lives. It consists of questions about the frequency of feeling and thoughts during the past time period. Potential answers: 0-never; 1-almost never; 2-sometimes; 3-fairly often and 4-very often. The scores are obtained by reversing the scores on the four positive items: for example, 0=4, 1=3, 2=2, etc. and then summing across all items. Scores for the 14-item form range from 0 to 56, with higher scores indicating greater perceived stress</description>

    <measure>Human Free BDNF</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Venous blood samples from median antecubital vein were collected in 5 ml vacuum tubes with a gel separator and was separated by centrifugation (15 min at 1200g) to make blood serum. Samples were aliquoted and stored at -800C until analysis. The serum concentration of Human Free BDNF was measured using an enzyme-linked immunoassay kit (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, USA)</description>
