  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research project aims to improve and promote physical activity participation in the
      outdoors and use outdoor walking as a form of long-term rehabilitation for young adults who
      have had a stroke.

      This research is specifically focused on adults of working age (e.g. 18 to 65 years classed
      as young adults) as there is little to no research or rehabilitation programmes for young
      adults who have had a stroke on how best to regain function and independence to return to
      social/leisure activities, employment and education. During this study, The investigators
      will measure how fast a young adult who has had a stroke walks, how much energy they use to
      walk and how their joints move when walking. The investigators will also use questionnaires
      to measure how confident a young adult who has had a stroke is and how they feel when
      outdoors.

      This project could highlight the positive role of exercising in outdoor natural environments
      to promote recovery following stroke in young adults. The investigators predict that an
      outdoor-walking rehabilitation programme could motivate the young stroke population to better
      engage in their rehabilitation, as walking in more challenging environments could facilitate
      an increase in the desire to walk outdoors and confidence.

    <textblock>
      This study is a randomised controlled trial, which will investigate whether an
      outdoor-walking rehabilitation programme can improve walking performance (how efficiently and
      how fast or slow an individual is able to walk) and quality of life of young adults who have
      had a stroke, compared to controls who have had a stroke, who will not be provided with the
      outdoor-walking programme. Forty-six individuals aged between 18 and 65 years, who have had a
      stroke in the last three years, will be recruited to participate in this study. Participants
      will be recruited from 4 health boards in Wales, United Kingdom: Powys Teaching Health Board,
      Aneurin Bevan University Health Board, Swansea Bay University Health Board and Cwm Taf
      University Health Board.

      For the development of the outdoor-walking rehabilitation programme, the Consensus for
      Exercise Reporting Template (CERT) was followed. The outdoor-walking rehabilitation programme
      will run over 3 months and take place in Wales, United Kingdom. Each week will include
      once-per-week, outdoor-walking instructor-led sessions. The walking routes planned for the
      rehabilitation programme will be detailed in an exercise diary provided to the participant.
      This will include information such as distance, terrain (e.g gravel, tarmac, grass),
      environment (e.g woodland, lowland, moorland), gradient (e.g uphill to downhill ratio, how
      steep/ flat) and perceived level of difficulty.

      The primary outcome measures for this study are walking speed and quality of life. Secondary
      outcomes include metabolic cost and biomechanical function. Outcomes will be measured pre and
      post 3-month rehabilitation data collection. Walking speed and metabolic cost will be
      measured during a 3-minute walking protocol. Quality of life will be measured using the
      standardised Stroke Aphasia Quality of Life (SAQOL), Confidence after stroke measure (CaSM)
      and Nature-relatedness scale (NR). Participants will also be asked to provide three
      difficulties they have experienced post-stroke (e.g difficulty walking) and three aims (e.g
      to go back to work) .

      Biomechanical function will involve analysing joint kinetic and kinematics and measured
      during the biomechanical function protocol. Adherence to the outdoor-walking rehabilitation
      programme will be measured pre, post-rehabilitation and follow-up through the use of the
      exercise diary and questionnaires.

      The results from this project will be used as benchmark data to provide evidence to support
      the role of outdoor rehabilitation in natural outdoor environments and green spaces for
      promoting health and wellbeing of young adults who have had a stroke.

    <measure>Change in walking speed</measure>
    <time_frame>5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Walking speed will be assessed by measuring the time to walk the middle 10m of a 15m walkway continuously for a total of 3-minutes. Scores are reported in meters/second with higher scores indicating better function. This will be recorded both indoors and outdoors and compared against the control.</description>

    <measure>Change in quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in quality of life will be assessed using the standardised Stroke Aphasia Quality of Life (SAQOL) that represents a measure of quality of life and compared to the control. Score is reported numbers with higher score indicating better quality of life.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in confidence (sub-measure of quality of life)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in confidence will be assessed using the Confidence after stroke measure (CaSM), which is a comprehensive measure of confidence developed for use specifically after having a stroke and compared to the control. Score is reported numbers with higher score indicating better cpnfidence.</description>

    <measure>Change in nature-relatedness: attitudes to natural outdoor environments (sub-measure of quality of life)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in attitudes to natural outdoor environments will be assessed using the Nature-relatedness scale (NR), which assesses subjective connectedness with the natural environment. Scores will be compared to the control. Score is reported numbers with higher score indicating better attitudes towards natural outdoor environments.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in aims and difficulties (sub-measure of quality of life)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in quality of life will be further assessed by qualitative thematic analysis. This will involve asking participants to give three aims and three difficulties they have at the moment, which has been done in a previous study conducted by the research team to assess quality of life.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in metabolic cost (efficiency)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Metabolic cost will be measured during the 3-minute walking test. Participants will walk at their self-selected walking speed. This will be recorded indoors and compared against the control group. Metabolic cost will be calculated by measuring oxygen consumption and then dividing the value by walking speed. Score is reported in millilitres/kg/metre with lower score indicating better efficiency.</description>

    <measure>Change in biomechanical function (gait analysis)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Biomechanical function will involve analysing joint kinetic and kinematics during 7 walking trials on a 5m walkway. Changes in phases of the gait cycle (heel-strike, support, toe-off) will be compared pre and post rehabilitation, and control.</description>
