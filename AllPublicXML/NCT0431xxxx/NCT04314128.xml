  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH) is a rare disease, primarily affecting overweight
      females of child-bearing age. Patients suffer from increased intracranial pressure (ICP),
      typically resulting in headaches, visual disturbances and bilateral papilledema, pulsatile
      tinnitus and cognitive deficits. The disease is difficult to diagnose, treat and monitor. The
      only current method of measuring the ICP in day-to-day clinical practice is by lumbar
      puncture. This procedure is invasive, and often painful for the patient. There is an unmet
      need of methods that can reliable measure or estimate ICP in a non-invasive manner.
      Ultrasound is one such potential method, and the aim of this study is to investigate the use
      of ocular ultrasound and transcranial doppler to measure or estimate ICP.

    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective cohort study. Investigators plan to include 50 patients in whom
      the IIH-diagnosis is suspected. Patients are referred from general practitioners,
      neurologists or ophthalmologists to the Danish Headache Center or admitted to the Neurology
      ward when the IIH diagnosis is suspected.

      As part of an established routine clinical work-up to establish the diagnosis of IIH, all
      patients will undergo (according to the Friedman criteria) the following examinations:

      A)

        1. An interview (history taking) and clinical examination

        2. Routine laboratory tests (blood tests)

        3. Ophthalmological examination

        4. Lumbar puncture with measurement of the ICP

        5. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain

      Additionally the following investigations will be performed at baseline (before and after
      lumbar puncture):

      B) Transorbital sonography (TOS) C) Transcranial Doppler When the patient is seen at the
      clinic for their regular follow-up visits the same measurements will be done.

      A control group of healthy participants (NR=25) will be included in whom TOS (B) and TCD (C)
      will be performed in order to compare the values between the patient group (IIH) and control
      group. Controls will be included to match the patients according to BMI, age and gender.

      All ultrasound images- and films will be saved, and evaluated by a blinded investigator.
