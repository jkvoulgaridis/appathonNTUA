    <textblock>
      The present study is focused on the importance of sensory stimuli at the tactile and
      proprioceptive level that occur during the activation of the pectoral area, following the
      treatment protocol of Vojta Therapy (VT) and which are the areas that are activated in the
      central nervous system (CNS) during stimulation. For the activation record it will be used
      electroencephalography.

      The relationship between intrinsic and extrinsic factors condition the development of the
      human being. The sensory organs are the main recipients of the information, thanks to them we
      are able to interact with the environment and register the influence of the stimuli inside
      the organism. The brain receives information from the environment through its senses.

      At the tactile level the brain receives afferent information thanks to the activation of
      mechanoreceptors of the skin during interaction with the environment. The receivers encode
      the stimulus information and send it to the specific CNS structures. In these structures, the
      sensations received are combined and the stimulus is transformed into a perfectly elaborated
      response, both in a conscious and innate way.

      Dr. Vojta showed in 1974 the locomotion reflects the result of the study of motor
      ontogenesis. This discovery was the demonstration of the existence of innate and
      preprogrammed motor patterns in Humans.

      Most of the studies related to VT have showed the improvements obtained by the patients,
      validating it as a method of treatment and evidencing objective changes after its
      application. This research aim to go further and verify that cortical areas are activated
      during the application of an external and proprioceptive stimuli that are performed during
      the first phase of VT turning and which areas are responsible for producing and organizing
      the efferent response.

    <description>All participants were properly instructed and signed an informed consent previous to the interventions. They were comfortably laid down on their back with eyes open, wearing the EEG cap during the intervention. They were asked to remain relaxed and still during the whole process. After a first minute of resting, the experimental group received a continuous reflex locomotion stimulus during the next 8 minutes.</description>
