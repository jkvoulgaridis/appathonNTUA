  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In last years, erector spinae plane block is widely used in abdominal and thoracic surgeries.
      Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is one of the most commonly performed surgical operations. In
      this study, the investigators will evaluate the effectiveness of erector spina plan block
      with different injection levels for postoperative analgesia on patients undergoing
      laparoscopic cholecystectomy surgery.

      Three groups were planned for this study.Randomization was planned with the closed envelope
      method. İn the first group, the ESP(erector spinae plane) block procedure will be applied
      from the T7 level bilaterally and in the second group it will be applied from the T9 level
      bilaterally. ESP block procedure will not be applied in the third group and this group will
      be considered as the control group. A comparison of NRS (Numeric Rating Scale) and morphine
      consumption will be planned for all groups of patients at 1-th, 4-th, 8-th.,12-th and,24-th
      postoperative hours.

    <description>It was planned to check the change in the NRS scores of patients at 1.,4.,8.,12.,24 hours for evaluation of efficacy level and effect time of ESP block procedure from different levels.
A NRS involves asking the patient to rate his or her pain from 0 to 10 (11 point scale) with the understanding that 0 is equal to no pain and 10 is equal to worst possible pain.</description>

    <intervention_type>Procedure</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>T7 Level Erector Spinae Plane Block</intervention_name>
    <description>ESP block is planned after the completion of surgery and before the extubation. Its application will be planned from the T7 level bilaterally when the patients are turned to the right lateral position. A linear ultrasound probe will be placed in the longitudinal parasagittal orientation 3 cm to lateral of T7 spinous process.
After imaging of erector spina musceles and transvers process of 7 th trorocal vertebrae, an ultrasound-guided local anaesthetic mixture ( 0.5% bupivacaine 15 cc + 2% lidocaine 5 cc) will be applied to the region between spinae muscles and transverse process using a needle of 22 gauge &amp; 8cm directed from cranial to caudal.
After application of the same procedure to the other side, the patients will be woken-up and patient-controlled analgesia consisting of intravenous morphine will be planned for all of them.
Additionally, at postoperative 1.,4.,8.,12.,24. hours, NRS scales and morphine consumption will be recorded.</description>
