  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this research, a unique &quot;Exergame&quot; has been developed and is being tested. The Exergame
      consists of unique Virtual Reality Cognitive Training (VRCT) games combined with concurrent
      cycling on a recumbent stationary cycle. The Exergame seamlessly integrates specific
      cognitive tasks into a virtual environment and is synchronized with cycling to promote
      cognition. Cycling through an interesting virtual environment will motivate and engage the
      older adult to participate in the exercise, and VRCT could augment cycling's effects on
      cognition. A further innovation is that the Exergame has been developed as both an Apple TV
      and iPAD application, making it widely accessible and available. It will provide a low-cost
      VRCT Exergame option that currently does not exist, one that is affordable and compatible
      with almost any stationary cycle. This project is significant because treatment that delays
      the onset of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) by five years could save the U.S. economy an estimated
      $89 billion by 2030 and no drugs can yet prevent, cure, or even slow AD. Aerobic exercise and
      cognitive training are two such promising interventions. Emerging mechanistic studies further
      suggest that the two interventions together may have a synergistic, superior cognitive effect
      than either intervention alone. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the feasibility
      and efficacy of the Exergame intervention on cognition. An RCT is planned in which subjects
      are randomized on a 2:1:1 allocation ratio to 3 parallel groups (exergame:cycling
      only:attention control). Mixed methods will be used to assess outcomes in both phases.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A treatment that delays the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD) by five years could be hugely
      cost-saving at an estimated $89 billion in 2030. However, nearly all (99.6%) drug trials for
      AD have failed, and no drugs can yet prevent, cure, or even slow AD. This highlights an
      urgent and pressing need to develop behavioral interventions to prevent AD and slow its
      progression. Aerobic exercise and cognitive training are two such promising interventions.

      Aerobic exercise and cognitive training are 2 promising interventions for preventing AD.
      Aerobic exercise increases aerobic fitness, which in turn improves brain structure and
      function, while cognitive training improves selective neural function intensively. Hence,
      concurrent aerobic exercise and cognitive training may very well have an additive or
      synergistic effect on cognition by complementary strengthening of different neural functions
      because aerobic exercise and virtual reality cognitive training depend on discrete neuronal
      mechanisms for their therapeutic effects.

      The purpose of this Phase II randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to test the efficacy and
      additive/synergistic effects of a 3-month combined cycling and virtual reality cognitive
      training intervention on cognition and relevant mechanisms (aerobic fitness, physical
      function), in persons with subjective cognitive decline at risk for developing AD.
