  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) is a condition where the pancreas does not have
      enough pancreatic enzymes to break down food. Some symptoms of EPI are frequent gas/bloating,
      unexplained stomach pains, frequent diarrhea, and foul-smelling, greasy stools. The purpose
      of this study is to see how effective CREON is for treating symptoms of EPI due to causes
      other than cystic fibrosis (CF), chronic pancreatitis (CP), pancreatectomy (PY), or
      pancreatic cancer (PC).

      CREON (Pancrelipase) is an approved drug used to treat people who cannot digest food normally
      due to their pancreas not making enough enzymes. Adult participants with a diagnosis of EPI
      due to causes other than CF, CP, PY, or PC will be enrolled. Around 50 participants will be
      enrolled in approximately 20 sites in the United States.

      Participants will receive oral CREON capsules with each meal and snack beginning at Day 1 for
      27 weeks.

      There may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their
      standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the course of the study at a
      hospital or a clinic. Participants will need to be confined for 2 separate periods of 6 to 8
      days each to measure Co-efficient of Fat Absorption (during screening and after enrollment).
      The effect of the treatment will be checked by medical assessments, blood and stool tests,
      checking for side effects and completing questionnaires.
