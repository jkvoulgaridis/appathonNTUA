      Complete the examination of cardio-pulmonary ultrasound in accordance with the a-ccue process
      of patients with novel coronavirus bedside. To summarize and analyze the characteristics of
      cardiopulmonary ultrasound in patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia, and assess the
      relationship between pulmonary ultrasound imaging score and National Early Warning
      Score(NEWS) and prognosis. Auto line B is a method which is based on artificial intelligence
      is used to calculate the lungs ultrasonic B line numbers reviewing the status of patients
      with lung, and also evaluate patients' lungs using the traditional artificial
      semi-quantitative method, to evaluate those two kinds of evaluation methods for the
      evaluation of patients with lung condition effects are consistent or not, and verify
      consistency of ultrasonic evaluation method and the way of CT evaluation.
