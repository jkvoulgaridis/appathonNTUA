  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an age de-escalation, dose-escalation open label randomised trial studying the safety
      and immunogenicity of RH5.1/Matrix-M, administered intramuscularly in healthy adults, young
      children and infants in Tanzania
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 60 participants will be enrolled consisting of healthy adults (18-45 years) and
      infants (6-11 months) residing in Bagamoyo district, Tanzania. Participants will be recruited
      from areas of low malaria transmission in Bagamoyo town and areas of high malaria
      transmission within Bagamoyo districts and surrounding districts. All participants will be
      followed for 2-2.5years after the first vaccination with RH5.1/Matrix-M vaccination. The
      duration of the entire study will be 2-2.5years per participant from the time of first
      vaccination.

          -  Any other significant disease, disorder or situation which, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, may either put the participants at risk because of participation in the
             trial, or may influence the result of the trial, or the participant's ability to
             participate in the trial.
