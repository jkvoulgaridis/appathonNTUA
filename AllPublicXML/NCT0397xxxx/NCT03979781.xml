  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a descriptive study designed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of a precision
      medicine approach to antiplatelet selection for secondary stroke prevention.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomly assigned to: (1) the treatment
      group where antiplatelet medications will be selected using platelet function phenotype
      and/or key pharmacogene genotypes (2) the control group where participants will receive
      standard care for antiplatelet therapy (without knowledge of phenotype or genotype).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Provide signed and dated informed consent form.

          -  Willing to comply with all study procedures and be available for the duration of the
             study.

          -  Meet criteria for a mild or moderate ischemic stroke or high-risk TIA

          -  Ability to randomize within 30 hours of stroke symptom onset/last seen normal time

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence of new or prior non-traumatic intracerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid
             hemorrhage, or subdural hemorrhage on initial head CT

          -  Evidence of a central nervous system tumor, abscess, intracranial aneurysm or
             vascular/structural malformation, or any neuro-inflammatory, neuro-infectious, or
             neurodegenerative disorder on neuroimaging or exam that could confound a participant's
             functional outcome

          -  Isolated or pure sensory symptoms (e.g., numbness), visual changes, or
             &quot;dizziness&quot;/vertigo without evidence of acute ischemic stroke on baseline head CT or
             MRI.

          -  Qualifying ischemic event is believed to be iatrogenic or procedure related

          -  Required to take a specific antiplatelet medication for an indication other than
             ischemic stroke during the study period that would prevent the investigator from
             following the study algorithm

          -  Etiology of qualifying ischemic event is known to be cardioembolic

          -  High likelihood that anticoagulation will be needed during the study period.

          -  High likelihood that carotid endarterectomy or carotid stenting will occur during the
             period of the study.

          -  Pre-stroke modified Rankin scale (mRS) score ≥ 3

          -  Evidence of frailty

          -  Contraindication to aspirin, clopidogrel, Aggrenox®, or ticagrelor

          -  Known allergy or hypersensitivity that would prevent the investigator from following
             the study algorithm

          -  Any history of moderate to severe drug-induced adverse events

          -  Renal insufficiency or history of kidney transplant

          -  Hepatic impairment, international normalized ratio (INR) &gt; 1.5, physical
             manifestations of liver disease, or history of liver transplant

          -  Any history of bradycardia without pacemaker placement

          -  Active obstructive lung disease

          -  Any active hematologic disorder

          -  Active bleeding diathesis

          -  Any systemic hemorrhage or GI bleed in the 3 months prior to the qualifying stroke

          -  Active peptic ulcer disease

          -  Women who self-report that they are pregnant or breastfeeding

          -  Active alcohol or substance abuse or dependence

          -  Inability or failure to provide informed consent.

          -  Inability of the patient to adhere to study procedures and/or follow-up, in the
             opinion of the investigative team

          -  Inability to swallow oral medications

          -  Not willing or able to discontinue prohibited concomitant medications

          -  Ongoing participation in another non-observational clinical study

          -  Life expectancy &lt; 1 year, in the opinion of the investigative team
