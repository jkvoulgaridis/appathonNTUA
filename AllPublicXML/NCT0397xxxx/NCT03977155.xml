    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to evaluate in participants with diarrhea-predominant Irritable
      Bowel Syndrome (IBS-D) the abdominal pain response to BOS-589 after 4 weeks of treatment and
      to evaluate the overall safety and tolerability of BOS-589 in the treatment of IBS-D during 4
      weeks of treatment, relative to placebo (PBO).

                  (appendectomy, hemorrhoidectomy, or polypectomy greater than 3 months
                  post-surgery are allowed).

          -  Confirmed alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt; 2 upper limit of normal (ULN)

             Gilbert's syndrome

          -  Evidence of active hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection or
             Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 or HIV-2 antibody positive

          -  Evidence of HCV infection based on a positive HCV antibody screen (Participants who
