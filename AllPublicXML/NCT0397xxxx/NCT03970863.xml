      Traditional treatments for localized prostate cancer are radical prostatectomy and
      radiotherapy. However, they would carry side effects including urinary incontinence, sexual
      dysfunction, radiation cystitis and proctitis, leading to great impact on quality of life.
      Focal therapy of is another emerging treatment strategy for localized prostate cancer. It
      aims on ablation of the tumor with sparing of healthy prostatic tissue in order to minimize
      the injury to urinary and sexual function. Besides, owing to the improvement of
      multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI), the investigators can localize the
      prostate cancer more precisely and the accessibility of focal therapy is also increased.

      Literature showed focal ablation of HIFU or cryotherapy for low and intermediate-risk
      prostate cancer patients yielded in brilliant outcomes. Biopsy in post-treatment one year
      showed 87% and 94.6% were negative for clinically significant cancer, respectively. Up to 92%
      of patients did not need salvage treatment in two years. Ninety-one to one hundred precent of
      patients had no urinary incontinence, and 74% and 81.5% had no erectile dysfunction,
      respectively.

      This prospective study aims to evaluate the cancer control and quality of life for prostate
      cancer patients treated with focal therapy.
