      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of occupational therapy in
      subthreshold attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subthreshold attention deficit hyperactivity disorder may occur in a subset of children who
      are possibly more sensitive to their environment. Therefore, it is very important to target
      the elimination of symptoms with appropriate preventive therapies before this disorder
      occurs. One of the promising preventive therapy option may be occupational therapy.

      Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder can have a negative impact on occupational
      performance such as: activities of daily living, education, resting, sleeping, playing and
      social participation. Occupational therapists are able to provide interventions to improve
      engagement in daily activities on social skills, play, executive functioning, impulsivity,
      inattention, and motor coordination.

      Although the guidelines about the treatment of ADHD are primarily medically and
      psychologically based, certain treatment components are useful for occupational therapy
      practice; for example, behavioural management of the child and psychoeducational programmes
      for families.

      However, treatment recommendations for subthreshold ADHD cases or the population at risk are
      limited. This study investigates the effectiveness of occupational therapy in subthreshold
      attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Dunn Sensory Profile</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Sensory Profile is a 125-item questionnaire filled out by the caregiver that describe responses to sensory events in daily life. It is a 5-point Likert scale how frequently the child uses that response to particular sensory events. This instrument evaluates the possible effects of sensory processing to a child's performance.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>K-SADS-PL</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The K-SADS-PL is a semi-structured interview scale, which is widely used and enables evaluation in 20 different diagnostic domains.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Conner's parent rating scale</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Conner's parent rating scale-revised: short form (CPRS-R:S): This standard measure is used as a diagnostic tool of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. It consists of 27 items, each rated on a 4-point Likert scale (0=not true at all to 3=very much true). It has four subscales which are oppositional, hyperactivity, cognitive problems and ADHD index.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Conners' Teacher Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Conners' Teacher Rating Scale- revised: short form (CTRS-R:S): This is a commonly used measure of behavioral problems associated with ADHD, which originally was developed as a measure of behavioral change for pharmacological studies. It is also 28 items (sixteen overlap with the original short-form). The CTRS-R:S has three scales which are Oppositional, Cognitive Problems/Inattention, and Hyperactivity.</description>

    <measure>Canadian Occupational Performance Measure</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Canadian Occupational Performance measure (COPM) is an outcome measure and semi-structured interview. It is a measure for identify goals in the areas of self-care, productivity and leisure/play that they have difficulty performing. In this study, each child selected three to five goals, and then parents and children rated performance and satisfaction on all goals using a 10-point scale. Changes in scores on baseline and end of therapy are determined separately. An increase of two or more points indicates clinically significant change.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) Scale:</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI scale was developed for use in clinical trials to provide a brief assessment of the clinician's view of the patient's functioning. The CGI has two components—the CGI-Severity (CGI-S), which rates illness severity (1=normal, not at all ill; 2=borderline mentally ill; 3=mildly ill; 4=moderately ill; 5=markedly ill; 6=severely ill; 7=among the most extremely ill) and the CGI-Improvement(CGI-I) (1=very much improved; 2=much improved; 3=minimally improved; 4=no change from baseline; 5=minimally worse; 6= much worse; 7=very much worse) which rates change from the initiation of treatment.</description>
