      Older adults with cancer remain underrepresented in cancer clinical trials that establish new
      standards of care. Geriatric assessment (GA) is defined by geriatricians as a
      multidimensional interdisciplinary assessment of the general health stat us of the older
      patient, reviewing the medical, psychosocial, functional and environmental domains. For each
      domain, several tools are available, but consensus is lacking on which tool to use and the
      optimal cut-offs or threshold scores. The literature supports the prognostic value of the GA
      and its utility in weighing the benefits and risks of cancer treatments in older adults.
      However, GA has not been implemented in routine oncology practice or in cancer clinical
      trials.

      The objective of this project is to develop a set of geriatric data, the Geriatric Core
      Dataset (G-CODE), to be collected in cancer trials of older patients. The methods rely on a
      consensus process involving international experts in the field of oncology and geriatrics.

      Although cancer is prevalent in the older segment of the population, older adults with cancer
      remain underrepresented in cancer clinical trials that establish new standards of care. As a
      result, robust data on the benefit/risk balance are lacking for many treatment strategies in
      these patients.

      Ageing is a heterogeneous process that stresses the clinical need to identify comorbid
      conditions and ageing-related physiologic changes, both well-known factors increasing the
      risk of treatment side-effects and poor outcomes.

      Geriatric assessment (GA) is defined by geriatricians as a multidimensional interdisciplinary
      assessment of the general health stat us of the older patient, reviewing the medical,
      psychosocial, functional and environmental domains. For each domain, several tools are
      available, but consensus is lacking on which tool to use and the optimal cut-offs or
      threshold scores. The literature supports the prognostic value of the GA and its utility in
      weighing the benefits and risks of cancer treatments in older adults. However, GA has not
      been implemented in routine oncology practice or in cancer clinical trials.

      In 2011, after a workshop on clinical trial methodology in older adults with cancer, the
      Elderly Task Force of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)
      recommended the use of a standardised minimum data set (minDS) for assessing the global
      health and functional status of older populations. This minDS consisted of the G8 screening
      tool, the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Following a consensus approach, a panel of
      14 geriatricians from oncology clinics identified seven domains of importance in geriatric
      assessment. Based on the international recommendations, geriatricians selected the mostly
      commonly used tools/items for geriatric assessment by domain. The Geriatric Core Dataset
      (G-CODE) was progressively developed according to RAND appropriateness ratings and feedback
      during three successive Delphi rounds. The face validity of the G-CODE was assessed with two
      large panels of health professionals (55 national and 42 international experts) involved both
      in clinical practice and cancer trials.

      After the last Delphi round, the tools/items proposed for the G-CODE were the following: (1)
      social assessment: living alone or support requested to stay at home; (2) functional
      autonomy: Activities of Daily Living (ADL) questionnaire and short instrumental ADL
      questionnaire; (3) mobility: Timed Up and Go test; (4) nutrition: weight loss during the past
      6 months and body mass index; (5) cognition: Mini-Cog test; (6) mood: mini-Geriatric
      Depression Scale and (7) comorbidity: updated Charlson Comorbidity Index. More than 70% of
      national experts (42 from 20 cities) and international experts (31 from 13 countries)
      participated. National and international surveys showed good acceptability of the G-CODE.
      Specific points discussed included age-year cut-off, threshold of each tool/item and
      information about social support, but no additional item was proposed.

      A formal consensus was reached on a set of geriatric data to be collected in cancer trials of
      older patients. The dissemination and prospective use of the G-CODE is needed to assess its
      utility.
