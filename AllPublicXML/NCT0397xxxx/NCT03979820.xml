  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the study is investigate the effect of escalating doses of oral
      tyramine on systolic blood pressure (SBP) at baseline and following an oral treatment with BI
      1467335 up to 39 days at a low or high dose once daily compared to placebo and phenelzine
      (Nardil®) as positive control.

               -  Use of adequate contraception, e.g. any of the following methods plus condom:
                  implants, injectables, combined oral or vaginal contraceptives, intrauterine
                  device (in case of oral contraceptives start of contraception at least 30 days

             is confirmatory) Alternatively, true abstinence is acceptable when it is in line with
             the subject's preferred and usual lifestyle. If a subject is usually not sexually

             requirements, or has a condition that would not allow safe participation in the study

          -  Use of monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors within 90 days before tyramine dosing

          -  Use of fluoxetine within 5 weeks before tyramine dosing
