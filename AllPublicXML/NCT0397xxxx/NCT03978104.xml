  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research project aims to provide the scientific findings about the beneficial effects of
      okara (soybean pulp) consumption on gut and glycaemic health in middle-aged and older
      individuals in Singapore. In addition, it aims to examine the health promoting impact of
      bio-transformed okara in this population. We hypothesise that consuming a habitual diet with
      an okara (untreated or bio-transformed) incorporated food product will improve the gut
      microbiome composition and will increase the production of short chain fatty acids when
      compared to a same diet with no okara. Okara-based food product can also improve the
      glycaemic response in individuals compared to a product without okara in meal tolerance test
      (acute).

      For this double-blind, randomized, crossover experiment, the participants will complete a
      16-week study period. Following a 1-wk pre-intervention baseline period, each participant
      will be randomly assigned to consume their habitual diet that either contains or do not
      contain okara food product (untreated and bio-transformed okara) for 3 weeks. The food
      product will be equivalent to a consumption of 20 g of okara (dried) per day. Following a
      3-week dietary 'washout' period, the participants will be assigned to consume the other diets
      for another 3 weeks. This process will be repeated until each participant have completed all
      three interventions. Fecal and fasting-state blood samples will be obtained at study weeks 1,
      4, 7, 10, 13, and 16, which correspond to before and end of the three 3-week intervention
      periods.

      Additionally, during Weeks 1, 7 and 13, fasted participants will also be required to undergo
      a meal tolerance test. A cannula will first be inserted into the participant's forearm for
      blood sampling by a trained phlebotomist. One of three meals prepared by designated study
      personnel will then be randomly assigned during each visit, namely, control biscuit,
      untreated okara biscuit and bio-transformed okara biscuit. During each test, the participants
      will eat the prepared meal within 10 minutes and have blood samples drawn by intravenous
      cannulation at time = 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 180 and 240 min, with time 0 being the time
      the participants first start eating the biscuits. The blood samples will analyzed for the
      postprandial blood glucose, insulin responses and lipid levels.
