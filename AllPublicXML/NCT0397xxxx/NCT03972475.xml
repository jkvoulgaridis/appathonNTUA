    <textblock>
      The amount of fluids characterized as non-resuscitation fluids given to ICU patients are
      likely to be high and will probably have a substantial impact on the total amount of fluid
      administered to ICU patients daily. It will most likely also influence on the total fluid
      balance and the negative outcome of fluid overload.

      The aim of our study is to investigate the amount of fluid given as maintenance fluids in the
      ICU and the impact of this fluid on total fluid balance.

      Fluid therapy is an important part in both prevention and treatment of shock and multiple
      organ dysfunction in the ICU. However, the risks of giving patients too much fluids resulting
      in fluid has been gaining increased focus during recent years. Numerous studies regarding the
      amount of resuscitation fluid given to ICU patients have been performed, as well as
      investigations regarding factors that trigger the decision to deliver a fluid challenge to
      the patients. Likewise, multiple studies reveal that a more restrictive use of resuscitation
      fluids often lead to a better outcome for our patients.

      However, data regarding the amount of maintenance fluids and the effect of maintenance fluids
      on fluid balance and consequently outcome remain sparse. One major difficulty is that there
      is no universal definition of the term maintenance fluid. Some researchers include all fluids
      that is not considered resuscitation fluids, i.e. fluids given to administer drugs, to keep
      peripheral and central venous catheters functioning, administration of basal fluid needs and
      nutrition, while others exclude fluids covering basal needs and nutrition from the
      definition.

    <description>To register the volume of fluid given to ICU patients categorized as resuscitation fluid, fluid to cover basal needs and nutrition and as fluid given to administer drugs and keeping intravenous accesses functioning. This will be measured i milliliters of fluid that the patients receive intravenously and orally by studying patient charts manually from their stay in the ICU.</description>

    <description>To relate the quantity of maintenance fluid given to the patients with their theoretical fluid needs, by counting their needs (basal need of 30 mls/kg/day, previous losses and ongoing losses) and comparing it to the amount of fluid that the patient has actually received (by going through patient charts from their ICU stay).</description>
