  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BOR15001L7 is a natural product. The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate its
      non-inferiority to docosanol 10% based on the healing time of cold sores in patients with
      recurrent herpes labialis.

      Secondary objectives are to:

        1. Evaluate the efficacy of BOR1500L7 on:

             -  The reduction of ulcerative lesions rates following the prodromal stage;

             -  The extension of the delay prior to first ulcerative lesions occurence following
                the prodromal stage;

             -  The decrease of cumulative ulcerative lesions dimensions during papule, vesicles,
                ulcers/soft and hard crust stages;

             -  The decrease of symptoms intensity (pain, tingling, itching, burning sensation)
                during prodromal, erythema, papule, vesicles, ulcers/soft crust, hard crust,
                re-epithelialize stages;

             -  The reduction of symptoms duration (pain, tingling, itching, burning sensation)
                during the prodromal, erythema, papule, vesicles, ulcers/soft crust, hard crust,
                re-epithelialize stages in subjects with recurrent herpes labialis;

        2. Evaluate the safety and tolerability of BOR15001L7 in subjects with recurrent herpes
           labialis

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Provide signed informed consent and willing to comply with study-related procedures;

          -  Males and females ≥18 years of age at screening;

          -  Diagnosed with recurrent herpes labialis, defined as showing at least 2 episodes of
             infections per year;

          -  Willing to avoid, during the treatment phase, the use of anti-inflammatory,
             anti-herpetic, antibiotic and antiviral agents as well as steroids or other natural
             products that would interfere with the immune system response (exception: only the use
             of valacyclovir will be permitted, if prescribed);

          -  Willing to avoid, during the treatment phase, the use of cosmetic products (ex. cream,
             make-up, etc.) at areas close to the infected region.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with skin disease affecting the peribuccal region (eczema, psoriasis,
             dermatitis, etc.);

          -  Patients with herpes labialis occurring within 14 days prior to screening;

          -  Patients known for allergies or intolerance to drug and comparator ingredients, or any
             cream used to treat skin conditions;

          -  Treatment with an investigational product or biological agent or device within 30 days
             or five half˗lives, whichever is longer.

          -  Any other condition, which, in the opinion of the investigator or the sponsor would
             make the patient unsuitable for inclusion, or could interfere with the conduct of the
             study.
