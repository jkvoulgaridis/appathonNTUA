  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy of an innovative 6-month
      smartphone-delivered intervention using simplified monitoring of dietary intake compared to a
      smartphone-delivered intervention with standard calorie monitoring among parents with
      overweight or obesity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 6-month randomized controlled trial comparing the efficacy of two smartphone-based
      dietary and weight change interventions among 70 parent-child dyads with at least one child
      between the ages of 2 and 12 (70 adults and 70 children ages 2-12). One intervention group
      (Simple) will use a simplified, low-burden form of dietary tracking in the study smartphone
      application and the other group (Standard) will use standard calorie tracking. Components of
      both interventions include (1) setting personalized goals for weight, dietary intake, and
      daily activity (2) adaptive text message interventions based on behavior change techniques
      such as goal setting and in-the-moment progress feedback several times per week, (3) weekly
      tailored feedback updated in the study smartphone app, and (4) weekly lessons on the
      smartphone app. The primary objective is to promote weight loss in the parents, and the
      secondary objective is to determine if one or both interventions produce a ripple effect of
      parent dietary change onto dietary changes in the child.

    <measure>Minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 Months, 6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity as measured by the Paffenbarger Physical Activity Questionnaire, from baseline to 3, and 6 months. The PPAQ is a self-administered questionnaire that asks for a recall of physical activity over the previous 1 week. Participants report how many days and for how many minutes each day they engage in brisk walking, and report other exercise activities that week (non-occupational and non-household-related), including how many days and for how many minutes each time. Activities are assigned MET values according to the Compendium of Physical Activities, when are then used to classify activities as light moderate, or vigorous, and are also assigned energy expenditure amounts in kcal. These values are used to calculate total energy expenditure in kcal/week, as well as energy expenditure from and total minutes engaged in moderate-to-vigorous activities, measured in kcal/week and minutes/week, respectively.</description>

There are 80 total items, 32 unhealthy items and 48 healthy items. Participants report whether each food/drink item is in the home or not (yes or no), and the items are summed for an unhealthy total and healthy total, and may also be used to total number of sugar-sweetened beverages/juice (out of 8 items), caloric beverages (15 items), fruits (17 items), vegetables (14 items), high-fat high-calorie items (20 items), and low-fat low-calorie items (14 items). Higher numbers indicate greater amounts of those types of food in the home.</description>

This consists of 50 items across 6 subscales, summed to create a total score for each: structure of family meals (10 items, score range 0-40), problematic child mealtime behaviors (20 items, range 0-70), use of food as a reward (6 items, range 0-24), parental concern about child's diet (17 items, range 0-85), spousal stress related to child's mealtime behaviors (4 items, score range 4-20), and influence of child's food preferences on what other family members eat (3 items, range 2-14). Higher scores indicate higher instances of use of the scale in question (ex: greater structure of family meals, greater use of food as a reward, etc.).</description>
