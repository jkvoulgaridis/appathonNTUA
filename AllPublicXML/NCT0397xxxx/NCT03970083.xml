      This research is studying the level of oxygen in tumors during the brachytherapy procedure.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tumors with low levels of oxygen have been found to be more resistant to standard radiation
      and chemotherapy treatments. For patients with tumors with low oxygen levels, it is not well
      known if higher radiation doses can overcome treatment resistance to radiation. Currently,
      there are limited ways of measuring tumor oxygen levels. The investigators believe that
      measuring tumor oxygen levels during the brachytherapy procedure will allow the investigators
      to develop better and improved oxygen measurement techniques, and ultimately improve clinical
      outcomes for patients, such as better local tumor control.

      This research study is a Pilot Study, meaning that this is the first time investigators are
      examining the oxygen sensor being used. This study is designed to test the oxygen sensor's
      ability to measure the oxygen levels within the participant's cervical tumor with the aid of
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. MRI scans use magnets to make detailed images of the
      participant's tumor and the surrounding normal tissues during the brachytherapy procedure.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants must have a biopsy-proven diagnosis of cervical cancer for which
             interstitial brachytherapy is planned as standard treatment

          -  Age 18 years or older

          -  ECOG performance status of 2 or less (see Appendix A)

          -  Patients who have received prior radiation or chemotherapy may be enrolled on this
             study

          -  Participant is deemed to be an appropriate candidate for MR-guided brachytherapy by
             the radiation oncologist and the patient elects to be treated with MR-guided
             brachytherapy

          -  Participant provides informed consent for prospective collection of relevant medical
             records for analysis of clinical outcome and treatment-planning techniques

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.
             Participant is willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the
             study including undergoing treatment and scheduled visits and examinations including
             follow- up

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants who have a contraindication to MRI identified by the MR procedure
             screening form, such as a pacemaker, aneurysm clip, inner ear implant,
             neurostimulator, or other non-MR-compatible device or implant

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements
