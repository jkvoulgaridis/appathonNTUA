  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aquatic cycling is becoming more popular as it appears to be more suitable for men and women
      even with poor physical activity level. Commercial tagline highlight beneficial effect of
      this activity on weight management. However there are poor information concerning the energy
      response induced by this activity. The aim of this project is to investigate effect of water
      temperature on energetic response (energy expenditure and food intake) of cycling exercise in
      water in normal weight and overweight premenopausal women.

      After inclusion visit, all subject will be submitted to DXA to obtain body composition data.
      Then subjects will be submitted to four experimental session in a semi-randomized order. For
      all those session, subjects will take a standardized breakfast (570kcal) three hours before
      experimental session.

      Control session (CON): subject will stand sited without any activity during 40 min.

      Subjects will be submitted to three aquatic cycling exercise session:

        -  session 27°C :aquatic cycling at 27°C without water jet during 40 min

        -  session 27°C+ water jets : aquatic cycling at 27 °C with water jets during 40 min

        -  session 18°C : aquatic cycling at 187°C without water jet during 40 min Every exercise
           session will be set at 70% of theorical maximal heart rate During each session, oxygen
           consumption and carbon dioxide production will be analysed with gas analysis system.
           Appetite and hunger sensation will be measured with a specific scale at different time
           point of each day of experimental session. Thirty minutes after the end of each
           experimental session subjects will have a buffet meal for lunch time.
