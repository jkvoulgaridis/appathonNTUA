  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to test the hypothesis that consumption of watercress, a rich
      source of the cancer chemopreventive agent 2-phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC), will enhance
      the detoxification of multiple environmental toxicants and carcinogens, particularly in
      subjects who are null for glutathione-S-transferase M1 (GSTM1), glutathione-S-transferase T1
      (GSTT1), or both. If our hypothesis is supported by the results of the trial, watercress
      could emerge as an inexpensive and plentiful dietary constituent which could promote good
      health by decreasing the effects of environmental stressors.
