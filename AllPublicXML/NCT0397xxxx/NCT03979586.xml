    <textblock>
      The main endpoint will be to evaluate the efficacy of laser-assisted hyaluronic acid delivery
      by fractional CO2 laser in facial skin remodeling. The secondary endpoint will be to confirm
      the safety of this protocol compared to a standard treatment by fractional CO2 laser.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fractional CO2 lasers are already used in skin remodeling. They can also create vertical
      channels to enhance topical drug delivery deep into the dermis. Combining the efficacy of
      fractional CO2 laser to laser-assisted hyaluronic acid delivery has not yet being studied,
      the combination of these two techniques could improve facial skin remodeling.

    <description>The primary judgment criterion will be the improvement at 3 months of at least one of the skin remodeling parameters (cutaneous texture, firmness, fine lines, radiance) at least 2 points greater (on a scale of 0 to 10) on fractional laser and hyaluronic acid-treated hemiface compared to fractional laser and control saline-treated hemiface.</description>

    <description>The study will be conducted in the Laser Dermatological and Plastic Center of the Conception Hospital in Marseille. It will be a prospective, controlled, hemiface, single-blind, independent-evaluator pilot study of 20 patients, 30 to 70 years old, with phototype I to IV (Fitzpatrick scale). By this study in hemiface, each patient will be his own witness. Neither the patient nor the examining doctor will know the choice of the hemiface of application of hyaluronic acid. This will be a single-blind study with independent evaluator. Patients will be included for 3 months, and followed for a period of 3 months.</description>

    <description>The facial skin remodeling corresponds to a request for repair treatment on the stigmas of heliodermia, irregularity of cutaneous texture, dyschromias, loss of radiance of the complexion, fine lines, as well as on the fine scars of the face for example, the finely depressed cicatrices sequellaires acne.</description>
