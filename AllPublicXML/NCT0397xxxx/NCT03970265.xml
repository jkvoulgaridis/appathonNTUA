  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infections are critical factors for the survival of critically ill patients. A serious
      problem is the high variability of antibiotic concentrations in critically ill patients. This
      may result in the risk of underdosage with possible ineffective therapeutic levels as well as
      in the risk of overdosage with possible adverse and toxic effects. Essential for the
      effectiveness of antibiotic therapy is the antibiotic concentration at target site. The goal
      of this study is to establish a method to extract Interstitial Lung Fluid (ILF) and
      Epithelial Lining Fluid (ELF) for antibiotic concentration measurements in patients following
      lung Transplantation and to calculate a tissue/serum concentration ratio. Improved knowledge
      regarding tissue penetration of Antibiotics may help to optimize drug dosing and management.

      Informed consent will be obtained prior to inclusion. 30 patients following lung
      Transplantation at the University Hospital of Munich will be included in this study.
      Intravenous Meropenem will be administered as perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis for lung
      transplantation. Interstitial Lung Fluid and Epithelial Lining Fluid will be extracted
      immediately after explantation of the lung from explanted lung tissue. Concentrations of
      antibiotics will be determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in ILF
      and ELF. Serum samples will be collected according to our in clinical routine established
      therapeutic drug monitoring. Tissue/Serum concentration ratio will be calculated. ELF will be
      collected on postoperative day 1-5 when bronchoscopy is performed during clinical routine.
      Numerous clinical and laboratory parameters will be determined. The investigators expect that
      correlations between antibiotic target site and blood concentrations and clinical and
      laboratory parameters will be found.
