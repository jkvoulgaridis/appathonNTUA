  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This grant compares the effects of cigarette smoking, protonated nicotine (&quot;salt&quot;) aerosol,
      and unprotonated nicotine aerosol on nicotine delivery, nicotine craving, and other outcomes
      in cigarette smokers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine differences in nicotine delivery, user behavior,
      subjective effects, and physiological effects, when cigarette smokers use a nicotine &quot;salt&quot;
      (protonated) aerosol, relative to an unprotonated aerosol or their own brand of cigarettes.
