      This study will compare two methods of vacuum (peristaltic or venturi) commonly used during
      the removal of a femtosecond treated cataract. The investigators will observe which method
      uses less energy, is gentler on the eye, reduces corneal swelling and if the vision recovers
      faster with one method compared to the other.

    <textblock>
      This is an open, prospective, randomized study to evaluate efficiency and outcomes of
      femtosecond laser cataract surgery with phacoemulsification performed with one of two
      standard vacuum systems.

      It is estimated that the duration of study participation will be up to 24 months.

      There will be randomization to 1 of 2 groups. Both eyes of each subject will be enrolled in
      the study. The first eye will be randomized to either the Venturi or peristaltic-based vacuum
      pump. The second eye will then receive the other type of vacuum pump for that procedure.

      Study Phases:

      Pre-operative Visit Procedure Post-operative Follow up The subject will be seen 1 day, 5-10
      days, and 90 days following the procedure.

      Surgical Procedure

        -  The cataract removal procedure will be performed under sterile technique and according
           to standard procedures. The femtosecond laser treatment will be followed by
           phacoemulsification removal of the cataract and implantation of an intraocular lens.

        -  Peri-operatively, subjects will be treated with a regimen of antibiotic, steroid and
           nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory eye drops per standard of care.

        -  All surgeries will be performed by the same experienced surgeon/principal investigator
           using the Catalys® SYSTEM femtosecond laser platform and WHITESTAR SIGNATURE® PRO
           Phacoemulsification System.

        -  Phacoemulsification Settings:

             -  For Venturi pump: 600 mmHg vacuum

             -  For Peristaltic-based pump: 600 mmHg vacuum and aspiration flow of 50 mL/min

             -  Other settings: ultrasound energy application parameters will be the same for the
                two groups

      Study Procedures

        -  The study will include routine cataract pre-operative testing with Nidek OPD, Galilei
           G4, and IOLMaster, and repeated at the post-op visits. An endothelial cell count of the
           cornea will be performed at the pre-operative visit and at the 90 day follow up visit.

        -  Subjects will be randomized to phacoemulsification settings of Venturi vacuum of 600
           mmHg or peristaltic vacuum of 600 mmHg and aspiration flow of 50 mL/min. All other
           phacoemulsification settings will be identical. The laser settings will be based on the
           grade of cataract only and will not be altered for this study.

        -  The phacoemulsification time, energy Ellips FX EFX, and average phacoemulsification
           energy will be recorded. The laser procedure time and total procedure time will be
           recorded. Complications will be recorded. Additional patient characteristics will also
           be recorded.

    <description>The venturi pump makes use of the venturi effect to create a vacuum. The venturi effect creates a vacuum by the flow of a fluid, typically air, over an opening. In many phacoemulsification machines, this requires nitrogen tanks or a self-contained air compressor. The vacuum level is created within a rigid drainage cassette, to which the phaco aspiration tubing is connected. Since there is no milking of the aspiration line, the phaco tubing can be made rigid with low compliance.</description>

  </intervention>

    <intervention_type>Device</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Peristaltic vacuum pump</intervention_name>
    <description>The peristaltic pump uses rollers to compress the phacoemulsification outflow tubing in a peristaltic manner, thereby creating flow and vacuum. The compression of the rollers on the tubing with the rotation of the pump physically moves fluid and creates a continuous &quot;milking&quot; action on the fluid column, The phaco machine can directly control this flow level, hence the term flow based, however, the preset vacuum level is only achieved once there is occlusion of the outflow line, typically at the phaco needle tip with cataract material.</description>
