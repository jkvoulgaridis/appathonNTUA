    <textblock>
      The goal of the study was to evaluate the pravalence of Rathke's Cleft Cyst of children under
      15 years of age and demonstrate that their prevalence is higher than for patients over 15
      years of age, due to their embryonic origin. It is also aimed to describe their aspect on MRI
      and evaluate the interobserver agreement in the detection of Rathke's Cleft Cyst.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rathke's cleft cysts (RCC) are benign cystic lesions in the sellar region and correspond to
      embryonic remnants of the Rathke's pouch. The prevalence of RCC in the literature is higher
      in adults than in children, but the data for children is limited and outdated. The hypothesis
      is that the frequency of RCC has been underestimated in children and that it actually
      decreases with age, especially in adults. The main objective of this descriptive study is to
      study the prevalence and signal of RCC in children under 15 years of age.

      460 encephalic MRIs of children under 15 years of age comprising at least one sagittal
      sequence without T1-weighted injection and/or a T2 sagittal sequence adapted to the study of
      the pituitary gland, were analyzed retrospectively. Examination analyses was performed
      blindly by two radiologists for serous RCC, hypersignal on T2-weighted and isosignal
      T1-weighted sequences, and mucosal RCC, hyposignal on T2-weighted sequences and hyper or
      isosignal on T1-weighted sequences. The results were consensually read in case of
      disagreement on the presence or absence of an RCC.

      Of the 460 patients included, the prevalence of RCC was 3% (14/460). 21% of the RCC cases
      (3/14) were serous and 79% (11/14) were mucosal. Of the 14 patients with RCC, a
      post-pituitary cyst was also found. The interobserver agreement was strong with a Cohen kappa
      coefficient of 0.85.

      The prevalence of RCC in children under 15 years of age (3%) is higher than that described in
      the literature (1.2%) and is close to that of adults (3.9%). RCCs are thus intra-sellar
      lesions of relatively frequent discovery in children, i.e. to identify in order to not
      erroneously lead to a differential diagnosis including tumors which would lead to a different
      prognosis, management, and follow-up.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  children aged 15 or under at the time that an MRI was performed exploring the sellar
             region

          -  MRI with at least T1 spin echo (SE) sagittal slices with a slice thickness of 2.5 or 3
             mm with inter-slice spacing of 0.3 mm and T2 SE with a slice thickness of 2 mm and
             inter-slice spacing of 0.2 mm.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with incomplete MRI protocol

          -  Patients whose MRI images had artifacts (patient movement, presence of dental
             material)

          -  Patients with suspected pituitary pathology due to endocrine symptomatology (growth
             retardation, puberty delay, diabetes insipidus) that could be attributed to an
             intrasellar injury were also excluded.
