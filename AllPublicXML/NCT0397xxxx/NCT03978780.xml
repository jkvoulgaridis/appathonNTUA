  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Both serratus plane and erector spinae fascial plane blocks are described to produce local
      anesthetic spread to the nerves innervating the axilla. Investigators think that the serratus
      plane block is more reliable for blocking axillary innervation. Investigators hypothesized
      that the serratus plane block provides superior postoperative analgesia for breast surgery
      involving the axilla.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The serratus anterior block provides postoperative analgesia for breast and axillary surgery.
      The axilla is an anatomical area with complex innervation and significant contribution to
      postoperative pain. Injection of local anesthetics in the serratus muscle fascial plane
      results in blocking the intercostal nerves T2-T6 that innervate the breast, as well as the
      long thoracic, thoracodorsal and medial and lateral pectoral nerves, which innervate the
      axilla. Recently, the erector spinae plane block has been described. The block has been
      proposed as an effective and reliable technique for blocking the innervation of the breast,
      as well as the brachial plexus rami that innervate the axilla. As such, both blocks
      purportedly provide pain relief to the axilla. Investigators aimed to compare these two
      blocks to identify the technique that provides superior postoperative analgesia for breast
      surgeries involving the axilla.

    <description>The target fascial plane superficial to the serratus anterior (superficial) muscle will be identified and the path of the block needle will be determined. After local anaesthetic infiltration of the skin with 1% lidocaine, a 50-90mm mm 22G insulated block needle will be inserted at the caudal aspect of the ultrasound probe and advanced in-plane to target the fascial plane directly below the serratus muscle. Once the tip is verified in the correct position, 0.4 ml/kg (max. 30 ml) of the local anaesthetic (ropivacaine 0.5% with 1:400,000 epinephrine) will be administered slowly in 5 ml aliquots under frequent aspiration and correct spread in the interfascial plane will be observed.
In patients randomised to the serratus plane block group, using ultrasound guidance a sham subcutaneous injection of 0.5ml sterile normal saline injection will be performed at the same site of the ESP block to stimulate a real block procedure.</description>

    <description>The interfascial plane deep to the erector spinae muscle will be identified and the path of the needle determined. The path of the needle will be visualised to target the area between the erector spinae muscle and the T3 transverse process. Local anaesthetic infiltration utilising 1% lidocaine will occur, and an 80mm 22G block needle will be inserted using an in-plane cranial to caudad approach, the needle will be advanced to target the interfascial plane deep to the erector spinae muscle at the T3 transverse process. Once the needle tip is in the correct position, 0.4 ml/kg (max. 30 ml) of the local anaesthetic (ropivacaine 0.5% with 1:400,000 epinephrine) will be administered slowly in 5 ml aliquots under frequent aspiration and correct spread in the interfascial plane will be observed. After injection, patients will be closely monitored until they are transferred to the OR.</description>
