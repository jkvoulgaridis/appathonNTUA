  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac output (CO) monitoring is often required for clinical evaluation and management in
      critically ill patients and during anesthesia. There are many methods to measure CO.
      Fick-based CO estimation (Fick-CO) is one of the most commonly used methods, while
      thermodilution (TD-CO) is viewed as golden standard. But Fick-CO is still widely used,
      especially in catheterization laboratories and pediatric cardiologic department, whose
      patients often with congenital heart disease. Multiple studies from the 1960s find a strong
      correlation between TD-CO and Fick-CO. However, more recent studies reject the conclusion.
      Since Fick-CO is the ratio of oxygen consumption (V'O2) to the arteriovenous difference in
      oxygen content, many parameters are included in the Fick equation, such as V'O2, hemoglobin
      (Hb), arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2), mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2), partial
      pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2), and mixed venous oxygen tension (PvO2). Any changes of
      each parameter may influence the accuracy of Fick-CO calculation. This may be the reason why
      it remains controversial whether Fick-CO and TD-CO are interchangeable or not. Although there
      are lots of studies comparing Fick-CO and TD-CO, discussing the impact of V'O2 on Fick-CO,
      how the other parameters influence the final CO estimation are rarely focused. Therefore, the
      purpose of this study was to assess the influence of FIO2 on PaO2, SvO2, PvO2, and the
      accuracy of Fick-CO in cardiac surgery patients.

      Patients who are aged ≥20 years, are undergoing planned elective cardiac surgery, and
      provided signed informed consent are included in the present study. Any patients with cardiac
      arrhythmia or an intra-cardiac shunt are excluded.

      The patients are randomly assigned to 2 groups: FIO2 &lt;70% or FIO2 &gt;90%. And during the
      surgery, the oximeter values are kept ≥98%. Intra-operatively, FIO2, PaO2, SvO2, PvO2, Hb,
      and TD-CO are recorded.

    <description>After collecting the elements data included in the Fick eqaution (oxygen consumption, hemoglobin, SaO2, SvO2, PaO2, and PvO2), we can calculate the Fick-based cardiac output in each patient.
