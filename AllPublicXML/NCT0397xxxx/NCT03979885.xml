  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Financial incentives for motivating changes in health behavior, particularly for smoking and
      other morbid habits, are increasingly being tested by health insurers, employers, and
      government agencies. However, in using incentive programs for smoking cessation, key
      unanswered structural and theoretical questions remain regarding their effectiveness,
      acceptability to patients, and economic sustainability. This trial aims to advance the
      science and implementation of financial incentives for smoking cessation interventions among
      high-risk, hospitalized smokers. The investigators will pursue two specific aims: 1)
      comparing the impact of three approaches for smoking cessation on smoking abstinence, use of
      evidenced-based therapy, and quality of life and 2) comparing the short-term and long term
      return on investment of using goal directed and outcome-based financial incentives to promote
      smoking cessation.
