  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical studies related to immunotherapy of HNSCC have shown that PD1 monoclonal antibody
      has better clinical benefits than conventional chemotherapy. This phase II clinical study is
      a single arm, open, single-center study. The aim of this study is to observe and evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of Sintilimab combined with paclitaxel-albumin-binding for injection in
      patients with advanced recurrent and metastatic HNSCC who fail to receive first-line or more
      treatment. Participation in this study for treatment may benefit patients with advanced
      recurrence or metastasis of HNSCC.
