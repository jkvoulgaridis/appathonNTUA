  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop an artificial intelligence(AI) assisted scoring
      system, which can evaluate the disease severity and mucosal healing stage in patients with
      ulcerative colitis. Then testify whether this new scoring system can help physicians to
      enhance the accuracy of disease severity assessments in a multi-center clinical practice.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ulcerative colitis is a non-specific chronic inflammation of gut characterized by referral
      bloody stool, diarrhea and abdominal pain. Endoscopic features of the disease severity and
      mucosal healing stage are strongly associated with treatment response and prognosis in the
      future. Currently, the Mayo endoscopic sub-score (Mayo ES) and Ulcerative colitis endoscopic
      index of severity (UCEIS) are commonly recommended to guide therapeutic adjustments. However,
      the accuracy of these scales greatly relies on intra-observer and inter-observer consistency
      for lack of objective measurements. Recently, deep learning algorithm based on convolutional
      neural network (CNN) has shown multiple potential in computer-aided detection and
      computer-aided diagnose of gastrointestinal lesions. Up to now, no randomized controlled
      trials have been conducted to evaluate the performance of deep learning algorithm for
      assessing disease activity in ulcerative colitis. This study aims to train a deep learnig
      algorithm to assess severity and mucosal healing stage of ulcerative colitis using the Mayo
      ES and UCEIS scale, then testify whether the engagement of AI can improve the evaluation
      accuracy of physicians in a multi-center clinical practice.

    <measure>The scoring accuracy of Mayo ES in AI-associated group and conventional group.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The scoring accuracy of Mayo endoscopic sub-score (Mayo ES) in each group will be calculated using scores from expert group as reference standard. The Mayo ES is a 4-point scale, which classifies the endoscopic severity of ulcerative colitis into the following four categories: point 0 refers to normal or inactive disease, point 1 refers to mild disease with erythema, decreased vascular patterns and mild friability, point 2 refers to moderate disease with marked erythema, absence of vascular patterns, friability and erosions, point 3 refers to severe disease with spontaneous bleed and ulceration. The scoring accuracy of Mayo ES ranging from 0 to 3 point will be separately evaluated in both groups.</description>

    <measure>The scoring accuracy of UCEIS in AI-associated group and conventional group.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The scoring accuracy of Ulcerative colitis endoscopic index of severity (UCEIS) in each group will be separately calculated using scores from expert group as reference standard. The UCEIS is an 8-point scale consists of 3 parts: vascular pattern (point 0 refers to normal mucosa, point 1 refers to patchy obliteration of vascular pattern, point 2 refers to complete obliteration of vascular pattern), bleeding (point 0 refers to no visible blood, point 1 refers to some spots of coagulated blood, point 2 refers to free liquid, point 3 refers to frank blood in the lumen), erosions and ulcers (point 0 refers to normal mucosa, point 1 refers to erosions, point 2 refers to superficial ulcers, point 3 refers to deep ulcers. The total UCEIS score summarized by the above 3 parts will be analyzed. The scoring accuracy of UCEIS ranging from 0 to 8 point will be separately evaluated in both group.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The accuracy of mucosal healing judgements using Mayo ES in each group.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The accuracy of mucosal healing judgements using Mayo ES will be calculated in each group. Assessments from expert group will be used as reference standard. Complete mucosal healing is defined as point 0 in Mayo ES scale, which refers to normal or inactive disease.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The accuracy of mucosal healing judgements using UCEIS in each group.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The accuracy of mucosal healing judgements using UCEIS will also be calculated in each group. Assessments from expert group will be used as reference standard. Complete mucosal healing is defined as point 0 in UCEIS scale, which refers to normal vascular pattern without bleeding, erosions and ulceration.</description>

    <description>Patients in this group go through a flexible colonoscopy under the AI monitoring device. During the withdrawal process, inflammatory lesions are detected by AI-associated scoring system. Pictures are automatically captured and analyzed by the computer. The Mayo ES and UCEIS sores will be calculated and presented on a second screen, providing a reference for the physician to evaluate the disease severity and mucosal healing stage of the patient. Biopsies will be taken from inflammatory region for histological examination. Videos will be recorded and re-evaluated by a group of experts to determine the final Mayo ES and UCEIS scores.</description>
