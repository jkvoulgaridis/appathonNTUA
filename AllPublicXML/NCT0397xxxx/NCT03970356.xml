  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a tailored multifaceted antibiotic
      stewardship intervention reduces antibiotic use for urinary tract infections in residential
      care homes and nursing homes attended by general practitioners. This will be evaluated in a
      pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial using a modified community-based participatory
      action research approach.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale:

      Almost 60% of antibiotics in frail elderly is prescribed for alleged UTI. About half of the
      antibiotics for UTI in this population are prescribed for non-specific signs and symptoms; a
      substantial part of these prescriptions might not be necessary.

      Research question:

      Does a tailored multifaceted antibiotic stewardship intervention reduce antibiotic use for
      UTI in residential care homes and nursing homes attended by general practitioners (GPs)?

      Study design, setting and population:

      A pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial using a modified community-based
      participatory action research approach. In the intervention group the latest UTI guidelines
      (which are standard care) are actively implemented at the level of the GP/caregivers.
      Residents ≥ 70 year with ADL dependency from 34 care homes + attending GP practices will
      participate in Norway, Sweden, Poland and the Netherlands.

      Methods:

      The study has two measurement periods; a baseline period (5 months) and a follow-up period (7
      months). In between the antibiotic stewardship intervention will be tailored and implemented
      in intervention practices. GPs will prospectively register suspected UTIs on standardized
      registration forms and (study) nurses/assistants will follow-up patients at day 7 and day 21
      for each UTI.

      Patients will be enrolled prior to the start of the study.

        -  June-August 2019: patient are recruited, informed consent is obtained, baseline
           characteristics of patients are recorded

        -  Sept 2019: study starts (from this moment onwards, the outcomes are being assessed).

      Data analysis:

      The primary analysis will be to assess the number of prescriptions of antibiotics for
      suspected UTI in the follow-up period, correcting for the baseline period and controlled for
      pre-specified confounders, using a generalized linear mixed model for Poisson distributions.

    <intervention_model_description>The investigators will perform a pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial (cRCT). The targeted population consists of frail elderly residents of residential care homes and nursing homes attended by general practitioners. The clusters (care home + general practitioners) are assigned to intervention- or control group. In the intervention group, an antibiotic stewardship intervention is actively implemented at the level of the general practitioners and caregivers in the homes.
The study has two measurement periods; a baseline period (5 months) and a follow-up period (7 months). In between there is an implementation period in which the intervention (i.e. active implementation) is started in the intervention homes [no measurements are taken] (4 months).</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The intervention is multifaceted, consisting of the implementation of an algorithm for restrictive use of antibiotics as proposed in recent guidelines (Verenso, Dutch guideline), tailored in close collaboration with local stakeholders to the specific implementation setting, by means of a modified participatory-action research (PAR) approach. To support the process of intervention-tailoring and -implementation, a toolbox comprising of materials, aids and actions is developed to be used at the discretion of the local stakeholders to support implementation of the algorithm.The algorithm is congruent with the Swedish and Norwegian guidelines, which also promote more restrictive use of antibiotics in case of non-specific symptoms, even though the algorithm is more detailed.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  physical and/or mental disabilities and ADL dependency requiring residential care or
             nursing home care

          -  attended by general practitioners

          -  not on continuous prophylactic antibiotic use

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  in hospice-care

          -  very limited life expectancy (≤1 month)

          -  no longer wish to participate

          -  start continuous antibiotic (prophylaxis)

          -  die or move away from the residential care home / nursing home

        For pragmatic reasons we will not include new patients during the last two months of the
        study. If patients are excluded within 2 months after inclusion, they will be taken out of
        the study. In other words: patients need to be included for at least 2 months to contribute
        data to the study.
