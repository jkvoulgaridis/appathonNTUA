  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to characterize the safety, tolerability, and
      dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and to determine the recommended dose of relatlimab in
      combination with ipilimumab (for dose escalation) and to evaluate the safety, tolerability,
      and preliminary efficacy of the recommended dose of relatlimab in combination with ipilimumab
      versus ipilimumab monotherapy (for dose expansion).
