  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The most advanced configurations of the Artificial Pancreas (AP) have not yet been
      demonstrated to sufficiently maximize time in target glycemia. One limitation is the
      challenge of postprandial glycemic control, which currently requires ongoing patient
      engagement for accurate and detailed bolus dose estimation for meals. Sodium Glucose Linked
      Transporter 2 Inhibition (SGLT2i) provides an additional mechanism to attenuate post-prandial
      glycemic excursion, and may represent a strategy that could further alleviate carbohydrate
      counting burden and improve the performance of AP configurations. This trial aims to compare
      - using a randomized, masked placebo-controlled, crossover, multicenter design - the efficacy
      of the SGLT2i empagliflozin 25 mg oral per day each in the setting of single-hormone
      automated AP and conventional insulin pump therapy on the proportion of time spent in target
      and in hypoglycemia each during a 4-week day-and-night period. The pilot trial aims to enroll
      28 adult patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) across 2 research sites (one in Toronto and one
      in Montreal) and includes a 2- week therapy optimization run-in period, 4-weeks for each of
      the two AP intervention arms, and a 1- week washout in between the pharmacological
      intervention sequences. Glucose levels will be measured by continuous glucose monitoring (G5,
      Dexcom Inc.). Insulin will be infused using a subcutaneous infusion pump (t-slim, Tandem
      Diabetes Care) and communication between pumps and the algorithm will be implemented using
      Android Smartphone devices and Bluetooth technology communication.

             risk of bleeding).

          8. Current use of other non-insulin adjunct anti-hyperglycemic drug or use within 30 days
             prior to screening.

             mechanism of action).

         10. Ongoing or planned pregnancy or breastfeeding.

         11. Severe hypoglycemic episode within one month prior to Visit 1.

         12. Diabetic ketoacidosis in the last 3 months prior to Visit 1.

         13. Current use of glucocorticoid medication except low stable dose and inhaled steroids
             (can interfere with glucose sensor measurements).

         14. Known or suspected allergy to the trial products.

         15. Other serious medical illness likely to interfere with study participation or with the
             ability to complete the trial by the judgment of the investigator.

         16. Anticipating a significant change in exercise regimen between initiation of two
             intervention blocks (i.e. starting or stopping an organized sport).

         17. Recent history of genital or urinary infection (&lt;1 month prior to Visit 1) or history
             of recurrent urinary tract infections.

         18. Difficulty in using the artificial pancreas system following training.
