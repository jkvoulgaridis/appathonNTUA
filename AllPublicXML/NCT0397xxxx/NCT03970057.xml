  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dramatic physiological, psychological, and social changes during the antenatal period may
      significantly affect a woman's psychosocial and physical conditions, thereby resulting in
      stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is a
      well-established effective psychotherapy to modify thoughts, beliefs, and perceptions, as
      well as change the behavioral patterns under numerous conditions. However, at-risk women that
      need access to CBT are challenged by many issues, such as insufficient therapists,
      stigmatization, long waiting times, and high costs. Preventive strategies may offer a more
      acceptable means of addressing the problem. Internet-based CBT can help overcome some
      barriers to improve psychological well-being by providing a timely and efficacious
      intervention that is customizable, cost-effective, and flexible in terms of time and
      geography.

      Hypotheses Compared with the control group,

        1. Women who completed an internet-based CBT (MoodUP) will have significantly lower scores
           for stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms immediately post-intervention and at 12
           weeks post-intervention;

        2. Women who completed MoodUP will reduce the frequency of negative automatic thoughts,
           achieve a better sleep quality, life satisfaction, and mental health immediately
           post-intervention and at 12 weeks post-intervention;

        3. Women who completed MoodUP will have better client satisfaction.

      Approach A two-stage research design will be used for 3 years. Stage I will consist of the
      development and validation of MoodUP based on theoretical and empirical rationales. The
      development of MoodUP will be guided by a combination of the basic principles from behavioral
      and cognitive psychology. Essential components, teaching strategies, and technical elements
      of MoodUP will be established according to literature review and a meta-analysis by the
      principal investigator and her team. Ethical and quality standards will be assessed using the
      Health on the Net code of conduct and the Health-Related Website Evaluation Form,
      respectively.

      Stage II will be used to evaluate the efficacy of MoodUP among 204 antenatal at-risk women
      using a stratified randomized controlled trial, two-armed parallel group pretest, and
      repeated post-test following the Consolidated Standards of Report Trials guidelines for an
      internet-based intervention. Primary outcomes will be the presence and severity of antenatal
      stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms using the 21-item Depression Anxiety Stress Scale.
      Secondary outcomes will be automatic thoughts, sleep disturbance, life satisfaction, mental
      well-being, and client satisfaction, as determined by the 30-item Automatic Thoughts
      Questionnaires, four-item Sleep Disturbance subscale of the Medical Outcomes Study Sleep
      Scale, the five-item Satisfaction with Life Scale, the WHO five-item Well-Being Index, and
      the seven-item Client Satisfaction Questionnaire, respectively. Multivariate analysis of
      variance with repeated measures will be used to compare the mean difference of scores in the
      three-time points through Wilks's lambda test. The data will be analyzed according to the
      intention-to-treat principle with baseline values imputed for missing follow-up data.

    <description>The DASS-21 is used to rate the frequency and severity of experiencing negative emotions over the previous week (P. F. Lovibond &amp; S. H. Lovibond, 1995).
Each of the three DASS-21 scales contains 7 item, divided into sub-scales of stress, anxiety and depressive symptoms (S. H. Lovibond &amp; P. F. Lovibond, 1995).
Frequency/severity ratings are made on a series of four-point scales from 0 (did not apply to me at all) to 3 (applied to me very much or most of the time).
Scores of each sub-scales will be multiplied by 2 to calculate the final score. The total score ranges of each sub-scales from 0 to 42, and a high score on each sub-scale indicates more stress, anxiety and depression.</description>

    <measure>30-item Automatic Thoughts</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Measured through Automatic Thoughts Questionnaire. The Automatic Thought Questionnaire (ATQ) is used to measure the occurrence of negative thoughts and related cognitive processes (Hollon &amp; Kendall, 1980).
It consisted of 30 statements reflecting negative cognition (Hollon &amp; Kendall, 1980). Respondents are asked to rate the frequency at which each self-statement or a similar self-statement occurred over the course of the past week.
The responses are provided on a 5-point scale from 1 (not at all) to 5 (all the time) in order to determine the severity of symptoms. The total score ranges from 30 to 150. A high scores represents more frequent negative thoughts and cognition (Hollon &amp; Kendall, 1980).</description>

    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Measured through The Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) (Diener, Emmons, Larsen, &amp; Griffin, 1985).
The five-item Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) is used to assess life satisfaction of the women.
Women will rate each item on a seven-point Likert scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). The total score ranges from 5 to 35, and a high score on SWLS indicates high life satisfaction.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Four-item Sleep Disturbance subscale</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Measure through Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale (MOSSS). The four-item sleep disturbance sub-scale of the Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale (Hays et al., 2005) is used to assess how well women sleep without tapping into other sleep-related medical conditions.
Three items related to sleep disturbance are rated on a six-point Likert scale, from 1 (less than 15 minutes) to 6 (none of the time), and one item related to the time needed to fall asleep is assessed on a five-point Likert scale, from 1 (less than 15 minutes) to 5 (more than 60 minutes). Scores are converted to an index that ranged from 0 to 100, with high scores indicating a high level of sleep disturbance.</description>

    <measure>5-item Mental well-being</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Measured through the WHO Well-Being Index (WHOWBI) (Bech, 2012; World Health Organization, 1998).
The WHO five-item Well-Being Index is used to measure overall mental well-being. Each item is rated on a six-point Likert scale from 0 (at no time) to 5 (all of the time). The total score ranges from 0 to 25, and a high score represents better well-being.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>7-item Client satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Measured through a self-developed questionnaire to evaluate the clients' satisfaction of website.
Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ) is developed by our research team. Each item is rated on a four-point Likert scale from 1 to 4, and response options differed for the various items. The total score ranges from 7 to 28, and a high score represents better client satisfaction. In addition, we have four open questions to obtain suggestions for improvement.</description>
