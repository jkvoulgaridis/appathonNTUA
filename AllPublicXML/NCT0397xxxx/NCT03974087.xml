  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Progressively causes the breakdown of cognitive functions and impairs quality of life for
      patients and their caregivers. In addition to memory impairment, visual attention is also
      compromised, even at the stage of mild cognitive impairment due to AD (MCI-AD). No treatment
      has been found for MCI-AD; therefore, attention has been drawn to non-invasive brain
      stimulation techniques, such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), in order to
      enhance cognitive functions by modifying brain plasticity. In the current research,
      investigator aim to examine the long-term effects of the optimal multiple-session tDCS
      protocol in MCI-AD on visual attention including the transfer to an ecologically valid
      virtual environment and identify the neural underpinnings of tDCS-induced behavioral
      aftereffects using a combined tDCS/ MRI network-based approach.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigator will investigate the long-term effects of 10 active tDCS consecutive sessions
      using an optimized stimulation protocol as compared to a placebo stimulation on visual
      attention in the MCI-AD. A two-parallel-group, randomized, placebo-controlled design will be
      used. In addition, the cognitive transfer of tDCS will be evaluated. Repeated tDCS sessions
      will be performed in 10 consecutive sessions (2 weeks: Monday to Friday) over one preselected
      ROI together with ongoing visual attention training. During the stimulation, investigator
      will use the visual matching task. Before the repeated stimulation sessions, participants
      will undergo the neurocognitive examination. Behavioral examinations of the trained and
      untrained tasks (i.e. the transfer tasks) will be performed to assess the baseline
      performance. MRI protocol consisting of T1, T2, FLAIR, and fMRI during the task performance
      (visual matching task), resting state fMRI, and DTI sequences will be acquired before and
      after the whole 10-day stimulation protocol in order to search for active vs. placebo
      tDCS-induced changes in brain activation and resting state functional and structural
      connectivity and to identify neural correlates of behavioral changes. Behavioral assessment
      of the trained task and the transfer task will be repeated immediately after and again at a
      one-month follow-up visit after the end of the last stimulation session
