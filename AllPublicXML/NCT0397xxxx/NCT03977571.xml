      BACKGROUND: For synchronous metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC), surgical resection of the
      primary tumor in the presence of distant metastases has been the standard of therapy for
      select patients followed by systemic therapy. In the era of TKIs two randomized trials,
      CARMENA and SURTIME, have questioned the role and timing of surgery in these patients,
      results point towards no surgery or a deferred approach.

      RATIONALE: The antitumor activity of immune checkpoint blockage (ICB) is more potent than
      other therapy in mRCC. The deferred cytoreductive nephrectomy approach ensures systemic
      therapy for all patients, avoid systemic treatment delay, and spare surgery in patients with
      progressive tumors. Current data only point towards a survival benefit for cytoreductive
      nephrectomy in intermediate risk patients, but not in poor risk patients

      HYPOTHESIS: Deferred cytoreductive nephrectomy after initial nivolumab combined with
      ipilimumab will improve OS in patients with synchronous metastatic RCC and ≤3 IMDC risk
      features

      This is an open, randomized, multicenter, phase III comparison trial, designed to evaluate
      the effect of deferred cytoreductive nephrectomy compared with no surgery following initial
      nivolumab combined with ipilimumab, in mRCC patients with IMDC intermediate and poor risk.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter trial, patients are stratified according to institution,
      number of IMDC risk factors, and combined elevated neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio and
      hyponatremia.

      All patients will receive induction checkpoint immunotherapy immediately after inclusion.
      After 3 months or a total of 4 series of nivolumab combined with ipilimumab, whichever comes
      first, the patient will be discussed for resectability at the multidisciplinary meeting
      (MDT). Whether the patient is eligible for cytoreductive nephrectomy is at the discretion of
      the urologist at the local MDT. Patients with ≤ 3 IMDC risk factors and deemed suitable for
      cytoreductive nephrectomy will then undergo randomization. Patients deemed not suitable for
      surgery or have &gt; 3 IMDC risk features at the 3 month evaluation continue systemic therapy
      for 3 months, followed by a 2nd evaluation. Patients with ≤ 3 IMDC risk factors and deemed
      suitable for cytoreductive nephrectomy will then undergo randomization. Patients deemed not
      suitable for surgery or have &gt; 3 IMDC risk features at the 6 month evaluation continue
      systemic therapy. Nivolumab may continue until unacceptable toxicity or total treatment
      length of 2 years from inclusion.

      ARM A: Deferred cytoreductive nephrectomy, followed by maintenance nivolumab.

      ARM B: No surgery, receive maintenance nivolumab alone.

      Patients undergo tumor tissue, blood, and stool collection at baseline, 3 and 6 months, for
      planned translational research.
