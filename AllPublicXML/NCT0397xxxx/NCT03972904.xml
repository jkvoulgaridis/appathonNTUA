  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the previous intervention studies of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus patients, changes in blood
      glucose and insulin resistance profiles before and after intervention indicated that
      different intervention methods had different effects on outcomes. Therefore, this study
      intends to explore the effect of the Light-Fat Rice®combined with Active Peptide® on the
      level of insulin resistance in overweight/obese diabetic patients and its effect on the
      outcome through a 4-week, randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial, further
      elucidating its intervention mechanism theoretically. The study predicts that dynamic blood
      glucose(mean blood glucose) and glycosylated albumin will significantly different between the
      control group and the intervention group.And insulin resistance levels, blood lipids and
      other indicators wil be improved, and the test group was superior to the control group.All of
      these will contribute to more scientific and effective Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus's management.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus is increasing year by year in the world, causing
      harm to patients' health and making a huge consumption of medical expenses. Obesity is one of
      the most obvious risk factors for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. There are also many positive
      studies on nutritional intervention for the treatment of obese patients with Type 2 Diabetes
      Mellitus at home and abroad. The effect of nutritional meal replacement to relieve the
      disease has also been widely recognized.

      Light-Fat Rice® is a new type of nutritious staple food taking rice, konjac, marine fish
      oligopeptide powder, inulin and yeast as raw material. Also,there is a protein solid
      beverage,Active Peptide®,containing soy protein isolate, soy peptide powder,
      oligofructose,water-soluble dietary fiber and other ingredients,such as multi-vitamin. When
      used together, it can provide balanced nutrition for the human body while satisfying low fat
      and high protein. In this study, a 4-week, randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical
      trial will be conducted to investigate the effects of Light-Fat Rice® combined with Active
      Peptide® intervention on insulin resistance in overweight/obese diabetic patients and their
      effects on prognosis,further explaining its intervention mechanism theoretically. Based on a
      previous review of similar literature studies, 60 of these patients will be enrolled and
      randomly assigned to the intervention and control groups at 1:1. Among them, the intervention
      group will be given 80g of Light-Fat Rice® staple food meal as an independent staple food or
      mixed in the staple food combined with 2 packs Active Peptide®, and the control group was
      given the same energy-equivalent staple food produced by the same manufacturer daily with 2
      packs maltodextrin. Both groups are provided with a same lifestyle guidance by professional
      physicians based on the &quot;Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes in
      China 2017&quot;, including reasonable diet, exercise guidance, and organization of health
      education.

The method of taking the product can be divided into two parts.And a dynamic blood glucose transient monitor would be worn for all patients at the 3rd week to record the patients's dynamic blood glucose changes including preprandial, postprandial (every 15 minutes), before and after exercise (every 30 minutes).Besides these,the patients would be asked to record dietary and exercise diary for 3 days(including one weekend at least) each week also.</intervention_model_description>
