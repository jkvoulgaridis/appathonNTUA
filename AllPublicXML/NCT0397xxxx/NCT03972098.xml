      The aim of the present study was to evaluate the levels of uromodulin in rheumatoid arthritis
      (RA) and to investigate whether it was correlated with baseline clinical characteristics. In
      addition CKD epi,MDRD,urine microalbuminuria,pH,serum urea, creatinine,CRP (C-Reactive
      protein) were measured.The participants consist of ; %68 patients,% 32 control group.

      Uromodulin, also known as Tamm-Horsfall protein, is a protein abundantly excreted in the
      urine in healthy individuals. It is synthesized in the thick ascending limb of Henle (TALH)
      and the early distal convoluted tubule. Its biologic function is still obscure; however, some
      experimental studies indicated that it might serve as an important urinary defense factor
      against bacterial colonization and stone formation.

      There are controversial publications on the frequencies of urinary tract infections and
      nephrolithiasis in patients with mutations of uromodulin gene. Deposition of mutated
      uromodulin in the urinary system may lead to tubular cell dysfunction and apoptosis. These
      alterations may subsequently cause tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis . Moreover, the
      release of abnormal uromodulin after apoptosis through basolateral secretion may elicit an
      immune response which may give rise to an immune-mediated tubulointerstitial nephritis .

      Uromodulin can activate the other components of the immune system and may modulate the
      inflammatory and immune responses through different mechanisms .

      Experimental studies yielded that uromodulin negative mice displayed splenomegaly with
      infiltration of white pulp by macrophages and increased levels of TNF-α and interleukin-1 .
      Rheumatoid arthritis is a systemic autoimmune condition that may eventually result in the
      joint damage, disability and premature mortality.

    <description>The diagnosis of RA was based on the criteria developed by the American College of Rheumatology and European League Against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) in 2010 [8]. A drug history was obtained from every patient. All non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs prescribed during the year before enrollment in the study were recorded. criteria included systemic diseases (renal failure, hepatic insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, other collagen vascular diseases, history of smoking and consumption of alcohol.In order to eliminate the possibility of any systemic disease therefore we choose that our control group as young.</description>
