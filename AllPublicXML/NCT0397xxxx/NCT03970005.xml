      The Ohio State University Early Psychosis Intervention Center (OSU EPICENTER) is implementing
      a specialized clinical program to serve individuals ages 12-25 who meet clinical high risk
      criteria for a psychosis (CHR-P). The purpose of this project is to evaluate (i) correlates
      of baseline characteristics among clinic participants; (ii) outcomes among individuals
      participating in this clinical service; and (iii) predictors and mediators of longitudinal
      outcomes among individuals participating in this clinical service.

    <measure>Time to remission of clinical-high risk status for psychosis</measure>
    <time_frame>Remission status assessed at all treatment visits which will occur approximately once every week for up to 104 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Using criteria inspired by Nelson et al. (2018), remission of clinical high risk status for psychosis is defined as simultaneous remission of both (i) symptoms and (ii) functional deficits associated with prodromal psychosis.
Remission of symptoms is defined as all positive symptom items scored less than 3 on the Structured Clinical Interview for Prodromal States (SIPS). Each item is rated from 0-6 with higher scores indicating greater severity of symptoms.
Remission of functional deficits is defined as a 5-point increase on the Personal and Social Performance scale (PSP: Morosini et al., 2000) as compared to baseline assessment or the PSP score â‰¥ 70. Scores range from 0-100 with higher scores indicative of better personal and social functioning.</description>
