    <textblock>
      This study aims at evaluating the relationship between peripheral artery plaque
      characteristics evaluated by ultrasound and coronary culprit lesion characteristics evaluated
      by OCT in ACS patients.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention
      (PCI) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) are included in this study. Two skillful
      echocardiographers will evaluate peripheral artery plaque characteristics by
      ultrasound.Ultrasound parameters of peripheral artery will be compared among patients with
      different coronary culprit lesion characteristics, such as plaque rupture and plaque erosion.

    <description>Plaque rupture is characterized by the presence of fibrous cap discontinuity with a cavity formation. plaque erosion is characterized by the presence of the attached thrombus overlying an intact and visual plaque, luminal surface irregularity at the culprit lesion in the absence of thrombus, or attenuation of the underlying plaque by thrombus without superficial lipid or calcification immediately proximal or distal to the site of thrombus.Patients with plaque erosion have less plaques, lower intima-media thickness (IMT), lower plaque score (PS) compared to patients with plaque rupture.</description>
