    <textblock>
      Depression in patients with type 2 diabetes is often undiagnosed and remains untreated,
      leading to poor therapy adherence and ill health-related outcomes. The aim of study was
      evaluated the effect of vortioxetine versus sertraline in the treatment of depression,
      diabetes-related distress and control metabolic in subjects with type 2 diabetes and
      depression. was included patients who were glycosylated hemoglobin ≥ 7.5%, 18 to 60 years of
      age and written consent . Pharmacological treatment for depression was assigned randomly:
      vortioxetine (10 mg/day) or sertraline (75 mg/day) for 8 weeks. Biochemical parameters,
      anthropometric measures and depression symptoms were evaluated before and at the and at the 8
      weeks after antidepressant treatment.

      The assessment consisted of an extended face-to-face interview. The patients answered a
      structured questionnaire used to collect: sociodemographic characteristics (gender, age,
      education, occupation and marital status) and clinical data (pharmacotherapy, habits,
      consumed of drugs, diabetes complications and comorbidities). Depression was screened using
      Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score ≥ 14 (HAM-D), Center for epidemiologic studies
      depression scale revised in Spanish (CES-DR35), and Problem Areas in Diabetes Questionnaire
      (PAID-V); anthropometrics measurements were evaluated (weight, waist circumference and body
      mass index). Besides, blood samples were drawn for the following biochemical parameters:
      fasting plasma glucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), cholesterol and triglycerides. Patients
      who gave informed consent and convened inclusion criteria were attended by a psychiatrist.
      The pharmacological management were randomly assigned: vortioxetine (10 mg/day) or sertraline
      (75 mg/day) for 8 weeks, in addition, the patients maintained their established anti-diabetic
      treatment (oral hypoglycemic or insulin). The study ended at the 8th week, subjects were
      attended by psychiatrist and blood samples were drawn for evaluated biochemical parameters
      and the structured questionnaire previously described was applicated.The clinical measures
      and biochemical parameters were done baseline and after 8-week pharmacological treatment.
      Finally the effect of both antidepressants were compared.

    <measure>Effect of antidepressant treatment (sertraline versus vortioxetine) in remission of depression in depressed type 2 diabetic patients.</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Two groups of depressed type 2 diabetic patients were involve in the study: one group received sertraline and the second vortioxetine. The assessment of depression was performed by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) validated in the Spanish version. We used a 17-item reduced version, the range of scale was 0-50, includes the following items: psychic anxiety, somatic anxiety, gastrointestinal somatic symptoms, general somatic symptoms, hypochondriasis, and insight. A score of 8 and above indicates depression and a high levels of anxiety symptoms. Where 14 was the cutoff point of this scale; patients with this score were diagnosed with major depression and included in the study. Depression was screened using HAM-D at the beginning of the study and at 8 weeks of treatment. Finally the effect of both antidepressant were compared.</description>

    <measure>Effect of antidepressant treatment (sertraline versus vortioxetine) in severity of depression in depressed type 2 diabetic patients.</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Two groups of depressed type 2 diabetic patients were involve in the study: one group received sertraline and the second vortioxetine. The severity of depression was measured with the center for epidemiologic studies depression scale revised in Spanish (CES-DR35). Previous studies in a Mexican population reported a Cronbach α score of 0.9. This questionnaire consists of 35 items, the range of scale was 0-140, among them are: depressed mood, anhedonia, appetite, sleep problem, psychomotor retardation, fatigue, guilt/conscience, thinking, suicidal ideation and social. A score of 16 and above indicates clinically significant symptoms of major depression episode and the severity of depression. Depression was screened using CES-DR35 at the beginning of the study and at 8 weeks of treatment. Finally the effect of both antidepressant were compared.</description>

    <description>Two groups of depressed type 2 diabetic patients were involve in the study: one group received sertraline and the second vortioxetine. Diabetes related stress was screened using 5-item Problem Areas in Diabetes Scale (PAID-5). The scale gives a total score from 0 to 20. A score of 8 and above indicates a high level of diabetes-related distress. Diabetes related stress was screened using PAID-5 at the beginning of the study and at 8 weeks of treatment. Finally the effect of both antidepressant were compared.</description>
