  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Walking capacity is one of the most valuable body functions among persons with multiple
      sclerosis (MS) and it is one of the most frequently affected, even in early stages of the
      disease. Inactivity and deconditioning can accelerate gait impairment and promote other
      pathologies related with sedentary lifestyle.

      Nordic walking (NW) is a fun and effective fitness and rehabilitation activity. The benefits
      of NW have been extensively described in healthy and elderly population (Tschentscher, 2013;
      Kappor, 2013) and it is proving to be highly recommended to different neurological
      conditions, specially to Parkinson Disease (Reuter 2006; van Eijkeren 2008; Fritz 2011;
      Ebersbach 2014).

      There is no evidence on NW and MS, although it's supposed to be an ideal physical activity
      for many reasons: it tones the upper and lower body at the same time, uses 90% of the
      skeletal muscles, burns up to 46% more calories than ordinary walking, reduces the pressure
      on knees and joints, poles propel the walker along easier and faster and it is one of the
      most effective cross training techniques for people who require improve cardiovascular and
      endurance conditioning.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A simple blinded randomized controlled trial as designed to assess if an endurance training
      (20 sessions of 45 minutes x 2 times/week x 10 weeks) using NW improves: walking capacity,
      balance, fatigue, mood and health-related quality of life of people with MS.

      66 people with MS will be randomly allocated in NW group or conventional endurance training
      group (treadmill and cycloergometer). Assessments will take place before starting the
      training, after the training and 3 months after.

    <measure>Modified Fatigue Impact Scale</measure>

    <description>The Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS) is a form of the Fatigue Impact Scale (Fisk et al, 1994) based on items derived from interviews with MS patients concerning how fatigue interferes in their lifes. The instrument provides an assessment of the effect of fatigue in terms of physical, mental and psychosocial functioning. Items on the MFIS can be aggregated into three subscales (physical, cognitive, and psychosocial), as well as into a total MFIS score. All items are scaled so that higher scores indicate a greater impact of fatigue on a person's activities. The Physical Subscale range from 0 to 36. The Cognitive Subscale ranges from 0 to 40. The Psychosocial Subscale ranges from 0 to 8.The total MFIS score can range from 0 to 84. It is computed by adding scores on the physical, cognitive, and psychosocial subscales.</description>

    <description>The Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life 54 (MSQoL-54) is a multidimensional health-related quality of life measure that combines both generic and MS-specific items into a single instrument. This 54-item instrument generates 12 subscales along with two summary scores, and two additional single-item measures. The subscales are: physical function, role limitations-physical, role limitations-emotional, pain, emotional well-being, energy, health perceptions, social function, cognitive function, health distress, overall quality of life, and sexual function. The summary scores are the physical health composite summary and the mental health composite summary, that are derived from a weighted combination of scale scores. Higher scores means better quality of life perceived.</description>
