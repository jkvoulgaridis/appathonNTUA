    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to measure the reliability and responsiveness of the Chinese version
      of the readiness for return-to-work (RRTW) scale. We would conduct a multiple-centered,
      prospective cohort study to require RRTW data in lost-time claimants in outpatient
      occupational rehabilitation in Taiwan.
