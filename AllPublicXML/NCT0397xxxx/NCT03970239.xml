  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Impulse control disorders are frequent and troublesome in patients with Parkinson's disease.
      However, the cerebral functional alterations related to impulse control disorders in
      Parkinson's disease are poorly understood and may involve the serotoninergic system besides
      alterations in the dopaminergic system.

      The primary objective of this study is to investigate the cerebral functional alterations in
      the serotoninergic system in patients with Parkinson's disease and impulse control disorders
      using Positron Emission Tomography with highly specific radiotracers of serotonin transporter
      (SERT) using [11 Carbon]-3-amino-4-(2-dimethylaminomethylphenylsulfanyl)-benzonitrile
      ([11C]-DASB) and of serotonin 5-Hydroxytryptamine 2A (5-HT2A) receptor using [18
      Fluorine]-altanserin ([18F]-altanserin), in comparison to patients with Parkinson's disease
      without impulse control disorders and healthy volunteers.

    <measure>Ardouin Scale of Behavior in Parkinson's Disease (ASBPD)</measure>
    <time_frame>2-3 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Ardouin Scale of Behavior in Parkinson's Disease (ASBPD) evaluates hypo- and hyperdopaminergic behaviors and can also detect and quantify neuropsychiatric fluctuations by evaluating OFF-drug dysphoria and ON-drug euphoria. It is based on a semi-structured interview that encompasses the whole spectrum of behavioral spectrum from hypo-to hyperdopaminergic syndromes as well as non-motor fluctuations. The scale consists of 18 items addressing non-motor symptoms, grouped in four parts: general psychological evaluation, apathy, non-motor fluctuations and hyperdopaminergic behaviors. The rating in five points (0-4 from absent to severe) is carried out during a semi-structured interview. Open-ended questions introduce each item, allowing patients to express themselves as freely as possible. Close-ended questions permit the rating of severity and intensity.</description>

    <measure>Questionnaire For Impulsive-Compulsive Disorders In Parkinson's Disease-Rating Scale (QUIP-RS)</measure>
    <time_frame>2-3 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Questionnaire For Impulsive-Compulsive Disorders In Parkinson's Disease-Rating Scale (QUIP-RS) is designed to measure severity of symptoms and support a diagnosis of impulse control disorders and related disorders in Parkinson's Disease (PD). The QUIP-RS is administered with an instruction sheet that provides examples of the behaviors being assessed and a brief description of the categories for frequency (never [0] = not at all, rarely [1] = infrequently or 1 day/week, etc.). Scores for each Impulsive Compulsive Disorder (ICD) and related disorder range from 0 to 16, with a higher score indicating greater severity (frequency) of symptoms. The total QUIP-RS score for all ICDs and related disorders combined ranges from 0 to 112.</description>

    <measure>Urgency, Premeditation (lack of), Perseverance (lack of), Sensation Seeking Impulsive Behavior Scale (UPPS Impulsive Behavior Scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>2-3 days</time_frame>
    <description>The full version of the UPPS-P Scale is composed of 59 items, with 10-14 items per scale. Items are scored on a 4-point scale:
Agree Strongly = 1 Agree Some = 2 Disagree Some = 3 Disagree Strongly = 4
Higher values translate into higher levels of impulsivity. The results allow assessement of the patient according to five impulsive personality traits:
Negative urgency: tendency to act rashly under extreme negative emotions
Lack of Premeditation: tendency to act without thinking
Lack of Perseverance: inability to remain focused on a task
Sensation Seeking: tendency to seek out novel and thrilling experiences
Positive Urgency: tendency to act rashly under extreme positive emotions</description>

    <measure>Movement Disorder Society (MDS) Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>2-3 days</time_frame>
    <description>The MDS-UPDRS is composed of four parts, namely, I: Non-motor Experiences of Daily Living; II: Motor Experiences of Daily Living; III: Motor Examination; IV: Motor Complications and includes 65 items. Each question has five responses that are linked to commonly accepted clinical terms: 0 = normal, 1 = slight, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, and 4 = severe. The overall progression of disability is given a score ranging from 0 = no disability 1= slight disability 2= moderate disability 3= high disability and 4= severe disability.</description>

    <measure>Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II)</measure>
    <time_frame>2-3 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) is used to measure the severity of depression. It contains 21 questions, each answer being scored on a scale value of 0 to 3. Higher total scores indicate more severe depressive symptoms:
0-13: minimal depression
14-19: mild depression
20-28: moderate depression
29-63: severe depression.</description>

    <measure>Starkstein Apathy Scale (SAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>2-3 days</time_frame>
    <description>For this scale, patients are asked to answer 14 questions, each of which is scored on a 4-point scale of 0-3, and apathy is rated as more severe as the total score (0-42) increases.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>State-Trait Anxiety Inventory -Y (STAI-Y)</measure>
    <time_frame>2-3 days</time_frame>
    <description>The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory measures anxiety by assessing someone's state (S) and trait (T) anxiety at the same time. Its combined format consists of 40 questions. The S-Anxiety scale (STAI Form Y-1) consists of twenty statements that evaluate how the respondent feels &quot;right now, at this moment&quot;. The T- Anxiety scale (STAI Form Y-2) consists of twenty statements that evaluate how the respondent feels &quot;generally&quot;. In responding to the S-Anxiety scale, the subjects choose the number that best describes the intensity of their feelings: (1) not at all, (2) somewhat, (3) moderately, (4) very much so. In responding to the T-Anxiety scale, subjects rate the frequency of their feelings on the following four-point scale: (1) almost never, (2) sometimes, (3) often, (4) almost always. Each STAI item is given a weighted score of 1 to 4. Scores for both the S-Anxiety and the T-Anxiety scales can vary from a minimum of 20 to a maximum of 80 with higher scores correlating to higher anxiety.</description>

    <measure>Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>2-3 days</time_frame>
    <description>The SHAPS measures the subject's ability to experience pleasure (hedonic tone) and its absence (anhedonia). It consists of 14 items with 4 possible responses: Definitely Agree, Agree, Disagree, Definitely Disagree. A score from 0- 14 is possible (1 point for each response in the Disagree category and 0 points for each response in the Agree category). The higher the score the less the subject is able to experience pleasure.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Temporal Experience of Pleasure Scale (TEPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>2-3 days</time_frame>
    <description>Measure specifically designed to capture the anticipatory and consummatory facets of pleasure. It consists of 10 questions assessing anticipatory pleasure (TEPS-ANT) and 8 questions assessing consummatory pleasure (TEPS-CON) using a 6-point fixed choice response format ranging from 1 = very false for me to 6 = very true for me. The higher the score for each section, the more the subject experiences anticipatory pleasure and consummatory pleasure, respectively.</description>

During this study, subjects will receive a single intravenous administration of approximately 4 Megabecquerel/kilogram (MBq/kg) of [11C]-DASB immediately prior to imaging using Positron Emission Tomography (PET). The effective dose in human body is about 2.1 milliSievert (mSv).
On a separate day, subjects will receive a single intravenous administration of approximately 3.7 MBq/kg of [18F]-altanserin for 120 minutes prior to imaging using Positron Emission Tomography (PET). The effective dose in human body is about 8.4 mSv.</description>
