  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of obesity on knee degenerative
      arthritis on body composition after dietary control and elastic resistance exercise; and
      whether persistent exercise habits and dietary control can relieve pain and strengthen muscle
      strength. Improve the quality of life and the decline of other risk factors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Due to dietary westernization and overweight, the number of knee joint degeneration is
      increasing year by year. Degeneration of knee arthritis can lead to pain and not exercise,
      and thus other chronic diseases. When the weight loss exceeds 5.1%, the function of the knee
      joint can be significantly improved and low heat weight loss (1200 kcal / day) and very low
      heat weight loss (less than 800 kcal / day) both weight loss The results are equally good
      .Many studies have shown that early and mid-interventional resistance exercise can improve
      muscle weakness, pain and stiffness in patients with degenerative knee arthritis, and elastic
      resistance exercise can effectively improve lower limb function and increase physical
      activity in patients with knee arthritis However, there has been no research on the effects
      of diet control and resistance exercise training on pain relief, body composition, lower limb
      function and quality of life in obese knee degenerative arthritis. The purpose of this study
      was to explore the degenerative knee degeneration. The effect of arthritis on the composition
      of the body after a balanced diet calorie control and home-based low-intensity elastic
      resistance movement; and whether persistent exercise habits and diet control can relieve
      pain, strengthen muscle strength, improve quality of life and other risks The effect of
      factor decline. Expected to combine the diet control and home group exercise to improve the
      quality of life of patients with degenerative knee arthritis.

    <measure>WOMAC</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>WOMAC is used to measure the patient's home knee function. Each question is scored using a five-point scale. The higher the score, the worse the knee function.
This study assessed the amount of change in WOMAC scores, whether it was lower than baseline after 12 weeks.</description>

    <measure>KOOS</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>KOOS is based on WOMAC and covers a wider range. The score of each topic is 0-4 points. The higher the score after the conversion formula, the better the knee joint function. This study assessed changes in KOOS scores, whether it was higher than baseline after 12 weeks.</description>

    <description>Cases will be tested for total cholesterol (mg/dL) in routine outpatient care. This study, at baseline and 12 weeks later, copied the most recent total cholesterol report from the case.
The amount of change in total cholesterol after baseline and 12 weeks was compared.</description>
