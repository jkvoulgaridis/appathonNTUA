  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose is to demonstrate the usefulness of WitCard and WitDisplayer in the diagnosis of
      AF but more generally in the qualification of the heart rhythm and the diagnosis of cardiac
      arrhythmias.

      The main objective is therefore to demonstrate that at least 90 +/- 0.03% of ECGWs are
      interpretable by a physician and the primary endpoint will therefore be the ratio of the
      number of ECGWs that allowed a physician to make a diagnosis. rhythmic (ECGW interpretable)
      and the total number of ECGW recorded and viewed.

      The clinical trial as part of the CE medical device certification process for secondary
      objectives and ancillary studies will be required to assess the diagnostic performance of the
      WitCard + WitDisplayer system, the quality of the ECGW recorded by the WitCard, the the
      safety of using the WitCard, the technical performance of the WitCard ECG recorder, the
      ergonomics of the WitCard, and finally the performance of automatic cardiac rhythm
      classification algorithms.
