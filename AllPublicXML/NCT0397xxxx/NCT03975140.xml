  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators used a double-blind single-center randomized controlled trial to explore
      the prevention value of acupoint sensitization based on stable angina pectoris, so as to
      verify the hypothesis that &quot;acupoint sensitization by finger pressing in traditional Chinese
      medicine can alleviate the onset of stable angina pectoris&quot;.After the inclusion of eligible
      patients, the patients were randomly assigned to test their acupoint sensitization value. The
      first five acupoints in the sensitization sequence were pressed on patients in the
      experimental group, and the last five acupoints were pressed on patients in the control
      group.The patients received treatment every other day for a total of 3 times a week for 4
      weeks, followed up for 4 weeks after the end of treatment.Patients were evaluated three times
      at baseline, at the end of treatment, and 4 weeks after the end of treatment, to assess
      angina episodes during the each period, as well as indicators such as the Canadian society of
      cardiology (CCS) angina classification.
