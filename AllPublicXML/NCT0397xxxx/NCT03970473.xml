  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary recruitment maneuver (PRM) has been shown to reduce postoperative shoulder pain by
      removing excessive intraabdominal gas following laparoscopic surgery(LS). A recent study
      demonstrated that compared to PRM in the supine position, PRM at semi-fowler position
      provides better evacuation of the remaining intraabdominal gas following gynecologic LS.

      This study aimed to compare the impact of PRM with 15 cm H2O and PRM with 30 cm H2O on
      postoperative shoulder pain in patients undergoing gynecologic LS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary recruitment maneuver (PRM) consists of five manual pulmonary inflations where each
      positive pressure inflation was done for 5 s at a maximum pressure of 30-40 cm H2O in the
      neutral position. When used after laparoscopic surgery and just before the extubation, PRM
      has been shown to facilitate the removal of intraabdominal gas and thus reduce the
      postoperative shoulder pain which is associated with the volume of the gas accumulating under
      the diaphragm. A recent study demonstrated that compared to PRM in the supine position, PRM
      at semi-fowler position provides better evacuation of the remaining intraabdominal gas and
      less postoperative shoulder pain following gynecologic LS. However, whether a PRM with lower
      pressure is also effective in reducing postoperative intraabdominal gas and postoperative
      shoulder pain is of question. This study aimed to compare the impact of PRM with two
      pressures (15 cm H2O or 30 cm H2O) in addition to the semi-fowler position on postoperative
      shoulder pain in patients undergoing gynecologic LS.
