  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lifestyle intervention is the most important management of non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases
      (NAFLD) patients. Weight reductions of 5-10% can improve non-alcoholic steatosis and
      fibrosis. However, the options for treatment in the clinics are limited. Therefore, in this
      study, we investigated the effectiveness of different lifestyle intervention strategies in
      NAFLD patients.

    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized clinical trial nested within a cohort study in overweight
      and obese non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) patients. In this study, 1500 eligible
      patients will be recruited, and demographic information and clinical data will be collected
      at baseline. Among these, 292 participants who agree to be randomized will be randomized into
      two intervention groups, including lifestyle education (LE), and intensive lifestyle
      intervention with low-carbohydrate diet (ILI), aiming to induce a loss ≥ 10% of initial
      weight in 3 months. The remainder will chose the treatment which they prefer according to the
      clinical practice. At the 3th, 6th and 12th month, all the participants will be followed, and
      data will be collected to study the development of NAFLD in different lifestyle intervention
      groups.
