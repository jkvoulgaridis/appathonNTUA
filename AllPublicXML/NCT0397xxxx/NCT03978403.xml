  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, open-label, randomized, four-way crossover study. Subjects will
      receive the four study treatments once, followed by in-clinic monitoring and extensive
      pharmacokinetic analysis. Dosing occurs ~48 hours apart from patch application, in randomized
      order. Subjects will have final assessment and be dismissed from the study.

      This is a single-center, open-label, randomized, four-way crossover study. Each subject will
      receive each of the four study treatments once, followed by in-clinic monitoring and
      extensive blood sample collection for pharmacokinetic analysis.

      Dosing will occur approximately 48 hours apart from the time of patch application, until
      completion of dosing in randomized order per the treatment sequence schedule. Plasma samples
      from the dosing days will be sent to the analytical laboratory for analysis and tolerability
      for each of the dose levels will be summarized.

      After completion of the four dosing days, subjects will be assessed one final time and
      dismissed from the study.
