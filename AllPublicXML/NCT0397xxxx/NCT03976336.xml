  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Berberine is a dietary supplement that comes from the roots, stems, and bark of various
      plants and has been used for centuries in traditional Chinese medicine. It may help lower
      cholesterol, lower blood sugar, and reduce inflammation.Very few studies have been done in
      the United States to show how berberine effects cholesterol and blood sugar. This study is
      looking to see how berberine changes cholesterol and blood sugar, and to see how well it is
      tolerated.Berberine is not a prescription medication but it appears to have similar actions
      to common prescription medications to lower cholesterol like statins, and to lower blood
      sugar like metformin. We are studying berberine to see if it may be a good option for people
      that do not want to take prescription medications.
