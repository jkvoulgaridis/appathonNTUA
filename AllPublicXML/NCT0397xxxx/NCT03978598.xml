    <textblock>
      The investigators are studying the effect of placing the etonogestrel implant (Nexplanon) in
      the first 24 hours after birth on breastfeeding. Women who wish to have an etonogestrel
      implant placed after their birth, wish to breastfeed, and are willing to participate in the
      study will be randomly assigned to either get the implant placed in the first 24 hours after
      delivery of the baby and placenta or 4-6 weeks later. The investigators do not believe there
      will be a difference in breastfeeding 8 weeks after delivery or time to lactogenesis between
      those who get the implant placed early or later.

    <textblock>
      Counseling and provision of postpartum contraception is an integral component of
      comprehensive reproductive healthcare. A woman's preference for contraception is paramount;
      early initiation of postpartum contraception may assist in optimal birth spacing promoting
      the wellbeing of mother and baby. Equally important is the provision of appropriate support
      for breastfeeding. Exclusive breastfeeding for six months with continuation beyond one year
      of age is recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), American Academy of Family
      Physicians, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), and the World Health
      Organization (WHO).

      The utilization of Long Acting Reversible Contraception (LARC's) has increased in the last
      decade. The etonogestrel (ENG) implant is one of the most effective LARC's and has become one
      of the methods used by many women in the postpartum period to prevent an unplanned pregnancy.
      The major advantage of immediate ENG implant insertion is the prompt initiation of a highly
      effective contraceptive method at a time that does not interfere with breastfeeding and the
      life changes and demands of motherhood.

      Our long-term goal is to understand the impact of the ENG implant hormonal contraceptive,
      initiated early in the postpartum period, on breastfeeding. The central hypothesis is that
      breastfeeding continuation at eight weeks postpartum is not inferior in women in the
      immediate insertion group of the ENG implant than in those with standard insertion and that
      time to lactogenesis stage II is not more than 8 hours difference between the immediate
      insertion and standard insertion groups.

      Primary:

      Aim #1: To determine breastfeeding continuation rates at 8 weeks in both groups.

      Aim #2: To determine the timing of lactogenesis in both groups

      Secondary:

      Aim #1: To assess breastfeeding continuation and exclusivity between the immediate versus the
      standard group. Aim #2: To compare postpartum factors associated with discontinuing
      breastfeeding between the immediate versus the standard group. Aim #3: To compare participant
      satisfaction with postpartum contraception counseling in women enrolled in the study and in
      those women who opted not to enroll in the study between the immediate versus the standard
      group. Aim #4: To compare postpartum mood as measured by EPDS score between the immediate
      versus the standard group. Aim #5: To compare postpartum sexual function as measured by
      Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) score between the immediate versus the standard group.
      Aim #6: To compare the total number of days of postpartum bleeding in the immediate versus
      standard. Aim #7: To compare participant satisfaction with the timing of ENG implant
      insertion between the immediate versus the standard group

      This proposal will support a non-inferiority RCT where participants will be randomly assigned
      to immediate insertion (first 24 hours after delivery) or delayed postpartum insertion (4-6
      weeks postpartum). This project will provide needed evidence on breastfeeding impact of early
      postpartum initiation of the ENG implant.

    <description>Using a questionnaire the investigators seek to compare exclusive breastfeeding through 6 months postpartum between the immediate versus the standard group. This will be assessed by answering a trichotomous question with the following statement:
If you are currently breastfeeding, are you:
Exclusively breastfeeding

To asses this outcome a four-point Likert scale will be used with the following anchors: not at all important, not very important, somewhat important and very important.

    <description>To compare postpartum mood as measured by Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) score at 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 weeks postpartum. Results reported as a total score ranging from 0-30, no subscale scores.

    <measure>Sexual Function.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 weeks postpartum.</time_frame>
    <description>To compare postpartum sexual function as measured by Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) score. Minimum score 2, Maximum score 36. Subscales are combined by first totaling the scores for the individual questions in that domain (ex. for Desire, the sum of scores for questions 1 and 2). That total is then multiplied by the factor for that domain, which is listed in the table above. The output is the final score for that domain, and will fall within the minimum and maximum scores listed in the table above.
For every domain, a lower score indicates either no sexual activity or negative outcomes in that domain, while a higher score indicates positive outcomes in that domain.</description>
