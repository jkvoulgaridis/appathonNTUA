      The trial aims to evaluate the effect of manual acupuncture versus transcutaneous electric
      nerve stimulation in treating primary dysmenorrhea.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to systematic reviews,manual acupuncture(MA) and high frequency transcutaneous
      electric nerve stimulation(TENS) had certain therapeutic effects on primary dysmenorrhea
      respectively.

      In this trial, 84 patients with primary dysmenorrhea will be recruited and randomly allocated
      into MA group and TENS group. Patients in MA group will receive treatment at acupoints of
      Shiqizhui(EX-B8), Ciliao(BL 32),Diji(SP 8) and Sanyinjiao(SP 6) and those in TENS group will
      receive treatment at the area along the lower borders of the ribs and the upper borders of
      the hip crests on both sides. All patients, both in EA group and TENS group, will be treated
      in their first day of dysmenorrhea, once a day for three consecutive days. And the treatments
      will last for three consecutive menstrual cycles.

    <description>The pain intensity was measured by the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), which is a valid measure of pain intensity with scores from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain).Participants will be asked to rate their mean pain intensity on the days with pain during the third menstruation by selecting a single number from 0 to 10.The primary outcome is the proportion of patients with at least 50% reduction in mean pain intensity from baseline.</description>

    <description>CMSS is a tool for evaluating patients' symptom integrally which consists of 17 items or symptoms.In severity evaluation,each symptom is scored in five levels: 0 represent symptoms not noticeable;1, slightly bothersome;2, moderate bothersome; 3, severely bothersome;4, very severely bothersome.
In the duration of the evaluation,each variable is scored in five grades by the retained time of symptom: 0 score denote did not occur;1, lasted less than 3h; 2, lasted 3 to 7h;3, lasted an entire day;and 4, lasted several days.</description>
