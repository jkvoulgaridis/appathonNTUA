  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to see if tucatinib with ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) works
      better than T-DM1 alone to help patients who have a specific type of breast cancer called
      HER2 positive breast carcinoma. The breast cancer in this study is either metastatic (spread
      into other parts of the body) or cannot be removed completely with surgery.

      Patients in this study will be randomly assigned to get either tucatinib or placebo (a pill
      with no medicine). This is a blinded study, so neither patients nor their doctors will know
      whether a patient gets tucatinib or placebo. All patients in the study will get T-DM1, a drug
      that is often used to treat this cancer.

      Each treatment cycle lasts 21 days. Patients will swallow tucatinib pills or placebo pills
      two times every day. Patients will get T-DM1 injections from the study site staff on the
      first day of every cycle.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tucatinib in combination with
      T-DM1 in subjects with unresectable locally-advanced or metastatic HER2+ breast cancer who
      have had prior treatment with a taxane and trastuzumab in any setting. Prior pertuzumab
      treatment is permitted, but not required. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 manner to
      receive 21-day cycles of either tucatinib or placebo in combination with T-DM1.

      While on study treatment, subjects will be assessed for progression every 6 weeks for the
      first 24 weeks, and every 9 weeks thereafter, irrespective of dose holds or interruptions.
      Study treatment will continue until unacceptable toxicity, disease progression, withdrawal of
      consent, or study closure. After completion of study treatment and after occurrence of
      disease progression, subjects in both arms of the study will continue to be followed for
      survival until study closure or withdrawal of consent.
