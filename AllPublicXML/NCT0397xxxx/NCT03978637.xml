        Inclusion Criteria:

        • Double lung transplantation ≥ 1 year before informed consent. Confirmed BOS progression
        to Grade 1, 2, or 3 diagnosed within 1 year of screening

        OR

        *Confirmed BOS progression to Grade 1, 2, or 3 diagnosed within 2 years of screening AND:

        •A ≥ 200 mL decrease in FEV1 in the previous 12 months

        OR

        *A ≥ 50 mL decrease in FEV1 in the last 2 measurements.

        • Willingness to avoid pregnancy or fathering children.

          -  Receipt of JAK inhibitor therapy after lung transplant for any indication. Treatment
             with a JAK inhibitor before lung transplant is permitted.

          -  Laboratory values at screening outside the protocol-defined ranges.

          -  Active HBV or HCV infection that requires treatment, or at risk for HBV reactivation
             (ie, positive HBsAg).

          -  Known HIV infection.

          -  History of active malignancy within 3 years of screening.

          -  Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.

          -  Treatment with an investigational agent, procedure, or device within 30 days of
             enrollment, or within 5 half-lives of the investigational product, whichever is
             longer.
