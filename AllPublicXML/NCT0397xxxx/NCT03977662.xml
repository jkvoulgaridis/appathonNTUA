  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to test the hypothesis that co-transplantation of allogeneic PTG
      with adult pancreatic islets (derived from same deceased donor) in the IM site in people with
      Type 1 diabetes with functioning kidney and/or liver transplants is safe, allows islet
      engraftment, and leads to insulin independence.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Single-center, open label, non-randomized safety and efficacy trial to evaluate
      co-transplantation of allogeneic parathyroid glands (PTG) with adult pancreatic islets (both
      PTG and pancreatic islets obtained from same deceased donor) in people with Type 1 diabetes
      in the intramuscular (IM) site with stable function of liver or kidney allografts on chronic
      immunosuppression.

      A total of 8 patients will be enrolled in the study and followed for a minimum of 1 year up
      to 2 years after the last islet transplant, depending on enrollment date.

             hypertension.

         19. Use of any investigational agents within 4 weeks of enrollment.

         20. Administration of live attenuated vaccine(s) within 2 months of enrollment.
