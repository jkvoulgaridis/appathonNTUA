  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Arthritic disease in people less than 60 years old is increasingly common. Younger, active
      individuals often present now to orthopaedic surgeons requiring treatment of knee
      osteoarthritis. Knee arthroplasty has been offered as a viable option to provide pain relief
      and improve function in the middle-aged patient.

      In a previous study submitted for publication, the investigators have looked at BMD in vivo
      after total knee replacement comparing two different tibial base plate designs in cemented
      and uncemented implants in terms of stiffness and modularity, and its effect on bone density
      changes, synovitis, osteolysis or survivorship. The investigators found a difference of 18%
      in bone mineral density favoring trabecular metal implant over cemented modular metal-back
      implant in patient between 55 and 75 years of age. The trabecular metal implant thus behaved
      as it was expected and preserved bone density in an elderly population.

      No randomized clinical trial has looked at cemented titanium tibial insert to uncemented
      trabecular metal tibia insert in young population. In order to isolate stiffness as study
      variable, one would aim at randomizing a homogeneous patient population undergoing total knee
      arthroplasty with implants of similar articular geometry designs with different tibial
      baseplate, titanium versus trabecular metal. The trabecular metal implant is closer to human
      bone modulus of elasticity.

      THE GOAL OF OUR STUDY IS TO

        1. Quantify the amount of bone remodeling 24 months after total knee arthroplasty using
           sequential dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry of the proximal tibia in younger and more
           active patients (less than 60 years of age).

        2. Evaluate the evolution of functional outcome over a 24 months period using sequential
           subjective and objective clinical evaluations using the Knee Society Score (KSS) and
           Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and Sf-12 v2 in this cohort of
           patients.

        3. There is also an interest in looking at the activity level before and after the surgery
           (by using the Tegner Activity Level Scale and the UCLA Activity Level Scale) and to
           determine the ability to return to an active lifestyle and the impact on implant
           survival.

      Two groups will be created:

      Group 1: NexGen cemented modular metal-backed tibial implant (Titanium) Group 2: NexGen
      uncemented Trabecular Metal(TM) modular tibial implant A total of 88 patients will be
      recruited

    <description>This exam will quantify the amount of bone density at 24 months after total knee arthroplasty. DXA scan can provide accurate, high-quality measurements of periprosthetic bone mineral density (BMD) with minimal precision error and a low coeficient of variation ranging from 1.3% to 4.7%17.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>KOOS (knee injury and osteoarthritis outcomes score )</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years post-op</time_frame>
    <description>The Index is self-administered and assesses the 5 subscales: pain (9 questions), other symptoms (7 questions), function in daily living (17 questions), function in sports and recreation (5) and knee related quality of live (4). All subscales are on 100, 100 being the best score, 0 the worst.
The total score is an average of all subscale</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>KSS (Knee Society Score)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years post-op</time_frame>
    <description>The original KSS has a &quot;Knee Score&quot; section (7 items) and a &quot;Functional Score&quot; section (3 items). Both sections are scored from 0 to 100 with lower scores being indicative of worse knee conditions and higher scores being indicative of better knee conditions.</description>

    <description>This self-administered generic health status measure is composed of 12 items measuring 3 major health attributes: functional status, well-being, and overall evaluation of health</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Lyshom and Tegner</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years post-op</time_frame>
    <description>The Lysholm Scale currently consists of eight items that measure: pain (25 points), instability (25 points), locking (15 points), swelling (10 points), limp (5 points), stair climbing (10 points), squatting (5 points), and need for support (5 points). Every question response has been assigned an arbitrary score on an increasing scale. The total score is the sum of each response to the eight questions, and may range from 0-100. Higher scores indicate a better outcome with fewer symptoms or disability.</description>
