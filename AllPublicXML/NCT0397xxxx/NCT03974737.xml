  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to study whether the Compensatory Reserve Index (CRI) (an FDA approved
      device that assesses intravascular volume) can be used to evaluate severity of Postural
      Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) and whether the CRI value has a correlation with
      severity of psychosocial symptoms and functional impairment associated with POTS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Autonomic dysfunction (or dysautonomia) describes several medical conditions linked to the
      autonomic nervous system. One of these is Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS).
      In pediatric populations, symptoms of autonomic dysfunction include an increase in heart rate
      when standing up (tachycardia), dizziness, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, headaches, abdominal
      discomfort, and sleep disturbances. POTS is specifically characterized by orthostatic
      intolerance and a forty beats per minute (bpm) increase in heart rate upon standing. The
      etiology of POTS is poorly understood, and there is limited literature on the management of
      POTS in pediatric populations. In the U.S., POTS is estimated to affect 1-3 million people.

      The ability of the CRI algorithm to accurately distinguish individuals with varying
      tolerances to reduced central blood volume can be attributed to a unique function of the
      algorithm, which analyzes and compares the entirety of each waveform in a window of time to
      trend subtle features that correspond with varying degrees of central volume loss. CRI can
      also detect vascular changes associated with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome. CRI
      will be evaluated in subjects at supine and standing positions along with traditional
      orthostatic measures.

      Following CRI measurements, subjects and their parents will be asked to complete a series of
      surveys to assess their psychosocial symptoms and functional impairment. The CRI measurement
      and survey completion will occur over the course of one clinic visit.

    <description>Adolescents with Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) who meet diagnostic criteria for an orthostatic heart rate increase of &gt;30, between ages 12-21 are eligible for this group. They will have a urine specific gravity conducted at the beginning of the clinic visit to assess hydration status. If urine specific gravity shows adequate hydration, subjects will proceed with orthostatic measurements with concomitant CRI measurements (via a non-invasive pulse oximetry monitor). (Subjects who are dehydrated will be given electrolyte drinks for rehydration and urine specific gravity will be rechecked after survey completion and before CRI and orthostatic measurements.) Following the CRI and orthostatic measurements, subjects and their parents will be asked to complete a series of surveys via REDcap.
