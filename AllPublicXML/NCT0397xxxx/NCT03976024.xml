  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate streptococcal carriage by swab, pharyngeal, anal and
      perineal in patients with DHBN-FN, in the entourage living under the same roof as well as
      patients with erysipelas

      The main hypothesis is the major role of chronic porting of patients and entourage in DHBN-FN
      to SBH.

      Indeed, the chronic pharyngeal / anal / perineal carriage could be a gateway following a
      transient bacteremia for a DHBN-FN.

      The transmission of germs from the surrounding to the patient plays a major role:

      At the gateway level in the case of exogenous DHBN-FN At the origin of chronic carriage in
      the case of endogenous DHBN-FN Transmission of germs from the patient to the surrounding area
      also plays an important role in increasing the risk of invasive SBH infections in the
      surrounding area.

Evaluation of streptococcal carriage by swab, pharyngeal, anal and perineal in patients hospitalized for a DHBN-FN at the end of hospitalization and 1 month after discharge from hospital during the reassessment consultation. Swabs made by the dermatologist.
The carriage of streptococcus in patients living under the same roof as patients with DHBN-FN will be evaluated by pharyngeal swab, anal and perineal. If the family accepts, the carriage of streptococcus in persons living under the same roof as patients with DHBN-FN will be evaluated by pharyngeal, anal and perineal swab in consultation.
