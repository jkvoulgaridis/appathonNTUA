  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of our study is to assess the effectiveness of Dermabond as a thoracic epidural
      fixation technique compared to both Mastisol and the Grip-Lok fixation bandage, two common,
      widely used techniques for epidural fixation.

    <description>Catheter fixation will be performed after appropriate placement of a thoracic epidural with Dermabond. The investigator performing the thoracic epidural will distribute the Dermabond at the catheter insertion site in a space no greater than a 2 cm circle around the site. Once the Dermabond is allowed to dry, mastisol will be applied to the surrounding skin and a clear Tegaderm dressing will be used to cover the catheter. Catheter depth at the skin will be recorded at that time. An Epidural catheter infusion pump with 1/8thpercent Bupivacaine and 2mcg/ml Fentanyl will be attached to the catheter and started by the primary anesthesia with a goal rate of 6ml/hr.</description>

    <description>Catheter fixation will be performed after appropriate placement of a thoracic epidural with Mastisol spray. The investigator performing the epidural placement will distribute Mastisol spray both in close proximity to the catheter insertion site as well as around the insertion site. Once the Mastisol is allowed to dry, a clear Tegaderm dressing will be used to cover the catheter. Catheter depth at the skin will be recorded at that time. An Epidural catheter infusion pump with 1/8thpercent Bupivacaine and 2mcg/ml Fentanyl will be attached to the catheter and started by the primary anesthesia team with a goal rate of 6ml/hr.</description>

    <description>Catheter fixation will be performed after appropriate placement of a thoracic epidural with a Grip-Lok fixation bandage. The investigator performing the epidural placement will place the fixation bandage one centimeter caudal from the insertion site. Mastisol will be applied to the surrounding skin and a clear Tegaderm will then be used to cover the catheter. Catheter depth at the skin will be recorded at that time. An Epidural catheter infusion pump with 1/8thpercent Bupivacaine and 2mcg/ml Fentanyl will be attached to the catheter and started by the primary anesthesia team in the operating room with a goal rate of 6ml/hr.</description>

    <description>All thoracic epidurals will be placed by a regional anesthesia resident or fellow under the direct supervision of an attending anesthesiologist using a standard epidural kit and in the paramedian approach.
Epidural placement will occur preoperatively in the same manner as our current practice criterion. There will be no difference in placement of the epidural catheter between the control groups and the treatment group. After placement, catheters will be secured with either Dermabond, Mastisol, or a Grip-Lok fixation bandage, all with overlying Tegaderms.</description>
