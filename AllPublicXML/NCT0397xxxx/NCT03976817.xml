  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical valve replacement is commonly performed in patients with severe aortic valve
      disease. In small aortic annulus, implantation of bioprosthetic valves can be associated with
      limited functional capacity. To avoid this condition, we changed our surgical technique to
      implant a larger bioprosthesis. Briefly, the prosthesis is sutured to the aortic annulus
      along the left and right coronary sinuses, and in a supraannular position along the
      noncoronary sinus, therefore allowing us to insert a prosthetic valve with a one-size larger
      diameter than the native aortic annulus.

      Surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR) is recommended for severe aortic valve disease.
      Bioprosthesis remains the substitute of choice for elderly patients. However, it may be
      associated with patient-prosthesis mismatch particularly for patients with small aortic
      annulus. Moreover, &quot;valve-in-valve&quot; transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has become
      a suitable therapeutic option for bioprosthesis structural degeneration, especially in
      patients with high surgical risk. It is therefore of great importance to implant the widest
      bioprosthesis as possible at the first AVR. The investigators report a surgical technique
      allowing the implantation of a larger bioprosthesis in patients with small aortic annulus:
      the supra-annular aortic valve replacement (SA-AVR) above the aortic annulus. The
      investigators analyzed the postoperative outcomes of the SA-AVR technique using the Perimount
      Magna Ease (Carpentier-Edwards, Irvine, California) bioprosthesis.

    <description>After median sternotomy, cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was established between the ascending aorta and the right atrium. The aorta was cross-clamped and a high potassium warm cardioplegia was infused and repeated every 15 minutes. The aortotomy was made above the sinuses and the aortic valve was removed. The prosthesis was chosen one size larger than the maximal sizer that could be inserted, which was also used to determine the appropriate height for insertion of the sutures along the wall of the non-coronary sinus.</description>
