  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study outlines a clinical prospective protocol consisting of preoperative chemoradiation
      in locally advanced rectal cancer, without elective pelvic nodal irradiation. The proposal to
      exclude lateral spaces from the target volume is based on the assumption that the
      radiological evidence of recurrence in the lateral lymph nodes is shown to be below 5%. In
      the study all patients underwent an accurate pre-treatment work-up including total body CT,
      pelvic MRI and 18-fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT, in order to include patients without evidence of
      disease in lateral lymph nodes. The primary endpoint of the study was the reduction of
      gastrointestinal toxicity; secondary endpoints were the pathological complete response (pCR),
      the local control (LC) rate, the overall survival (OS) and the disease-free survival (DFS).

      Patients affected by histologically proven rectal cancer were considered for enrollment in a
      prospective protocol that included preoperative CRT and surgical treatment. All patients
      underwent pre-treatment work-up (clinical examination, pancolonoscopy with biopsy, total body
      CT scan, pelvic MRI, and whole body 18-fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT scan). Eligible patients had
      primary resectable cT2-low lying-T3, N0-N1 adenocarcinoma of the rectum, without evidence of
      disease in lateral lymph nodes. Additional eligibility criteria included performance status
      as well as liver, kidney, and bone marrow function that allowed for long-course CRT, older
      than 18 years, and no distant metastases.
