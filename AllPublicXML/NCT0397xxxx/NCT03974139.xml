  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity, a major health problem, is gradually transforming into a global epidemic. The
      current obesity treatment with long term efficacy is the bariatric surgery, however, the
      operative risk of this procedure is high and the post-operative iotrogeny may be important.
      Obesity is most often associated to the feeding behavior which depends on hypothalamic
      integration of peripheral signals such as leptin and glucose. High levels of circulating
      leptin are detected in obese patients. These elevated leptin levels fail to reduce appetite
      or increase energy expenditure. The mechanism underlying this non-integration of peripheral
      signals remains to be identified. The ratio of leptin levels in the cereprospinal fluid (CSF)
      and in the periphery is drastically decreased in obese patients when compared to lean
      individuals, therefore a defective transport of circulating leptin into the brain via the CSF
      is maybe linked to obesity.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that the alteration of leptin transport into the CSF of obese patients could
      be modulated by drugs such as metformin which is widely used worldwide to treat diabetes.
      This study is monocentric, prospective, one-arm type and interventional. The main objective
      isto evaluate the impact of metformin on the transport of leptin into the CSF of obese
      patients.

      We propose to show a variation of CSF leptin / serum leptin before and after metformin
      treatment and study its association with changes in hypothalamic metabolic activity,
      cognitive and appetite-related behaviors and ratio of other metabolic signals. This would
      support the hypothesis of modulation of resistance to peripheral leptin by metformin and thus
      uncover a new indication for metformin treatment towards the management of obesity.

      For this purpose, volunteers will be subjected to blood sampling via venipuncture, CSF
      collection via lumbar puncture, MRI assessments and questionnaires (cognitive tests, food
      survey and feeding behavior) before and after a 3-month metformin treatment.
