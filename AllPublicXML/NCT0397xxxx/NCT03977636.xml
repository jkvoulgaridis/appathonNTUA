  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since 2008, in France, hospital funding is determined by the nature of activities provided
      (activity-based funding). Quality control of hospital activity coding is essential to
      optimize hospital remuneration. There is a need for reliable tools to allocate human
      resources wisely in order to improve these controls.

      The main objective of this study was to identify the determinants of time needed by medical
      information technicians to control hospital activity coding in a Regional Hospital Center.

      From March 2016 to the beginning of January 2017, medical information technicians reported
      the time they spent on each quality control, and the time they needed when they had to code
      the entire stay. Multiple linear regressions were performed to identify the determinants of
      quality control or coding duration. A split sample validation was used: model was created on
      one half of the sample and validated on the remaining half.
