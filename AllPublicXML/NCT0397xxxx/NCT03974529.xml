      High quality clinical trial and meta-analysis have demonstrated short term, and to a lesser
      extent, long term benefits in various outcome measures. To achieve positive effects,
      supervised progressive strength and aerobic endurance training program of 12 weeks was
      required. Extended progressive strength training improved muscle strength for up to 24
      months. While aerobic endurance training would increase walking capacity up to 16 months. 1
      There are data suggesting a threshold of intensity of exercise to be reached for the positive
      effect. This overall body of evidence suggests that regular vigorous exercise should be
      accorded a central place in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.

      However, there was no evidence about regular intensive exercise of running in Parkinson's
      disease. And most of the studies were not randomized with a control group.

      In this study, the investigators are to investigate the effect of regular vigorous aerobic
      exercise training of running on motor and non-motor symptoms, and quality-of-life of people
      with Parkinson's disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is growing volume of evidences support the positive effect of exercise and physical
      therapy to Parkinson's disease. Various exercise types have shown different positive effects.
      Gait training for 4 weeks showed a moderate improvement in balancing while balance training
      of 8 to 26 weeks decreased fall rate. Cued exercise would mildly increase the speed of the
      gait. Complementary exercises, such as Tai Chi and dancing, have shown improvement in
      balancing of the patients.

      One of the main complaints of Parkinson's disease is rigidity. It is because of the
      musculoskeletal impairments which compromise the flexibility and stability of both axial
      structure (spine) and the extremities. Truncal stiffness and rigidity results in a stooped
      posture, which further undermines one's balance and agility. Flexibility training
      (stretching) is shown to be beneficial to all stages of patients with Parkinson's disease, in
      terms of improved both range of movement in joints and spinal stability. It is recommended
      that regular stretching should be the first step in one's exercise program to combat the
      muscle rigidity. High quality clinical trial and meta-analysis have demonstrated short term,
      and to a lesser extent, long term benefits in various outcome measures. To achieve positive
      effects, supervised progressive strength and aerobic endurance training program of 12 weeks
      was required. Extended progressive strength training improved muscle strength for up to 24
      months. While aerobic endurance training would increase walking capacity up to 16 months.

      There are data suggested a threshold of intensity of exercise to be reached for the positive
      effect. This overall body of evidence suggests that regular vigorous exercise should be
      accorded a central place in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.

      In this study, the investigators are to investigate the effect of regular vigorous aerobic
      exercise training of running on motor and non-motor symptoms, and quality-of-life of people
      with Parkinson's disease.

    <description>A comprehensive 50 question assessment of both motor and non-motor symptoms associated with Parkinson's. The MDS-UPDRS features sections that require independent completion by people affected by Parkinson's and their carers, and sections to be completed by the clinician.
Part 1: non-motor experiences of daily living Part 2: motor experiences of daily living Part 3: motor examination Part 4: motor complications. Some sections of the UPDRS scale require multiple grades assigned to each extremity with a possible maximum of 199 points. A score of 199 on the UPDRS scale represents the worst (total disability) with a score of zero representing (no disability).</description>

    <description>The PDQ39 is a 39-item self-reporting questionnaire which assess the Parkinson's disease associated health related quality over the last month. PDQ-39
There are 39 questions in the long form Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire, with 8 discrete scales:
mobility (10 items) activities of daily living (6 items) emotional well-being (6 items) stigma (4 items) social support (3 items) cognitions (4 items) communication (3 items) bodily discomfort (3 items) Patients are asked to think about their health and general well-being and to consider how often in the last month they have experienced certain events (e.g. difficulty walking 100 yards). Patients are asked to indicate the frequency of each event by selecting one of 5 options (likert Scale): never/occasionally/sometimes/often/always or cannot do at all.</description>

    <description>Symptoms related to anxiety and depression measured with Anxiety and depression Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). It is a commonly used tools in hospital settings to determine the level of depression and anxiety. There are 14 questions in total, with 7 items assessing level of depression whereas 7 for the level of anxiety. Each item on the questionnaire is scored from 0-3 and this means that a person can score between 0 and 21 for either anxiety or depression. The higher the score, the higher level of depression/ anxiety patient is experiencing.The HADS uses a scale and therefore the data returned from the HADS is ordinal.</description>
