      The main gold of this study is to lead a multicentric, prospective study, to evaluate the
      diagnostic quality of tears in children with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) and
      radiologically isolated syndrome (RIS) during a longitudinal follow-up.

    <textblock>
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a disease that affects the white matter of the central nervous
      system. In France, approximately 100,000 patients are affected. It is one of the most common
      neurological condition in young adults.

      The presence of supernumerary oligoclonal bands (OCBs) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in
      comparison to the serum was established in 2017 as a criterion for temporal dissemination in
      MS patients. This is a predictive factor of conversion to MS in the clinically isolated
      syndrome (CIS) and radiologically isolated syndrome (RIS), either in children or adults.

      However, the main inconvenient of OCB analysis in CSF is the requirement of a lumbar
      puncture, which is a traumatising technique that may raise ethical concerns especially when
      it has to be performed in children.

      Searching for OCBs in tears, which are more accessible, may represent an attractive
      alternative. Some published articles studying adult populations go in this direction, but
      there are no data in the literature regarding children.

      The main gold of this study is to lead a multicentric, prospective study, to evaluate the
      diagnostic quality of tears in children with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) and
      radiologically isolated syndrome (RIS) during a longitudinal follow-up.
