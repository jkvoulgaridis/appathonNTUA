  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the addition of Low Dose Naltrexone to standard
      endometriosis treatments will improve patient reported endometriosis associated pain.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The central hypothesis of the research study is that low dose naltrexone (LDN), in
      combination with hormonal suppression of endometriosis (standard of care), will lead to
      significant improvement of endometriosis-related pain.

      The proposal seeks to:

        1. determine if the addition of LDN to standard endometriosis treatments will improve
           patient- reported endometriosis associated pain using daily Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)
           scores and

        2. measure the impact of treatment on quality of life as measured by validated
           questionnaires including the Endometriosis Health Profile-30 (EHP30) and the Patient's
           Global Impression of Change (PGIC).

    <description>Pain will be reported daily using the Visual Analog Scale, a 100mm horizontal line on which the patient's pain intensity is represented by a point between the extremities of 0 (no pain) and 100 (worst pain). The final outcome measure will be calculated as area under the curve from randomization through 12-weeks of intervention and normalized per participant to an average AUC score per week.</description>
