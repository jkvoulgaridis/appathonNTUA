  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order to best meet the needs of all those affected by the genetic risk of cancer in our
      region, it is important to identify the factors likely to influence the course leading to the
      GENEPY surveillance network. The aim of this study is to evaluatie the adhesion to the
      network of care of people at genetic risk of cancer in Midi-Pyrénées (GENEPY).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This network has been open since November 2015 for people who are genetically predisposed to
      breast / ovarian cancer. The extension to digestive pathologies (HNPCC syndrome, PAF) is in
      progress. It concerns not only the persons carrying a mutation also those belonging to a
      family without identified mutation but whose risk of predisposition is important.

      The GENEPY network is based on a collaboration between oncogenetic consultations in the
      region and professionals practicing in institutions (private, public) and liberal: general
      practitioners, gynecologists, radiologists, oncologists, gastroenterologists, psychologists
      ...

      It is therefore a multicentric and multidisciplinary network, which aims to promote the local
      care of people genetically predisposed (or considered at high risk of genetic
      predisposition), while ensuring a high level of competence, to guarantee an optimal and
      equitable care on the whole of Midi Pyrenees.

      The diagnosis of a new genetic disease in an individual is likely to have implications for
      other family members who may themselves be at risk of developing the disease and / or passing
      it on to their children.

      The inclusion of subjects in the GENEPY network follows the genealogical study of a case
      (index) : relatives are identified as potentially at risk. In accordance with the
      recommendations, but also generally at the wish of the patients, the index case is then asked
      to inform its relatives and to propose them to go to an oncogenetic consultation of their
      choice. If these people reside in the Midi Pyrenees Toulouse oncogenetic consultation is open
      to them. If following this consultation a mutation is identified or that their genetic risk
      is considered important, they are proposed to join the GENEPY network for their monitoring.
