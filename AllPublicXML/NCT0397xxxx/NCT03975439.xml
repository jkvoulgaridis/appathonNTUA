  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate chronic kidney disease (CKD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD)
      risk factors in a sample population of Hispanics/Latinos and Caucasians in Yakima county that
      are rural dwelling. This investigation is intended to provide information on the impact rural
      geographical location and social determinants of health (SDOH) have on CKD and CVD risk
      factors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Yakima County has a large hispanic farmworker population. The peak work times are between May
      and September. There is a growing body of research that shows the risk of agricultural
      workers in work environments with extreme heat.

      The purpose of this pilot study is to look at incidence of non-diagnosed chronic kidney
      disease within Yakima County to inform future studies to examine other factors and unique
      bio-markers that may help in the early diagnosis of heat related injuries in agricultural
      workers.
