  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vitreous fluid, containing 95% water, fills the space behind the lens. Its gelatinous
      consistency is due to the presence of hyaluronic acid, mucopolysaccharide and collagen
      fibers. With age, the collagen aggregates into parallel bundles, bound by cross links,
      leaving the pockets of liquid in the glass body. This redistribution is referred to as
      syneresis, which is found in 90% older than 40 years. After liquefaction, the vitreous enters
      the retroviral space and separates the posterior hyaloid membrane from the retina. When
      separating from the optical disk it forms an annular formation (Weiss ring) in front of the
      optical disc. These agglomerated collagen bundles (opacities) disperse the photons of light
      and are perceived by the patients as a &quot;gray silhouette-like artifact&quot;. Two major
      interventions for these symptoms include Nd: YAG laser vitreolysis and vitrectomy. The less
      invasive method Nd: YAG laser increases the temperature of the opacity thus vaporizing them
      to smaller fragments that are easier to sediment onto the bottom of the vitreous cavity
      thereby relieving the symptoms.

    <description>Before treatment an optical coherence tomography (OCT) scan of the macula is performed to monitor possible macular oedema. After application of anesthetic and midriatics drops, the patient is positioned on the chin and forhead support (ND: YAG laser). Then, a contact lens (panfundoscope) is filled with methylcellulose and placed on the cornea. The laser is focused on the opacity that is to be treated and the first laser stamp of an initial power of 3 mJ is applied. The measured direct effect will guide in further adjustment of the laser beam power to achieve the desired effect. After treatment, a single drop of corticosteroid is applied to the patient and an ocular patch is applied. On follow up days an OCT scan of the macula is performed to monitor possible side effects.</description>
