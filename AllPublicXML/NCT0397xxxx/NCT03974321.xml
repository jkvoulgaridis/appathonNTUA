  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute myocardial infarction (MI) is a significant complication following non-cardiac surgery.
      We sought to evaluate incidence of perioperative MI, its preoperative - and intraoperative -
      risk factors and outcomes after this complication.

      Background:

      In Sweden, over 800 000 patents undergo surgery each year. Worldwide, the number of surgical
      procedures yearly is over 310 million. Surgical care is en essential part of the advancement
      in treating disease, associated with increased lift expectancy a d improved quality of life.
      However as surgical volume continues to grow, the number of patients who suffer postoperative
      complications will also increase.

      Hemodynamic instability in the perioperative period is frequent and there has been a
      cumulative interest in this area and the relation to organ failure over the recent years.
      There are several studies showing results of associations between intraoperative hypotensive
      events and perioperative cardiac, kidney and cerebral injury, as well as increased mortality
      in high-risk surgical patients.

      More specifically the project aims to answer how intraoperative events, with a special focus
      on hypotension, are related to perioperative myocardial and kidney injury.

      We hypothesize that patients, with preoperative risk factors, undergoing major non-cardiac
      surgery are at increased risk of developing perioperative organ damage in the presence of
      intraoperative hypotension or other events such as tachycardia, hypoxia and extensive blood
      loss.
