  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this study is to ultimately develop an improved standard of cancer
      care by facilitating new cancer research, clinical trials, new technology, new informatics
      solutions, and &quot;personalized medicine&quot; for the University of New Mexico Comprehensive Cancer
      Center (UNMCCC) and the Oncology Research Information Exchange Network (ORIEN) Consortium of
      academic medical centers, community hospital systems, and other health care providers. To
      bring new translational research to the community, the ORIEN consortium has initiated the
      ORIEN Total Cancer Care Program (TCCP). The TCCP establishes a unique collection of blood,
      tissue, other biological samples and their associated data (survey data, medical records
      data, cancer registry data, and other related data) from thousands of patients with cancer or
      at risk of having cancer. This is not a treatment trial. It is a study designed to create a
      centralized data and tissue repository.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Through this protocol, UNMCCC and its partners will establish and maintain a unique
      repository of blood, tissue, other biological samples and their associated data (survey data,
      medical records data, cancer registry data, and other related data) collected from thousands
      of patients 18 years of age or older who have cancer or are at risk of developing cancer. In
      this protocol, the investigators require the permission of patients to study their answers to
      survey questions that may be collected as part of their regular clinical care, permission to
      study their medical and related records, and permission to collect excess tissues removed at
      the time of planned surgery, an additional tumor sampling (needle passes) at the time of
      planned diagnostic biopsies, previously collected, stored tumor tissue (if available), blood,
      and/or other biological samples. Additional research tumor samples may be collected at the
      time of any diagnostic needle biopsy or endoscopic biopsy or, if available, patient tissue
      from a previous procedure will be obtained and utilized as needed. Clinical and related data
      will be collected on all patients from the time of initial entry into the study and will
      continue for life.
