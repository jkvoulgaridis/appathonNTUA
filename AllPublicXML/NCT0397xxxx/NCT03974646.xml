  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to develop, implement and evaluate the effectiveness of a theory-driven
      nurse-led self-management intervention program compared to standard usual care in people with
      CKD stages 3-4 on CKD knowledge, self-management behavior, self-efficacy and HRQoL using
      valid and reliable instruments in Malaysia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients aged ≥ 18 years with CKD stages 3−4 will be recruited between July 2019 - October
      2019. Participants will be randomly allocated into either the intervention (N = 77) or
      control group (N = 77). The control group will receive standard usual care, while the
      intervention group will receive standard usual care plus a self-management program delivered
      by renal nurse educators. The intervention will be guided by social cognitive theory and
      include group-based educational sessions, CKD booklet and follow-up phone calls. Both groups
      will be followed for 12 weeks. Data will be analyzed using SPSS version 25. The primary
      outcomes are improving in knowledge and self-management, while the secondary outcomes are
      improving in self-confidence, quality of life and clinical outcomes of the participants.

    <measure>Change CKD knowledge</measure>
    <time_frame>Timepoint 1 = Baseline. Repeated measurement: Timepoint 2 = week 12 (Five week post-intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>kidney disease knowledge will be measured using a self-report instrument Kidney Disease Knowledge Survey (KiKS). It includes 28 questions, 5 multiple choice type questions and 23 Yes-No questions; none of the questions included an &quot;I don´t know&quot; option. To assess the survey score, 1 point was given to each correct answer and zero to each wrong one. The questionnaire doesn't have domains, and the total score was calculated as the sum of the correct responses to each question divided by the total number of questions, which results in values from 0 to 1 where 1 means the highest level of knowledge.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change CKD Self-Management Behavior</measure>
    <time_frame>Timepoint 1 = Baseline. Repeated measurement: Timepoint 2 = week 12 (Five week post-intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>CKD self-management behavior will be assessed by Self-report instrument Chronic Kidney Disease Self-management (CKD-SM) by (C. C. Lin et al., 2013). CKD-SM instrument contains of 29-item to measure participants' self-management behavior factors. Each item is scored on a Likert scale from 1−4 with 1 being 'never' and 4 'always'. Total scores of the CKD-SM range from 29 to 116 and higher scores indicate better self-management behavior in managing CKD.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change Self-efficacy to manage CKD.</measure>
    <time_frame>Timepoint 1 = Baseline. Repeated measurement: Timepoint 2 = week 12 (Five week post-intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Self-efficacy will be measured by using a self-report instrument the Stanford Self-Efficacy for Managing Chronic Disease - 6-item Scale. This widely used six-item instrument was derived from several self-efficacy scales developed and tested for the Chronic Disease Self-Management study by Lorig et al., 2001. Each item is scored on a 10-point Likert scale ranging from &quot;not at all confident&quot; (1) to &quot;totally confident&quot; (10), with a total score ranging from 6-60. The scale is scored by calculating the mean of at least four of the six items, therefore allowing for a maximum of two missing items. A higher number indicates a higher self-efficacy.</description>

    <measure>Change Health-related quality of life (HRQoL): Malay KDQOL-36TM</measure>
    <time_frame>Timepoint 1 = Baseline. Repeated measurement: Timepoint 2 = week 12 (Five week post-intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Health-related quality of life will be assessed using a self-report instrument Malay version of the Kidney Disease Quality of life (KDQOL-36TM) originally developed by RAND Health Organization, the University of Arizona for individuals with CKD and on dialysis. KDQOL-36TM consists of 12 items which measure physical functioning (physical component summary PCS) and mental functioning (mental component summary MCS), four items to assess the burden of kidney disease, 12 items for symptoms and problems, and eight items to measure the effects of kidney disease on daily life. The scores of the KDQOL-36TM are transformed into 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better HRQoL.</description>
