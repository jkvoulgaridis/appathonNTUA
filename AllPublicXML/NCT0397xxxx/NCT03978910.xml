  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human motor adaptation is crucial to adapt to new environments, such as altered gravity.
      Dexterous manipulation and fine movements in space require learning new coordinated motor
      actions. Traditionally, adaptation mechanisms have been tested in laboratories with robotic
      devices that perturb specific task parameters unbeknownst to the participant. Over
      repetition, participants build a more accurate representation of the task dynamics and,
      eventually, improve performance. These perturbations are applied locally on the hand or limb
      while the dynamics of the rest of the body remains unaltered. These approaches are therefore
      limitative since they do not reflect ecological adaptation to globally changed dynamics, such
      as new gravitational environments. Parabolic flights, centrifuges and water immersion allow
      circumventing these limitations. Previous investigations in these contexts have highlighted
      the role of the global context in motor adaptation. However, it is unknown if global learning
      could benefit from exploiting known local dynamics. Here, we design an original task that
      will capture both the learning of arm movement kinematics as well as grasping forces for
      object manipulation in an ecologically valid design. We test whether executing this task in
      hypogravity with rendering of Earth gravity locally at the hand is beneficial or detrimental
      to task performance. By adopting the &quot;negative picture&quot; of conventional robotic approaches,
      these results will further our understanding of basic motor adaptation and provide insightful
      information on the optimal design and control of human-machine interfaces and wearable robots
      in space environments and other immersive dynamics.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy volunteers (men or women).

          -  Aged from 18 to 65.

          -  Affiliated to a Social Security system and, for non-French resident, holding a
             European Health Insurance Card (EHIC).

          -  Who accepted to take part in the study.

          -  Who can take scopolamine or nautamine (medication against airsickness).

          -  Who have given their informed written stated consent.

          -  Who have passed a medical examination similar to a standard aviation medical
             examination for private pilot aptitude (JAR FCL3 Class 2 medical examination) and have
             been declared fit to fly. The examination must be less than one year before the
             experiment flight. There will be no additional test performed for participant
             selection.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Persons who took part in a previous biomedical research protocol, of which exclusion
             period is not terminated.

          -  Persons with any history of cerebral, cardiovascular or vestibular diseases.

          -  Persons with history of psychiatric diseases, including anxiety disorder.

          -  Persons whose medical condition has changed since the class 2-like medical
             examination.

          -  Pregnant women (urine pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential).
