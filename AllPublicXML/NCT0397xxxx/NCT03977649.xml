    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial with a 2-sequence, 2-period,
      2-treatment crossover design. The study population will consist of adult male and female
      subjects with a documented history of episodic migraine (4 to 14 baseline migraine days), who
      have failed at least 2 previous migraine prophylactic treatment for lack of efficacy or
      tolerability. After a run-in phase of 4 weeks, patients will be randomized, according to a
      1:1 ratio, to a 24 weeks of treatment, as follow:

        -  Sequence 1: A/B

        -  Sequence 2: B/A where: A=monthly subcutaneous erenumab 140 mg for 12 weeks; B=monthly
           subcutaneous masked placebo for 12 weeks
