      This study evaluates the safety of PVSRIPO treatment in combination with Atezolizumab in
      patients with WHO grade IV malignant glioma. All patients will receive a single PVSRIPO
      infusion followed by atezolizumab infusions every three weeks for up to two years.

      The purpose of this phase1b/2 study of atezolizumab in combination with oncolytic
      polio/rhinovirus recombinant (PVSRIPO) in patients with recurrent World Health Organization
      (WHO) grade IV malignant glioma is to assess the safety of the combination of PVSRIPO +
      atezolizumab, as well as describe the survival of patients receiving this novel therapy
      combination. Patients will receive an intratumoral infusion of PVSRIPO followed by
      atezolizumab treatment with possible surgical resection after the first atezolizumab
      treatment at the discretion of the treating neurosurgeon.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have a recurrent supratentorial WHO grade IV malignant glioma based on
             imaging studies with measurable disease (≥ 1 cm and ≤ 5.5 cm of contrast-enhancing
             tumor). Prior histopathology consistent with a WHO grade IV malignant glioma confirmed
             by the study pathologist, Roger McLendon, or his designate. Assuming patient meets all
             other criteria, the treating neurosurgeon must confirm placement of infusion catheter
             tip can occur ≥ 1cm from ventricles and that procedures can be completed per their
             medical judgement and in keeping with the protocol, when considering individual lesion
             characteristics including location relative to eloquent brain function.

          -  Patient or partner(s) meets one of the following criteria:

               1. Non-childbearing potential (i.e. not sexually active, physiologically incapable
                  of becoming pregnant, including any female who is post-menopausal or surgically
                  sterile, or any male who has had a vasectomy). Surgically sterile females are
                  defined as those with a documented hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy or
                  tubal ligation. Postmenopausal for purposes of this study is defined as 1 year
                  without menses.; or

               2. Childbearing potential and agrees to use one of the following methods of birth
                  control: approved hormonal contraceptives (e.g. birth control pills, patches,
                  implants, or infusions), an intrauterine device, or a barrier method of
                  contraception (e.g. a condom or diaphragm) used with spermicide.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years of age at the time of entry into the study

          -  Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS) ≥ 70%

          -  Total bilirubin, serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamic
             pyruvic transaminase (SGPT), alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 x normal prior to biopsy

          -  Neutrophil count ≥ 1000 prior to biopsy

          -  Hemoglobin ≥ 9 prior to biopsy

          -  Platelet count ≥ 100,000/µl unsupported is necessary for eligibility on the study;
             however, because of risks of intracranial hemorrhage with catheter placement, platelet
             count ≥ 120,000/µl is required for the patient to undergo biopsy and catheter
             insertion, which can be attained with the help of platelet transfusion

          -  Creatinine ≤ 1.2 x normal range prior to biopsy

          -  Positive serum anti-poliovirus titer prior to biopsy

          -  The patient must have received a boost immunization with trivalent inactivated IPOL™
             (Sanofi-Pasteur) at least 1 week, but less than 6 weeks, prior to administration of
             the study agent

          -  At the time of biopsy, prior to administration of virus, the presence of recurrent
             tumor must be confirmed by histopathological analysis

          -  A signed informed consent form approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) will
             be required for patient enrollment into the study. Patients must be able to read and
             understand the informed consent document and must sign the informed consent indicating
             that they are aware of the investigational nature of this study

               1. Patients with an active infection requiring intravenous treatment or having an
                  unexplained febrile illness (Tmax &gt; 99.5°F/37.5°C)

             recovered from side effects of such therapy

          -  Patients may not have received immunotherapy ≤ 4 weeks prior to starting the study
             drug unless patients have recovered from side effects of such therapy

          -  Patients may not be less than 12 weeks from radiation therapy of the brain, unless
             progressive disease outside of the radiation field or 2 progressive scans at least 4

                  mandated to have received chemotherapy prior to participating in this trial

               2. If the MGMT promoter in their tumor is known to be methylated or the MGMT
                  promoter methylation status is unknown at time of screening, patients must have
                  received at least one chemotherapy regimen prior to participating in this trial

          -  Patients with neoplastic lesions in the brainstem, cerebellum, or spinal cord;
             radiological evidence of active (growing) disease (active multifocal disease); tumors

          -  Patients with prior, unrelated malignancy requiring current active treatment with the
             exception of cervical carcinoma in situ and adequately treated basal cell or squamous
             cell carcinoma of the skin

          -  Patients with a known history of hypersensitivity to atezolizumab, or any components
             of atezolizumab

          -  Patients with active autoimmune disease requiring systemic immunomodulatory treatment
             within the past 3 months

        NOTE: If a patient is treated for an unrelated malignancy other than the exceptions noted
        within the past 3 years, a letter from their treating oncologist for the unrelated
        malignancy must be on file confirming that said unrelated malignancy does not require
        current active treatment (prophylactic like tamoxifen OK) and that the patient is stable
        with low risk of recurrence/death within 3 years from this other malignancy (i.e., disease
        is stable). If this letter is not on file, a consult with the Sponsor's medical designee is
        required prior to submitting the patient for consideration of enrollment in the trial.
