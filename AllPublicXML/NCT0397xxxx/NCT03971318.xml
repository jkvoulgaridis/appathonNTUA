  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the development of molecular biology and precise medical treatment, new challenges have
      been raised in the diagnosis and treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in children. In
      recent years, the criteria for clinical staging and efficacy evaluation of NHL in children
      have been updated. Recent clinical studies of COG in the United States and LMB in France have
      confirmed that molecular biological markers such as Notch1, PTEN and LOH6q are significantly
      associated with the prognosis of T-lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL). These molecular biological
      markers should be included in the new risk stratification system. High-intensity treatment of
      high-risk patients will improve survival. Recent studies have also suggested that PET/CT is
      helpful in evaluating residual lesions in patients with lymphoma after chemotherapy. In order
      to keep pace with the times in the diagnosis, clinical staging, risk stratification, efficacy
      evaluation and treatment of NHL in children. SCCCG-LBL-2017 was formulated by South China
      Children's Cancer Group of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which mainly updated in clinical staging,
      efficacy evaluation, risk stratification, treatment,etc..

      Research purpose:

        1. To investigate the efficacy and safety of SCCCG-LBL-2017 in Chinese children with LBL.

        2. To explore the feasibility of risk stratification of T-LBL by combining genotyping.

        3. To investigate the correlation between MDD and MRD in lymphoblastic lymphoma and
           prognosis.

        4. To investigate the role of PET/CT in the assessment of residual lymphoblastic lymphoma.

        5. To explore the effect of reducing HD-MTX dosage and shortening maintenance therapy time
           on the efficacy and survival of low-risk LBL patients.

        6. To explore the effect of prolonging the duration of maintenance therapy on the efficacy
           and survival of high-risk LBL patients.
