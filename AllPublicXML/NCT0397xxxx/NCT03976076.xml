  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open label, multicenter study allows JBPOS0101 (investigational product) to be given as
      either add-on therapy or monotherapy for patients with refractory infantile spasms. The
      design and choice of study population of this Phase 2 clinical study is based on the need to
      provide initial safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and efficacy outcomes of the
      investigational product for future clinical studies.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female between 6 months through 24 months of age at the time of informed
             consent

          -  Has clinical diagnosis of IS, confirmed by video-electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis,
             and hypsarrhythmia on EEG at screening according to the Burden of Amplitudes and
             Epileptiform Discharges (BASED) scale score.

          -  As assessed by the investigator has no or partial response to at least 2 out of the 3
             therapies of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), vigabatrin, and glucocorticoids
             (i.e. prednisolone, prednisone), or has no or partial response to at least 1 out of
             the 3 therapies of ACTH, vigabatrin, and glucocorticoids and is contraindicated to
             and/or refused by the patient's legal representative(s) for treatment with one or both
             other 2 therapies.

          -  Patient has general good health (defined as the absence of any clinically relevant
             abnormalities as determined by the investigator) based on physical and neurological
             examinations, medical history, normal renal function and electrocardiogram (ECG), and
             clinical laboratory values completed during the Screening Period visit (Visit 1).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient considered by the investigator, for any reason (including, but not limited to,
             the risks described as precautions and warnings in the current version of the
             investigator's brochure for investigational product) to be an unsuitable candidate to
             receive the investigational product.

          -  Patient has known or suspected allergy to the investigational product or apple juice.

          -  Patient has clinically significant renal impairment, defined as creatinine &gt;1.5 mg/dL
             or blood urea nitrogen &gt;2 × upper limit of normal (ULN); clinically significant liver
             dysfunction, defined as total bilirubin ≥2 × ULN, or aspartate aminotransferase or
             alanine aminotransferase ≥3 × ULN; has clinically significant abnormal laboratory
             values; the investigator may deem the patient eligible if he/she judges the laboratory
             values to be not clinically significant.

          -  Patient has an ongoing or known history of human immunodeficiency virus infection, or
             chronic hepatitis B or C.

          -  Patient has a clinically significant abnormality on ECG that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, increases the safety risks of participating in the study.

          -  Patient has a neurodegenerative disorder as the underlying cause of IS.

          -  Patient has a known history of aspiration pneumonia within the past year.

          -  Patient has previously participated in another clinical study of the investigational
             product or received any investigational drug or device or investigational therapy
             within 30 days of study entry.

          -  Patient has received therapy with felbamate, cannabinoids, ketogenic diet or vagus
             nerve stimulation within 14 days of screening.

          -  Patient has received therapy with a medication known to be a CYP3A4 substrate and
             whose PK has been shown to be impacted in the presence of a CYP3A4 inhibitor within 14
             days of screening.

          -  Patient has not remained at stables doses of all drugs used for treating epileptic
             seizures for at least 14 days prior to screening (except for rescue medications used
             for acute treatment of breakthrough seizures which are not known to be CYP3A4
             substrates and whose PK has not been shown to be impacted in the presence of a CYP3A4
             inhibitor.

          -  Patient has a lethal or potentially lethal condition other than infantile spasms, with
             a significant risk of death before 18 months of age such as non-ketotic
             hyperglycinemia.

          -  Patient has had more than 12 months pass since the clinical diagnosis of IS.

          -  Patient has a body weight below 5 kg.
