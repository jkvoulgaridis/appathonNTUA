  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibrosis is a dynamic process resulting from the balance of fibrogenesis and fibrolysis,
      mainly secondary to chronic necro-inflammation related to regular alcohol consumption,
      metabolic syndrome (NASH) or viral hepatitis. The liver has the property of allowing the
      reversion of fibrosis / cirrhosis when the necrotic-inflammatory activity is controlled. The
      balance between fibrosis / fibrolysis and its inhibition depends on many pathways and the
      hypothesis of the efficacy of a single treatment remains uncertain. Molecular factors in the
      progression of liver fibrosis should be determined. It is necessary to control the liver
      fibrosis and thus reduce the risk of carcinoma in this population. The anti-fibrotic drugs
      are being developed, but so far only alpha-tocopherol and obeticholic acid have been shown to
      have a significant anti-fibrotic effect in humans. Several new drugs are currently being
      evaluated in ongoing Phase 2 and 3 randomized clinical trials, but most of them have
      intrinsic limitations: (i) they take a long time for evaluation (&gt; 3 years), ( ii) they
      generally require an histopathological evaluation by serial liver biopsies that are invasive
      and unpopular with patients who are aware of noninvasive tests for fibrosis assessment and
      (iii) treatment is often a single treatment versus a placebo group with the uncertainty that
      at 1 or 3 years, serial liver biopsies results are convincing.

      The study will be performed in 30 patients. Patients will be enrolled in two investigators
      sites (Cochin Hospital, Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital, France) where the patient selection will
      be conducted during a Multidisciplinary Collaborative Meeting.

      The patients will be enrolled after collecting their informed consent. As soon as the patient
      is included, arrangements will be made for the organization of the liver resection according
      to the usual procedure of the hospital department.

      The biological samples for the research (blood and liver) will be taken at the time of the
      surgery and sent to the Research Unit (Institut Pasteur) where immunological analyses will be
      carried out.
