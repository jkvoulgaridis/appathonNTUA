        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. A new written informed consent for participation of the study is required to be given
             before undergoing any study-specific procedures.

          2. Only patients that have previously been dosed by the IMP according to protocol
             Protrans-1 are eligible for a second dose of Protrans.

          3. No identified IMP related on-going adverse event, neither history of any adverse event
             that is evaluated potentially to be related to the previous IMP dosing in Protrans I.

          4. Clinical history compatible with type 1 diabetes diagnosed less than 3 years before
             enrolment. This also includes control patients not receiving IMP.

          5. Only male patients between 18-41 years of age will be included.

          6. Mentally stable and, in the opinion of the investigator, able to comply with the
             procedures of the study protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Inability to provide informed consent

          2. Patients with body mass index (BMI) &gt; 30, or weight &gt;100 kg

          3. Patients with weight &lt;50 kg

          4. Patients with unstable cardiovascular status incl. NYHA class III/IV or symptoms of
             angina pectoris.

          5. Patients with uncontrolled hypertension (≥160/105 mmHg).

          6. Patients with active infections unless treatment is not judged necessary by the
             investigators

          7. Patients with latent or previous as well as on-going therapy against tuberculosis, or
             exposed to tuberculosis or has travelled in areas with high risk of tuberculosis or
             mycosis within the last 3 months.

          8. Patients with serological evidence of infection with HIV, Treponema pallidum,
             hepatitis B antigen (patients with serology consistent with previous vaccination and a
             history of vaccination are acceptable) or hepatitis C.

          9. Patients with any immune suppressive treatment

         10. Patients with known demyelinating disease or with symptoms or physical examination
             findings consistent with possible demyelinating disease.

         11. Patients with known, or previous, malignancy.

         12. Taking oral anti-diabetic therapies or any other concomitant medication which may
             interfere with glucose regulation other than insulin

         13. Patients with GFR &lt;80 ml/min/1.73 m2 body surface

         14. Patients with proliferative retinopathy

         15. Patient with any condition or any circumstance that in the opinion of the investigator
             would make it unsafe to undergo treatment with MSC.

         16. Known hypersensitivity against any excipients, i.e. dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).
