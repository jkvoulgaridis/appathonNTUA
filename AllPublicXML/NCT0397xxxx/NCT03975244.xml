  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Patients awaiting bariatric surgery, apart from suffering higher BMI, show a
      large number of comorbidities and a low physical fitness. These factors are associated with a
      longer surgery time, a longer hospital stay and a greater number of operative complications.
      To reduce these disadvantages, a nutritional intervention is performed to reduce total weight
      and the comorbidities associated with obesity prior to surgery. However, the prescription of
      an exercise program, which can be an effective tool to improve these factors, is not usually
      part of the usual care of these patients.

      Objective: To know the effects of a semi-supervised exercise program on body composition,
      cardiovascular risk factors and operative complications in bariatric patients.

      Methods: Approximately 3 months before surgery, 60 patients awaiting bariatric surgery will
      be recruited. Patients will be randomized into two groups: a) an experimental group (n = 30);
      b) a control group (n = 30). The experimental group will perform a semi-supervised exercise
      program, while the control group will only perform the corresponding evaluations. Both groups
      will be assessed for body composition, cardiovascular risk factors, physical condition,
      quality of life and physical activity levels at the beginning and at the end of the
      intervention. In addition, surgery time, hospital length of stay and operative complications
      will be evaluated in both groups.

    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 months, between 8:00 AM and 9:00 AM.</time_frame>
    <description>Bioimpedance analysis will be used for establishing body weight and body composition. This variables will be evaluated between 8:00 and 9:00 A.M., after at least 8 hours of fasting, with an empty bladder. Body mass index will be calculated dividing weight in kilograms by squared height in meters. Therefore, body mass index will be expressed as kgÂ·m-2.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The Spanish version of Short Form Health Survey 36 (SF-36) will be used for knowing changes in quality of life. This questionnaire uses 8 scales to evaluate physical health (4 scales: Physical Function, Role Physical, Bodily Pain, General Health) and mental health (4 scales: Vitality, Social functioning, Role Emotional, and Mental Health). The scores of these scales are transformed into values between 0-100 points, where highest scores are related to better function. These 8 scales are grouped into two summary components (physical summary component; mental summary component) which will be calculated according to the reference values of the Spanish population, with a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10.population.</description>
