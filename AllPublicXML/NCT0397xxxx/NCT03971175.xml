    <textblock>
      Study design Prospective multicentre explorative randomized single blinded study to evaluate
      accuracy of molecular genetic characterisation of NSCLC. Patients with suspected lung cancer
      are randomized in a 1:1-setting for bronchoscopic tumor tissue either by forceps or by
      cryobiopsy. Apart from the bronchoscopic techniques liquid biopsy of peripheral blood and if
      feasible transbronchial needle aspiration with or without endobronchial ultrasound guidance
      are performed for in all patients.

      Objectives

      Primary Objective:

      assessment of differences in detection of molecular genetic alterations in NSCLC between
      bronchoscopic forceps biopsy and bronchoscopic cryobiopsy

      Secondary Objective:

      assessment of differences in detection of molecular genetic alterations in NSCLC between

        -  liquid biopsy, solid tumor tissue by bronchoscopic techniques, cytologic material by
           TBNA

        -  combination of methods (tissue biopsy, TBNA and liquid biopsy) and single techniques

        -  naïve and processed tumor tissue specimen (eg. microdissection)

      To assess differences in side effects e.g. periinterventional bleeding

      Explorative Objective:

      To explore tumor mutational burden with regard to

        -  solid tumor tissue by bronchoscopic forceps biopsy by bronchoscopic cryobiopsy

        -  cytologic material by (EBUS-guided) TBNA

        -  liquid biopsy

      Target subject population Patients with suspected lung cancer or proven NSCLC and visible
      tumor suspicious lesion(s) requiring tissue diagnosis form the study population of this
      trial.
