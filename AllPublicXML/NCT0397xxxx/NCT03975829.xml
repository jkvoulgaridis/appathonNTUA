             performed.

          -  Participation in a Novartis sponsored study such as CTMT212X2101, CDRB436G2201,
             CDRB436A2102, regardless of current age.

          -  Parent study (or cohort of parent study) is planned to be closed.

          -  Subject has demonstrated compliance, as assessed by the investigator, within the
             parent study protocol requirement(s).

          -  Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plans and any other
             study procedures.

        For Subjects Entering the Treatment Period:

          -  Subject is currently receiving treatment with dabrafenib/trametinib monotherapy or
             combination within a Novartis Sponsored Drug Development study. Note that subjects who
             were on the chemotherapy arm of the CDRB436G2201 study are eligible for treatment
             period of this study only after crossing over into the experimental treatment arm of
             the CDRB436G2201 study

          -  In the opinion of the investigator is likely to benefit from continued treatment.

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

        All Subjects:

        - Subject has participated in a combination trial where dabrafenib and/or trametinib was
        dispensed in combination with another study medication.

        For Subjects Entering the Treatment Period:

          -  Subject has permanently discontinued from study treatment in the parent protocol due
             to any reason.

          -  Treatment with dabrafenib and/or trametinib for the subject's indication is approved
             for marketing and the appropriate dosage form is commercially available and reimbursed
             in the local country

          -  Subject currently has unresolved drug related severe toxicities for which dabrafenib
             and/or trametinib dosing has been interrupted in the parent study. If the subject
             should meet criteria to resume treatment on the parent protocol then they may be
             eligible for treatment in this study.

        Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion may apply.
