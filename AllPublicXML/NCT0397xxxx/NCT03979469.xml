  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators intend to study the safety and effectiveness of opioid free anesthesia
      compared to opioid anesthesia in ambulatory surgery in children, regarding postoperative
      pain, hemodynamic stability, agitation and discharge times. Quality of postanesthetic care
      was estimated in a 24h follow up.

    <description>Comparison of the discharge times from the hospital between opioid free and opioid based anesthesia using Discharge criteria based on physiological scoring system, evaluating respiration, circulation, level of consciousness, postoperative pain, postoperative nausea and vomiting and surgical site. A score 12 or more allows patient to leave safely from the hospital.</description>

    <description>Comparison of the severity of postoperative pain between opioid free and opioid based anesthesia using Visual Analogue Scale for children aged 7 years and more. We instruct the patient to point to the position on the line between the faces to indicate how much pain they are currently feeling. The far left end indicates &quot;no pain&quot;(0) and the far right end indicates &quot;worst pain ever.&quot;(10)</description>

    <description>Comparison of the severity of postoperative pain between opioid free and opioid based anesthesia using the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability scale or FLACC scale for children between the ages of 3 years and 7 years. The scale has five criteria, which are each assigned a score of 0, 1 or 2.The scale is scored in a range of 0-10 with 0 representing no pain.</description>

    <description>In group A opioid free anesthesia is administered. Anesthesia and analgesia were achieved with ketamine(1mg/kg, bolus), dexmedetomidine(1mcg/kg, over 10 minutes), local anesthetic(ropivacaine 2mg/kg 0.75% wound infiltration), paracetamol(15mg/kg), non steroid analgesics(diclofenac 1mg/kg). Anesthesia induction with ketamine(1mg/kg), propofol 1% 2-3mg/kg, rocuronium 1mg/kg. Anesthesia maintenance with propofol 1% 10mg/kg/hour. Reversal of rocuronium with sugammadex 2mg/kg.</description>

    <description>In group B opioid based anesthesia is administered.Anesthesia and analgesia were achieved with remifentanil(0.3mcg/kg/minute), local anesthetic(ropivacaine 2mg/kg 0.75% wound infiltration), paracetamol(15mg/kg), non steroid analgesics(diclofenac 1mg/kg).Anesthesia induction with propofol 1% 2-3mg/kg,fentanyl(2mcg/kg), rocuronium 1mg/kg.
