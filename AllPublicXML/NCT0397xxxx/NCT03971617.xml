  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a placebo-controlled, double-blind trial that will investigate the safety and
      tolerability of molecular hydrogen, a promising antioxidant agent, in patients with
      early-stage Parkinson's Disease. The medication will be administered orally as 8 ounces of
      hydrogen-enriched drinking water twice a day over the course of one year.

      This study will investigate the safety and tolerability of molecular hydrogen, a promising
      antioxidant agent, in patients with early-stage Parkinson's Disease. Subjects will be
      sequentially randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive hydrogen-enriched water or the
      corresponding placebo twice a day, in addition to all standard-of-care treatments. Enrollment
      goal is 70 subjects. Duration of therapy is 52 weeks.

      The primary outcome measures are safety and tolerability of hydrogen-enriched water.
      Secondary outcome measures include: progression of motor symptoms, health-related quality of
      life, progression of cognitive decline, progression of symptom burden, and progression of
      neuromelanin-related MRI signal.

    <description>The ingredient in the tablet producing H2 is magnesium. Each tablet contains 80 mg magnesium, a safe level well below the recommended daily dietary allowance of 420 mg for men/ 320 mg for women. Dissolving one tablet in 250 mL of water will achieve a saturating H2 concentration of approximately 1.6 ppm. Twice a day subjects will dissolve a tablet into water and drink the effervescent water.</description>
