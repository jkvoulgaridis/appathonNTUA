  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study for placement of a tiny microdevice into lung tumors to more precisely
      predict tumor-specific drug sensitivity, and to help inform systemic therapeutic decisions.
      The microdevice will provide a novel technique for interrogating human lung tumor tissue in
      situ, and will uniquely facilitate assessment of response to multiple drugs simultaneously.
      This will not only increase the specificity of a particular participant's chosen systemic
      therapy, it will also augment the speed and efficiency with which investigators are able to
      make clinical decisions regarding choice of therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The initial aims in this pilot study will focus on the safety and feasibility of microdevice
      placement and retrieval in participants with suspicious lung lesions. The microdevice, which
      is 5.5 mm in length and approximately 750 Âµm in diameter (i.e., comparable in size and shape
      to commonly used fiducial markers), will be placed in the suspected tumor tissue at the time
      of surgical resection. Multiple agents will passively diffuse into local, confined regions
      (several microns) of the surrounding microenvironment. The agents are released at
      approximately one millionth of a systemic dose. The device(s) will be removed for analysis at
      the time of resection, which will be performed for clinical indications independent of
      enrollment in this study. The investigators will collect data regarding the safety and
      feasibility of the placement and retrieval of the microdevices, and perform detailed tissue
      analysis of drug response. Investigators hope to compile preliminary data regarding
      correlations between in situ drug response and the genetic and histopathologic features of
      tumors, systemic treatment response, and ultimately, clinical outcomes.
