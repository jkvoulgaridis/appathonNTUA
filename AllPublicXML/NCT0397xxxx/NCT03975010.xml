    <description>This is an open-label, randomised, single-dose, 3 arms study design. Subjects will be randomised into one of 3 arms, in a 1:1:1 ratio, wearing BUP TDS 20 mg for 3 days or 40 mg for 3 days or 40 mg for 4 days. Safety follow-up will be planned at 7~9 days after patch removal.
The study patch will be applied under the cover of naltrexone to reduce opioid related side-effects. Naltrexone 50 mg will be taken orally every 12 hours, from the evening of Day 00 (13 hours prior to IMP application), until the evening of the patch removal.</description>

             previous and/or current unhealed extensive dermal damage in the area where the patch

          -  Subjects with hairy areas who could not, or would not, cut the hair at the patch site
             for proper placement of the patch

          -  Subjects who have difficulty swallowing tablets.

          -  Subjects who cannot tolerate venipuncture, or subjects who have difficulty in
             collecting blood, or subjects who have a history of fainting at the sight of blood or
