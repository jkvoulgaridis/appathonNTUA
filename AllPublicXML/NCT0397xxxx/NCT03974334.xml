  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a one-year study. The study's primary outcome is successful improvement of the Our
      Whole Lives for Hypertension (OWL-H) online patient education platform, based upon
      participant use and focus group feedback, to deliver information on self-management of
      hypertension and other cardiac risk factors, and to encourage self-monitoring of blood
      pressure.

      Specific Aim 1 - To pilot test the OWL-H platform for 8 weeks with 26 patients with
      hypertension (2 groups of 13) to refine its utility for home self-monitoring (number of times
      patients record home blood pressure and input this data onto OWL-H and engagement of
      self-management (i.e. # of logins, # of mind body sessions completed, # of times modules
      accessed each day)). Hypothesis 1: Eighty percent of patients will log in and record their
      blood pressures.

      Specific Aim 2 - At the end of each group, hold a focus group to obtain information about: 1)
      the barriers and facilitators of using the OWL-H platform and using OWL-H to self-monitor
      blood pressure at home, 2) satisfaction with OWL-H, 3) how OWL-H helped with reduction of
      number of cardiac risk factors (e.g., smoking, eating habits, perceived stress, and amount of
      exercise and health-related quality of life).

    <description>Our Whole Lives - Hypertension is an innovative online community and self-management program that provides access to stress reduction, mind-body techniques, nutrition, exercise, and peer support. OWL-H provides educational materials including videos of clinician-led talks (stress reactivity, nutrition, movement, etc.). OWL-H also provides subjects a facilitated community blog, private journal, peer support, and an extensive resource library. It will be tested by 26 patients with hypertension, to refine the platform based on patient feedback and outcomes.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female subjects of all races and ethnicities who are English-speaking adults
             over the age of 18 and who have a current diagnosis of hypertension.. OWL in currently
             only available in English.

          -  Subjects' physical and mental health status will be sufficient to be able to
             comprehend instructions and participate in the interventions.

          -  Subjects must be able to access computer technology (cellular phone, desktop, laptop)
             and the internet to utilize the online OWL-H.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Serious underlying systemic or co-morbid disease, including psychotic or manic
             symptoms, which preclude physical or cognitive ability to participate in the
             intervention.

        The risk-benefit ratio of the interventions for these individuals may be potentially higher
        than acceptable.

          -  Active substance abuse, given that individuals who have active substance abuse pose a
             higher risk both to themselves and other members of the groups.

          -  Beginning new hypertension treatments in the past week or planning to begin new
             hypertension treatments in the next few weeks, or planning a major medical event in
             the next few weeks, which would interfere with accurately determining the effect of
             the intervention on impact in this study.

          -  Subjects who are pregnant will be not included in this study given that the
             risk-benefit ratio of this intervention may be higher than acceptable for these
             individuals due to the potential onset of non-study related gestational diabetes
             and/or gestational hypertension. Determination of pregnancy status will be based upon
             subject self-report.

          -  Subjects who are not willing to participate in the intervention or attend the group
             visits.
