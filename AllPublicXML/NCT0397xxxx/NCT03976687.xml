    <textblock>
      This is a single centre, open label, randomized, 3 treatment arms, with and without food
      dosing, Phase 1b pharmacology study to assess the safety, tolerability, Pharmacokinetics (PK)
      and Pharmacodynamics (PD) of Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR) agonist/modulator EYP001a in healthy
      volunteers and Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In total 16 participants (4 healthy volunteers and 12 NASH patients) will be enrolled and
      randomly assigned to one of the 3 treatment arms:

        -  Treatment Arm 1: Dose A once daily morning dose (n=4 NASH patients, n=4 healthy
           volunteers)

        -  Treatment Arm 2: Dose B once daily morning dose (n=4 NASH patients)

        -  Treatment Arm 3: Dose C twice daily - first morning dose and second dose 3 hours post
           first dose (n=4 NASH patients).

      Subsequently, all the enrolled participants (both healthy volunteers and NASH patients) will
      be randomly assigned to one of the 2 parallel study Groups:

        -  Group A (n=8, 2 healthy volunteers and 6 NASH patients): This group will include 2 NASH
           patients from Treatment Arms 1, 2 and 3 and 2 healthy volunteers from Treatment Arm 1.
           Participants in Group A will be dosed in a fasted state on Days 2, 3, 4 and 5 followed
           by dosing in fed state on Days 6, 7, 8 and 9.

        -  Group B (n=8, 2 healthy volunteers and 6 NASH patients): This group will include 2 NASH
           patients from Treatment Arms 1, 2 and 3 and 2 healthy volunteers from Treatment Arm 1.
           Participants in Group B will be dosed in a fed state on Days 2, 3, 4 and 5 followed by
           dosing in fasted state on Days 6, 7, 8 and 9.

      The maximum total engagement duration for eligible participants in this study is up to 76
      days: 60 days screening, 1-day admission visit and 8 days dosing period (in-patient in
      clinical trial unit) and 7 days follow-up.

      The participants who are eligible for enrolment will be admitted to the Clinical Trial Unit
      on Day 1. The participants will receive EYP001a at the study site by trained personnel per
      the schedule of dosing for the study from Day 2 to Day 9 in fed/fasted state depending upon
      the study group. Participants will be discharged on the morning (8:00 AM) of Day 10 after
      collection of last PK and PD blood samples. Participants will return to the Clinical Trial
      Unit on Day 16 for the follow-up visit.
