  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive complications after major surgery are a common phenomenon. The incidence of
      Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction (POCD), may vary from 5% to 25% in adult patients,
      depending on different risk factors. Age has been strongly associated with cognitive
      complications. POCD is a prolonged decline in cognitive function that appears after surgery
      as compared with preoperative functions. In order to classify evaluate POCD, it requires at
      least 2 measurements. A baseline, completed before surgery and a second measurement, post
      surgery.

      In light of the high prevalence of POCD and the difficulties in its prediction, NeuroIndex
      has developed a quantitative EEG system and software that aim to produces risk predictor
      index (IS) for POCD. This study aims to evaluate the relationship between the software
      produced predictor index and the actual POCD events. The qEEG will be monitored during the
      surgery in addition to the routine clinical practice in operating rooms.

      POCD will be evaluated using Montreal Cognitive Assessment test (MoCA) prior and post
      surgery.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males and females between the ages of 65 or above.

          -  Subjects with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I-III.

          -  Subjects who are intended to undergo cardiac surgery (CABG or valve replacement) under
             general anesthesia.

          -  Surgical procedures scheduled for over 30 minutes.

          -  Lack of significant hearing disturbances.

          -  Subjects with ability to read and understand the consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Significant visual impairment so that the pictures of the confusion assessment method
             could not be interpreted to accurately test to assess delirium.

          -  Profound dementia or aphasia that interfered with the assessment of cognitive
             dysfunction (positive delirium in CAM-ICU).

          -  Patients with a history of stroke.

          -  Any documented major neurologic or psychiatric dysfunction.
