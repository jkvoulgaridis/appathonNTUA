  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis is a dysregulated host response to severe life-threatening infections, leading to
      organ failure and death in up to 40% of patients with septic shock. Pulmonary infections are
      the main cause of community-acquired sepsis and frequently lead to the development of acute
      respiratory distress syndrome(ARDS). Features of immunosuppression, including diminished cell
      surface monocyte human leukocyte antigen DR (mHLA-DR) expression, are strongly associated
      with hospital mortality. Such decrease in HLA-DR expression on antigen-presenting cells has
      been associated with impairment of microbial antigens to Tcells. Septic patients also show
      elevated expression of inhibitory receptors associated with cell exhaustion.. Yet,
      biochemical, flow cytometric and immunohistochemical findings consistent with
      immunosuppression have been observed in lungs and spleen of patients died of sepsis and
      multiple organ failure, demonstrating the relevance of studying these defects directly in
      organ tissues. A novel approach aimed to characterize the role and prognostic value of
      alveolar biomarkers measured directly in the injured lungs is warranted and supported by:
      -disappointing results of previous clinical trials attempting to restore the level of
      biomarkers measured on circulating cells; -evidences of regional immunosuppression in lungs
      of ARDS patients; -lung is the main site of hospital-acquired infections with a prevalence of
      ventilator-associated pneumonia in 30% over the course of Intensive Care Unit(ICU) stay in
      ARDS patients.

      Investigators speculate that biomarkers measured on alveolar leukocytes (AL) surface, are
      important predictors of outcome and potential therapeutic targets in ICU patients with
      pneumonia-associated ARDS.

      Investigators aim to explore whether biomarkers measured directly on AL from patients with
      pneumonia-associated ARDS are associated to regional pulmonary immunosuppression using
      leukocyte functional tests; and predictors of outcomes.

      Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid(BALF) and blood samples will be collected in ARDS patients.
      Leukocyte populations and cell membrane biomarkers will be quantified using flow cytometry.
      Leukocyte functional tests will be performed ex vivo on leukocytes collected from BALF and
      blood samples. Pharmacological interventions will be performed ex vivo.

      This project aims to identify biomarkers associated with outcomes and potential therapeutic
      targets.
