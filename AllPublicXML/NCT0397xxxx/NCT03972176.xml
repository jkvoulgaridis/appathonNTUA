  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During last years, non-caloric sweeteners (NCSs) have been increasingly incorporated into
      foodstuffs in replacement of sucrose in Chile. This situation has reached a point where it is
      currently difficult to find sugary foods without NCSs. As a result, the voluntary and
      involuntary consumption of these additives is growing significantly in the population,
      increasing the risk of exceeding the acceptable daily intake (ADI), especially for children.
      This situation is worrying as recent evidence suggests that NCSs are not inert in the body
      and can trigger adverse metabolic effects. For example, the consumption of beverages with
      NCSs has been shown to favor the development of obesity and type-2 diabetes in children and
      adults, and a recent study reported that the intake of NCSs during pregnancy was associated
      with a greater weight gain of the child at one year. It is likely that certain NCSs pass into
      the amniotic fluid and that the fetus is exposed to some of these compounds during pregnancy.
      This situation would persist in the infant through breast milk, as some studies detected
      sucralose and acesulfame-K in this fluid, even in mothers who claimed not to consume them.
      However, the real impact of NCS exposure during the neonatal period on the child health has
      been few studied. Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine the concentration of NCSs
      in samples of amniotic liquid and breastmilk and to correlate these data with the NCS intake
      by the mothers. Mothers/children will be classified in quintiles according to the results
      obtained. In the children from quintiles 1 and 5, we will also study whether neonatal
      exposure to NCSs may affect the sweet taste threshold and the preferences for this taste, the
      levels of salivary insulin and the weight gain in the first year. Breastmilk microbiota and
      child fecal microbiota will be also evaluated.
