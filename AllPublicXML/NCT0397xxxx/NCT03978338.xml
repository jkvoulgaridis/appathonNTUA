  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, reduced levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) have been found
      in dementia patients. BDNF reduces amyloid precursor protein (APP) fragments via the Trk
      signaling pathway, and the expression of transgenic BDNF in animal models of Alzheimer's
      Disease（AD）shows a protective effect on neurodegeneration. A lot of researches have proved
      that brain hydrolysate injection can improve the level of BDNF in the brain. And oral brain
      peptide dietary supplements, which is also derived from brain proteolytic products, may also
      adjust and improve neuron metabolism, promote the formation of synapses, induce the
      differentiation of neurons, and protect nerve cells from ischemia and neurotoxin damage,
      reduce the risk of loss of cognitive function in the aging process. However, there are still
      no studies on dietary supplements derived from brain protein hydrolysates in China.
      Therefore, the investigators designed a randomized controlled double-blind study program to
      preliminarily evaluate the efficacy, safety and possible mechanism of brain polypeptide
      solution in improving the cognition of mild alzheimer's disease patients.

      The research is a prospective, multicenter, cohort study. 200 patients with mild alzheimer's
      disease will be selected and randomly divided into experimental group and control group
      according to the numerical random table. The experimental group will take the brain
      polypeptide solution 60ml per day and the control group was treated with the same package of
      placebo 60ml per day. The treatment regimen remained unchanged during the observation period.
      During the study period, safety index including blood and urine routine, liver and kidney
      function, coagulation index and clinical effect index about neuropsychological scales will be
      recorded.

      The investigators design a prospective, multicenter, cohort study.200 patients with mild
      Alzheimer's disease will be selected and divided into brain polypeptide nutrient solution
      group (experimental group) and control group according to the numerical random table. The
      experimental group will take brain polypeptide solution 60ml per day, while the control group
      took placebo in the same package 60ml per day. The observation period is 84 days. And
      follow-up will take place at 42 and 84 days .The treatment regimen remained unchanged during
      the observation period. Safety indexes include blood and urine routine, liver and kidney
      function, coagulation index, etc. Screening indexes include syphilis antibody, HIV antibody,
      hepatitis b virus antibody, hepatitis c virus antibody, folic acid, vitamin B12, etc.
      Clinical outcome indicators include a number of scales to evaluate neurological and cognitive
      functions, such as the Alzheimer's disease assessment scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog).
      Mechanism related indicators such as metabolomics was used to understand the possible
      differences in metabolic indicators. It is helpful to guide the use of brain polypeptide in
      Alzheimer's patients correctly .
