      The goal of this study is to determine if hypotensive neuraxial anesthesia is associated with
      worse outcomes in Primary Total Hip Arthroplasty. The plan to analyze the outcomes is listed
      below:

      Primary outcomes:

      Multiple logistic regression will be used to compute the adjusted odds ratios of any
      postoperative complications (MI, CVA, death) , adjusting for covariates including duration of
      intraoperative mean arterial pressure of less than pre-defined threshold, such as 55, or 60
      mmHg mean blood pressure.

      Sensitivity analyses will also consider the effects of intra-operative hypotension (IOH)
      defined as mean blood pressure of less than 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, and 65 mm Hg.

      Secondary outcomes:

      Multiple logistic regression will be to compute the adjusted odds ratios of individual
      postoperative complications, (such as MI, CVA, stroke) , adjusting for covariates including
      duration of intraoperative mean blood pressure of less than pre-defined threshold, such as
      55, or 60 mmHg mean blood pressure. Sensitivity analyses will also be conducted to test the
      effects of extend of IOH on complications.

    <description>The association between levels and length of intraoperative controlled hypotension and incidence rates of individual and composite outcome of any of the following events: (i) myocardial infarction (MI), (ii) cerebrovascular accident (CVA), (iii) death. If any of these events are positive, then the composite outcome will be positive. The units of measurement will be the same.</description>
