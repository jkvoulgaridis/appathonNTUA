  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At present, the incidence of language dysfunction in patients with brain language area tumor
      in the first month after operation was 20%-40%. The investigator's team has confirmed and
      found that bilateral cerebellar VIIa lobules are the critical areas of cerebellar which is
      closely related to the language function of the patients. This study aims at enhancing
      language function recovery after surgery through the transcranial magnetic stimulation
      stimulates the key areas of cerebellar.

      This study is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, multi-center clinical trial in which
      participants with postoperative aphasia in the brain-language region tumors of three
      neurosurgery departments, Huashan Hospital, Shanghai Jing'an Center Hospital and Huashan
      Hospital North Hospital. Participants were randomly divided into Intervention group and
      control group. Before transcranial magnetic stimulation treatment, the two groups were
      required to conduct language behavior assessment and magnetic resonance imaging data.
      Participants in both groups were given 10 consecutive days bilateral cerebellar VIIa lobules
      Theta Burst Stimulation from one week after surgery and received speech rehabilitation
      training after stimulation.

      The investigators collect patients MRI data and language behavioral assessment scores at
      1week post operation and 1 month after the operation and 3 months after the operation.
      Subsequently, three MRI data and language behavioral assessment scores were processed and
      statistically analyzed to compare the differences between the two groups

      Intervention group: Intermittent Theta Burst Stimulation(Positive stimulation) is used in
      right cerebellar VIIa lobule. Continuous Theta Burst Stimulation(Negative stimulation) is
      used in left cerebellar VIIa lobule. The stimulation intensity was 80% Rest Motor
      Threshold.According to the patients' condition, age and tolerance,the intensity should be
      adjusted.

      Control group: The investigators use with fake stimulation , the appearance is the same as
      the magnetic stimulator used in the experimental group, and the stimulation will also make
      sounds, but no magnetic field effect, the stimulation mode is the same as the intervention
      group.

      Subsequently, The investigators collect patients MRI data and language behavioral assessment
      scores at 1week post operation and 1 month after the operation and 3 months after the
      operation.three times MRI data and language behavioral assessment scores were processed and
      statistically analyzed to compare the differences between the two groups from the cerebellar
      spontaneous neurological activity level (ALFF), cerebellar gray matter volume, functional
      connectivity of cerebellar network and language behavioral score.
