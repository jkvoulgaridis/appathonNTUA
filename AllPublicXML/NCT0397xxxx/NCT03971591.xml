  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the efficacy of Men Moving Forward (MMF), a four-month
      community-based lifestyle intervention designed for AA PC survivors. MMF is rooted in the
      evidence-based Moving Forward lifestyle intervention developed with and for AA breast cancer
      survivors. This intervention was adapted in collaboration with AA PC survivors. It will offer
      twice weekly sessions aimed at supporting adherence to the ACS nutrition and physical
      activity guidelines to promote improved body composition (i.e., decreased adiposity,
      increased lean mass).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aim 1. To examine the efficacy of the Men Moving Forward guided intervention, as compared to
      a self-guided control intervention, in producing significant post-intervention changes in
      body composition in 200 AA PC survivors.

      Hypothesis: Men randomized to the guided arm will exhibit significant post-intervention
      decreases in adiposity and increases in lean body mass compared to men randomized to the
      control arm.

      Aim 2. To investigate the effects of participation in the Men Moving Forward guided
      intervention on health behaviors and quality of life outcomes.

      Hypothesis: Men in the guided program will exhibit increased intake of fruits and vegetables
      and decreased intake of red meat/processed meat, greater levels of physical activity (minutes
      per week and #times/wk resistance training) and improved quality of life (targeting physical
      function, social isolation, sexual functioning) compared to men in the control arm.

      Aim 3. To explore the effects of the intervention program on blood pressure, blood lipids,
      fasting glucose, and biomarkers associated with comorbidities and carcinogenesis (i.e
      adiponectin, leptin, C-peptide, IGF-1, IGFBP-3, C-Reactive Protein, estradiol, testosterone
      and sex hormone binding globulin)

      Hypothesis: Men in the guided arm will exhibit greater improvements in biomarkers associated
      with chronic disease and carcionogenesis compared to men in the self-guided control arm.

      Men Moving Forward supports PC survivors in adopting physical activity and eating patterns
      that will improve their body composition, bolster QOL and reduce risk for comorbidities and,
      potentially, PC recurrence.

    <description>The Intervention will be conducted in cohorts of 15-20. We anticipate there will be 5-6 cohorts over the course of the study. Men assigned to the Guided Lifestyle Program will participate in twice weekly sessions - the first weekly session will be 120 minutes in length with the first hour addressing lifestyle change education and strategies, the second hour will be supervised exercise with strength training. The second weekly session will be a one-hour supervised exercise session with strength training. Men will also receive 2-3 text messages weekly. They will also receive a participant informational binder with health and exercise information and tools as directed by ACS nutrition and physical activity guidelines.</description>
