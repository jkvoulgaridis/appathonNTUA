  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A debate regarding ankle fracture fixation centers on time to weight bearing. Recent
      literature has supported immediate weight bearing in surgically stabilized ankle fractures.
      However, significant variation among orthopaedic surgeons persists, and weight bearing
      recommendations change when there is a syndesmotic disruption. There is very little
      literature on time to weight bearing, with most available series casting/immobilizing these
      injuries for 6 weeks after fixation. There is very little data examining post-operative
      weight bearing after syndesmotic stabilization, and the majority centers on screw fixation.
      The minimum time to weight bearing after an ankle fracture with syndesmotic fixation in the
      literature is 4 weeks, with most focusing on 6 to 12 weeks. Based on biomechanical data
      regarding suture button techniques, the investigators hypothesize that patients undergoing
      ankle fracture fixation plus suture button fixation of their syndesmotic disruption will be
      able to safely bear weight early (2 weeks) after surgery. The investigator's null hypothesis
      is that there will be no difference between early weight bearing (2 weeks), and late weight
      bearing (6 weeks) in terms of outcome, hardware failure, loss of reduction, and return to
      work.

      Adult patients who have an ankle fracture with suspected syndesmotic disruption, requiring a
      suture button fixation operative intervention will be randomized into early (2 weeks
      post-surgically) weight-bearing status or delayed weight-bearing status (non-weight-bearing
      for 6 weeks following fixation).

      Primary objective: Maintenance of ankle reduction at 1 year follow-up (measured by comparing
      immediate post-op CT and 1 year time-point CT).

      Secondary Objectives: Pain scores, surgical experience, work productivity and activity
      impairment , AAOS foot and ankle scores (2w, 6w, 12w, 6m, 1y), use of assistive devices,
      range of motion, physical therapy requirement/length of use/compliance, post-operative
      protocol compliance, post-operative complications (wound healing, infection, implant failure,
      fracture healing).

    <description>The Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) questionnaire is a self-administered instrument used to assess the impact of disease on productivity. The sum of specific health problem impairment and impairment due to other health reasons is equal to impairment due to all health reasons. WPAI outcomes are expressed as impairment percentages, with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity, i.e., worse outcomes.</description>

    <measure>Foot and ankle outcomes (AAOS)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The AAOS foot and ankle questionnaire is a patient-administrated 25-item survey specifically developed for foot and ankle-related disability. The questionnaire is divided into two scales, the Foot and Ankle Core scale, comprised of 20 questions and the Shoe Comfort Scale with five questions. The questions themselves are distributed amongst five different categories: Pain (9 items), function (6 items), stiffness and swelling (2 items), giving way (3 items) and shoe comfort (5 items). Answers are then measured on a scale of 1 to 5 or 6, with1 being the best outcome score.</description>
