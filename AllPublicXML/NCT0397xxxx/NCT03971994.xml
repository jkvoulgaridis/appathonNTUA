    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to investigate the existence of emotional attention
      impairments in Alzheimer's Disease, in correlation with amygdala and attention networks
      alterations. To this end, functional and structural neuroimaging will be used. A face
      expression recognition task, along with eyetracking, will be used to assess emotional
      attention impairments.
