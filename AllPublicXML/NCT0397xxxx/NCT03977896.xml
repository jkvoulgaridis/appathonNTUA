  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brain tumors are the most common solid tumors in children and are the second most common
      cause of cancer-related death among this population. Posterior brain fossa tumors represent
      about 50% of children brain tumors.

      Recently, knowledge in molecular biology has permitted to identify different tumors subgroups
      of very different prognosis. Today, surgery removal of the tumor is the mandatory.
      Neuro-oncological treatment differs depending on the histological and molecular subgroup.
      With classical Magnetic Resonance Imaging (cMRI), distinction between different types of
      posterior fossa tumors remains difficult.

      Positron Emission Tomography combined with MRI (PET/MRI) has proven its benefits for the
      management of brain tumors. The direct spatiotemporal correlation makes possible the
      assessment of metabolic, anatomical and functional information. PET/MRI would provide
      precisions on the pre-therapeutic characterization of tumors, which could permit to modify
      the patients' care.

      L- [methyl-11C] methionine (11C-MET) is currently the gold-standard tracer used in
      neuro-oncology, but few data exists in children. 11C-MET PET/MRI assessment seems promising,
      but has not been studied enough. To the best of our knowledge, there is no specific study on
      primary brain tumors of the posterior fossa in children using 11C-MET PET/MRI.

      The primary objectives of this first pilot study is to evaluate the practical feasibility of
      11C-MET PET/MRI imaging (machine accessibility and imaging interpretability) before surgery
      in a population of children older than 5 years old with posterior fossa tumors.

      The secondary objectives aim to describe :

        -  the PET/MRI parameters of the different tumors studied,

        -  and the patient's participation acceptation.

      This feasibility study will allow us to standardize the PET/MRI measurements; this could
      allow us to discriminate, in a larger study, the different tumor subgroups before surgery.

    <description>Except PET/MRI imaging, all the examinations will be done according to the patient's usual care.
PET/MRI imaging will be realized within max 7 days after children enrollment, and the surgery (usual care) will be performed within max 4 days after PET/MRI imaging.
PET/MRI imaging will include the following sequences: T1axial, Diffusion, Magnetic susceptibility post-Gadolinium injection, 3DT1 pre and post-Gadolinium injection, and Arterial Spin Labelling Imaging (ASL).</description>
