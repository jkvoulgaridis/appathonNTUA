  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective memory (PM) is the ability to implement intended actions in the future. It allows
      maintaining and retrieving future plans, goals, and activities (i.e., remember to remember).
      PM is associated with most everyday memory problems . PM is crucial to correctly respond to
      all the social, occupational and working demands of everyday life, to perform many deferred
      health-related actions and is involved in therapeutic adherence .

      Indeed, PM errors are an important part of the aging memory complaints. The prevalence of
      self-reported PM failures is also significant among young adults, compared with self-reported
      retrospective memory (RM) failures .Yet, PM errors are major sources of frustration and
      embarrassment .

      In oncology, recently investigated the self‚Äêreported memory complaints in a 80
      case-healthy-control study breast patients . Subjective memory complaints were assessed using
      the Prospective and Retrospective Memory Questionnaire . Results from the Paquet et al. study
      show that all participants (i.e., both patients and matched-controls) reported more PM than
      RM failures in daily-life (p&lt;.001). Breast cancer patients reported more RM and PM failures
      than controls. However, this group effect was no longer statistically significant when
      controlling for depression and fatigue.

      These findings are consistent with the view that memory complaints are closely associated
      with depression and cancer-related fatigue, and more generally with psychopathological
      variables .As underlined by Paquet et al. subjective memory complaints should be investigated
      because they refer to some aspects of the cancer experience that could potentially be linked
      to quality of life. Thus, it is important to explore psychopathological basis such as
      depression, anxiety and fatigue while investigating self-reported memory failures in cancer
      patients.

      Despites the importance of PM, there have been, to our knowledge, only few studies evaluating
      PM complaints or PM functioning in patients diagnosed with an intracerebral tumor (such as
      Diffuse Low-Grade Glioma- DLGG- or glioblastome- GB) or extra-cerebral tumor (such as breast
      cancer - BC). Therefore, the investigators thought it would be useful, as a first step, to
      conduct a study to explore and to manage the PM and RM subjective complaints in cancer
      patients compared to another chronic disease, such as HIV. In fine, these data will help to
      identify a new target for psychological management focused on either psychopathological or
      neuropsychological rehabilitation

      Primary objective :

      This study will aim at determining the nature of subjective memory complaints (i.e.,
      prospective or retrospective memory) in cancer patients with intra- cerebral tumors
      (Glioblastomas and Diffuse Low Grade Gliomas) and extra cerebral tumors (Breast cancer), and
      in patients with HIV compared with controls.

      The protocol administration will take about 20 minutes. It will be conducted by an
      experienced clinical neuropsychologist or clinical oncologist in each center during standard
      care. According to the results on the questionnaires and test, patients will be addressed and
      managed by a neuropsychologist, a clinical psychologist, psychiatrist or a speech therapist.
