  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single centre, non-randomized, tandem colonoscopy trial of the NISInspire-C System,
      followed immediately by a conventional colonoscope (CC). Each trial subject will undergo
      colonoscopy using the NISInspire-C system, followed immediately by CC. The purpose of this
      study is to obtain observational data on the safety profile, feasibility and usability of the
      NISInspire-C System in performing diagnostic colonoscopy in human subjects. The level of
      procedural pain experienced by subjects will also be explored.

    <description>The NISInspire-C System is a disposable robotic colonoscopy system that consists of a flexible slender insertion tube designed to ensure non-invasive, reliable and safe colorectal screening. It comprises of two components: NISInspire-C Console, and the NISInspire-C Disposable Colonoscope.</description>
