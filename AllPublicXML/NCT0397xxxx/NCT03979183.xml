  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given (1) the high volume of women on reproductive age that have a clinical diagnosis of
      endometriosis and (2) the poor management of symptoms that medical treatment usually
      achieves, new therapeutic interventions need to be evaluated in order to improve pain and
      quality of life in those patients. Therefore, 'Physio-EndEA' study has been designed to
      evaluate whether therapeutic exercise could help on the management of endometriosis-related
      symptoms

      Background: Prevalence of endometriosis is approximately 10% of women of childbearing age.
      Pain, considered in its multiple versions (dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, dyschezia, dysuria and,
      in general, chronic pelvic pain) is the most common and disabilitating symptom in affected
      women. Usual care, consisting on palliative pharmacological treatment in combination with
      surgery, is clearly insufficient and physical therapies need to be explored in order to
      reduce pain and to improve quality of life in affected women.

      Objective: The overall objective of 'Physio-EndEA' study will be to explore potential short
      and mid-term benefits of a rehabilitation program on the quality of life of symptomatic
      women.

      Methods: A total of 40 symptomatic endometriosis women will be recruited. Inclusion criteria
      includes: aged 18-50, clinical diagnosis of endometriosis and interested in improving
      lifestyle while exclusion criteria includes: diagnosed chronic disease or orthopaedic issues
      that would interfere with ability to participate in a physical activity program. Women will
      be randomized to either intervention (n=20) or usual care group (n=20). Intervention group
      will receive twice weekly session for 9 weeks and control group will receive recommendations
      about healthy lifestyle and usual care.

      Discussion: This study attempts to improve the quality of life of symptomatic endometriosis
      women by reducing musculoskeletal and occupational impairments. Findings will offer a new
      therapeutic approach for a better pain control.

    <measure>Change in quality of life assessed by EHP-30</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, inmediately after intervention and 1-year post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>It will be assessed using the Endometriosis Health Profile-30 (EHP-30). It is a self-administered disease-specific instrument to measure QoL in women with endometriosis. The 30-item EHP, referred to the last 4 weeks, is comprised of five domains: pain, control and powerlessness, emotional well-being, social support, and self-image. Items within each subscale, answered on a 5-point Likert-type scale, are summed and then transformed to a percentage scale ranging from 0 (best health status) to 100 (worse health status) by dividing the raw score of all items by the maximum possible raw score, multiplied by 100</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pressure pain threshold (PPT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, inmediately after intervention and 1-year post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Algometry will be used to measure PPT levels in abdomen, pelvis and lower back regions through an electronic algometer. For this purpose, an approximate rate of 30 kilopascal/s will be applied with a 1cm2 probe. Seven points from the abdominal and pelvic area, and two additional points from the lower back region will be tested. Prior PPT assessment, assessor will ask for participants to press the switch when they first feel a change from pressure to pain. The mean of three tests, spaced by 30 s, will be used for the analysis.</description>

Higher scores represent better performance</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Chronic fatigue</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, inmediately after intervention and 1-year post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Muscular fatigue will be assessed with the Piper Fatigue Scale-Revised (PFS-R), originally developed to assess cancer-related fatigue, but also used to assess fatigue in other musculoskeletal disorders such as heart failure. It contains 22 items scoring from 0 to 10. Total score is average score of these 22 items (0-10). Lower scores reflect better performance. PFS-R has high reliability (Cronbach's Œ±=0.96).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Gastrointestinal function</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, inmediately after intervention and 1-year post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>It will be assessed with the Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GLQI) (36 items) grouped in 5 domains: digestive symptoms, physical status, emotions, social dysfunction and effects of medical treatment. Each item is scored from 0 (worst appreciation) to 4 (best appreciation). Scores of items are summed to obtain the global score, which ranges from 0 (worst) to 144 (best quality of life).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, inmediately after intervention and 1-year post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>It will be assessed with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) (19 items), grouped in seven &quot;components&quot;: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction. Each component ranges from 0 (lowest dysfunction) to 3 (greatest dysfunction), and the PSQI global score is obtained by the sum of component's scores, and thus, ranges from 0 to 21, with higher scores indicating poor sleep quality.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-perceived physical fitness</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Regular physical activity will be estimated through the Minnesota Leisure Time Physical Activity Questionnaire (MLTPAQ), that has shown a moderate reliability to indirectly estimate physical activity (Spearman rank correlation coefficient &gt; 0.69). During an interview, the assessor will ask each women the number of days per week and the amount of time (in minutes) per day that they spent doing each of the 63 activities listed in the questionnaire. Finally, an activity metabolic index is calculated by multiplying the number of days per week, the amount of time per day and the standard intensity codes assigned to each activity. This score approximates Kcal/day of energy expenditure.</description>
