  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lower extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD), the third leading cause of atherosclerotic
      cardiovascular morbidity following coronary artery disease and stroke, affect 200 million
      people worldwide and is associated with high rates of cardiovascular events and death.
      Consensus is reached on an &quot;endovascular-first-strategy&quot; for symptomatic PAD who have
      developed critical limb ischemia.

      However, the challenge of endovascular therapy is the long-term patency, and the associated
      worse clinical outcomes, including higher rates of major adverse cardiovascular events, and
      major adverse limb events. Meta-analysis concluded that restenosis occurred rate 5-70 % at 1
      year; the incidence of adverse limb outcomes, (including worsening of symptoms, the need for
      peripheral revascularization, and amputation) was 26% over a period of 4 years;
      Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality up to 28 % after endovascular therapy.

      There are no consensus guidelines on the optimal timing and the factor on adverse clinical
      outcome remains uncertain. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to conduct a structured
      surveillance plan for follow-up care and evaluate risk factors that will eventually support
      development of a predictive model for clinical outcomes of endovascular procedures to treat
      lower extremity PAD.

      This is a prospective, observational, multi-center, clinical study examining predictors of
      clinical outcomes for patients undergoing PAD endovascular treatment. The study population
      will undergo lower extremity computed tomographic angiography (CTA )and endovascular
      intervention procedures. CT scanning was performed with the coverage from the common iliac
      artery bifurcation to the tiptoe, CTA data were transfer to an offline workstation for
      further analysis. Axial images, cross-sectional views, curved planar reformations and
      multiplane reformations, as well as three dimensional maximum intensity projection images
      were available for evaluation. This includes disease in a vessel located proximal(involving
      the aortoiliac and femoropopliteal locations), distal, (involving the infrapopliteal
      location), proximal and distal (multilevel disease).

      We conduct a detailed chart review to gather the data related to the index endovascular
      intervention procedures report, study personnel history and physical presentation, laboratory
      inspection, the lesion characteristics arising from CTA. Data abstract from chart review
      include indication for procedure (intermittent claudication, rest pain, and tissue loss),
      detailed lesion characteristics (lesion length, stenosis severity, diameter, and presence of
      total occlusion), procedure(s) performed and devices used, and per procedural events.

      Patients will be followed up for the occurrence of these outcomes from the time of their
      initial revascularization procedure(1month after enrollment, and at months 3 (+- 2 weeks), 6
      (+- 2 weeks), and 12 (+- 2 weeks)).

      The follow-up of Clinical outcomes : Primary clinical outcomes of interest were ：1）restenosis
      in the treated segment（Restenosis was defined as a reduction in the luminal diameter of more
      than 50 percent according to any imaging examinations such as duplex ultrasound, CTA,magnetic
      resonance Imaging(MRI) or digital subtraction angiography(DSA) ）；2）re-intervention in the
      treated segment for the clinical progression. Secondary end points included:1) all lower
      extremity amputation, 2) all -cause death, myocardial infarction, and stroke; 3) a neo-
      segment more than 75 % stenosis and clinical assessment requires intervention .

      Cox proportional hazards models were created to show the hazard ratios (HRs) associated with
      lesion characters and patient demographic and clinical characteristics ,and further identify
      predictors of clinical outcomes, moreover, plotted unadjusted Kaplan Meier curves for lower
      extremity peripheral artery patients undergone endovascular revascularization.
