      The objective of this clinical investigation is to collect valid scientific safety and
      effectiveness data on the Acuity 200 (fluoroxyfocon A) Rigid Gas Permeable Contact Lens,
      manufactured from a newly developed rigid gas permeable material that is highly permeable to
      oxygen. The clinical performance data reported from this study is intended to be submitted to
      the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) in
      support of a 510(k) premarket notification.

      This is an open-label, multi-center, randomized concurrent-control study with the treatment
      duration of 90 days. Subjects will be recruited into the study based upon the inclusion and
      exclusion criteria provided. Eligible subjects will be examined for baseline evaluation and
      lens fitting. Up to sixty (60) subjects will wear the test contact lenses for daily wear and
      up to twenty-eight (28) subjects will wear the control contact lenses. The subjects will
      attend seven scheduled study visits and will undergo standard ophthalmic evaluation for
      contact lens care. The subjects will be followed for a period of three months (90 days)
      following dispensing of the Test and Control Device.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Prior to being considered eligible to participate in this study, each subject MUST:

          -  Be at least 18 years of age as of the date of evaluation.

          -  Have:

               -  read the Informed Consent,

               -  been given an explanation of the Informed Consent,

               -  indicated an understanding of the Informed Consent and

               -  signed the Informed Consent Form.

          -  Be willing and able to adhere to the instructions set forth in this protocol and able
             to keep all specified appointments.

          -  Be a current contact lens wearer.

          -  Possess wearable and visually functional eyeglasses.

          -  Be in good general health, based on his/her knowledge.

          -  Require spectacle lens powers between +10.00 and -10.00 diopters sphere with no more
             than 2.5 diopters of spectacle refractive astigmatism and be willing to wear lenses in
             both eyes.

          -  Have manifest refraction visual acuity equal to or better than 0.10 log MAR (20/25
             Snellen) in each eye.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects may not be enrolled into the study if ANY of the following apply:

          -  Subject is wearing lenses in a mono-vision modality and is unwilling to be fit with
             distance lenses in both eyes. NOTE: Subjects may NOT wear mono-vision lenses at any
             time during the study as it will interfere with the distance visual acuity
             measurement.

          -  Subject appears to exhibit poor personal hygiene (that in the investigator's opinion
             might prevent safe contact lens wear).

          -  Subject has 2.5 diopters or great of corneal astigmatism.

          -  Use of ocular medications for any reason or systemic medications which might interfere
             with contact lens wear.

          -  A known history of corneal hypoesthesia (reduced corneal sensitivity).

          -  Slit lamp findings that would contraindicate contact lens wear, including but not
             limited to:

               -  History of corneal ulcer, corneal infiltrates or fungal infections

               -  Corneal scars within the visual axis

               -  Pterygium

               -  History of papillary conjunctivitis that has interfered with lens wear or a
                  current condition of Grade 2 (Mild) or greater

          -  Clinically significant (Grade 3 or 4) anterior segment abnormalities or any infection
             of the eye, lids, or associated structures.

          -  The investigator for any reason considers that it is not in the best interest of the
             subject to participate in the study.

        To be eligible to be randomized for study product trial a subject must have ALL of the
        inclusion criteria and NONE of the exclusion criteria present. To be eligible for lens
        dispensing, the subject's study device contact lens visual acuity must be equal to or
