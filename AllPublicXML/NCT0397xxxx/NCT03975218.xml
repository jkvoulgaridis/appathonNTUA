  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is a growing disease. It is the first pathology responsible for acquired handicap, the
      second of dementia and the second cause of death in the world. In France, they are the
      leading cause of death in women and the third cause in men. Sequelae and disabilities also
      represent a significant financial cost for health insurance.

      The early management of the treatment improves the patient's vital and functional prognosis.
      The ability of the patient to identify the signs of stroke requiring urgent consultation and
      proper orientation are therefore crucial for further management.

      The most common signs that patients must recognize are muscle weakness or sudden paralysis of
      an arm, leg or half of the body, asymmetry of the face, tingling, numbness of a hemi-body,
      speech or understanding, loss of vision of an eye or hemifield, disorder of the coordination
      of a hemi-body. The variety of clinical pictures complicates primary prevention.

      In this context, a 2010-2014 National Stroke Action Plan was undertaken with the aim, among
      other things, of developing information to prevent stroke and to limit its sequelae. In this
      plan, the attending physician must improve prevention in high-risk patients and be a link
      between the city and the hospital for follow-up.

      Several questions arise:

        -  Are patients who are regularly followed by a general practitioner better educated on the
           signs of stroke / TIA and thus more able to give an appropriate warning?

        -  What is the profile of patients who have not been affected by the different modes of
           primary prevention?

        -  What are the effective means of information and those desired
