      This is a Phase IV, single site, randomized, open-label, 3 treatment group, parallel study
      comparing BYDUREON-BCiseTM plus FARXIGATM to BYDUREON-BCiseTM alone and FARXIGATM alone in
      patients diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) on a stable dose of metformin alone.

      Patients who meet all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will enter a 1-week
      Lead-in Period, during which patients will be given a blood glucose meter and fitted with a
      blinded Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) and undergo a 14-day CGM assessment.

      After the 1-week Lead-in Period, approximately 60 subjects will be randomized at a 1:1:1
      ratio to one of three open-label treatment arms to achieve approximately 20 subjects per
      treatment arm.

      The study consists of a 2-week Screening Period, a 1-week Lead-in Period, a 14-week
      open-label Treatment Period and a 10-week Follow-up Period.

             take drugs that directly reduce gastrointestinal motility

          -  Chronic or repeated intermittent corticosteroid treatment (subjects receiving stable
             doses of replacement corticosteroid therapy may be enrolled)

          -  A history of prior amputation, peripheral vascular disease, or diabetic foot ulcers
