  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of the study in Dose Escalation are to evaluate safety, tolerability,
      and pharmacokinetics (PK) of REGN5678 alone and in combination with cemiplimab and in Dose
      Expansion are to assess efficacy, as measured by objective response rate (ORR) per modified
      Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3) criteria, of REGN5678 in combination with cemiplimab.

      The secondary objectives of the study in Dose Escalation are to assess efficacy, as measured
      by ORR per modified PCWG3 criteria, of REGN5678 in combination with cemiplimab and in Dose
      Expansion are to characterize the safety profile in each expansion cohort and to characterize
      the PK of REGN5678 in combination with cemiplimab. Secondary objectives in both Dose
      Escalation and Dose Expansion are to assess efficacy of REGN5678 in combination with
      cemiplimab, as measured by additional criteria and to assess immunogenicity of REGN5678 in
      combination with cemiplimab.
