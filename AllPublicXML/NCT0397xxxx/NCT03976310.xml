    <textblock>
      BenraliScan aims to obtain thoracic computed tomography imaging data to predict the future
      level of patient response to a monoclonal antibody. Because the clinical responses under
      study can take many months to manifest, early identification of patients most-likely to
      benefit from treatment and treatment rule-out for others will save considerable time for
      everybody involved.

      The primary objective of BenraliScan is to determine the prognostic value (sensitivity,
      specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value) of air-trapping measures
      (Expiratory/Inspiratory ratios for Mean Lung Density (MLDe/i)) detected via quantitative
      thoracic computed tomography at baseline for improvement in exacerbation rate (the presence
      of a ≥50% reduction in baseline exacerbation rate versus the absence of a ≥50% reduction in
      baseline exacerbation rate) at 52 weeks among eosinophilic asthma patients treated with
      Benralizumab.

      Secondary, exploratory objectives include:

        -  To describe clinical improvement category sub-groups (e.g. non-responders versus strong
           responders) in terms of: target concomitant medication usage, symptomology, quality of
           life (questionnaires), exacerbation rates (and other adverse events) and lung function
           parameters, differential blood counts, serum club cell secretory protein (CCSP) levels,
           other quantitative thoracic computed tomography (QTCT) variables, sinus mucosal
           thickness.

        -  To perform exploratory, prognostic-value studies (including but not limited to
           prognostic variables derived from changes occurring over 24 weeks and from clustering or
           factor mining at baseline and 24 weeks). These exploratory studies will include (but are
           not necessarily limited to) estimating the sensitivity/specificity of baseline/early
           imaging variables (or combination thereof) for predicting clinical response variables.

        -  To describe the prognostic categories (e.g. predicted non-responder versus predicted
           responder) found in terms of: clinical improvement, target concomitant medication usage,
           symptomology, quality of life (questionnaires), exacerbation rates (and other adverse
           events) and lung function parameters, differential blood counts, serum CCSP levels,
           other QTCT variables, sinus mucosal thickness.

        -  To create a centralised image library associated with the study.

        -  To verify the reproducibility of the relationships found between mean lung density
           (upper and lower lung, inspiratory and expiratory), the fractal dimension of -850 HU
           segmentations, and clinical variables found during the SCANN'AIR study (NCT03102749).

        -  To explore the association between bronchial homothety curves (the homothety of two
           consecutive bronchial measurements as a function of bronchial generation) and disease
           severity/progression.

        -  To monitor patient safety throughout the study.

    <description>An exacerbation is defined as follows: worsening of symptoms (increased shortness of breath, cough, sputum, with or without fever) which necessitates unscheduled healthcare resource use, a need for &gt;48h of oral corticosteroids. For oral steroids, a minimal dose of 0.25 mg/kg is required. For patients taking oral steroids on a long term basis, at least a doubling dose for 2 days is required.</description>

Patients are asked to recall how their asthma has been during the previous week by responding to one bronchodilator use question and 5 symptom questions. Questions are weighted equally and scored from 0 (totally controlled) to 6 (severely uncontrolled). The mean ACQ-6 score is the mean of the responses. Mean scores of ≤0.75 indicate well-controlled asthma, scores between 0.75 and &lt;1.5 indicate partly controlled asthma, and a score ≥1.5 indicates not well controlled asthma. Individual changes of at least 0.5 are considered to be clinically meaningful.</description>
