  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see how investigators may best improve treatment adherence
      and disease management for heart failure after hospital discharge. This is because the period
      after hospital discharge is critical to long-term recovery, overall quality of life, and
      prevention of future hospitalizations. In this study, a trained nurse interventionist will
      work with the participants to develop a personalized adherence enhancement strategy for heart
      failure diagnosis. The personalized adherence enhancement strategy is called EMPOWER.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>mean change in adherence to low-sodium diet</measure>
    <time_frame>week 1 to week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Adherence to low sodium diet will be assessed by the Dietary Sodium Restriction Questionnaire (DSRQ). The DSRQ is composed of 3 subscales: 1) attitude toward the behavior, 2) subjective norm, and 3) perceived behavioral control.
Attitude. There are 6 items in the Attitude subscale. The scores on this subscale ranged from 6 to 30, where a higher score indicates correct attitudes (better knowledge) about following a low-sodium diet.
Subjective norm. There are 3 items in the Subjective Norm subscale. The scores on this subscale ranged from 3 to 15, where a higher score indicates heavier influence of subjective norm of social contacts on one's adherence to low-sodium diet.
Perceived behavioral control. There are 7 items in the Perceived Behavioral Control subscale. The scores on this subscale ranged from 7 to 35, a higher score indicates a higher likelihood for each item to be a barrier in adherence to low-sodium diet.</description>

    <description>EMPOWER includes 4 weekly home visit and 4 follow up booster phone calls every other week for the following 8 weeks. The trained nurse interventionist will address identified adherence barriers related to knowledge deficits about heart failure and its treatment including psycho-social barriers and logistic barriers with their primary care physician if necessary.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  diagnosis of moderate/severe heart failure at hospital admission, defined by ICD codes
             (ICD-9 428 or ICD-10 150), New York Heart Association class III/IV, and left
             ventricular ejection fraction less than or equal to 40% (i.e., echocardiography)

          -  discharge from heart failure-led hospitalization to home health care in approximately
             the previous week

          -  intact or mildly impaired cognitive function (Montreal Cognitive Assessment
             eligibility scores greater than or equal to 18)

             Rochester

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  end-of-life prognosis in the following 6 months that make it difficult to examine the
             changes in heart failure outcomes

          -  currently receiving hospice care

          -  conditions that impact the receipt of the intervention such as active suicidal
             ideation that is identified at baseline using the Geriatric Depression Scale and the
             Geriatric Suicide Ideation Scale

          -  being non-English speaking
