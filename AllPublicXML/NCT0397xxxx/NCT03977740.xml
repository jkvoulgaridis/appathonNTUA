    <textblock>
      Background: Parkinson disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and
      characterized by tremor, rigidity and bradykinesia. Almost 84% of PD patient develops
      respiratory abnormalities and pointed as the most common cause of death. Airway obstruction,
      trunk muscle rigidity is the common cause of respiratory abnormalities.

      Purpose: The main purpose of the study will evaluate the efficacy of chest PNF on pulmonary
      function and chest wall mobility in PD.

      Methods: 20 participants will be recruited for study purpose and divide into two groups.
      Group= A will be the control group and participants will receive conventional treatment which
      includes deep breathing exercise and segmental breathing exercise, incentive spirometry etc
      for one week. Group= B participants will receive chest PNF exercise along with conventional
      treatment for a week. Pretreatment and post-treatment data will be recorded by the help of
      PFT (FVC, FEV1 &amp; FEV1/FVC) and chest wall expansion at axillary and xiphisternal level for
      data analysis. Data analysis will be done by paired t-test for within group and independent
      t-test will be used for the between-group variable. The level of significance will be set at
      0.05.
