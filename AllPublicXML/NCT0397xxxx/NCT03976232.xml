  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep problems in patients with CLBP are a very common complication and is the most neglected
      part of the management. Though previous literature suggested that sleep problems need to be
      managed in patients with CLBP, no physical therapy or manual therapy techniques has been
      checked for their efficacy to manage the same. Therefore, there is a need to check the
      efficacy of various physical therapy and manual therapy techniques so that sleep problems
      associated with CLBP can be managed effectively by physical means. The main purpose of the
      study is to check the efficacy of tDCS and CST to improve sleep, pain and quality of life in
      patients with CLBP.
