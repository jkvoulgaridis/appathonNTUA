  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This retrospective study evaluated the efficacy and the safety of use of this treatment
      combined with a taxane for the treatment of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer and
      compared the clinical and demographic characteristics of real life patients to the patients
      of CLEOPATRA.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2013 the European Medicines Agency authorized the use of a new antibody named Pertuzumab
      in combination with Trastuzumab in first-line setting for patients with HER2-positive
      metastatic breast cancer. The efficacy and the safety were demonstrated in the CLEOPATRA
      study. This study had inclusion and exclusion criteria that might not be representative of a
      real life population of women with metastatic breast cancer. Few study tried to evaluate this
      treatment in real life settings but with discordant results. This retrospective study
      evaluated the efficacy and the safety of use of this treatment combined with a taxane for the
      treatment of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer and compared the clinical and demographic
      characteristics of real life patients to the patients of CLEOPATRA.
