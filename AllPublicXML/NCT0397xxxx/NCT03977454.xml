      Preoperative quadratus lumborum block (QLB)/lateral femoral cutaneous nerve block (LFCNB)
      with ropivacaine and glucocorticoids provide more effective analgesia than periarticular
      injection (PAI) with the same mixture in total hip arthroplasty (THA).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To support our hypothesis that preoperative quadratus lumborum block (QLB)/lateral femoral
      cutaneous nerve block (LFCNB) provides more effective analgesia than periarticular injection
      (PAI) in total hip arthroplasty (THA), we will look at the following outcomes:

      Primary outcome: Daily opioid consumption

      Secondary outcomes:

        1. Pain intensity and physical functioning while in the hospital: using pain inventory
           modified from Brief Pain Inventory 23, see attached;

        2. Boston mobility scores (from physical therapy note);

        3. Clinical Quality Improvement (CQI) data: White blood cell (WBC), serum glucose and
           complications;

        4. Length of hospital stays;

        5. Surgical outcome by Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)
           scores at 2-weeks postop in surgeon office to be collected by researchers.

      Since both QLB/LFCNB nerve block and PAI techniques are both routinely used as standard of
      care anesthesia for THA, the study intervention will be the randomization to assign patients
      to one of these treatment options and assess their response from post-op patient
      questionnaires and data collection.
