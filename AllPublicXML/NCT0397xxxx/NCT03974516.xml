  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be performed in healthy volunteers in a conventional 3+3 dose-escalation
      design. Four cohorts (dose level A, B, C, and D) of up to 6 evaluable volunteers per cohort
      are planned to be sequentially accrued to receive Careseng 1370 1, 2, 3 and 4 sachets per
      day, 4,000 mg/sachet before meal (starting from 1 sachet). At least 5 days of staggering and
      with the investigator's judgement of no safety concern will be required to administer the
      next volunteer for the first three volunteers of each cohort. The staggering time is counted
      from Day 1 of one volunteer to Day 1 of the next volunteer.

      Careseng 1370 should be taken around 1 hour before meal. No volunteer is allowed to be
      assigned to more than 1 dose level. All dose escalation/de-escalation decisions will be made
      by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB).
