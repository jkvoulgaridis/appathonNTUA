  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a single center, open-label, two-way crossover, drug-drug-interaction study to
      determine the effect of multiple dosing of omeprazole on 4 consecutive days on the
      pharmacokinetics of a single dose of an immediate-release capsule of CG5503 (tapentadol) in
      healthy participants.
