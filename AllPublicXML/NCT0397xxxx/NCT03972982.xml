  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Short-term intensive insulin therapy is shown to induced glycemic remission, but
      traditionally patients were hospitalized for 2-4 weeks in order to receive the therapy, the
      long inpatient period precluded the wide application of the thrapy. This study aims to
      invesitgate whether simplified regimen is non-inferior to traditional regimen in achieving
      long-term glycemic remisson.
