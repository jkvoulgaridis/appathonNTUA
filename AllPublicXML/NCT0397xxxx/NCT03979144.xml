  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It concerns a study to evaluate the usability of an HIV self-test prototype developed from TR
      DPP® HIV - 1/2 Oral Fluid. The study followed the recommendations of Technical Note No.
      20/2016 / GEVIT / GGTPS / ANVISA.

      It concerns a study with a mixed method approach to evaluate the usability of a prototype of
      HIV self-test among lay users. Data collection techniques were performed through observation
      through videos of lay users conducting self-testing without supervision, a qualitative
      checklist by participant observation, pre-test and post-test interviews, and closure form.
      There was no randomization in this study.

      The study was conducted by four clinical research sites, distributed in four different states
      of Brazil in other to obtain a geographic representation: Unidade de Ensaios Clínicos para
      Imunobiológicos (UECI) at Rio de Janeiro; Centro de Ciências da Saúde da Universidade Federal
      da Paraíba (UFPB) at Paraíba, Faculdade de Medicina de Botucatu (UNESP) at São Paulo and
      Centro de Ciências Biológicas e da Saúde da Universidade Estadual do Pará (UEPA) at Pará.

        Lay people, that is, individuals without formal technical or scientific training, with
        different degrees of education, genres and age groups. The user profile included
        information about the academic / professional training and city / state, of both sexes,
        selected from characteristics distributed in 4 different groups, including regional
        variations:

        Group 1: participants with a grade of schooling up to elementary school, in the age group
        of 18 to 29 years; Group 2: participants with a high school education level, between the
        ages of 18 and 29; Group 3: participants with educational level up to elementary school, in
        the age group from 30 years; Group 4: participants with a high school education, in the age
        group from 30 years of age
