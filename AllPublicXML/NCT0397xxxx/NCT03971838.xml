      The purpose of this study is to offer women with a history of gestational diabetes access to
      diabetes prevention programming; their children 10 and older can participate. There are two
      potential types of participants:

        1. Women and their children 10+ can consent to participate in the diabetes prevention
           programming offered through Dr. Hannon's center (called Encourage). Researchers will
           collect data at three time points, baseline, 4-6 months, and 12 months.

        2. Instead of participating in Encourage, women may participate in other diabetes
           prevention programming/weight management programming offered by other entities.
           Researchers will consent these women into the study to complete 3 data collection
           points, baseline, 4-6 months, and 12 months. Additionally, researchers will consent
           women to obtain data from their chosen program. For instance, if a woman chooses to do a
           Diabetes Prevention Program through the YMCA, researchers will ask women to self report
           their weekly attendance and weight.
