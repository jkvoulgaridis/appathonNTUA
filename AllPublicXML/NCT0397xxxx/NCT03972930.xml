  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the main challenges in treating sarcomas with radiation is the toxicity to normal
      structures around the sarcoma. Early reports suggest Hypofractionated Radiotherapy will be
      safe and effective for treatment of soft tissue sarcomas. However, given the rarity of this
      disease, the diversity of histological sub-types, and the variety of locations where these
      can occur (anywhere in the body), more data is needed to provide understanding of the safety
      and efficacy of hypofractionated radiotherapy for treatment of this disease. The hypothesis
      is that by using hypofractionated radiotherapy, highly conformal high dose radiation can be
      delivered to soft tissue sarcomas, while respecting established normal tissue constraints and
      that local control rates will be greater than historical rates reported with conventional
      fractionation.

      Eligible participants with biopsy proven soft tissue sarcoma will be on study for up to 60
      months.

    <description>The primary endpoint is 2-year local control, defined as the proportion of participants whose best response as determined per RECIST criteria using imaging is Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), or Stable Disease (SD) out of all participants who have received at least one fraction. Local control will be reported with an exact 95% confidence interval (CI).</description>

    <description>Progression free survival (PFS) defined with follow-up radiological assessment with PFS calculated from the point of start of hypofractionated radiotherapy to the point of recurrence or death. Participants without documented progression who are alive at last follow-up will be censored at the date of the last radiologic assessment. PFS will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Biopsy proven soft tissue sarcoma, either localized and inoperable/unresectable or

             hypofractionated radiotherapy.

          -  Participant refuses surgery or is aware that surgery is not recommended for them

          -  Karnofsky performance status &gt; 60

          -  Able to understand and sign an informed consent form

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant

          -  Chemotherapy or systemic anti-cancer treatment within the preceding two weeks

          -  Unable to undergo imaging or positioning necessary for radiotherapy planning
