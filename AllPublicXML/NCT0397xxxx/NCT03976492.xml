  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the most common type of nerve injury and it severely
      endangers the public health. It is necessary to accurately measure the early neurological
      function of brain injury for monitoring its prognosis and therapeutic interventions. Glasgow
      Coma Score (GCS) and Computed Tomography (CT) are often used to diagnose the severity of TBI.
      However, GCS has its drawbacks in the observation of prognosis, because it is interfered by
      analgesics, sedatives and relaxants in the evaluation of neurological function. CT may miss
      the diagnosis of diffuse axonal injury (DAI) and the monitoring of intracranial pressure
      (ICP). Secondary injuries after TBI, such as oxidative stress, inflammatory damage, and
      abnormal metabolism, can destroy cerebral blood vessels and structures, which also affect the
      diagnosis of injury. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new methods to quickly identify
      which patients are likely to suffer brain injury or even cause persistent disability.
      Detection of brain injury biomarkers based on blood and brain tissue has long been used to
      assess the severity of TBI, but no biomarkers have been found for early diagnosis of mTBI and
      prognosis of different degrees of brain injury. Protein and metabolic product differences
      were detected from blood or the lesion samples of normal population, patients with traumatic
      brain injury and/or non-brain injury using mass spectrometry proteomics and metabolomics
      analysis platform, and diagnostic markers of potential traumatic brain injury were found, and
      their differential and diagnostic values were discussed.
