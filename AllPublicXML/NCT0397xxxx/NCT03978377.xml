  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiotherapy improves locoregional control and survival of thoracic tumour patients. However,
      the associated exposure of normal tissues, often leads to side effects and possibly even
      reduces survival. Indeed, there is growing evidence that overall survival after radiotherapy
      for lung and oesophageal cancer is related to the radiation dose to heart and lungs. This
      suggests that thoracic radiotherapy causes mortality, which is currently not recognized as
      radiation-induced toxicity. So the question arises how to explain this treatment-related
      mortality.

      Interestingly, Ghobadi et al demonstrated in rats that thoracic irradiation can lead to
      pulmonary hypertension (PH). Histopathological analysis showed that radiation-induced PH
      closely resembles the pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) subtype. Moreover, in a clinical
      pilot study we confirmed early signs of PH including dose-dependent reductions in blood flow
      towards the lungs in radiotherapy patients.

      In general PH significantly affects survival. Moreover, the PAH subtype is the most-rapidly
      progressive and lethal subtype. However, medical treatment can significantly slow down PAH
      progression, providing opportunities for secondary prevention. Yet, hard evidence that
      radiation-induced PH is a clinically relevant phenomenon in patients treated for thoracic
      tumours, is lacking.

      In the present study, the incidence and time course of treatment-related changes in
      cardio-pulmonary physiology will be assessed using standard diagnostic tools such as
      echocardiography, cardiac MRI (CMR) and serum biomarkers and relate them to the radiation
      dose distribution. Such insight in the characteristics of this possible radiation-induced PH
      and contributing risk factors is essential to develop primary (radiation dose optimization)
      prevention strategies.

      The general objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that pulmonary hypertension
      (PH) is a clinically relevant radiation-induced side effect of thoracic irradiation. If
      confirmed this allows us to take appropriate measures in patient care to improve quality of
      life in thoracic cancer patients.

      To investigate this hypothesis, the following specific aims have been defined:

        -  To assess the incidence and time course of PH in a prospective cohort study in patients
           treated with radiotherapy for lung or oesophageal cancer.

        -  To characterize other changes in myocardial function and pulmonary arteries, and their
           function using cardiac MR.

        -  To determine treatment-related risk factors, in particular radiation dose factors to the
           lungs and heart that could be used for future optimization strategies to minimize the
           risk of inducing PH in these patients.

        -  To determine the clinical impact by correlating PH to patient-rated outcome measure
           (PROMs) and survival. Taken together this study will determine if radiation-induced
           pulmonary hypertension is a clinically relevant toxicity and will provide information
           required for future studies on its prevention and treatment. In addition, more insight
           will be obtained on other forms of cardiovascular damage and complications that may
           occur in these patients.
