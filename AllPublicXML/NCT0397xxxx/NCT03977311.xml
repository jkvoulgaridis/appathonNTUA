  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, safety and feasibility of MR-guided HIFU hyperthermia application will be
      assessed in patients diagnosed with locally advanced cervical cancer. This site has
      reasonable soft tissue pathways and depths for the ultrasound to access with limited osseous
      or air interference. Additionally, of cervical cancer patients who develop recurrence
      following standard treatment, approximately 1/3 will recur locally and an additional 1/3
      recur both locally and distantly. Risk of local failure increases with higher FIGO staging.
      Therefore, patients with locally advanced cervical cancer stand to benefit from adjuvant
      hyperthermia to potentially increase local disease control outcomes. While MR-HIFU may
      conceivably increase risk for local complications such as fistula formation, these risks are
      felt to be acceptable given the potential morbidity of local disease failure, which often can
      only be addressed curatively by pelvic exenteration. In this study, testing will be performed
      within tumor volumes involving the cervix uteri. Heating will be to the therapeutic level of
      41-42°C for 30-60 minutes, a commonly utilized therapeutic target. This session duration will
      be achieved in either a single session either before or after the radiotherapy fraction or in
      an optional two sessions of 15-30 minutes both before and after the radiotherapy fraction,
      for a total time of 30-60 minutes one day per week. This study will help to elucidate the
      feasibility of achieving and maintaining therapeutic hyperthermia within an entire tumor
      volume over the goal period of time of 30-60 minutes.

      The investigators anticipate that successful completion of this study will lead to further
      clinical trials investigating the treatment efficacy in terms of added local control compared
      to traditional, standard-of-care radiotherapy.

    <description>-The study team will determine the tumor volume to be treated per standard-of-care diagnostic MRI or CT imaging. An array of scans will be used to align the participant with the HIFU system, optimize heat delivery to the patients, and/or monitor aspects related to the participant such as motion. Vendor-provided software will be used with the participant in each position to create a customized treatment plan for heat delivery. The HIFU device will then be used to apply clinical levels (41-42°C) of heat to the tumor volume. Regions will be heated to the 41-42°C for up to 60 minutes in one session (either before or after radiation) on one day per five to ten standard radiation therapy fractions, with a maximum of 6 days of hyperthermia over the course of their standard, indicated radiation therapy treatment.</description>
