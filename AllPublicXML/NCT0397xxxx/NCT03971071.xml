      Study 20170703 is a phase 4, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled
      study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of erenumab against placebo in subjects with
      chronic migraine (CM) who have a history of at least 1 preventive treatment failure and are
      diagnosed with medication overuse headache (MOH).

      Study 20170703 is a phase 4, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group,
      placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of erenumab against placebo in a
      chronic migraine (CM) population with medication overuse headache (MOH) and prior history of
      treatment failure. Subjects will be enrolled based on fulfilment of the International
      Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd Edition (ICHD-3) CM and MOH criteria and will not
      be advised to early discontinue acute medication.

      Subjects who successfully complete the 24-week double-blind treatment period (DBTP) of the
      study will be offered an opportunity to continue in an open-label treatment period (OLTP) of
      28-weeks duration. Subjects who received erenumab treatment during the DBTP will continue to
      receive the same erenumab dose during the OLTP. Subjects who received placebo during the DBTP
      will be allocated in a 1:1 ratio to receive either erenumab 70 mg or 140 mg SC QM during the
      OLTP. All subjects will remain blinded to their original DBTP treatment assignment.

    <ipd_time_frame>Data sharing requests relating to this study will be considered beginning 18 months after the study has ended and either 1) the product and indication have been granted marketing authorization in both the US and Europe or 2) clinical development for the product and/or indication discontinues and the data will not be submitted to regulatory authorities There is no end date for eligibility to submit a data sharing request for this study.</ipd_time_frame>
    <ipd_access_criteria>Qualified researchers may submit a request containing the research objectives, the Amgen product(s) and Amgen study/studies in scope, endpoints/outcomes of interest, statistical analysis plan, data requirements, publication plan, and qualifications of the researcher(s). In general, Amgen does not grant external requests for individual patient data for the purpose of re-evaluating safety and efficacy issues already addressed in the product labelling. Requests are reviewed by a committee of internal advisors. If not approved, a Data Sharing Independent Review Panel will arbitrate and make the final decision. Upon approval, information necessary to address the research question will be provided under the terms of a data sharing agreement. This may include anonymized individual patient data and/or available supporting documents, containing fragments of analysis code where provided in analysis specifications.
