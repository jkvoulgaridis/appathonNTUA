  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Materna Prep Device in
      reducing the length of the second stage of labor and reducing pelvic muscle injuries during
      vaginal delivery.

      Intervention with the Materna Prep Device is expected to be a one-time use of 30-90 minutes.
      Total subject participation in the study is expected to be up to 4 months from the time of
      initial enrollment. All evaluations prior to and after delivery can be performed on an
      outpatient basis. The Materna Prep Device is a vaginal dilator used to pre-stretch the
      vaginal canal to shorten the length of second stage of labor in preparation for vaginal
      delivery.

      This is randomized, controlled study designed to evaluate safety and effectiveness of the
      Materna Prep Device in pre-stretching the vaginal canal in preparation for vaginal delivery.
      The primary effectiveness endpoint is the length of the second stage of labor, defined as the
      time from the cervix being dilated to 10cm to the complete delivery of the baby. Data on
      maternal and neonatal adverse events will be gathered and evaluated. Adverse events will be
      further summarized by relatedness to the device and/or procedure, seriousness and level of
      severity.

      There are three secondary endpoints:

      Reducing Perineal laceration rate. Reducing the Length of Pushing Time, defined as the time
      from when the mother begins pushing to the complete delivery of the baby.

      Reducing Levator Hiatus Area (measurement between pelvic muscle and pelvic bone) determined
      at 3-month ultrasound follow-up.
