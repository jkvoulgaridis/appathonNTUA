  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the main cause of mortality by cancer in France. The lung cancer stage at time
      of diagnosis is a major determinant of survival. To date, 75% of lung cancer are diagnosed at
      an advanced stage with worse survival). Lung cancer screening is based on low dose CT scan
      which allows to decrease lung cancer related mortality of 20% in patients aged 55-74
      years-old with a history of tobacco consumption â‰¥ 30 PY active of who quite &lt; 15 years. These
      criteria for eligibility for lung cancer screening lead to 1 to 2% of lung cancer diagnosis
      at the first CT scan. In our experience regarding 1 year of lung cancer surgical resection,
      only 45% of the patients presented criteria for lung cancer screening. Moreover, the duration
      of tobacco consumption would provide a better stratification of lung cancer risk compared to
      only PY. Therefore, other criteria for lung cancer screening eligibility could be proposed.
      Currently, 9 out of 10 lung cancer is linked with tobacco consumption which is also a major
      risk factor for atherosclerosis-associated cardiovascular events. Around 40% of patients with
      a lung cancer have a history of atherosclerosis-associated cardiovascular event, mainly
      coronary artery diseases and peripheral artery diseases. Main Objective: The objective is to
      compare the observed rate of lung cancer prevalence in our study to the rate of around 2 %
      observed in lung cancer screening trials in south Europe (France and Italy).

      The investigators hypothesize that the population of patients with a history of
      atherosclerotic cardiovascular event associated with tobacco consumption present a higher
      prevalence of lung cancer compared with the population of patients eligible for lung cancer
      screening program which is defined by age and history of tobacco consumption.
