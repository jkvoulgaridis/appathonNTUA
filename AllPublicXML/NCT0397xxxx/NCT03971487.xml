  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some people who have what doctors currently call schizophrenia or bipolar disease may
      actually have a brain disease caused by auto-antibodies. Auto-antibodies are produced when
      the normal defense mechanism of the body goes wrong and begins to attack the body, similar to
      &quot;friendly fire.&quot; Auto-antibodies attack brain receptors and then the person who has this
      problem begins to have hallucinations and other manifestations of schizophrenia, like feeling
      that people can see what they are thinking and also feeling that other people do not like
      them. If this disease is caused by auto-antibodies, typically the person is well until they
      are 15 years of age or older, but seldom older than 35 years. Then, in a matter of a few
      months they begin to have hallucinations and the other symptoms. Doctors still do not know
      whether some people with schizophrenia or bipolar disease have auto-antibodies attacking
      their brain. For this reason, in this study some of these patients will receive a treatment
      that suppresses the auto-antibodies and their symptoms after treatment will be compared with
      the symptoms of a group of similar patients who are given a preparation that looks like the
      real treatment, but it is not.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Individuals of either sex, 18-35 years of age.

          -  Having an active psychotic disorder meeting DSM-5 criteria, including a duration of at
             least six months, for Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder, as defined by the Mini
             International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI).

          -  A total PANSS ≥ 60 and a score ≥ 4 on at least 2 of the PANSS positive symptoms.

          -  Normal academic performance at least until the age of 15 years and absence of
             psychiatric symptoms before the same age.

          -  Ability to assent or consent to the performance of the study and participate in
             testing procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             two weeks prior to baseline PANSS testing (Visit 2, see below).

             standard analgesics or antipyretics, in the six months prior to randomization.

          -  Vaccinated with a live-attenuated vaccine less than 4 weeks before ocrelizumab
             infusion or with a non-live vaccine less than 2 weeks before infusion.

          -  Active infection, or history of or known presence of recurrent or chronic infection
             (for example, hepatitis B or C, Human Immunodeficiency Virus, syphilis, tuberculosis,
