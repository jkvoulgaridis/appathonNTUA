  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study plans to enroll 9 patients to assess the safety of C-TCR055. Subjects who meet the
      eligibility criteria will receive a single dose of C-TCR055 injection, and will be followed
      up post treatment for safety monitoring. The follow up period will last 12 months.
