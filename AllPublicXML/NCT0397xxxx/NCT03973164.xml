  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The diagnosis of lymphoma bone marrow infiltration is very important for the staging and
      treatment mode of lymphoma. Traditional bone marrow cytology and pathology examinations are
      only performed locally, and missed diagnosis is possible. The study explore the value of
      multi-parameter pelvic magnetic resonance in detecting bone marrow infiltration with newly
      diagnosed lymphoma patients . This study also explore the consistency of pelvic magnetic
      resonance and PET/CT for detection of lymphoma bone marrow infiltration.
