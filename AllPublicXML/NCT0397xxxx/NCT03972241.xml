  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The symptoms and signs of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) include bradykinesia,
      rigidity, tremor and poor sensory integration, which result in mobility disability. Present
      integrated research project tries to investigate the effects of different physical therapy
      interventions on daily activities in patients with PD. This integrated research project
      includes 3 subprojects as follows. The title of Subproject 1 is &quot;Three dimensional motion
      analysis of daily activities with functional insole in Parkinsonian patients&quot;. The title of
      Subproject 2 is &quot;Immediate and long-term effects of novel plantar mechanical device on
      postural control in standing and gait performance in people with Parkinson's disease&quot;. The
      title of Subproject 3 is &quot;Upper extremity hand function and coordination during functional
      movement in patients with Parkinson's disease&quot;.

      This multidisciplinary research project collaborates with Department of Physical Therapy, and
      Department of Medicine in Tzu Chi University. Furthermore, this integrated study also works
      with Department of Neurology, Department of Neurosurgery, as well as Department of
      Rehabilitation in Tzu Chi Hospital to improve the mobility in patients with PD.

      This is a three-year integrated project, and the common purposes of this project in each are
      as follows. In the first year, it is to compare the daily functional difference between the
      healthy and the Parkinsonian patients. In the second year, it is to examine the immediate and
      short-term effects of different interventions on daily activities in Parkinsonian
      patients.The third year is for upper extremity functional assessment.

      In the first year, it is to compare the functional difference of biomechanics and motor
      control between the healthy and the Parkinsonian patients. In the second year, it is to
      examine the immediate and short-term effects of functional foot insole and the kinetic
      training on daily activities in Parkinsonian patients. In the third year, it is to examine
      the hand tremor during drawing, and the coordination during reaching in Parkinsonian
      patients.
