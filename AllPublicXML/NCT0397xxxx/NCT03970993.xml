  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical trial in which healthy volunteers will be administered experimental
      malaria vaccines. Nine groups of volunteers will receive vaccination with the novel malaria
      vaccine candidate, R21 in combination with the vaccine adjuvant, Matrix M. In Groups 1a, 1b,
      3a and 3b, vaccines will be delivered at 4 week intervals (ie. At 0, 4 &amp; 8 weeks). In Groups
      2a, 2b, 4a, 4b &amp; 5, vaccines will be delivered initially at a 4 week interval but the last
      interval will be 24 weeks to assess if a staggered dose affects the immune response. In
      Groups 4a, 4b &amp; 5, this third dose will also be a fractional dose.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will assess the safety of the vaccinations, and the immune responses to
      vaccination. Immune responses are measured by tests on blood samples. Volunteers will be
      infected with malaria by mosquito bites, 28 weeks after the first vaccination in Group 2a,
      and 12 weeks after the first vaccination in Group 3a. In addition, Groups 6 and 7 of
      volunteers not receiving vaccines will also be infected with malaria by the same method 28
      weeks and 48-56 weeks from the beginning of the trial. These infection experiments will be
      used to assess vaccine efficacy: how well the vaccines act to prevent malaria disease. Groups
      1a, 1b, 2b, 3b, 4a, 4b &amp; 5, will not be given malaria infection.

      R21 is a protein particle, which is produced by combining a protein from Hepatitis B with the
      circumsporozoite protein (CSP) of the malaria parasite. This is not a live vaccine and so
      there is no chance of catching malaria.

      Healthy volunteers will be recruited in England across four research sites: in Oxford,
      London, and Southampton.
