    <textblock>
      RESILIENT is a phase III, multi-center, prospective, pragmatic randomized clinical trial with
      blinded assessment of the primary endpoint. This study aims to evaluate whether mHealth-CR
      improves functional capacity in older adults (age ≥70) with IHD compared with standard
      traditional cardiac rehabilitation care. A total of 400 eligible patients will be randomized
      in 3:1 manner to mHealth-CR versus usual care for assessment of primary endpoint. Enrollment
      will occur over approximately 42 months with an expected minimum of 3 months follow-up per
      participant.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of RESILIENT is to evaluate whether mobile health cardiac rehab
      (mHealth-CR) improves functional capacity in older adults (age ≥70) with ischemic heart
      disease (IHD), identified at the time of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), percutaneous
      coronary intervention (PCI), or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), compared with usual
      care. Our central hypotheses related to efficacy are that mHealth-CR will (1) improve
      functional capacity (primary outcome), (2) improve goal attainment, health status, and
      activities of daily living, and (3) lower rates of hospital readmission and death (secondary
      outcomes). Our central hypothesis related to engagement is that we will identify distinct
      trajectories of engagement and characteristics that predict membership in each category.

    <measure>Change in 6-minute walking distance (6MWD)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 month</time_frame>
    <description>Change in 6MWD, reflective of functional capacity, is measured by the 6-minute walk test (6MWT). The 6-minute walk test (6MWT) is a submaximal exercise test in which the pace is self-selected by the participant. The 6MWT will be performed during baseline hospitalization and at the 3-month follow-up visit by a blinded research nurse.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Goal Attainment measured using a 5-point goal attainment scale (GAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 month</time_frame>
    <description>Using the SMART goal framework, GAS describes the person's expected level of goal achievement over 3 months, ranging from no change (scored as -2) to much better than expected (scored as +2) out of a 5 point-scale. Scales are dynamically set according to a person's needs, while measurement of attainment is standardized. Overall score is calculated by incorporating the goal of outcomes scores into an aggregated t-score. Goal attainment, through goal setting, is an especially important outcome in older adults who may begin an intervention with a variety of deficits (therefore necessitating individualized therapy towards realistic goals).</description>

    <measure>Participant reported health status - measured using the SF-12</measure>
    <time_frame>3 month</time_frame>
    <description>Health status encompasses a person's functional status, symptoms, and wellbeing, and is increasingly recognized as an important patient-centered outcome. Both the SF-12 and SAQ-7 have been validated and are convenient for participants (&lt;5 minutes to administer). For the SF-12, we will analyze change from baseline to 3 months using a threshold of 5 points in SF-12 physical component score (PCS) as a clinically meaningful change</description>

    <measure>Participant reported health status - measured Seattle Angina Questionnaire 7 (SAQ-7) (disease-specific health status).</measure>
    <time_frame>3 month</time_frame>
    <description>Health status encompasses a person's functional status, symptoms, and wellbeing, and is increasingly recognized as an important patient-centered outcome. Both the SF-12 and SAQ-7 have been validated and are convenient for participants (&lt;5 minutes to administer). For SAQ-7, we will analyze at a single time point (3 months) the number of participants who have residual angina (SAQ-7&lt;100) vs. no angina (SAQ-7=100).</description>

ADLs are activities that allow a person to live independently (e.g. food preparation, medication management, transportation, shopping, managing finances, using the telephone, and housekeeping).</description>
