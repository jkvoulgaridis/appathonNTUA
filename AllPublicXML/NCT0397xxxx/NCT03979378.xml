  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ectopic calcification and ossification complicate many diseases, which are rare for the most
      part. These calcifications (or ossifications) are generally classified according to their
      apparent formation mechanism. Even if very different diseases can be at the origin, these
      calcifications (or ossifications) have as common points: an unknown physiopathology, a
      composition of calcium pyrophosphate for the most part and l no curative treatment validated
      to date.

      Indeed, although several reported cases suggest the potential efficacy of different
      treatments , none of these treatments is currently recognized as effective because of the
      absence of confirmation data or because of contradictory results.

      Sodium thiosulfate (STS) has been used for a long time as an antidote to cyanide poisoning
      and as a protective agent against cytotoxic side effects such as ifosphamide. More recently,
      STS has been reported in the treatment of renal calcification. vascular or even subcutaneous.
      First prospective studies on animal models and in humans seem to confirm the interest of this
      product in the treatment of these abnormal calcifications.

      For several months, a magistral preparation in the form of ointment based on STS has been
      developed by the pharmacy of Limoges University Hospital in order to combine the local effect
      of STS while avoiding the side effects of an administration of this treatment by systemic
      way. The first uses of this preparation appear promising and some preliminary results have
      already been published. The benefit / risk ratio of this approach seems to be advantageous
      for clinicians since preparations whose composition is close are currently validated by the
      FDA and the World Health Organisation for the treatment of benign pathologies such as
      cutaneous dermatophytes or pityriasis versicolor.
