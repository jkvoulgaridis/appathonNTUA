  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Minimal change nephrotic syndrome (MCNS) is an acquired glomerular disease characterized by
      massive proteinuria occurring in the absence of glomerular inflammatory lesions or
      immunoglobulin deposits. MCNS represents a frequent cause of nephrotic syndrome (NS) in
      adults (10% to 25% of cases). The disease typically takes a chronic course characterized by
      frequent relapses. Until now, exclusive oral steroid therapy at the dose of 1mg/kg/day (max
      80 mg/day) for a minimum of 4 weeks and a maximum of 16 weeks (as tolerated) constitutes the
      first line treatment of adults with MCNS. Despite of successful remission of initial episode,
      previous case series showed that 56%-76% of patients experience at least one relapse after
      steroid-induced remission. The recent MSN trial prospectively showed that 57.9% and 70% of
      adult patients were in complete remission (CR) after 4 and 8 weeks of oral steroids therapy
      (1mg/kg/day). Among them, 23.1% of patients displayed at least one relapse episode (after one
      year-follow-up). Although well tolerated, side effects are common in patients with prolonged
      and/or repeated courses of steroids and alternative regimens seem highly suitable to reduce
      the risk of subsequent relapse. Rituximab has recently emerged as a promising therapeutic
      option in patients with steroids dependent-MCNS. In a multicenter, double-blind, randomized,
      placebo-controlled trial in children with frequent relapse or with steroid dependent NS, the
      authors found that the median relapse free period was significantly longer in the Rituximab
      group than in the placebo group without significant differences concerning serious adverse
      events. To our knowledge, its use has never been investigated for the initial episode of MCNS
      with the aim to reduce the subsequent risk of relapse that is a major concern in the
      management of MCNS patients.

      The main objective is to demonstrate, from initial episode of MCNS in adults, once complete
      remission has occurred, that the use of Rituximab (two injections separated by one week
      375mg/m2, with definitive steroids withdrawal after 9 weeks of treatment) may reduce the risk
      of subsequent MCNS relapse after 12 months of follow-up and may be a safe and an efficient
      treatment regimen.

      The study will be a single stage phase IIb, randomized, open-label, parallel group, in a 1:1
      ratio, active controlled, multicenter trial testing the efficacy and safety of two injections
      of Rituximab separated by one week 375mg/m2 from initial episode of biopsy-proven MCNS in
      adults. Since Rituximab therapy (when initiated in a context of steroid dependency MCNS)
      seems to be more effective in patients with complete remission and because of recent data
      from MSN trial showing that 70% of patients were in complete remission of nephrotic syndrome
      after 8 weeks of steroids, we decided to maximize the potential benefit, to perform
      randomization of patients after 8 weeks of steroid treatment. A potential risk factor of
      relapse is the time of CR occurrence, and because some patients reach CR at 4 weeks and
      others at 8 weeks, a randomization (1:1) with minimization strategy will be done in order to
      balance this factor between arms. The primary endpoint will be the incidence of MCNS relapse
      during the 12 months following randomization defined by the recurrence of nephrotic syndrome
      (urine protein/creatinine ratio (UPCR) ≥ 300mg/mmol and decreased albumin level (&lt; 30 g/L) in
      a patient who was in complete remission.

      Rituximab is currently considered as an effective therapeutic option to maintain remission in
      patients with frequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome (FRNS) or steroid-dependent nephrotic
      syndrome (SDNS). The goal of this prospective study is to determine the potential interest of
      the use of Rituximab from the initial episode of MCNS to reduce the risk of subsequent
      relapse, that is a major concern in the management of MCNS patients.

    <intervention_model_description>The study will be a single stage phase IIb, randomized, open-label, parallel group, in a 1:1 ratio, active controlled, multicenter trial testing the efficacy and safety of two injections of Rituximab separated by one week (375mg/m2) from initial episode of MCNS in adults.
The control arm is a standard regimen of oral steroid alone (progressively tapered within 24 weeks).
At inclusion, all patients will receive oral steroid therapy (Prednisone, 1mg/kg/day, maximum 80 mg/day). For patients without complete remission after 4 weeks of treatment, prednisone will be continued at the same dose until the 8th week. For patients with complete remission after 4 weeks of treatment, doses of prednisone will be progressively reduced between the 4th and the 8th week (0.06 mg/kg by week).
Patients who reach complete remission by 8 weeks after inclusion will be randomized at this time to receive either Rituximab (experimental group) or the standard steroid regimen (control group).</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The TBQ is a validated questionnaire exploring burden associated with taking medicine, self-monitoring, laboratory exams, medical visits, need for organization, administrative tasks, following advice on diet and physical activity, and social and financial impact of the treatment TBQ is composed of 15 items with rating scale ranging from 0 (best outcome (&quot;not a problem&quot;)) to 10 (worst outcome (&quot;large problem&quot;)) and an open-ended question. It is unidimensional and a global score (sum of answers to each item) is calculated.
4 weeks before randomization, 1 week after randomization (i.e. end of treatment for experimental arm) and 16 weeks after randomization (i.e. time of steroids cessation for control arm). The baseline level of treatment burden is assessed at Week -4 (instead of W0 randomization) to avoid a learning bias because the questionnaire would have been administered at time points W0 and W1.</description>
