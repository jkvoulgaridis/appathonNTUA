  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A toddler's fracture is a fracture that occurs in the lower leg, oven the shin, of children 9
      months to four years of age. It usually happens when a young child twists the leg while
      running or jumping. It is one of the most common injuries of the leg in this age group. In
      Canada and the United States there are about 80,000 cases per year that present to emergency
      departments. The good news is that these fractures are stable injuries and heal exceptionally
      well, without any reported concerns for problems in the future. Despite this, most children
      with this fracture are managed in a restrictive full circular cast, often including the
      entire leg, for three to six weeks. This cast management then also includes about two to
      three repeat visits to see a bone doctor, where the cast is often changed and new x-rays are
      taken with each visit. However, none of these things has ever been shown to change the way
      these young children's fractures heal. Further, casting can cause harm such as skin
      irritation or poor cast fit which may result in problems that are more distressing than the
      fracture itself. There are also costs to consider. The needless excess costs of the current
      management strategy in Canada alone can be estimated to be about 1.8 million dollars
      annually. And so, increasingly, some doctors are choosing to manage these stable fractures
      with a supportive device on the lower leg, a removable walking boot. This type of device can
      be taken off as needed by the parent and child and used only as long as the child needs it to
      manage the pain that results from this stable fracture. This makes caring for the child much
      easier and allows the child to return to activities when the child is ready. Further,
      families do not necessarily need to return to a bone doctor for cast changes or x-rays or
      reassessment. Since this fracture recovers so well, patients can see their family doctor to
      make sure their child is returning to activity as expected and have their questions about
      recovery answered. But, in order to be sure that the removable walking boot works as well as
      a cast in these fractures, we need to do a well-designed study to make sure we consider all
      the important aspects of making this change. As a result, in children with toddler's
      fractures, we will compare the traditional treatment of cast placement to a removable walking
      boot with respect to how each immobilization strategy controls pain and how quickly children
      return to their usual activities. We hope that children treated with a removable walking boot
      will still be able to achieve good pain control while their injury is healing. It is possible
      too those children will even return to their activities sooner and this newer strategy could
      save the health care system money.

      Background:

      Toddler's fractures (TF) are characterized as stable, spiral or oblique fractures of the
      tibial diaphysis or distal metaphysis that mainly occur in children between nine months and
      four years of age. Despite its inherent stability, the most frequent treatment option remains
      an above/below knee casting for three to six weeks, without clear and strong evidence to do
      so. Casting and orthopedic follow-up results in further burden including unnecessary visits
      to an orthopedic surgeon, additional sets of lower extremity radiographs and day-to-day
      inconveniences/complications (e.g. bathing/showering, problems of fit, breakage, and skin
      related complications). Commercially available removable immobilization devices have been
      applied successfully to low-risk stable extremity pediatric fractures, and have numerous
      advantages over conventional immobilization with casts (e.g. easy care, comfort and
      application/removal convenience) but have not properly been studied in the management of TF.

      Study Aims:

      To compare the recovery of children with TF when treated with a commercial, removable
      immobilization device versus an above-knee walking fiberglass cast.

      Hypothesis:

      The removable pediatric walking boot will be at least as effective as the walking above-knee
      cast with respect to pain with ambulation as measured by the EVENDOL scale at four weeks
      after injury.

      Research Design:

      This is a multi-centre, two-arm, non-inferiority randomized control trial. All independently
      weight-bearing children age 9 months to 4 years who present to the ED within five days of a
      lower extremity injury/complaint and diagnosed clinically and radiolographically with an
      accidental TF will be eligible for enrolment. Study participants will be randomly assigned to
      receive either a removable below knee device or a circumferential walking cast. The main
      outcome will be pain with ambulation as measured by the EVENDOL pain scale at four weeks.
      Complications, day-to-day burdens, unscheduled visits will be ascertained, as the impact and
      satisfaction with the treatment device. Accounting to a maximal 20% drop-off rate, a sample
      size of 160 participants was calculated to have a power of 90% to identify a difference of 2
      with an alpha value of 0.025. About one-third of participants will be recruited at CHU
      Sainte-Justine (n=54).

      Relevance:

      Current practice patterns predominately include treatment with a circumferential cast for
      several weeks. This type of rigid immobilization is likely unnecessary for such a stable
      injury. However, the research to date comparing casting with removable devices in children
      with TF has significant limitations and has not been of sufficient quality to change the
      immobilization and follow-up practice of TF. Specifically, retrospective design and analyses
      of data collected for a different purpose is subject to methodological limitations such as
      bias, missing data, and inconsistent measurement of outcomes. Further, these data have
      typically been limited to a single site, limiting generalizability. Other research has
      gathered data using surveys, which is limited by the fact that what physicians say they do
      does not necessarily represent what they actually do, and hence does not necessarily
      accurately represent clinical practice or outcomes. Finally, no research to date has
      considered the perspectives of families who need to care for these injured toddlers at home.
      Therefore, to secure the confidence of all relevant stakeholders, we need to provide high
      quality evidence to determine the most effective and convenient management strategy for this
      common childhood injury. If we can demonstrate that a removable device is at least as safe
      and effective as a circumferential cast in the treatment of TF, there are likely to be
      similar benefits for these fractures as it has been found with other minor pediatric
      fractures (e.g. comfort/convenience, safety, recovery, and cost-effectiveness advantages). As
      this is a common injury in childhood, the use of a removable device to manage this injury is
      highly likely to result in lower morbidity and save costs for the health care system and
      population, and these advantages will also generalize nationally and internationally.

    <masking_description>Double blinding is not feasible since the patient and families will know which immobilization method was applied. Therefore, the individual performing the outcome assessments will be a different person from the research team and will be masked to treatment allocation. The families will be instructed not to reveal the allocation to the research team member in order to minimize the chances of unblinding during follow-up encounters. In spite of the latter, there is potential for accidental unblinding. The frequency of this will be documented and reported.</masking_description>
