    <textblock>
      Open trial of heart rate variability biofeedback as an adjunct to individualized smoking
      cessation counseling plus transdermal nicotine replacement patch in smokers with elevated
      emotional distress.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to develop and pilot test heart rate variability biofeedback for
      smokers with elevated emotional distress as an adjunct to individual smoking cessation
      counseling and transdermal nicotine patch. In this open trial, all participants will receive
      the active intervention. Findings will be used to refine the protocol in advance of a
      subsequent Phase III randomized clinical trial.

    <measure>Intervention Feasibility: Participant Attendance and Adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>Weekly from Week 1 through Week 7</time_frame>
    <description>A composite index of attendance and adherence (e.g., homework completion) will be used to index intervention feasibility, from Week 1 through Week 7 (i.e., end-of-treatment).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Intervention Feasibility, Treatment Initiation: Participant Ratings of Perceived Effectiveness and Appropriateness</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1</time_frame>
    <description>Feasibility will be assessed via participant ratings of perceived effectiveness of the intervention in terms of helping them quit and manage emotional distress, ease of use, and perceived appropriateness of the intervention, upon treatment initiation.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Intervention Feasibility, End-of Treatment: Participant Ratings of Perceived Effectiveness and Appropriateness</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 7, i.e., end-of-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Feasibility will be assessed via participant ratings of perceived effectiveness of the intervention in terms of helping them quit and manage emotional distress, ease of use, and perceived appropriateness of the intervention, upon completing the intervention.</description>

    <measure>Intervention Acceptability, Treatment Initiation: Participant Ratings of Satisfaction and Liking</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1</time_frame>
    <description>Acceptability of the intervention will be based on participant ratings of satisfaction and liking of intervention components, upon treatment initiation.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Intervention Acceptability, End-of-Treatment: Participant Ratings of Satisfaction and Liking</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 7, i.e., end-of-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Acceptability of the intervention will be based on participant ratings of satisfaction and liking of intervention components, upon completing the intervention at Week 7.</description>

    <measure>Changes in Smoking Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 (i.e., baseline), Week 3 (i.e., quit date), Week 5 (i.e., 2-weeks post-quit), Week 7 (i.e., 1-month post-quit), and Week 16 (i.e., 3-months post-quit)</time_frame>
    <description>Change in smoking behavior from Week 0 (i.e., baseline) through Week 16 (i.e., 3-months post-quit) will be assessed via the well established Timeline Followback calendar interview.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Smoking Cessation</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 3 (i.e, Quit date), Week 5 (i.e., 2-weeks post-quit), Week 7 (i.e., 1-month post-quit), and Week 16 (i.e., 3-months post-quit)</time_frame>
    <description>Smoking cessation will be based upon self-report and carbon monoxide analysis of breath sample (&lt;5 ppm) at Week 3, i.e., the quit date, and at Week 5, Week 7, and Week 16, corresponding with 2-weeks, 1-month, and 3-months post-quit date. Participants whose abstinence is verified via carbon monoxide analysis of breath at Week 16, which occurs approximately five weeks following transdermal nicotine patch termination for those who use the full 8-week course, will provide a saliva sample for cotinine testing to biologically verify abstinence (&lt;12 ng/mL). Participants whose carbon monoxide analysis of breath sample (I.e., Weeks 3, 5, and 7) or cotinine analysis (Week 16) do not indicate abstinence will be coded as smoking.</description>

    <measure>Change in Total Emotional Distress</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, Week 5, Week 7, Week 16, i.e., baseline, 2-weeks, 1-month, and 3-months post-quit</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported changes, over time, in total emotional distress will be evaluated via the 21-item, Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale from Week 0 (i.e., baseline) to Week 5 Week 7, and Week 16, corresponding with 2-weeks, 1-month, and 3-months post-quit. Items will be rated on a Likert-type scale (0=Did not apply to me at all, to 3=Applied to me very much, or most of the time).</description>
