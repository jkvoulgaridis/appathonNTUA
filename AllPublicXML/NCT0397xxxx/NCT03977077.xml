    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of domestic injection
      paclitaxel (albumin binding type) in patients with advanced digestive tract tumors,and to
      further explore the possible predictors of efficacy.In order to provide more effective
      chemotherapeutic drugs, prolong survival time and improve quality of life for patients with
      advanced digestive tract tumors.
