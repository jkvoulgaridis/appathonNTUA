    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-center, open-label, dose-finding phase Ib clinical study with extension
      phase, which is aimed at evaluating the efficacy and safety of GB226 combined with
      fruquintinib in treatment of relapsed or metastatic NSCLC patients with EGFR-sensitive
      mutations who have failed to respond to EGFR-TKI treatment,evaluating the pharmacokinetic
      characteristics of GB226 and fruquintinib, and the immunogenicity of GB226, and preliminarily
      evaluating the antitumor activity of GB226 and fruquintinib.
