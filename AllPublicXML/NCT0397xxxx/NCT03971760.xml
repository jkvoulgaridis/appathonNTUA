  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A precautionary measure that is frequently used after a neck surgery is the usage of suction
      drains, which allow the evacuation or air and fluids accumulated at the site of the surgery
      using negative pressure. Theoretically this helps promote better healing of the wound. Usage
      of suction drains, however, requires keeping some patients hospitalized after surgery for
      drain surveillance while they could have otherwise been discharged to safely begin their
      convalescence at home. In other cases, patient hospitalisation can be prolonged by the usage
      of suction drains, because surgeons wait for the output of the drain to fall below a certain
      quantity before removing them. This of course results in additional costs to the health
      system. The quantity below which the drain output should fall before drain removal is however
      not something agreed upon in the medical literature and is generally based on a surgeon's
      personal experience or that of the institution in which they practice. It would be important
      to better define this value, since prolonged usage of suction drains is not risk-free.
      Indeed, they constitute, among other things, an access for bacteria to cause an infection to
      develop inside the neck, which compromises wound healing and may result in more pronounced
      scarring. This study aims to compare a frequently used output value (30 mL per 24 hours) with
      a more permissive one of 50 mL per 24 hours. The investigators will look more specifically at
      wound complications, length of hospitalisation and cost-effectiveness for the health system.
      This study will recruit patients undergoing neck surgery at the Centre Hospitalier de
      l'Université de Montréal to compare both of these suction drain output values.
