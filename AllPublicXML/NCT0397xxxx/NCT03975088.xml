    <textblock>
      The best treatment strategy for refractory DME is not known, options include switching
      between anti-VEGF agents, corticosteroids, and vitrectomy. In this study, authors describe a
      new surgical technique for the treatment of refractory non tractional DME. The technique
      consists of vitrectomy with ILM peeling with subretinal injection of Ranibizumab.

      Purpose: In this study, authors describe a new surgical technique for the treatment of
      refractory DME. The technique consists of vitrectomy with ILM peeling with subretinal
      injection of Ranibizumab.

      Methods: This is a prospective interventional non-comparative study including patients with
      refractory DME. Included patients were subjected to the new surgical technique of pars plana
      vitrectomy with sub-retinal injection of Ranibizumab.
