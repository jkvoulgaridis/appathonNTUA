  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, many studies have pointed out that bacterial toxin and cytokine storm are
      the main causes of shock and multiple organ failure in patients with sepsis. Endotoxin is the
      main vehicle for systemic inflammatory reaction caused by gram-negative bacteria which induce
      sepsis. Endotoxin binds to Toll- Like receptor 4 (TLR4) trigger a cytokine storm. The amount
      of endotoxin is associated with shock, insufficient intestinal perfusion, and poor prognosis.
      Therefore, clinicians try to use various methods to antagonize the action of endotoxin, which
      can reduce the cytokine storm and inflammatory response to improve the prognosis of sepsis.

      Continuous venous venous hemofiltration plays a role in blood purification in septic shock.
      With different hemofiltration filters, it has different effects. By removing the inflammatory
      mediators caused by bacterial toxins and cytokines, shock can be improved. The study plans to
      receive patients with septic shock and use a hemofiltration filter that adsorbs endotoxin and
      removes cytokines (oXiris, Baxter Healthcare) to perform continuous venous venous
      hemofiltration in addition to basic septic shock resuscitation. The effect on the
      concentration of cytokines in the blood, the infusion dose of inotropics, the fluid balances,
      and the degree of organ damage was evaluated. It is hoped that the results of this pilot
      study can lead us to subsequent randomized clinical trials to explore whether this filter can
      improve the prognosis of septic shock patients.
