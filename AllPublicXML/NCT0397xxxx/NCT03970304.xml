  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-randomized study. The purpose of this study is to better
      understand how vaccines against typhoid fever affect the normal immune system and bacteria in
      the intestine. Patients having standard-of-care colonoscopies will be divided into 3 groups:

      Group 1: Vivotif typhoid vaccination then colonoscopy; Group 2: Colonoscopy, then Vivotif
      typhoid vaccination, then follow-up colonoscopy; Group 3: Colonoscopy without vaccination.

      The Vivotif typhoid vaccine used in this study is licensed by the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) for travelers to developing countries. Volunteers will be asked to
      donate tissue, blood, saliva and stool samples for studying how the body responds to the
      typhoid vaccine.
