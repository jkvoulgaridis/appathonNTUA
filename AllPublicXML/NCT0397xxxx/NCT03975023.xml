  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a health issue impacting athletes and no clinical treatment
      protocol, other than rest, is yet established. The efficacy of a treatment protocol relies on
      objective, physiological measures of brain function and ultimately a quantification of injury
      severity.

      The present study aims to assess neurophysiological markers of auditory and visual measures
      of brain function using the NeuroCatch Platform and eye-tracking technology, respectively.
      The current gold standard of TBI evaluation, including cognitive and balance assessments,
      will also be captured.

    <description>During each study visit, the participants will undergo the following procedures:
NeuroCatch Platform (NCP) assessment (only if participant meets NCP-specific criteria)
RightEye's eye-tracking battery
Highmark Interactive's EQ application
Cambridge Brain Science's neuropsychological tests</description>

  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Device</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>NeuroCatch Platform (NCP)</intervention_name>
    <description>The NCP plays a proprietary 6-minute auditory stimulus sequence of tones and words that elicit involuntary evoked responses in the brain. Tone stimuli elicit N100 and P300 responses, and spoken word pairs elicit N400 responses. The NCP proprietary software identifies the latency and amplitude (timing and size) of three selected ERPs. Latency and amplitude values are reported as empirical (measured) values.</description>
