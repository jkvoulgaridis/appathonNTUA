    <description>Participants randomized to BfitBwell + PA behavior change counseling sessions will receive six, 1-1.5 hour sessions lead by a Certified Exercise Physiologist, trained on the study protocol. Sessions will be held once per week, every other week at the Anschutz Health and Wellness center. Participants will attend the sessions in groups, as schedules allow. Behavior change discussion topics will target self-efficacy for exercise, barriers to exercise, goal setting, behavior modification strategies, time management, cognitive reframing, and relapse prevention. Participants in this study arm will receive a group education workbook in congruence to discussion session topics to promote notetaking, and self-reflective journaling.</description>
