  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study aims to develop and test the effectiveness of a mobile application for
      patients who smoke to use while waiting in the clinic exam room to see their provider. The
      application will present patients with a variety of videos designed to increase their
      engagement in evidence-based smoking cessation treatment and offer them action steps to
      engage in smoking-related treatment or discussions with their provider.

      The overarching goal of this study is to develop a novel, effective mobile application for
      patients to use while waiting in the clinic exam room to see their provider and to access
      on-line after their visit. The Learn, Connect, and Quit (LCQ) application will present
      patients with a variety of videos designed to increase their understanding of, and engagement
      in, evidence-based smoking cessation treatment (e.g., videos that address barriers to
      cessation and explain treatment options). The LCQ app will also be coordinated within the
      clinical care system to allow patients to self-refer for smoking treatment and will serve as
      a prompt to begin a conversation with the provider thereby connecting smokers to
      evidence-based treatment with minimal staff burden, thus, increasing the feasibility and
      sustainability of this intervention. This research will pursue the following specific aims:

      Specific Aim 1: Develop the Learn, Connect, and Quit mobile application to: 1) present
      educational and motivational content in an easily accessible manner (i.e., via videos); and
      2) provide avenues for smokers to connect to evidence-based treatment (e.g., request a
      referral to the Wisconsin Tobacco Quitline via the app, initiate a discussion with their
      provider).

      Specific Aim 2: Identify optimal implementation procedures and clinical workflows to
      facilitate the use of the LCQ app within the clinical setting.

      Specific Aim 3: Establish the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effects of the
      Learn, Connect, and Quit app among smokers in a primary care clinic to support an NIH R01
      application.

      This research will create an innovative, patient-driven intervention that can be integrated
      into healthcare systems and leverage the patient wait times in traditional clinical settings
      to provide motivational content and treatment information to increase: motivation, smoking
      treatment engagement, and connections with evidence-based treatment resources. This
      innovative product will then be tested in larger implementation trials with external funding.

    <description>This group will consist of up to 100 English-speaking adult smokers recruited from their primary care clinic who are willing to complete a brief phone-based interview about their experience in using the &quot;Learn, Connect, and Quit&quot; (LCQ) tablet-based mobile application. The LCQ app presents smoking and cessation-related educational and motivational content in an easily accessible manner (i.e., via videos) and provides avenues for smokers to connect to evidence-based treatment.</description>

    <description>Rooming staff and physicians from the primary care clinic (where &quot;Patients Who Smoke&quot; group participants are recruited) will be asked to participate in interviews about the feasibility of implementing the LCQ app including implementation burden, impact on clinical workload, and clinical utility of the app (i.e., Did patients ask more questions about smoking treatment? How challenging was it to try to give all smokers the app to explore?).</description>

    <description>The Learn, Connect, and Quit (LCQ) Mobile Application is an application for electronic tablets that can: assess smokers' interest in quitting; answer smokers' questions about smoking, quitting, and available treatments; provide information about treatment options; communicate information about patients' smoking status, concerns, and treatment interest to their provider; and connect patients with treatment options including the Wisconsin Tobacco Quitline (WTQL), and other smoking intervention resources provided by their healthcare system.</description>
