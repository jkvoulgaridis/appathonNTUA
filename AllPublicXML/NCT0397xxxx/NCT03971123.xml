    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Cmax will be calculated from PK concentrations of Total Ketones (B-hydroxybutyrate and Acetoacetate), Tricaprilin and Octanoic Acid Levels. Cmax = Cmax is maximum concentration, determined directly from individual concentration-time data.Summary statistics will be generated for each PK parameter.</description>

          -  Clinically significant abnormal laboratory results at Screening.

          -  Participation in a clinical research study involving the administration of an
             investigational or marketed drug or device within 30 days prior to dosing,
             administration of a biological product in the context of a clinical research study
             within 90 days prior to dosing, or concomitant participation in an investigational
             study involving no drug or device administration.

          -  Subject has a known allergy to the study drug's active or inactive ingredients.

          -  Subject has been following a ketogenic diet (or other diet incompatible with the
             on-study diet), in the opinion of the investigator.

          -  Unable to refrain from, or anticipates the use of, any drug including prescription and
             non-prescription medications, herbal remedies or vitamin supplements beginning 14 days

             Paracetamol (up to 4g per 24-hour period) or ibuprofen (up to 1,200 mg per 24-hour
             period) may be permitted during the study.

          -  Has had alcohol 48 hours prior to Day -1 of Period 1.

          -  Any other condition which, in the investigator's opinion may adversely affect the
             subject's ability to complete the study or its measures or which may pose significant
