      To describe the beliefs, understanding and experience of immunosuppressant medication
      adherence in our current transplant patient population through a series of patient focus
      groups

  <detailed_description>

      The investigators want to understand more about why some of our kidney transplant patients
      find it difficult to take their anti-rejection medicines as intended. It is hoped that if the
      investigators can improve their understanding of why some patients struggle with their
      anti-rejection medicines, the investigators will be able to find better ways to help our
      transplant patients and so fewer patients may develop problems with their transplant. This
      study will collect qualitative data from a series of focus groups with kidney transplant
      recipients to explore their beliefs, understanding and experience of anti-rejection
      medication adherence. The focus groups will also explore the support that participants have
      received to help them with their medication adherence and what support they feel should be
      available to them and to others in the future to optimise anti-rejection medication adherence
      in transplant patients. Five focus groups will be undertaken. Each focus group will include
      six patients and will last for approximately 1.5 hours. All participants will be kidney
      transplant recipients transplanted and followed up at Imperial College Renal and Transplant
      Centre.

    <description>Through a series of focus groups, the investigators will qualitatively explore kidney transplant patients' understanding of the terms immunosuppressant medication adherence and nonadherence. What importance do patients attach to adherence. Do patients understand that nonadherence may effect the outcome of the transplant. The focus groups will identify the common practical and perceptual barriers to adherence identified by transplant patients and the interventions kidney transplant patients have used to try and improve their adherence. The focus groups will which interventions patients have found effective and which interventions patients have not found to be effective to improve their adherence. They will also identify support patients have had with adherence since their transplant, the support patients feel could have helped them to better adhere to their medicines up to now and the support our patients feel would help them to adhere better to their medicines in the future</description>
