  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the how the cerebellum is involved in speech motor learning over
      time and short-term corrections in patients with cerebellar ataxia and healthy controls. This
      will be accomplished through three approaches: behavioral studies, magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI), and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). During behavioral studies, participants
      will be asked to speak into a microphone while their voice is played back over earphones, and
      to do other speaking tasks. MRI will be acquired to perform a detailed analysis on brain
      function and anatomy related to speech and the cerebellum. In healthy controls, TMS will also
      be performed to temporarily disrupt the cerebellum before, during, or after the participant
      performs speaking tasks. Patients with cerebellar ataxia and healthy volunteers will be asked
      to complete behavioral studies and/or MRI; healthy volunteers may be asked to additionally
      participate in TMS.

      This study will investigate the role of the cerebellum in speech, building upon prior work in
      understanding cerebellar function in reaching and walking. Neuroimaging and lesion studies
      have provided strong evidence that the cerebellum is an integral part of the speech
      production network, though its precise role in the control of speech remains unclear.
      Furthermore, damage to the cerebellum (either degenerative or focal) can lead to ataxic
      dysarthria, a motor speech disorder characterized, in part, by impaired articulation and
      severe temporal deficits. This project seeks to bridge the gap between theoretical models of
      cerebellar function and the speech symptoms associated with ataxic dysarthria. Two mechanisms
      underlie speech motor control - feedback and feedforward control. In feedback control,
      speakers use sensory feedback (e.g., of their own voice) to control their speech. In
      feedforward control, speakers use knowledge gained from their past speech productions, rather
      than on-line feedback, to control their speech. This study entails a systematic plan to
      elucidate the role of the cerebellum in feedforward and feedback control of speech. A central
      hypothesis is that the cerebellum is especially critical in the feedforward control of
      speech, but has little involvement in feedback control. To explore this hypothesis, we will
      obtain converging evidence from three innovative methodologies: 1) Neuropsychological studies
      of speech-motor responses to real-time altered auditory feedback in patients with cerebellar
      atrophy (CA) and matched healthy controls, 2) Parallel studies in healthy controls undergoing
      theta-burst transcranial magnetic stimulation to create &quot;virtual lesions&quot; of the cerebellum,
      and 3) Structural and functional studies in CA patients to examine the relationship between
      cerebellar lesion location, dysarthria symptoms, and feedforward and feedback control
      ability.

      Speech provides an important opportunity to examine how well current theories of cerebellar
      function generalize to a novel effector (vocal tract) and sensory (auditory) domain. Its
      purpose for communication imposes exacting spectro-temporal constraints not seen in other
      motor domains. Furthermore, the distinctive balance of feedback and feedforward control in
      speech allows us to examine changes in both control types subsequent to cerebellar damage.
      Critically, this is the first work examining the link between theoretically motivated control
      deficits in CA patients and the speech symptoms associated with ataxic dysarthria, as well as
      their neural correlates.

    <description>Percent compensation is calculated as the following ratio: -100*(change in acoustic feature produced by the subject)/(change in acoustic feature caused by auditory feedback alteration). The negative sign ensures that changes produced by the subject that oppose the auditory feedback alteration changes are counted as positive compensation. Acoustic features used to compute percent compensation depend on the experiment performed and will include pitch or formant frequencies of subjects' output speech (measured by frequency in Hz), voice onset time (measured in milliseconds), fricative consonant duration (measured in milliseconds), and formant transition time (measured in milliseconds). We will look for short-term (within-trial) and long-term (across-trial) changes in percent compensation produced by subjects in response to alterations in subjects' auditory feedback they hear while speaking.</description>
