      In this study, the investigators test whether a 4-week 12-session attention bias modification
      treatment (ABMT) could reduce depressive symptoms relative to placebo controls in young
      adults with major depressive disorder at post-training and 3-month follow-ups. Meanwhile, the
      investigators also test whether a 2-week 4-session ABMT booster training for every three
      months could reduce residual depressive symptoms and recurrences relative to placebo controls
      for 1-year follow-up

      Attention Bias Modification Training was a modified dot-probe task, in which 90% of the
      targets appeared at the neutral word position and 10% at the sad word position. The placebo
      training procedure is a classic dot-probe task in which the targets appeared with equal
      probability in the sad (50%) and neutral (50%) word positions. The investigators assess
      attention bias scores, depressive symptoms, trait anxiety, rumination and self-report
      attention control ability at 1-week, 2-week, 4-week,7-week,3-month,4-month, 5-month, 6-month
      and 12-month follow-ups after training.

    <description>The ABM training task was a variation of the computerized visual dot-probe task. During the training, each session includes 54 neutral-sad word pairs presenting 6 times (6 Ã— 54=324 trials) during 20-minute. Participants received 12 sessions over 4 weeks (1 session every other day). In the active ABMT, 90% of the probes appeared at the neutral position and 10% at the sad position. At the placebo ABMT, 50% of the probes appeared at the neutral position and 50% at the sad position.</description>
