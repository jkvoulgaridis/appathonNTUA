      Improving Medication Adherence with Telehealthcare Medication Therapy Management to Change
      Health Outcomes in Adolescents and Young Adults with Asthma (MATCH) is a multi-center,
      randomized parallel group study targeted to an at-risk population of Adolescents and Young
      Adults (AYA) with uncontrolled asthma who have poor adherence with prescribed Inhaled
      corticosteroid (ICS) therapy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study evaluates a Medication Therapy Management (MTM) video telehealthcare intervention
      to address poor medication adherence. In addition, it employs a novel method to track and
      provide feedback to participants on adherence by using Propeller Sensors. 300 adolescents and
      young adults will be randomized to Medication Therapy Management (MTM) video telehealthcare
      plus electronic adherence self-management [MTM EAM] or electronic adherence self-management
      alone (EAM). The primary outcome is the time to first exacerbation event defined as a
      worsening of asthma requiring the use of systemic corticosteroids for at least 3 days,
      emergency department visit, or hospitalization.

An exacerbation event is defined as a worsening of asthma requiring the use of systemic corticosteroids for at least 3 days, or asthma-specific emergency department visit with treatment with systemic corticosteroids, or asthma-specific hospitalization, or death (all cause and asthma exacerbation).</description>

    <description>MTM is an individualized approach to &quot;optimize medication use for improved patient outcomes&quot; and is designed to &quot;empower patients to take an active role in managing patients' medications&quot; thus, providing a favorable strategy for addressing adherence issues. Five core elements define MTM: complete medication therapy review (CMR), creation of a personal medication list (PML), development of a medication action plan (MAP), intervention and/or referral for drug therapy problems, and documentation and follow-up</description>
