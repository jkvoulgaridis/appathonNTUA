  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of abbreviated 3-day anticoagulation
      with dabigatran etexilate before cardioversion guided by trans-oesophageal echocardiography
      in comparison with conventional 3- week course of dabigatran etexilate before cardioversion

      Current guidelines recommend for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF)
      lasting more than 48 h designated for cardioversion standard approach with anticoagulation
      for a minimum 3 weeks before anticoagulation. The alternative is abbreviated anticoagulation
      in case of using trans-oesophageal echocardiography (TEE)-guided approach with quick
      cardioversion if no thrombus or high-grade spontaneous echo contrast is seen. There is
      currently no data on the direct comparison of efficacy and safety of conventional and
      abbreviated courses of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOAC) before
      cardioversion in AF.

      The RE-SOUND study is prospective open label study with blinded outcome evaluation (PROBE
      design) multicenter active control trial comparing efficacy of 3-day abbreviated TEE-guided
      and conventional 3-week courses of NOAC dabigatran etexilate before cardioversion in adult
      patients with AF lasting more than 48 h
