    <textblock>
      HBV‐related acute‐on‐chronic liver failure (HBV‐ACLF) deteriorates rapidly with a high
      short-term mortality. Early identification and accurate prognostic prediction was critical to
      improve survival rate. This study was sought to determine the liver volumetry as predictor
      for short-term mortality in HBV-ACLF and develop a simpler prognostic model based on liver
      morphology. Liver volumetry were determined from CT at admission. Univariate and multivariate
      logistic regression were used to identify the optimum prognostic indicators and develop
      prognostic model. Additionally, receiver operating characteristic curves were analyzed to
      evaluate the predictive ability of the model.

      HBV‐ACLF deteriorates rapidly with a high short-term mortality and early identification and
      accurate prognostic prediction may be the key to make clinical decision and improve survival
      rate. Liver volume, non-invasively reflects the balance of structural collapse with hepatic
      regeneration, predicting the prognosis of liver diseases. However, there is no idea whether
      the liver volume is an indicator to predict the mortality of HBV-ACLF patients. The present
      study evaluated the difference of liver volume between 28-day survival group and
      non-survivals and developed a new prognostic model based on liver volume . This study
      highlighted the significance of liver morphology in predicting the outcome of HBV-ACLF for
      the first time. The prognostic model was non-invasive and easy to use with a higher
      prediction ability.

        All the patients were diagnosed with hepatitis B virus‐related acute‐on‐chronic liver
        failure who met with the inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria. Two cohorts of subjects
        were enrolled in two separate investigations. In the modeling cohort, subjects were
        identified retrospectively from patients with acute exacerbation of chronic hepatitis B
        manifesting as hepatic encephalopathy (HE), upper gastrointestinal bleeding, ascites, acute
        jaundice and coagulopathy, referred from January 1, 2015 to December 31,2018. In the
        validation cohort, subjects were perspectively identified for validating the model.
