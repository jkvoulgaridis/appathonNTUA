    <textblock>
      enroll patients with histologically confirmed high-grade gliomas to evaluate the ability of
      regadenoson to transiently disrupt a relatively intact blood-brain barrier (BBB). determine
      the best dose of regadenoson to disrupt the BBB and allow for enhanced penetration of
      gadolinium during MRI.
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      To determine if there is a dose of regadenoson, in the range shown to be safe for clinical
      administration, that can increase gadolinium Ktrans by more than 10 times the values reported
      in the literature within normal-appearing brain parenchyma with a previously documented
      intact blood-brain barrier in patients with high grade gliomas.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE To determine if there is a dose of regadenoson, in the range shown to be
      safe for clinical administration, that can substantially alter the normalized, contrast
      enhanced MRI signal intensity in normal-appearing tissues and in: A) Brain adjacent to tumor
      (i.e. T2 hyperintense, but without contrast enhancement before regadenoson) and B) Contrast
      enhancing tumor (with contrast enhancement before regadenoson).

      Part I Treatment Plan

      Part I of the protocol is designed to identify the best regadenoson dose(s) to transiently
      disrupt the blood-brain barrier as measured by DCE-MRI and contrast enhancement on
      T1-weighted images corresponding to an increase in the accumulation of MRI contrast
      (gadolinium) into normal appearing brain contralateral to the brain tumor.

      Patients who are at low risk of having complications with a standard regadenoson cardiac
      stress test (young with no known cardiac disease) and who have had stable MRI scans for at
      least 2 months prior to enrollment will be asked to undergo a research MRI within two weeks
      after their most recent previous MRI.

      Part II Treatment Plan

      Part II will be initiated if the first portion of the study identifies one or more doses of
      regadenoson that meets the desired endpoint of a Ktrans value &gt;0.04 min-1 within
      contralateral normal-appearing brain following regadenoson administration. Part II patients
      will undergo more extensive imaging prior to regadenoson administration to confirm that
      regadenoson has a significant effect on the BBB using a more comprehensive imaging approach.

      Five additional patients who are at low risk to have complications of a standard chemical
      cardiac stress test (young with no known significant cardiac disease) will be sequentially
      enrolled at each regadenoson dose meeting the desired endpoint in Part I. In these cohorts,
      the full research imaging protocol will be utilized in both the pre- and post-regadenoson MRI
      scans which will allow a direct comparison of all imaging parameters in both the
      pre-regadenoson and post-regadenoson settings to be directly compared.
