    <textblock>
      This study intends to explore the therapeutic effects of the development of negative
      attention bias modifaction and positive attention bias on depressive symptoms and redundancy
      through two different attention training methods: (1) neutral attention training (when
      neutral and sad stimuli are presented simultaneously, attention is always directed towards
      neutral stimuli to correct negative attention bias) and (2) positive attention training (when
      neutral and positive stimuli are presented simultaneously, attention is always directed
      towards positive stimuli to develop positive attention bias).

      Attention Bias Modification Training was a modified dot-probe task. In the neutral attention
      bias, 90% of the targets in the training group appear in the neutral word position and 10% of
      the targets appear in the negative word position, while 50% of the targets in the placebo
      group appear in the neutral word position and 50% of the targets appear in the negative word
      position. In the positive attention bias, 90% of the targets in the training group appear in
      the positive word position and 10% of the targets appear in the neutral word position, while
      90% of the targets in the placebo group appear in the neutral word position and 10% of the
      targets appear in the positive word position. The investigators assess attention bias scores,
      depressive symptoms, trait anxiety, rumination and self-report attention control ability at
      1-week, 2-week, 4-week, 7-week, 3-month, 4-month, 5-month, 6-month and 12-month follow-ups
      after training.
