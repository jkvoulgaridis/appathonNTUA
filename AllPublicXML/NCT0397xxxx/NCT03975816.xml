    <textblock>
      Epidural analgesia is considered an effective and safe method for obstetric pain control.
      Currently, self-assessment pain scales remain to be the gold standard in labor pain
      evaluation after the administration of epidural analgesia. However, individual patient
      susceptibility to pain perception makes difficulties for the clinicians to assess the
      effectiveness of painless labor precisely. The aim of this study is to evaluate the validity
      of ANI in obstetric pain monitoring during epidural analgesia.

      Epidural analgesia is considered an effective and safe method for obstetric pain control.
      Currently, self-assessment pain scales remain to be the gold standard in labor pain
      evaluation after the administration of epidural analgesia. However, individual patient
      susceptibility to pain perception makes difficulties for the clinicians to assess the
      effectiveness of painless labor precisely. Without a convincing objective tool for obstetric
      pain evaluation during epidural analgesia, the clinicians are hard to adjust adequate
      epidural drug dosage. Establishing an objective pain index would help the clinicians to have
      a better pain management during labor.

      In 2012, M. Le Guen et al. demonstrated a linear relationship between visual analogical pain
      scores(VAS) and Analgesia Nociception Index (ANI) values during labor. Their efforts started
      the application of ANI in obstetric pain monitoring. However, the reliability of ANI in
      obstetric pain monitoring under epidural analgesia have not yet been verified. The aim of
      this study is to evaluate the validity of ANI in obstetric pain monitoring during epidural
      analgesia.

    <measure>The correlation of subjective pain measurement by the VAS score and objective pain measurement by the ANI(Analgesia Nociception Index) score</measure>
    <time_frame>90 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The VAS(visual analog scale) score is a subjective measure for pain. Scores are recorded by making a handwritten mark by the patient on a 10-cm line that represents a continuum between &quot;no pain&quot; and &quot;worst pain.&quot; The score will be transferred to a 0-100 index by divided 10 with the distance from the starting point to the written mark (in centimeter) and multiplied by 100. The ANI (Analgesia Nociception Index) score is a 0-100 index derived from heart rate variability which was applied as an objective pain measurement. The larger the index indicated less pain. The correlation of the VAS score and the ANI score will be analyzed to verified the strength of the ANI score in evaluating labor pain during epidural analgesia.</description>

    <measure>The correlation of uterine contraction strength measured by cardiotocography and the ANI (Analgesia Nociception Index) score</measure>
    <time_frame>90 Minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Uterine contraction strength was measured by external cardiotocography with a scare from 0-100.The ANI (Analgesia Nociception Index) score is a 0-100 index derived from heart rate variability which was applied as an objective pain measurement. The larger the index indicated less pain. The correlation of the uterine contraction strength and the ANI score will be analyzed to verified if the ANI score changing with related to uterine contraction.</description>
