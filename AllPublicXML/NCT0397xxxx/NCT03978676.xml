    <textblock>
      Secondary mitral insufficiency is a common complication of heart failure, aggravating
      symptoms and prognosis, and may be responsible for worsening dyspnea, pulmonary edema, and
      excess mortality. It is essentially a ventricular rather than a valvular disease, whose
      origin may be ischemic or not. It is induced by a geometrical and contractile modification of
      the left ventricle which causes an imbalance between the tensile and the closing forces of
      the mitral valve thus causing a defect of coaptation and the increase of the surface between
      the mitral leaves and the ring in systole (tenting). Dynamic mitral insufficiency is defined
      by changes in the degree of severity of regurgitation as a function of hemodynamic
      conditions.

      During exercise, the course of mitral insufficiency is variable and is not predicted by the
      degree of regurgitation at rest. The worsening of the leak is also well correlated with the
      onset of dyspnea on exertion in patients with left Ventricular Ejection Fraction heart
      failure (LVEF reduced). Nevertheless, there is little data available in the literature on the
      factors predisposing to the development of stress-related mitral insufficiency, as well as
      its clinical and echocardiographic impact in the cardiac insufficiency patient, particularly
      in the case of preserved LVEF (6.7%).

      The identification of echocardiographic data at rest to predict and anticipate the behavior
      of mitral insufficiency in the effort (aggravation or stability / disappearance), would allow
      a simplified evaluation and a better management in this population of patients for which the
      evaluation in echography of effort can be technically complex and limited (difficulty of
      quantification of the mitral leak, time of effort sometimes too short ...).
