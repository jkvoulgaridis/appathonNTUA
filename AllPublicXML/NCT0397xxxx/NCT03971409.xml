      This phase II trial studies how well avelumab in combination with binimetinib, utomilumab, or
      anti-OX40 antibody PF-04518600 works in treating patients with triple negative breast cancer
      that is stage IV or is not able to be removed by surgery (unresectable) and has come back
      (recurrent). Immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors like avelumab require activation of the
      patients immune system.

      This trial includes a two week induction or lead-in of medications that can stimulate the
      immune system. It is our hope that this induction will improve the response to immunotherapy
      with avelumab. Patients on this trial will receive two weeks of treatment with one of three
      treatments to stimulate the bodies immune system, including the monoclonal antibodies,
      utomilumab, and the anti-OX40 antibody PF-04518600 which may help the body's immune system
      attack the cancer, and could interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.
      The third medication is called binimetinib , which may stop the growth of tumor cells by
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth, and may help activate the immune system.
      It is not yet known whether giving avelumab in combination with binimetinib, utomilumab, or
      anti-OX40 antibody PF-04518600 will work better in treating patients with triple negative
      breast cancer

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 arms.

      Arm I: Patients receive binimetinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for a lead-in period of 15
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive
      binimetinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28 and avelumab intravenously (IV) over
      60 minutes every 2 weeks. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity

      Arm II: Patients receive anti-OX40 antibody PF-04518600 IV over 60 minutes for a for lead-in
      period of 15 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients
      then receive anti-OX40 antibody PF-04518600 IV over 60 minutes and avelumab IV over 60
      minutes every 2 weeks. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Arm III: Patients receive utomilumab IV over 60 minutes for a lead-in period of 15 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive utomilumab
      IV over 60 minutes every 4 weeks and avelumab IV over 60 minutes every 2 weeks. Cycles repeat
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients have a follow-up at 30 days after treatment
      ends and then every 6 months for a minimum of one year following start of study therapy or
      until the study is stopped.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Anti-tumor effect of avelumab in combination with different targeted agents explored in
      the sub-protocols of the trial.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Additional anti-tumor effects. II. Safety and tolerability of avelumab in combination with
      different targeted agents explored in the sub-protocols of the trial.

      III. Patient reported outcomes (PRO) between baseline and cycle 3 day 1 across arms.

      IV. Longitudinal trends in PRO outcomes across treatment arms. V. Differences in PRO outcomes
      for patients who respond compared to those who do not respond.

      CORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the therapeutic predictive role of the following on clinical outcome:

      I a. Programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression and immune 'hot-spots'. I b. Tumor
      infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL)s, and cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8) and cluster of
      differentiation 4 (CD4) positivity in TIL.

      I c. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A (Major Histocompatibility complex class 1 (MHC-I)) and
      Human Leukocyte Antigen - DR isotype (HLA-DR) (Major Histocompatibility complex class 2
      (MHC-II)), FoxP3, OX40 and OX40L, Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), and myelocytomatosis
      oncogene (MYC) expression.

      I d. Number/levels of expressed predicted class I and class II neoantigens, central memory
      T-cells and T-cells.

      I e. Expression of effector/regulatory immune gene, innate Programmed cell death protein 1
      (PD-1) resistance signature (IPRES), and B cell, T cell, and/or macrophage signatures.

      I f. Basal or claudin-low molecular subtypes. I g. T cell receptor (TCR) clonality in the
      tumor and peripheral blood. I h. Genomic mutational burden. I i. PD-L1 positivity in
      circulating tumor cells (CTCs). I j. Soluble B7-H1 (sB7-H1) levels.

      II. To determine if circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (ctDNA) results will
      discriminate pseudo-progression from true progression.

      III. To determine if certain genomic alterations detected in tumor tissue or ctDNA are
      potentially associated with resistance to the tested drug combinations.
