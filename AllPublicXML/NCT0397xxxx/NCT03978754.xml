  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is a common malignant disease that threatens the health of women.As a serious
      chronic condition from breast cancer treatment, lymphedema, is caused by chronic accumulation
      of lymph fluid in the interstitial spaces of the affected limb or surrounding areas.Reported
      prevalence of lymphedema following treatment for breast cancer varies, ranging from 7-45% One
      reason for the wide variation in the reported incidence of lymphedema is the different
      measurement techniques used and the absence of an agreed diagnostic criteria. Nowadays, the
      common method include limb circumference measurement、limb volume measurement、bioimpedance
      spectroscopy (BIS) and self-report.Each of these methods has advantages and disadvantages .
      As a new method for detecting lymphedema ，some study have shown indocyanine
      green（ICG）lymphography can have a certain value for the detection of subclinical edema。Early
      detection demonstrate the greatest promise of reducing the incidence of late-stage lymphedema
      in breast cancer patients undergoing surgery.The aim of this study was therefore to examine
      the relationships between the most commonly used measures of lymphedema and the respective
      reliability of each of these tools. And if it's possible ,investigators are going to test
      which method is more sensitive for the diagnosis of clinical and subclinical lymphedema as
      well as the value of indocyanine green（ICG）in detecting sub-clinical lymphedema.
