  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the study is to estimate the relative bioavailability and palatability
      of 2 new crizotinib formulations to the commercially available crizotinib formulated capsule
      at a 250 mg dose administered under fasted conditions in adult healthy participants.
      Additionally, this study aims to assess the safety and tolerability of crizotinib 250 mg
      single dose in 4 formulations when given fasted, with high fat meal, or with a proton pump
      inhibitor in healthy participants. Finally, this study will explore the effect of food or
      proton pump inhibitor on the pharmacokinetics of the 2 new crizotinib formulations.

      We hypothesize 1 of the 2 new crizotinib formulations will have improved relative
      bioavailability and palatability than the formulated capsule under fasted or fed conditions
      with or without a proton pump inhibitor.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female participants who are overtly healthy as determined by medical
             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests.

          -  Participants who are willing and able to comply with all scheduled visits, treatment
             plan, laboratory tests, lifestyle considerations, and other study procedures.

          -  Body mass index (BMI) of 17.5 to 30.5 kg/m2; and a total body weight &gt;50 kg (110 lb).

          -  Capable of giving signed informed consent as described in Appendix 1, which includes
             compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the informed consent
             document (ICD) and in this protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurological, or
             allergic disease (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic,
             seasonal allergies at the time of dosing).

          -  Any condition possibly affecting drug absorption (eg, gastrectomy, gastric or
             intestinal bypass surgery, cholecystectomy).

          -  Any condition possibly affecting the ability to taste (eg, dysgeusia, respiratory
             infection).

          -  History of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C;
             positive testing for HIV, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B core
             antibody (HBcAb), or hepatitis C antibody (HCVAb). Hepatitis B vaccination is allowed.

          -  Other acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition including recent (within the
             past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior or laboratory test abnormality that
             may increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product
             administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the
             judgment of the investigator, would make the participant inappropriate for entry into
             this study.

          -  Use of prescription or nonprescription drugs and dietary supplements within 7 days or
             5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of crizotinib.

          -  Participants with history of known sensitivity to esomeprazole or substituted
             benzimidazoles.

          -  Previous administration with an investigational product within 30 days or 5 half-lives
             preceding the first dose of crizotinib (whichever is longer).

          -  A positive urine drug test or cotinine test.

          -  Screening supine blood pressure (BP) ≥140 mm Hg (systolic) or ≥90 mm Hg (diastolic),
             following at least 5 minutes of supine rest. If BP is ≥140 mm Hg (systolic) or ≥90 mm
             Hg (diastolic), the BP should be repeated 2 more times and the average of the 3 BP
             values should be used to determine the participant's eligibility.

          -  Baseline 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) that demonstrates clinically relevant
             abnormalities that may affect participant safety or interpretation of study results
             (eg, QT interval corrected using the Fridericia's method [QTcF] &gt;450 msec, complete
             left bundle branch block [LBBB], signs of an acute or indeterminate-age myocardial
             infarction, ST-T interval changes suggestive of myocardial ischemia, second- or
             third-degree atrioventricular [AV] block, or serious bradyarrhythmias or
             tachyarrhythmias). If QTcF exceeds 450 msec, or the QRS complex exceeds 120 msec, the
             ECG should be repeated 2 more times and the average of the 3 QTcF or QRS complex
             values should be used to determine the participant's eligibility. Computer-interpreted
             ECGs should be overread by a physician experienced in reading ECGs before excluding
             participants.

          -  Participants with ANY of the following abnormalities in clinical laboratory tests at
             screening, as assessed by the study-specific laboratory and confirmed by a single
             repeat test, if deemed necessary: Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or ALT level ≥1.5 ×
             upper limit of normal (ULN); Total bilirubin (TBili) level ≥1.5 × ULN; participants
             with a history of Gilbert's syndrome may have direct bilirubin measured and would be
             eligible for this study provided the direct bilirubin level is ≤ ULN; Estimated
             glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt;60 ml/min/1.73 m2 (See Appendix 10.2 for
             calculation method).

          -  Male participants who are unwilling or unable to comply with the contraception
             requirement listed in Section 10.4.1.

          -  History of alcohol abuse or binge drinking and/or any other illicit drug use or
             dependence within 6 months of Screening. Binge drinking is defined as a pattern of 5
             (male) and 4 (female) or more alcoholic drinks in about 2 hours. As a general rule,
             alcohol intake should not exceed 14 units per week (1 unit = 8 ounces (240 mL) beer,

             1 ounce (30 mL) of 40% spirit or 3 ounces (90 mL) of wine).

          -  Blood donation (excluding plasma donations) of approximately 1 pint (500 mL) or more
             within 60 days prior to dosing.

          -  History of sensitivity to heparin or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.

          -  Participants who currently smoke.

          -  Unwilling or unable to comply with the criteria in the Lifestyle Considerations
             section of this protocol.

          -  Investigator site staff members directly involved in the conduct of the study and
             their family members, site staff members otherwise supervised by the investigator, or
             Pfizer employees, including their family members, directly involved in the conduct of
             the study.
