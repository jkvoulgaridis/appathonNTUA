  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infantile brain plasticity is still a poorly known phenomenon. However, neuropsychological
      disorders and behavioral deficits are common disorders that can have serious consequences for
      school enrollment, family and social adjustment, as well as repercussions on future adult
      lives.

      In addition, generally very premature infants (TGP) have identifiable executive function
      disorders (EF), particularly those involving attentional processes such as working memory
      (WM).

      The main objective of the study is to evaluate the effects of cognitive remediation (CR)
      strategies on the brain plasticity of the cortical areas involved in the management of WM in
      school-aged TGP children (8 years).

      The secondary objective of the study is to evaluate the action of CR on the development of
      cortical areas concerned

      It is a monocentric, prospective and comparative study of the exposed type (to cognitive
      remediation) - unexposed. Recruitment and data collection are carried out prospectively, in
      connection with the original study (EPIREMED). Included patients will be explored by Magnetic
      Resonance Imaging (MRI) 3 resting state Tesla.

      The main hypothesis is that CR strategies have a beneficial effect on the cognitive
      processing of visual-spatial executive functions, but also on the cortical areas involved in
      brain plasticity in general (indirect benefits); not to mention the psychological benefits ad
      hoc to such studies (self-esteem, increased concentration, new stress management strategies
      put in place).

      The ultimate objective of this study is to better understand the mechanisms of cerebral
      plasticity concerning higher executive functions. Moreover, this study should make it
      possible to confirm the improvement of the overall fate of the child by better understanding
      the neuropsychological and anatomical origins of his disorders. Interventions taking into
      account the environment of the very premature baby are necessary because it is closely linked
      to the developmental future.
