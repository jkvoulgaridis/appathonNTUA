      Doxil or Doxorubicin to be administered was administered in a dose of 50 mg/m2 as infusion
      over 15 minutes. Blood samples to be obtained at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours

      Comparison of AUC in a single dose of Doxorubicin vs single dose of Doxil [ Time Frame: 0, 1,
      2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours. Cycle is defined as 28 days) The primary objective of
      this study is to determine the pharmacokinetic equivalence of Doxorubicin and Doxil as a
      single dose in patients with carcinomas, lymphomas and leukemia's. The outcome measure will
      be determined by analyzing the concentration from each patient at pre-specified time points
      and calculating Area under the curve (AUC) and Peak Plasma Concentration (C max)to determine
      % variability between doxorubicin and Doxil within each patient.
