  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia is a chronic disease consisting of widespread pain, fatigue, sleep disturbances,
      and cognitive impairments, among other symptoms, which affect daily physical activity.

      The regular physical exercise improves the functional, physiological, and behavioral
      components of physical fitness. Dance therapy seems to increase motivation and adherence to
      therapy, and can provide a real alternative to conventional exercise

      The experimental group will receive a dance program treatment .

      The control group will receive an educational intervention.

    <measure>Timed Up and Go (TUG)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change from de baseline in functional mobility and predict risk of falls. The single-task subscale consists of a measurement of the time in seconds for the patient to rise from sitting in a standard arm chair, walk 3 meters, turn, walk back to the chair, and sit down. The dual task subscale adds a cognitive task (TUGCognitive) or a manual task (TUGManual) to the simple task.</description>
