  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The cost of medical care in the United States far exceeds that of all other advanced
      economies and continues to accelerate at a rate unacceptable to our society, due primarily to
      the high costs of new imaging technologies and novel drugs (1). Cardiac positron emission
      tomography (PET) imaging is a powerful new modality for the non-invasive detection of
      provocable coronary ischemia in patients with low to intermediate-risk chest pain or its
      equivalent. Intermountain Medical Center (IMC) is performing approximately 6000 clinical
      cardiac PET scans annually. However, cardiac PET scans are expensive (i.e., billed at
      &gt;$5,000/scan, average receivable revenue $1500-$2000/scan). Coronary artery calcium (CAC) is
      a sensitive marker of coronary atherosclerosis. A CAC scan (CACS), performed by multislice
      computed tomography (CT), is a relatively inexpensive (~$70-$150/scan), low-radiation dose
      test that marks the presence of coronary atherosclerotic plaque. The absence of CAC has been
      shown to be associated with very low coronary risk. ACCURATE will test whether a CAC-first
      strategy (i.e., risk stratification, when CAC ≤ 1, to medical management or to cardiac PET
      stress testing), performed routinely in symptomatic patients presenting for evaluation of
      possible coronary artery disease (CAD) prior to the cardiac PET stress test, can be used as a
      gatekeeper for progression to the expensive rubidium-PET stress (regadenoson) perfusion scan
      and be a major cost-saver without adversely affecting patient care or outcomes. Routinely,
      qualifying patients undergo CACS when they present for evaluation of possible but unknown CAD
      status and are referred for cardiac PET stress testing. In ACCURATE, those with CACS≤1 will
      then be consented and randomized to either a cardiac PET stress test strategy or a
      non-PET-driven medical care strategy. Subjects randomized to the cardiac PET stress test
      strategy will receive appropriate subsequent care depending on the outcome of the cardiac PET
      scan (i.e., depending on whether ischemia is present or not). Subjects randomized to the
      CAC-only arm will receive appropriate non-PET driven medical clinical management and
      follow-up. All participating subjects' electronic medical records will be reviewed
      indefinitely for clinical outcomes. Initial outcomes will be reported at 1-year, 2-years, and
      5-years, with future analyses to be determined by the study investigators.

      The objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that PET stress test strategy will
      results in a decreasing in major adverse cardiac endpoint without exceeding $100,000 per
      quality-adjusted life year compared to a CAC-first strategy for screening suspected/possible
      coronary artery disease.

    <description>The costs of routine cardiac PET stress test strategy will be less than &lt;$100,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) compared to CAC-first strategy. Cost-effectiveness, categorized by the American Heart Association, will be defined as achieving at least fair cost effectiveness, i.e., as achieving &lt;$100,000/QALY, which is widely accepted as a &quot;willingness-to-pay&quot; threshold, with &lt;$50,000/QALY defined as good cost-effectiveness.</description>
