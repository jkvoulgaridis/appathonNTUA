  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most common cancer pathology among women worldwide and represents a
      complex psychological challenge for those affected. Diagnosis and subsequent treatments can
      have a significant impact not only on the physical well-being of people, but also on their
      psychological well-being. Tumor-related distress is described as an &quot;unpleasant emotional
      multifactorial experience of a psychological, social and / or spiritual nature that can
      interfere with the ability to effectively cope with cancer, physical symptoms and treatment&quot;
      from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network.Studies have shown that from one third to half
      of breast cancer patients can experience psychological distress. The psychological distress,
      understood as symptoms of anxiety, depression and stress, is related to a lower quality of
      life, a lower compliance related to a lower efficacy of the treatments, a higher mortality
      and a higher risk of suicide, so much so that this discomfort it is recognized as the sixth
      vital sign in cancer treatment. Both the diagnosis of cancer and the treatments related to
      the disease, can lead to the alternation of depressive phases and in some cases even to the
      presence of major depression: it is estimated that the levels of depression reach thresholds
      that oscillate between 5 and 25% between women suffering from breast cancer.

      In reference to what are the interventions aimed at reducing depressive symptomatology in
      patients with breast cancer, in this study we refer in particular to 2 treatments, of which
      several studies attest to their effectiveness: interventions based on Mindfulness (MBI) and
      interventions based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).

      Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is an empirically supported treatment for depression.
      Numerous studies have shown that CBT is both effective in treating acute depression and
      preventing subsequent relapses and relapses after the end of active treatment.

      MBI-based interventions have been widely disseminated both at the clinical and research level
      as short, cost-effective interventions.

      Several systematic reviews have shown the effectiveness of MBIs in improving anxiety and
      depressive symptoms, sleep, fatigue, disease adaptation and stress reduction, with coping and
      well-being improved in patients with chronic illnesses including also the oncological
      pathologies. In particular, a meta-analysis of studies conducted on women with breast cancer
      confirmed the effectiveness of MBI in reducing symptoms of anxiety, depression and stress,
      suggesting the importance of these treatments in improving the mental health of these women.
      In addition, studies have shown that the improvements achieved are stable even at long-term
      follow-up.

    <description>The MBI used in this study is called body-affective mindfulness (BAM); BAM is based on:
(1) awareness practices such as body scan, breath meditation, walking meditation and yoga exercises; (2) mindfulness in relationship practices such as loving kindness, enriching listening to nature and persons and self-compassion; (3) sensorimotor psychotherapy Sensorimotor psychotherapy emphasizes the use of somatic resources to attain and sustain a mindful disposition and integrates the concept of a stress response with the concept of a &quot;window of tolerance&quot; in order to maximize the clinical utility of the intervention and tailor it to breast cancer patients.</description>
