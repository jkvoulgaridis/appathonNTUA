    <description>The investigational agent in this protocol is NeoTCR P1, an autologous adoptive T cell therapy (ACT) for patients with solid cancer. NeoTCR P1 is composed of apheresis derived CD8 and CD4 T cells that are precision genome engineered to express one autologous TCR of native sequence that targets a neoepitope (neoE) presented by human leukocyte antigen (HLA) receptors exclusively on the surface of that patient's tumor cells and not on other cells in the body.</description>
