  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase I/II clinical trial will be integrated and conducted. In phase I clinical trial,
      subjects with moderate to severe glabellar lines at maximum frown are enrolled and safety is
      assessed after 12 weeks of administration of 20U of ATGC-100. In phase II clinical trial,
      subjects with moderate to severe glabellar lines at maximum frown are enrolled, and efficacy
      and safety are assessed by comparing with Botox (Allergan).
