  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, a newly developed index, the Nociceptive Level (NOL) index, was validated and
      showed superiority over heart rate and blood pressure for recognition and grading of intense
      and mild nociceptive stimuli during surgery under general anesthesia.

      We hypothesize that compared with standard management, NOL-guided anesthesia will lead to
      reduced postoperative pain scores, and during anesthesia, to increased hemodynamic stability.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Uncontrolled postoperative pain may result in significant clinical, psychological, and
      socioeconomics consequences. Not only does inadequate pain management following surgery
      result in increased morbidity and mortality but it also may delay recovery, result in
      unanticipated readmissions, decrease patient satisfaction, and lead to chronic persistent
      postsurgical pain. Pain is multifactorial in nature and understanding both the complexity of
      pain and its side effects is imperative to achieve a successful surgical outcome.

      Nociception/analgesia are currently assessed by monitoring changes in heart rate (HR), blood
      pressure (BP), and other indirect parameters which are not sensitive or specific to
      nociception. As a result, the patient may be given insufficient analgesia which can promote
      postoperative pain, or excessive analgesia which can result in overdosing and related
      complications.
