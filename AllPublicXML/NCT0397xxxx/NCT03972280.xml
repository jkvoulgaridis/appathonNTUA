  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study CSL324_1002 will investigate the safety and pharmacokinetics of repeat doses of CSL324
      in subjects with hidradenitis suppurativa and palmoplantar pustulosis. CSL324 is a novel,
      recombinant therapy that may treat diseases caused by increased numbers of neutrophils at
      sites of inflammation.
