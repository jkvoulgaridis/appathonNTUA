      To address the objectives, a retrospective cohort design will be employed to evaluate patient
      characteristics, treatment patterns, medication effectiveness, and health care cost and
      utilization in RA patients newly initiating tofacitinib in combination with oral methotrexate

    <description>The mean Quan-Charlson Comorbidity Score during the Pre-Index Period is reported. Quan-Charlson Comorbidity Score predicts the probability of death within one year in participants and was based on the presence of any diagnosis codes on medical claims at any time during the 12-month pre-index period, based on the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) diagnosis codes. Total score ranges from 0 to 9.0. A score of zero indicates that no comorbidities were found. The higher the score, the more likely the predicted outcome could result in mortality or higher healthcare resource utilization.</description>

The bDMARD could have been any TNFi, any non-TNFi, adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, golimumab, infliximab, anakinra, abatacept, tocilizumab or rituximab. Variable-length pre-index period defined as the period from the participant's first date of enrollment in the database to the day before the index date. The date of enrollment had to be at least 1 year prior to the index date and depending on the participant could have been as much as maximum of 5.2 years.

        <title>Mean Claims Based Index of RA Severity (CIRAS) Score During Pre-Index Period</title>
        <description>The mean of the CIRAS score during pre-index period is reported. The CIRAS is based on claims at any time during the 12-month pre-index period, used to measure RA disease severity using 9 measures (age at index, gender, inflammatory marker test ordered, rehabilitation visit, rheumatoid factor test, Felty's syndrome, number of platelet counts ordered, number of chemistry panels ordered, rheumatologist visit). Value of all 9 measure was used to derive the overall CIRAS score which ranges from 0-7.9 with higher value indicating greater severity of RA.</description>

          <description>Mean Disease Duration of RA based upon the variable length pre-index period is reported. Disease duration (in days) defined as the number of days from the earliest claim with a diagnosis of RA in the variable length pre-index period until the index date. Variable-length pre-index period defined as the period from the participant's first date of enrollment in the database to the day before the index date. The date of enrollment had to be at least 1 year prior to the index date and depending on the participant could have been as much as maximum of 5.2 years. The index date was the date of the first claim for tofacitinib made by participants to their insurance provider during identification period of 3 years.</description>

MPR was calculated as the total days supply of MTX between the first and including the last prescription/administration divided by the time between the first through and including last biologic prescription/administration days supply.</description>
          <population>Analysis was performed on all participants included in the study. Analysis was performed on “MTX persistent” participants only and the data for this OM was not planned to be collected and analyzed for &quot;MTX Discontinued&quot; and &quot;MTX Interrupted&quot;.</population>

        <title>Mean Total RA Related Monthly Health Care Cost</title>
        <description>Mean total monthly health care cost due to RA is reported. RA related refers to cost spent by participants due to RA on health care services. This is calculated as the total of treatment cost (cost of tofacitinib, biologic DMARDs, NB-DMARDs and administration of IV biologics) and medical cost (ambulatory cost, emergency department visits cost, inpatient admission cost, home health care cost, urgent care cost and other medical services cost). RA related monthly health care cost is reported for every month from 12 months duration before index date (pre-index period) to 12 months duration post index date (post index period). Index date is defined as the date of first claim for tofacitinib made by participants to their insurance provider during identification period of 3 years.</description>
