  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tinnitus is the perception of a sound in the absence of an audible source. Currently up to
      15% of the general population suffers chronically from tinnitus. The most severe degree of
      tinnitus Ã­s experienced by 2.4% of the population and is associated with insomnia,
      depression; anxiety and even suicide. Up to date there is no effective standard therapy.
      Current therapies mostly focus on treating the distress caused by tinnitus instead of
      reducing the actual phantom sound. Nevertheless, many patients do not benefit from the
      current approaches and become severe and chronic tinnitus sufferers. In these patients
      neuromodulation-based treatments can be a promising option. Tinnitus perception is associated
      with many complex changes in several different brain structures. The general accepted
      hypothesis is that neuronal changes occur in both auditory and non-auditory brain structures,
      most often as a compensating mechanism on reduced input from the auditory nerve caused by
      cochlear hair cell damage. These central neuronal changes include an increase in spontaneous
      firing rate, synchronized activity, bursting activity and tonotopic reorganization. In
      high-frequency deep brain stimulation (DBS) a reversible lesion-like effect is mimicked. From
      findings in Parkinson's disease patients who also had tinnitus and were treated with DBS, it
      is known that stimulation can alter or even completely diminish perception of tinnitus. It
      can be expected that modulation of specific structures within the complex tinnitus pathways
      can disrupt pathological neuronal activity and thereby alter tinnitus perception or distress
      caused by this phantom sensation. The investigators found in animal studies that DBS in the
      central auditory pathway can indeed significantly decrease tinnitus-like behavior. In a
      questionnaire study the investigators found that around one-fifth of the patients would be
      reasonably willing to accept invasive treatments and one-fifth would be fully willing to
      undergo invasive treatment like DBS. Based on preclinical studies and human case studies, the
      investigators expect that DBS of the central auditory pathway will inhibit tinnitus
      perception and distress caused by this phantom sensation. Based on studies performed within
      Maastricht University Medical Center (MUMC), the investigators selected the medial geniculate
      body of the thalamus (MGB) as the most potential target to treat tinnitus with DBS.

             treatments (hearing aids, cognitive treatments) and is thoroughly evaluated by the
             multidisciplinary tinnitus team in MUMC. Thus patients do not respond to both of the
             following treatments (i.e. TQ is still â¥ 47):

          -  Hearing aids (except if hearing is normal)

          -  Evidence-based cognitive treatment in Hoensbroek (Cima et al., 2012) or a similar
             version of this treatment in the MUMC

          -  Minimum age 18 years, maximum age 69 years.

          -  Experiencing tinnitus which is:

          -  Not pulsatile

          -  Unilateral or bilateral

          -  Severe tinnitus (based on the TQ score â¥ 47)

          -  Chronic and stable (present &gt; 2 years and stable &gt; 1 year).

          -  Bilateral hearing of high tone Fletcher Index &lt; 60 dB

          -  Willingness to participate in this study (informed consent)

          -  Anatomic cause of tinnitus (e.g. vestibular schwannoma, tumour, middle-ear pathology)

          -  DSM-V psychiatric disorders, other than depression or anxiety disorder (such as
             bipolar disorder, dementia, addiction, personality disorders); diagnosed by a
             psychiatrist. A psychiatrist will screen the patients for this matter.

          -  Depression or anxiety disorder which was already present before tinnitus. A
             psychiatrist will screen the patients for this matter.

          -  Cognitive impairment (assessed with standard 'cognitive functioning battery test'
             questionnaires) or coping problems (CISS-21)

          -  Active ear diseases that needs further attention according to research team

          -  Pregnancy or breast-feeding

          -  Active suicide thoughts or attempts

          -  Underlying malignancies, whenever life expectancy is lower than 2 years

          -  Other implantable electronic devices that potentially could interfere with DBS, e.g.
             cochlear implants, auditory brainstem implants or cortical implants
