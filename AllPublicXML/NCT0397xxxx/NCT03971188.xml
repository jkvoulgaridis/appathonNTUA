  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Carpometacarpal osteoarthritis (CMC OA) is a prevalent and disabling disease. Trapeziectomy
      with ligament reconstruction and tendon interposition (LRTI), the most frequently performed
      procedure for CMC OA, requires prolonged postoperative immobilization which limits patients'
      abilities to perform Activities of Daily Life (ADLs) and to work. Trapezium excision and
      internal brace (IB) stabilization is a largely unstudied novel alternative to LRTI which has
      demonstrated encouraging short-term clinical outcomes and allows an expedited return to
      work/activity. In this feasibility and pilot grant application, our overall objective is to
      investigate critical questions to inform the planning of a definitive randomized controlled
      trial (RCT) comparing IB and LRTI for patients with CMC OA. Our central hypothesis is that a
      prospective RCT comparing LRTI and IB is feasible, and that IB will produce superior
      patient-reported outcomes to LRTI at 6 weeks and 3 months with an expedited return to
      work/activity. Our specific aims are to (1) Establish feasibility of a definitive trial by
      determining the proportion of eligible subjects who agree to randomized treatment and
      determining the follow-up retention rate, (2) Estimate effect sizes and variability in
      outcomes for planning a definitive RCT, and (3) Characterize objective clinical outcomes
      (thumb range of motion, grip/pinch strength, radiographic outcomes, complications/need for
      additional surgery, and cost) and to identify differences in return to work/activity
      following IB and LRTI. To achieve the study's aims, the investigators will randomize 50
      patients as they present to the clinics of the 7 Washington University Orthopaedic Hand
      surgeons to LRTI (control) or IB (experimental). Patients will follow-up at 2 weeks, 4 weeks,
      3 months, and 1 year post-operatively. Primary outcomes will be feasibility (randomization
      rate, follow-up retention rate), and PROMIS scores at 6 weeks and 3 months. Secondary
      outcomes will be objective clinical outcomes and return to work/activity. Upon completion of
      the study's aims, the investigators expect to demonstrate that a prospective, randomized
      trial comparing ligament reconstruction and tendon interposition (LRTI) and internal brace
      (IB) is feasible, and that patients who undergo IB will have superior short-term
      patient-reported outcomes to those who undergo LRTI. Furthermore, the study will generate
      effect size and variability estimates for a definitive, subsequent randomized controlled
      trial (RCT). Should the objectives for this study be successful, the IB procedure may be
      readily incorporated into the Hand surgeon's armamentarium as a viable option for the
      treatment of CMC OA, and the study will provide essential data to support informed, shared
      decision-making among patients and their physicians.

    <measure>Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Upper Extremity and Physical Function scores</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>PROMIS Physical Function and Upper Extremity scores will be collected at all clinic visits on iPad as per standard protocol for all patients presenting to a Washington University Orthopaedic Surgery clinic. These scores will be compared pre-op and at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 3 months, and 1 year post-op. All PROMIS domain scores are normalized to a mean score of 50 and standard deviation of 10 intending to minimize floor and ceiling effects and ensure the results are readily understood and communicated. Higher scores on all PROMIS Computer Adaptive Tests (CATs) indicate more of the domain measured such that higher scores on Physical Function are associated with greater function. The Upper Extremity and Physical Function scores will be reported independently, and will not be summed.</description>

    <description>Visual Analog Scale Pain and Satisfaction scores will be collected by a member of our team at all visits. These scores will be compared pre-op and at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 3 months, and 1 year post-op. Scale ranges from 0 to 10 points. For Pain, 0 indicates no pain and 10 indicates maximum pain. For Satisfaction, 0 indicates most unsatisfied and 10 indicates most satisfied.</description>

    <description>The investigators will record pinch and grip strength PRE-OP and POST-OP (all visits except 2 weeks post-op) in both the operative and contralateral hands. Pinch strength will be measured using a pinch gauge and recorded in kilograms. For pinch, the investigators will record &quot;lateral/key pinch&quot; AND &quot;3-point pinch&quot;. Grip strength will be measured using dynamometer and recorded in kilograms.</description>

    <measure>Complications</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Complications will recorded at all time points post-op and will be tracked as binary (yes/no). There will be 3 levels of severity- mild, moderate, and severe. Mild- minor clinical significance (i.e., scar tenderness or sensory disturbances). Moderate- clinically relevant with delay in patient recovery, but not severe enough to necessitate revision surgery and resolved 12 months post-op (i.e., mild Complex Regional Pain Syndrome type I, tendinitis, neuromas treated with steroid injections). Severe- result in revision surgery, pain at rest, or impaired hand function at 12 month exam (i.e., severe Complex Regional Pain Syndrome type I or tendinitis and neuromas that did not improve with corticosteroid injections and required surgery). Complications will be compared between the two treatment groups.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Return to Work/Activity</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will track return to work/activity by asking patients at each follow-up visit (1) IF they have returned to their work and baseline activity, and (2) if so, HOW LONG AFTER THEIR SURGERY did they return (ie, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks, 2 mos, 2.5 mos, 3 mos, 4 mos, 5 mos, &gt;6 mos). Return to work and activity will be compared between the two treatment groups.</description>
