  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSNHL) is a complicated hearing impairment
      with unclear etiology and unsatisfying treatment effects. Vestibular dysfunction like vertigo
      has been considered as a risk factor of profound hearing loss and poor prognosis in ISSNHL.
      Glucocorticoids, administered through oral or intratympanic way, is currently a regular and
      standard treatment for ISSNHL based on hearing outcome. However, little investigations have
      been conducted on recovery process and treatment effects of glucocorticoids on vestibular
      dysfunctions of ISSNHL. This study aims to evaluate the recovery pattern and possible process
      of vestibular system in ISSNHL with vestibular dysfunction, and to compare the efficacy of
      oral or intratympanic glucocorticoids in these participants.

      A randomized, outcome assessor- and statistical analyst-blinded, controlled, clinical trial
      will be carried out. 72 patients complaining of vestibular dysfunction appearing as vertigo,
      dizziness, imbalance or lateropulsion with ISSNHL will be recruited and randomized into two
      arms of oral or intratympanic glucocorticoids therapy in 1:1 allocation. The primary outcomes
      will be subjective feelings evaluated by duration of vestibular dysfunction symptoms,
      dizziness-related handicap, visual analogue scale for vertigo, and objective vestibular
      function tests results assessed by sensory organization test, caloric test, video head
      impulse test and vestibular evoked myogenic potentials. Assessment will be performed at
      baseline and at 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks post-randomization.

      This study is designed as an 8-week, single-center, randomized, assessor- and
      analyst-blinded, controlled trial with two parallel interventional groups in a 1:1
      allocation.

      Patients will be recruited from outpatient clinics of the Eye and ENT Hospital of Fudan
      University in Shanghai, qualified with well-trained doctors, staff and required facilities
      for this clinical trial.

    <description>To evaluate the recovery of vestibular function and subjective vestibular dysfunction feelings, we set the recovery rates of the whole battery of vestibular function tests (SOT/caloric test/vHIT/VEMPs) as the primary outcome, which is the proportion of patients whose abnormal results of vestibular function tests at baseline recover to normal during the 8-weeks follow-up:
recovery rate (8 weeks)=(number of patients recover from abnormal result at baseline to normal during at 8-weeks follow-up)/(number of all enrolment participants patients with abnormal result at baseline)×100%;</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adults aged between 18 to 70 years old;

          2. Diagnosed with unilateral ISSNHL according to the National Institute for Deafness and
             Communication Disorders (NICDC) criteria30: a decrease in hearing of ≥30 decibels
             (dB), affecting at least 3 consecutive frequencies occurring within a 72-hour period.
             Since premorbid audiometry is generally unavailable, premorbid hearing level will be
             defined as the opposite ear's thresholds in this condition;

          3. Reported vertigo/dizziness/imbalance/lateropulsion and abnormal results in at least
             one of the vestibular function tests (including SOT, caloric test, vHIT, cVEMP, and
             oVEMP);

          4. Onset of audio-vestibular symptoms occurred within 7 days;

          5. Be willing to sign the informed consent of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Definite etiologies are found or highly suspected after clinical evaluations, such as
             vestibular schwannoma, stroke, trauma or demyelinating disease;

          2. Diagnosed with a present or previous hearing or balance disorders which might be
             confused with ISSNHL (history of Meniere's disease, benign paroxysmal positional
             vertigo, vestibular neuronitis or vestibular migraine; history of otosclerosis;
             history of luetic, congenital or genetic hearing loss, etc.);

          3. Hearing level (evaluated with PTA) in the unaffected ear is abnormal, so that a
             premorbid hearing level of the affected ear may not be estimated;

          4. Suspected as central vestibular dysfunction, evaluated by present and previous medical
             history, physical examination and VNG;

          5. Present with conditions contraindicated systemic glucocorticoids use, such as
             tuberculosis, hepatitis C or B infection, active herpes zoster infection or other
             known human immunodeficiency virus, pancreatitis, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus,
             severe osteoporosis, chronic renal insufficiency or gastrointestinal ulcer;

          6. A history of more than 3 days sufficient systemic glucocorticoids uses (≥1 mg/kg/d)
             within 3 months which may increase the risk of adverse effects. Considering that the
             glucocorticoids is a well-acknowledged standard treatment and that the patients might
             have probably received initial systemic glucocorticoids in emergency before outpatient
             appointment, we only excluded those who have received sufficient glucocorticoids
             (≥1mg/kg/d prednisone) for more than 3 days in previous 3 months;

          7. Having received other systemic etiological treatments for ISSNHL (including hyperbaric
             oxcygen therapy (HBOT), thrombolytic drugs and antiviral drugs) which may confound the
             effects of study drugs. Patients who received only emergency or symptomatic treatments
             will not be excluded (i.e., betahistine, promethazine, diazepam, mecobalamin or ginkgo
             biloba leaves extracts);

          8. Not appropriate for receiving vestibular function tests due to combination of
             fracture, inflammatory or suppurative ear disease, severe cervical spondylosis or
             severe psychotic disorders;

          9. Multiple organ dysfunction or unstable vital signs;

         10. Pregnancy or lactation;

         11. Evaluated as unsuitable for the trial for any other reasons by investigators.
