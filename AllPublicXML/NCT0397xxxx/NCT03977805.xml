      This study is a single-center, open-label, single-dose design. It is planning to enroll six
      Chinese healthy adult male subjects. The metabolism and disposition of Herombopag, will be
      studied in these subjects after a single oral administration of a solution dose of [14C]
      Herombopag (5 mg, 100 uCi).

      The metabolism and disposition of Herombopag, will be studied in six healthy men after a
      single oral administration of a solution dose of [14C]eltrombopag (5 mg,100 uCi).

      The sutdy will investigate total radioactivity pharmacokinetics in whole blood and plasma
      、quantitatively analyze the the total radioactivity in the excreta、evaluate the predominant
      route of elimination and indentify the Metabolite profiles in plasma 、urine and faces.
