  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is examining whether the Klue app is effective in detecting missed or late meal
      boluses in patients with Type 1 diabetes. The app is programmed onto an Apple Watch and will
      detect potential missed boluses from hand motion. It will send text alerts to the user asking
      if they have bolused. This is a pilot study and will assess whether there is a change in the
      number of missed meal boluses in the two weeks prior to each visit. If the findings are
      significant, this software can be integrated in future closed-loop algorithms for automatic
      insulin delivery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized, cross-over, unblinded study with subjects randomized upon entry
      into the study to either begin using the Klue software for 6 weeks or to continue with their
      usual care for 6 weeks. Subjects are eligible for enrollment if they are using a continuous
      glucose monitor (CGM) and insulin pumps or an insulin pen with memory and CGM, are missing or
      late in giving at least 4 food boluses in the previous two weeks, and they have an iPhone.
      Missing or late meal boluses will be assessed through their pump/pen and sensor downloads.
      This is a pilot study. The investigators do not have preliminary data to do a true power
      calculation. The primary outcome will be the change in the number of missed meal boluses in
      the two weeks prior to each visit. Secondary outcome measures will be the number of missed
      meal boluses in each month of the study, change in HbA1c levels (measured every 6 weeks),
      accuracy of the Klue software in detecting meals (true positive and false positive rates),
      and a user satisfaction survey.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age 13 and over

          2. On an insulin pump for at least 3 months and using CGM or using an insulin pen with
             memory and a CGM

          3. Willing to wear a CGM at least 70% of the time while in the study

          4. Using an iPhone

          5. Willing to wear an Apple watch on their dominant hand while awake

          6. Missing or late in giving at least four food boluses in the previous two weeks

          7. Understanding and willingness to follow the protocol and sign informed consent

          8. Ability to speak, read and write in the language of the investigators

        Exclusion Criteria:
