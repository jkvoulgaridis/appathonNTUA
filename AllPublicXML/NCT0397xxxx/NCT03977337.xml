           ischemic electrocardiographic (ECG) changes within three days of major emergency
           abdominal surgery

        5. Describe the incidence of postoperative cardiac arrhythmias within three days of major

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Surgery within 72 hours of an acute admission to the Department of Surgery or an acute
             reoperation.

          -  Major gastrointestinal surgery on the gastrointestinal tract.

        This will include:

          -  Open, laparoscopic, or laparoscopically-assisted procedures

          -  Procedures involving the stomach, small or large bowel, or rectum for conditions such
             as perforation, ischemia, abdominal abscess, bleeding or obstruction

          -  Washout/evacuation of intra-peritoneal abscess (unless due to appendicitis or
             cholecystitis - excluded, see below)

          -  Washout/evacuation of intra-peritoneal hematoma

          -  Bowel resection/repair due to incarcerated umbilical, inguinal and femoral hernias
             (but not hernia repair without bowel resection/repair)

          -  Bowel resection/repair due to obstructing/incarcerated incisional hernias provided the
             presentation and findings were acute

          -  Laparotomy/laparoscopy with inoperable pathology (e.g. peritoneal/hepatic metastases)

          -  Laparoscopic/Open adhesiolysis

          -  Return to theatre for repair of fascial dehiscence

          -  Any reoperation/return to theatre meeting the criteria above is included

        If multiple procedures (primary surgery or reoperation) are performed on different
        anatomical sites within the abdominal/pelvic cavity, the patient would be included if the
        major procedure is general surgical.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Not capable of giving informed consent after oral and written information

          -  Previously included in the trial

          -  Elective laparoscopy

          -  Diagnostic laparotomy/laparoscopy where no subsequent procedure is performed (NB, if
             no procedure is performed because of inoperable pathology, then include)

          -  Appendectomy +/- drainage of localized collection unless the procedure is incidental
             to a non-elective procedure on the GI tract

          -  Cholecystectomy +/- drainage of localized collection unless the procedure is
             incidental to a non-elective procedure on the GI tract (All surgery involving the
             appendix or gallbladder, including any surgery relating to complications such as
             abscess or bile leak is excluded)

          -  Non-elective hernia repair without bowel resection.

          -  Minor abdominal wound dehiscence unless this causes bowel complications requiring
             resection

          -  Ruptured ectopic pregnancy, or pelvic abscesses due to pelvic inflammatory disease

          -  Laparotomy/laparoscopy for pathology caused by blunt or penetrating trauma

          -  Laparotomy/laparoscopy for esophageal pathology

          -  Laparotomy/laparoscopy for pathology of the spleen, renal tract, kidneys, liver, gall
             bladder and biliary tree, pancreas or urinary tract
