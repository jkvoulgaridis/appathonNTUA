  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background CREST is an acronym for the cardinal clinical features of the syndrome
      (Calcinosis, Raynaud phenomenon, Esophageal dysmotility, Sclerodactyly, and Telangiectasia)
      and part of the heterogeneous group of sclerodermas.

      Calcinosis is the pathologic calcification of soft tissues. When symptomatic, they can be
      tender and painful, ulcerate, and drain a white chalky substance. With time, heterotopic bone
      formation may occur. Inflammatory reactions also intermittently occur at the site of
      calcinosis. It has been suggested that TGF-beta3 plays a major role in the pathogenesis of
      calcinosis.

      A variety of medical therapies have been used to try to alleviate patient symptoms. These
      include pharmacological approaches (e..g., warfarin), surgical curettage or excision, as well
      as carbon dioxide laser treatments. No consistently reliable pharmacological treatment seems
      to be available to prevent or eliminate calcinosis. Curettage and excision and carbon dioxide
      laser of localized painful large deposits can relieve symptoms but recurrence is common. In
      addition, aggressive curettage or excision can damage deeper neurovascular structures. While
      calcinosis is associated with significant morbidity its treatment remains a challenge.

      Photobiomodulation (PBM) has been shown to promote wound healing, suppress inflammatory
      reactions and regulate collagen synthesis in a number of in vitro and in vivo studies.

      Human skin contains photolabile nitric oxide (NO) derivatives which decompose after UVA
      irradiation and release vasoactive NO. However, aside from blue light, barely nothing has
      been reported about the effects of red and NIR wavelengths.

      Method A custom-built air tight sleeve which envelopes the forearm of a subject will be used
      to measure the NO emanating from the skin under photobiomodulation conditions (red &amp; NIR) and
      quantified by chemiluminescence detection.

      Simultaneously, CREST patient's hands exhibiting calcinosis and/or Raynaud phenomenon will be
      exposed to exogenous gaseous nitric oxide (INOMAX) to determine the vascular impact of this
      approach.

      This case series will assess Light Emitting Diode (LED) based PBM therapy as a treatment
      alternative for cutaneous calcinosis and the effects of gaseous NO on calcinosis and/or
      Raynaud phenomenon in CREST patients.
