  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trauma-related nightmares in Veterans are associated with poor clinical outcomes, greater
      substance use, and increased risk of suicide. In spite of an urgent need to reduce the burden
      of trauma-related nightmares, the underlying physiological changes associated with them are
      poorly understood, and there are no clear evidence-based recommendations for their treatment.
      Limitations of current assessment procedures represent a barrier to improved care.
      In-laboratory sleep studies rarely capture nightmares, limiting the knowledge about them and
      their response to treatment. This study addresses these limitations by using extended,
      in-home sleep monitoring to capture sleep data associated with nightmare reports in Veterans,
      and assessing how these features are altered throughout a cognitive-behavioral nightmare
      treatment. Results from this study will increase understanding of trauma-related nightmares,
      and advance strategies for personalizing symptom management for Veterans.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a critical need for continued research to better understand trauma-related
      nightmares with the goal of developing personalized treatment plans. Limitations of current
      assessment procedures present a significant barrier to improved care. In-laboratory sleep
      studies rarely capture nightmares and cannot assess change over time, reducing the knowledge
      of phenotypic markers of nightmares to guide treatment. Therefore, there is a need to assess
      sleep over multiple nights in the home environment, where nightmares occur. This study aims
      to significantly enrich knowledge about trauma-related nightmares by using a zero-burden,
      multi-night, objective sleep measurement method within Veterans' usual sleeping environment
      prior to and during an evidence-based cognitive-behavioral intervention for nightmares. This
      study has two primary aims: 1) to identify, with greater precision than previously possible,
      objective features of sleep associated with trauma-related nightmare occurrences; and 2) to
      use the treatment for nightmares as interventional probes to determine whether and how
      changes in sleep physiological parameters identified in Aim 1 covary with changes in
      subjective nightmare frequency and severity.

      The study will include 80 trauma-exposed Veterans reporting with trauma-related nightmares.
      Eligible participants will monitor their sleep for a week using a multi-night mattress
      actigraphy implemented in their home. Mattress actigraphy, which measures movements using
      accelerometers embedded in a mattress topper, employs no body surface sensors. Therefore,
      this system represents a truly zero-burden method for obtaining intensive longitudinal sleep
      measurement. During the week of sleep monitoring, participants also will complete one-night
      of polysomnography (PSG) sleep assessment to calibrate the actigraphic sleep efficiency and
      to identify untreated sleep apnea. These methods will be used to investigate candidate
      physiological parameters associated with trauma-related nightmares. After establishing the
      levels of these candidate markers, this project will assess the impact of a
      cognitive-behavioral treatment, Exposure, Relaxation, and Rescripting Therapy (ERRT), on the
      subset of markers which can be measured continuously over the course of the treatment.
      Participants will be randomized to five weeks of active treatment (ERRT; n = 40) or to five
      weeks of the comparison treatment (sleep and nightmare management; n = 40). Throughout the
      course of treatment, participants will continue to sleep while monitored by the mattress
      actigraphy system. Upon completion of treatment, a post-treatment and follow-up assessment
      will assess subjective symptom change. Results from this study will provide important
      information to facilitate increased understanding of the phenomenology, pathophysiology, and
      treatment of nightmares in trauma-exposed Veterans.

    <time_frame>Baseline past week; Nightly during baseline; 1-week post-treatment; 3-month follow-up treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>This fill-in-the-blank variable assesses the number of nightmares experienced in the past week (range = 0 - X nightmares) at each assessment (baseline, one week following treatment, and three months following treatment).

    <measure>Change in PTSD Symptom Severity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1-week post-treatment, 3-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Change in PTSD Symptoms will be assessed using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale DSM 5 (CAPS-5) and the self-report PTSD Symptom Checklist. The items on the CAPS-5 are on a 5-point scale (0 - 4), (possible range: 0-80). A symptom is considered present if the severity is rated 2 or higher. Total scores are comprised of four factors (reexperiencing, avoidance, cognitive/emotional and hyperarousal)</description>

    <measure>Change in Global Sleep Quality</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1-week post-treatment, 3-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Change in sleep Quality will be assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, a 19-item self-report measure assessing qualities and problems associated with sleep in the past month. A global sleep quality score is obtained by summing seven component scores. Higher scores reflect poorer sleep quality. The global score ranges from 0 to 21, with a cut-off score of 5 as distinguishing &quot;good&quot; sleepers from &quot;poor&quot; sleepers.
The addendum is used in conjunction with the PSQI for use with trauma-exposed participants and assesses the presence of seven trauma-related sleep disturbances.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 1-week post-treatment, 3-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9), is a 9-item self-report instrument used to assess depression severity. Items are scored 0 to 3, with the total score being the sum of the 9 items. Higher scores indicate greater depression severity, with a score of 10 or greater considered major depression, and scores of 20 or more is severe major depression.</description>

    <measure>Change in Nightmare Effects</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1-week post-treatment, 3-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Change in the impact of nightmares will be assessed using the change in Nightmare Effects Survey, an 11 item Likert-type questionnaire designed to assess the impact of nightmares on 11 areas of life including work, social, and leisure activities. Total scores range from 0 to 44, with higher scores indicating greater level of nightmare-related impairment.</description>

    <measure>Change in Fear of Sleep</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1-week post-treatment, 3-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Change in fear of sleep will be assessed using the Fear of Sleep Inventory, a 23-item self-report measure that assesses trauma-related thoughts and activities associated with sleep and the occurrence of traumas associated with the bedroom or sleep. Total scores range from 0 to 92, with higher scores indicating greater fear of sleep.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in suicidal ideation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1-week post-treatment, 3-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Change in suicidal ideation will be assessed using the Depressive Symptom Index: Suicidality Subscale (DSI-SS). The four items of the DSI-SS are scored on a 0-3 scale, with total possible sum scores ranging from 0-12; higher scores indicate greater severity of suicidal ideation.</description>
