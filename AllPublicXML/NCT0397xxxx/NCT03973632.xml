  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      By analyzing safety and pharmacokinetics of SH-1028 Tablets in healthy subjects,
      pharmacokinetic characteristic will be evaluated mainly under fasting and fed
      conditions.Safety including AE/SAE is also a significant secondary objective.
