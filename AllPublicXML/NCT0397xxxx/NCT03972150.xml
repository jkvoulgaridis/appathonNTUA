        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Of legal age (according to local legislation) at screening. No upper limit.

          -  Signed and dated written informed consent in accordance with International Council on
             Harmonisation (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and local legislation prior to
             admission to the trial.

          -  Male or female patients. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) and men able to
             father a child must be ready and able to use highly effective methods of birth control

             consistently and correctly, starting with the screening visit and through 6 months
             after the last dose of study treatment. A list of contraception methods meeting these
             criteria is provided in the patient information. The requirement of contraception does
             not apply to women of no childbearing potential and men not able to father a child,
             but they must have an evidence of such at screening.

          -  Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of advanced, unresectable, and/or metastatic solid
             tumours (any type). Measurable lesion not mandatory for participation in this trial.

             therapies.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 1.

          -  Recovery from all reversible adverse events of previous anti-cancer therapies to
             baseline or Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade 1, except for
             alopecia (any grade), sensory peripheral neuropathy, must be ≤ CTCAE grade 2 or
             considered not clinically significant.

          -  Adequate organ function.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Known hypersensitivity to the trial drugs or their excipients or risk of allergic of
             anaphylactic reaction to drug product according to Investigator judgement (e.g.

             controlled by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), inhaled corticosteroids,
             or the equivalent of ≤10 mg/day prednisone).

          -  Known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Test results obtained
             in routine diagnostics are acceptable if done within 14 days before the informed
             consent date.

          -  Any of the following laboratory evidence of hepatitis virus infection.

               -  Positive results of hepatitis B surface (HBs) antigen

                  in routine diagnostics are acceptable if done within 14 days before the informed
                  consent date.

          -  History of severe known hypersensitivity reactions to other mAbs.

          -  Immunosuppressive corticosteroid doses (&gt;10 mg prednisone daily or equivalent) within
             4 weeks prior to the first dose of trial medication.

          -  Any investigational or anti-tumour treatment within 4 weeks or 5 half-life periods
             (whichever is shorter) prior to the initiation of trial treatment.

          -  Serious concomitant disease, especially those affecting compliance with trial
             requirements or which are considered relevant for the evaluation of the endpoints of
             the trial drug, such as neurologic, psychiatric, infectious disease or active ulcers
             (gastrointestinal tract, skin) or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk
             associated with trial participation or trial drug administration, and in the judgment
             of the investigator would make the patient inappropriate for entry into the trial.

          -  Major injuries and/or surgery or bone fracture within 4 weeks of start of treatment,
             or planned surgical procedures during the trial period.

             unstable angina, history of infarction within past 6 months, congestive heart failure
             &gt;NYHA [New York Heart Association] class II).

        Uncontrolled hypertension is defined as follows: Blood pressure in rested and relaxed
        condition ≥140 mmHg, systolic or ≥90 mmHg diastolic (with or without medication)

             investigator.

          -  Untreated brain metastasis(es) that may be considered active. Patients with previously
             treated brain metastases may participate provided they are stable (i.e., without
             evidence of progressive disease (PD) by imaging for at least 4 weeks prior to the
             first dose of trial treatment, and any neurologic symptoms have returned to baseline),
             and there is no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases

          -  Patients who require full-dose anticoagulation (according to local guidelines). No
             Vitamin K antagonist and other anticoagulation allowed; Low Molecular Weight Heparin

             last 5 years.

          -  Patients who must or wish to continue the intake of restricted medications or any drug
             considered likely to interfere with the safe conduct of the trial

          -  Patients not expected to comply with the protocol requirements or not expected to
             complete the trial as scheduled. (e.g. chronic alcohol or drug abuse or any other
             condition that, in the investigator's opinion, makes the patient an unreliable trial
             participant).

          -  Patients who were previously treated in this trial.

          -  Patients with haematological malignancies.

          -  Women who are pregnant, nursing, or who plan to become pregnant.
