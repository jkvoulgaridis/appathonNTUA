  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label, window of opportunity platform study in patients with
      muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) deemed ineligible to receive cisplatin-based
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy, who are scheduled to undergo definitive surgery (radical
      cystectomy). The primary objective of this study is to assess changes to immunogenomic
      markers after treatment with pembrolizumab alone and in combination with the selective class
      I histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor (entinostat).

    <textblock>
      This study will investigate immunogenomic changes with pembrolizumab alone and in combination
      with a selective class I histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor (entinostat).

      The study will enroll 20 subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of MIBC (cT2-T4aN0M0) who are
      ineligible for (based on consensus criteria)[1] or refuse neoadjuvant cisplatin-based
      chemotherapy. Subjects must consent to having tissue collected for research purposes during
      the scheduled surgery prior to study entry. After screening and enrollment, blood and
      archived transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT) tumor tissue will be collected
      from each subject for baseline analyses. Subjects will then start on clinical trial treatment
      followed by radical cystectomy. Subjects will be administered pembrolizumab alone 200 mg IV
      on day 1 and day 22 (Arm 1) or pembrolizumab on day 1 and day 22 and entinostat 5 mg given
      orally on day 1, day 8 and day 15 (Arm 2).

      Blood and tumor will then be collected from each subject at the time of cystectomy (within 10
      weeks after initiation of protocol therapy). The investigators do not anticipate delays in
      surgery due to the planned schedule of the preoperative treatment administration for the
      purposes of this study and based on the phase II ENCORE 601 trial (pembrolizumab and
      entinostat in melanoma) which reported an acceptable safety profile. Phase I data identified
      grade 1/2 fatigue as the most common entinostat-related toxicity, with neutropenia and anemia
      only occurring at doses exceeding those proposed for this study. Safety stopping rules for
      drug-related toxicity will dictate whether the trial should be halted if subjects are
      experiencing drug-related toxicity that delays or interferes with standard of care
      procedures.

    <measure>Change from baseline in Z-score of T cell CD8 immune 37-gene signature</measure>
    <time_frame>Less than 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The primary objective will be assessed by the change in the T cell immune gene signature in patients treated with pembrolizumab compared to those treated with pembrolizumab plus entinostat. Gene expression for each gene included in the T cell CD8 immune 37-gene signature (Bindea et al, Immunity 2013) will be quantified based on messenger RNA sequencing (mRNAseq). For each patient in each treatment group, the change in Z-score of the T cell immune gene signature will be calculated from the post-treatment tumor biopsy (cystectomy) compared with the pre-treatment biopsy and changes in Z-scores in the two groups will be compared.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in number and character of neoantigens</measure>
    <time_frame>Less than 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Neoantigens will be predicted based on whole exome sequencing data using mRNAseq-based filtering. The number of predicted neoantigens will be calculated in the pre-treatment biopsy specimen and the post-treatment cystectomy specimen for each patient. The change from baseline in number and character of neoantigens will be described and compared for each treatment group. Similarly, the T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire will be sequenced and clonality in blood and tumor will be compared between pre- and post-treatment samples for each patient, and change in clonality will be compared between treatment groups.</description>

    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Compare changes in STAT and NF-κB gene signatures and histone acetylation (H3K9Ac, H3K27Ac, and others) levels after combination treatment with pembrolizumab and entinostat as compared to pembrolizumab alone (subset of subjects with frozen TURBT Gene expression for each gene in representative STAT, NF-κB, and histone acetylation gene signatures (from MSigDB) will be quantified based on mRNA sequencing. Change in Z-score of these gene signatures will be calculated from pre- and post-treatment tissue samples for patients in both cohorts (pembrolizumab alone or pembrolizumab plus entinostat), and then changes in Z-scores will be compared between cohorts.</description>

    <description>The analysis of the toxicity and safety will be based on the frequency of adverse events and their severity. Worst toxicity grades per subject will be tabulated for adverse events and laboratory measurements by using the National Cancer Institute- Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE version 5.0) and will be reported in the form of frequency tables.</description>
