    <textblock>
      This trial is a prospective, randomized, single-center, open-label, parallel-arm,
      blinded-analysis trial, the objective of which is to evaluate the effect of transmuscular
      quadratus lumborum block (TMQLB) in the pain relief and quality of recovery in laparoscopic
      partial nephrectomy compared with thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB).

    <measure>The pain scores determined by the numeric rating scale (NRS, 0-10)</measure>
    <time_frame>within 48 postoperative hours</time_frame>
    <description>NRS is an internationally recognized pain scale with 11 points ranging from 0 to 10 points, with 0 defined as no pain and 10 defined as the worst pain imaginable.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>dermatomal distribution of sensory reduction</measure>
    <time_frame>30 min after the block</time_frame>
    <description>Thirty minutes after the block, the bilateral dermatomal sensory blocks for the anterior abdomen (between the anterior axillary and mid-clavicular lines) and thigh were assessed with the pinprick method. A reduce in pinprick sensation relative to the unblocked side was interpreted as an effective block.</description>

    <measure>quality of recovery evaluated by the self-assessment 15-item quality of recovery (QoR) scale</measure>
    <time_frame>at 3 days and 5 days after the sugery</time_frame>
    <description>QoR is a 15-item questionnaire which will score on a scale of 0-10 pertaining to patient's comfort, support system, pain, well-being, and ability to carry out daily activities, where 0 indicates none of the time and 10 indicates all of the time</description>

    <description>The patient is placed in the lateral position. The curved probe of Ultrasound Scanner is used for scan and located vertical to the iliac crest at the posterior axillary line to find the Shamrock sign. The 22-G needle is then inserted in plane and directed to the QL muscle. After the proper position of the needle tip between the psoas major muscle and the quadratus lumborum muscle is confirmed, 0. 6 ml/kg 0.5% ropivacaine is injected into the interfascial plane.
Followed by IPCA in the first 48h after surgery: morphine boluses: 1.5-2 mg, lockout time :10 min, 1h limitation: 6-8 mg morphine.</description>

    <description>The patient is placed in the lateral position, the spinous processes of T10 are identified and marks are made 2cm lateral to the spinous processes. The curve probe of ultrasound scanner is placed transversally at the mark to identify the paravertebral space. Then a 22-G needle is inserted in-plane from lateral to medial and advanced until the tip reached the paravertebral space surrounded by the parietal pleura and the superior costotransverse ligament. 0.4 ml/kg 0.5% ropivacaine is injected into the paravertebral space of T10.</description>
