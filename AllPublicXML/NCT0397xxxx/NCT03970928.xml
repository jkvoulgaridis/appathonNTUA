  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fluid management is critical in patients undergoing surgery. Goal-directed fluid management
      (GDFM) protocols have been shown to decrease the length of hospital stay. In this study, we
      aimed to compare the effects of conventional fluid management with Pleth Variability Index
      (PVI) guided on blood lactate, serum creatinine levels, postoperative kidney injury and the
      duration of hospital stay.

      Fluid management is critical in patients undergoing surgery. Goal-directed fluid management
      (GDFM) protocols have been shown to decrease the length of hospital stay in various kinds of
      surgical procedures. In this study, we aimed to compare the effects of conventional fluid
      management with Pleth Variability Index (PVI) guided on blood lactate, serum creatinine
      levels, postoperative kidney injury and the duration of hospital stay. Patients will be
      randomized to one of the study arms: group1 (conventional fluid management arm) will receive
      0.9 % NaCl at a rate of 4- 8 mL/kg/h, a 250-ml bolus crystalloid/ colloid injection will be
      administered when the mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) decreased below 65 mmHg.; group 2
      (GDFM); group 2 (GDFM group) will receive 0.9 % NaCl at rate of 2 mL/kg/h, a 250-mL bolus
      crystalloid/colloid injection will be administered when PVI is higher than 13 % over 5 min.
      In both groups, when MAP is still &lt; 65 mmHg after fluid bolus infusion, 5 mg i.v. bolus
      ephedrine will be administered. The groups will be compared concerning postoperative blood
      lactate, serum creatinine levels, postoperative kidney injury and the duration of hospital
      stay.

    <description>A pulse oximetry probe will be connected to the fourth finger of the hand in which there was not an arterial catheter in all patients and it will be wrapped so that it would not be affected by the external light. The pulse oximeter will then be connected to a monitor including the PVI software which automatically and continuously calculates the respiratory variations in the photoplethysmogram from data collected noninvasively via a pulse oximetry sensor. 0.9 % NaCl at a rate of 2 mL/kg/h will be infused in PVI- guided GDFM group, a 250-mL bolus crystalloid/colloid injection will be administered when PVI was higher than 13 % over 5 min.</description>
