  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The linear or nonlinear relationship of pulmonary systolic pressure and cardiovascular and
      kidney outcome after non-cardiac surgery is unknown. This study is to explore the
      relationship of the two and try to identify the possible threshold of pulmonary systolic
      pressure for major cardio-vascular events after non-cardiac surgery.

      The linear or nonlinear relationship of pulmonary systolic pressure and cardiovascular and
      kidney outcome after non-cardiac surgery is unknown. This study is to explore the
      relationship of the two and try to identify the possible threshold of pulmonary systolic
      pressure for major cardio-vascular events after non-cardiac surgery.

      Patients with preoperative cardio-echogram under going non-cardiac surgery were collected.
      The postoperative major cardiovascular, cerebral and kidney events were also identified and
      collected. Other data including peri-operative information and surgeries and anesthesia data
      were gathered.

      Logistic regression models were built and selected. Independent risk factors relative to
      postoperative major cardiovascular and cerebral events were screened and identified. Odds
      ratio, relative risk and relative risk ratio of varies dichomitus cut points were calculated,
      trend breakpoint were identified, propensity score analysis were also done for causal
      inference.
