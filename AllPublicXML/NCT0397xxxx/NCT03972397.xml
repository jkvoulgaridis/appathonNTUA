  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the efficacy of intercostal nerve cryoablation on the
      magnitude and duration of postoperative pain control both in patients undergoing
      thoracoabdominal incisions for the descending or thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Descending/thoracoabdominal incision is planned

          -  There is reasonable expectation that the patient will be extubated within 48 hours
             after surgery

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient has a known allergy to morphine or any opioid

          -  The patient has a known chronic pain disorder or takes daily opioid medication &gt; 1
             month prior to surgery

          -  The surgeon/anesthesiologist concludes that the period for intubation will be likely
             be for more than 48 hours after surgery There is anticipated difficulty communicating
             pain status due to language or other barriers at the investigator discretion.
