  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to test the feasibility of an intervention using biofeedback
      to treat stress and anxiety among individuals with tetraplegia.

      The expected duration of participation in this study is about 15 hours over the course of
      about 5 weeks. Participants will be randomly assigned to either a biofeedback training
      intervention or a control group. After completing questionnaires, participants will undergo
      physiological monitoring (measuring heart rate and breathing). Those assigned to the
      biofeedback group will undergo 30 minutes of physiological monitoring while also
      participating in biofeedback training twice a week for 4 weeks (8 sessions). Those assigned
      to the control group will undergo 30 minutes of physiological monitoring twice a week for 4
      weeks (8 sessions), but will not receive biofeedback training. Each session is expected to
      last 1-1.5 hours. One week after the last session, participants will return to Craig Hospital
      to complete questionnaires and undergo 5 minutes of physiological monitoring.

      It is hypothesized that the biofeedback intervention will demonstrate high feasibility and
      compared to those in the control group, participants who receive the biofeedback intervention
      will attain greater pre-post reductions in both physiological and self-reported stress.

    <time_frame>Week 0 (baseline) and Week 5 (post-treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) is a self report instrument designed to measure core symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress. Each of the three DASS-21 scales contains seven items, divided into subscales with similar content. Scores for depression, anxiety, and stress are calculated by summing the scores for the relevant items. Items are rated on a scale from 0 (did not apply to me at all) to 3 (applied to me very much or most of time), with higher scores indicating more depression, anxiety, and stress.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 0 (baseline) and Week 5 (post-treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The Subjective Units of Distress Scale (SUDS) is a single-item self report instrument designed to measure the intensity of feelings and other internal experiences such as anxiety, anger, agitation, stress, or other painful feelings. A scale of 0 to 100 will be used to measure the subjective intensity of disturbance or distress experienced by the participant. A higher score indicates greater distress.</description>

    <measure>State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>After intervention sessions #1-8 (weeks 1 through 4)</time_frame>
    <description>The State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) is a 40 item self-report inventory consisting of 20 items to assess trait anxiety and 20 items to assess state anxiety. Items are rated on a scale from 1 (not at all) to 4 (very much). A total score is calculated by summing all six scores, multiplying the sum by 20, and then dividing by six. Total scores range from 20 - 80 with higher scores indicating greater self-reported anxiety. A normal score on the STAI is 34 - 36.</description>

    <description>Participants (n=15) will undergo psychophysiological monitoring while also participating in traditional resonance frequency training for a total of eight 30-minute sessions. Prior to beginning the heart rate variability (HRV) training session, participants will be introduced to the two channels (PPG and RSG) of the Thought Technology ProComp 2 Encoder and the Biograph Infinity software. Participants will receive further instruction explaining how physiological information will be displayed and used as a means of training to induce a relaxed state while receiving real time PPG and RSG feedback. Participants will be instructed on using controlled breathing to assist with reaching this relaxed state.</description>

    <description>The control arm (n=15) participants will undergo physiological monitoring for eight 30-minute sessions. Before the initial session, a trained study staff will provide participants with an introductory explanation of the associated equipment. The equipment will then be attached to the participants and they will be provided with the following instructions: &quot;You will be monitored with this equipment for 30 minutes. During this time frame, please try to limit movement and conversation as much as possible.&quot;</description>
