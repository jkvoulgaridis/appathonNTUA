  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is very common, as most people will experience infection
      during their lifetime. The most common manifestation of HPV infection is common warts. Common
      warts may appear at any age.

      Conventional treatments can be used to treat warts and they are based on two mechanisms:
      stimulation of cellular immunity against HPVs or destruction of the lesion. These treatments
      are based on the location of the wart and the degree of the symptoms.

      No specific antiviral therapy is available to cure warts and today, there is no treatment
      that allows the definitive eradication of the virus.

      The 2LVERU® has been available for more than 20 years, and has received a marketing
      authorization in Belgium by the Federal Agency for Medicines and Health Products (FAMHP). It
      is used as an immune regulator in the treatment of common warts (verruca vulgaris), flat
      warts (verruca plana) or plantar warts (verruca plantaris) caused by Human Papillomavirus.
      Since 2LVERU® has been made available, clinical observational data collected on treated
      patients have shown the beneficial effect on the disappearance of warts.

      The purpose of this placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind trial is the comparison of
      the efficacy of the treatment on the disappearance of warts at the end of treatment (6-month
      visit) between the 2LVERU® JUNIOR and 2LVERU® versus the placebo group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study duration will be maximum 21 months with 12 months of inclusion and 9 months of
      follow-up.

      Patients aged 3 years and older who present common warts (Verruca vulgaris), and/or plantar
      warts (Verruca plantaris), and/or flat warts (Verruca plana) during a visit with their
      dermatologist/general practitioner.

      The total number of patients to include will be 374 with 187 patients per group.

      Primary objective:

      Comparison of the efficacy of the treatment on the disappearance of warts at the end of
      treatment (6-month visit) between the 2LVERU® JUNIOR and 2LVERU® versus the placebo group.

      Secondary objectives

        -  Comparison of the efficacy of the treatment on the disappearance of warts at 4 months
           between groups.

        -  Comparison of the efficacy of the treatment on the level of disappearance (4 levels) of
           warts at 4 months and 6 months (end of the treatment) between groups

        -  Comparison of the efficacy of the treatment on the recurrence of warts 3 months after
           the end of treatment between groups

        -  Compare the pain related to warts during the study between groups

        -  Safety issues.

      Treatment phase:

        -  Group n°1 = 2LVERU® JUNIOR / 2LVERU® (6 months of treatment)

        -  Group n°2 = Placebo (6 months of treatment)

      Post-treatment Follow-up phase: 3 months

      Treatment will be considered successful if the following three criteria are met for all
      treated warts as described at the baseline visit:

        -  Normal skin colour at the wart site

        -  Normal skin texture at the wart site

        -  Normal touch at the wart site Treatment will be considered a failure, at the end of the
           treatment, if at least one of the above three criteria is not met for all treated warts
           as described at the baseline visit.
