      This is an open-label, multi-centre, Phase I study to assess the PK, PD and safety of 2 week
      treatment with inhaled AZD7594 in adolescent patients with asthma.

      The study is planned to be conducted at 4-10 study sites in the United States. The study
      intends to include 24 patients (12 to 17-year-old patients). For each patient, the duration
      of participation in the study will be approximately 5 to 7 weeks (37 to 52 days).

      This is an open-label, multi-centre, Phase I study to assess the PK, PD and safety of 2 week
      treatment with inhaled AZD7594 in adolescent patients with asthma.

      The study is planned to be conducted at 4-10 study sites in the United States. Eligible 12 to
      17-year-old patients with asthma controlled on Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) step 2
      medication (ie, low dose inhaled corticosteroid [ICS] or leukotriene receptor antagonist
      [LTRA]), as evidenced by an asthma control questionnaire (ACQ-5) score ≤1.5, will be asked to
      stop their ongoing asthma maintenance treatment. After a washout period (14 to 21 days), all
      patients with confirmed reversibility will start study treatment, consisting of inhalations
      of AZD7594 (360 µg, delivered dose, via dry powder inhaler [DPI]) once daily for 15 to 16
      days.

      The study intends to include 24 patients in order to have 18 evaluable patients, enrolled in
      equal proportion in the age group of 12 to 14 years (inclusive), and the age group of 15 to
      17 years (inclusive), with at least 7 patients in each subgroup.

      For each patient, the duration of participation in the study will be approximately 5 to 7
      weeks (37 to 52 days)

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Provision of signed and dated informed consent form (ICF) prior to any study-specific
             procedures from patient's parents/legal guardians is required and signed and dated
             informed assent from the patient.

          2. Patient must be 12 to 17 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the
             ICF/assent.

          3. A minimum of 6-month documented history of asthma treated (daily or intermittently)
             for at least 3 months before screening (Visit 1) with either low dose inhaled
             corticosteroid (ICS) monotherapy or leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA)
             monotherapy.

          4. Pre-bronchodilator FEV1 ≥70% of the predicted normal value at screening (Visit 1).

          5. An ACQ-5 score &lt;1.5 at screening (Visit 1).

          6. Be non-smoker or ex-smoker who has stopped smoking (or using other nicotine products)
             for &gt;6 months prior to screening (Visit 1).

          7. Body mass index (BMI) above the 5th percentile for the patient's age and gender and a
             minimum weight of 30 kg at screening (Visit 1).

          9. Negative pregnancy test (urine or serum) for post-menarcheal female patients at
             screening (Visit 1).

         10. Post-menarcheal female patients must be willing to use a highly effective method of
             contraception which results in a low failure rate (ie, less than 1% per year). Sexual
             abstinence will be accepted as an effective method of contraception, provided a
             discussion occurred between the subject and investigator to confirm this lifestyle.

             After the washout period, patients are eligible to enter the treatment period only if
             all of the following inclusion criteria apply:

         11. Negative pregnancy test (urine or serum) for post-menarcheal female patients at
             baseline (Visit 4).

         12. FEV1 increase of at least 12% and 200 mL from baseline 15 to 30 minutes after 400 μg

             history within 6 months of Visit 1, or confirmed at Visit 1 or Visit 2. In 12 to
             14-year-old patients (who are likely to have a smaller forced vital capacity),
             positive reversibility testing could be based solely on the relative post
             bronchodilator response (at least 12%).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients are eligible to enter the washout period if none of the following exclusion
        criteria apply:

             study.

          3. Prolonged QT interval corrected using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) ≥440 msec based on
             ECG at screening (Visit 1) or pre-dose at Visit 4, or family history of long QT
             syndrome.

          4. Prolonged PR interval (&gt;180 msec for ≤16-year-old patients and &gt;200 msec for &gt;16 year

             Prior/concomitant therapy

         10. Patient who, in the opinion of the Investigator, is unable to abstain from
             protocol-defined prohibited medications during the study.

             Prior/concurrent clinical study experience

             to both AstraZeneca staff and/or staff at the study site).

         15. Judgement by the Investigator that the patient should not participate in the study if
             the patient is unlikely to comply with study procedures, restrictions and
             requirements.
