      This early phase I trial studies how well the use of a continuous positive airway pressure
      (CPAP) machine works in treating obstructive sleep apnea in patients with polycythemia vera
      or essential thrombocythemia. Obstructive sleep apnea is a condition where a person stops
      breathing during sleep, and is estimated to affect 30 to 50 percent of patients with
      polycythemia vera or essential thrombocythemia. A patient with obstructive sleep apnea
      typically snores, has disrupted sleep, experiences morning headaches, and has daytime
      sleepiness. Patients diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea are typically treated with a
      device called CPAP. The CPAP provides pressurized air that keeps upper air passages open
      during sleep and may prevent them from narrowing or collapsing as occurs during snoring or
      sleep apnea.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To understand effects of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for obstructive sleep
      apnea (OSA) on the course of polycythemia vera/essential thrombocythemia (PV/ET).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate prevalence of OSA in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms. II. To
      understand effects of CPAP for sleep apnea on the course of myeloproliferative neoplasms
      (MPNs).

      III. To correlate OSA severity with thrombotic and inflammatory marker values in patients
      with PV/ET at baseline.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts.

      COHORT I (OBSERVATIONAL COHORT): Patients not diagnosed with OSA undergo observation for 6
      months.

      COHORT II (TREATMENT COHORT): Patients diagnosed with OSA and prescribed a CPAP machine for
      treatment receive continuous treatment with CPAP for 6 months.
