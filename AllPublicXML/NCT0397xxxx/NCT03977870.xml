  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common and potentially fatal pathology in France. The risk
      of recurrence is around 5 to 7% per year. The identification of patients at risk of VTE and
      its prevention is a real health issue in particular. 50% of MTEV recurrences occur in the
      absence of a risk situation, suggesting the involvement of specific risk factors for MTEV
      recurrence that have not been identified to date.

      In the last ten years, so-called &quot;genome-whole&quot; or &quot;genome wide&quot; association (GWAS)
      approaches have identified new genetic risk factors for the first episode of VTE. On the
      other hand, no study has focused on the predictive factors of recurrence.

      The previous project, conducted from 2012 (NCT02904967), had as its main objective to
      identify new genes for susceptibility to MTEV recurrence by comparing cases of MTEV
      recurrence versus controls having had a single episode of MTEV. The MARTHA cohort (1,542
      patients) is extremely valuable study material and is one of the few cohorts in the world
      with genome-wide data in the field of VTE. Follow-up could only be performed in 359 patients,
      76 (21%) of whom presented with a new episode of VTE.

      The objective of this project is to increase the number of patients for whom the
      investigators will have information on recurrence / non-recurrence of VTE, by querying
      national registries on the vital status of patients, and possible causes of death. .

      These new data on the occurrence or not of a new thrombotic episode, will be confronted with
      the genetic data already available in all the patients in order to identify specific genetic
      risk factors and potentially predictive of the recurrence of MTEV.

        The Martha cohort is composed of 1542 subjects from the Region of Marseille with at least
        one episode of VTE documented. Patients in the MARTHA cohort have already all been
        genotyped for approximately 500,000 polymorphisms
