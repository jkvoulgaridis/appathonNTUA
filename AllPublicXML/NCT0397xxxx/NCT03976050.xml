  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study drug, HL-085 is a MEK inhibitor with the potential indication for cancers. It is an
      oral medication to be given daily.

      The purposes of this study is to find answers to the following research questions:

        1. What is the highest tolerable dose of HL-085 that can be given to subjects when given
           orally (by mouth) on a twice daily basis?

        2. What are the side effects of HL-085?

        3. How much HL-085 is in the blood at specific times after dosing and how does the body get
           rid of the HL-085?

    <measure>Adverse events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Duration of the study, estimated to be approximately 24 months.</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Dose limitation toxicities (DLT)</measure>
    <time_frame>During Cycle 1 (the first 28 days)</time_frame>
    <description>A DLT is defined as the occurrence of any of the following AE considered possibly, probably, or definitely related to the IP, HL-085, by the Investigator and/or the Sponsor that occurs during Cycle 1 as described in below:
Any death not clearly due to the underlying disease or extraneous causes; or
Non-hematologic toxicities Grade 3 or higher.
Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with clinically significant bleeding, or other hematologic toxicity at Grade 4 or above.
Neutropenic fever
liver parameter abnormalities
Any toxicity requiring permanent discontinuation of the IP</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Maximum tolerated dose (MTD)</measure>
    <time_frame>MTD will be determined when DLT occurs in great or equal to 33.3% of the same cohort subjects during During Cycle 1 (the first 28 days)</time_frame>
    <description>MTD is defined as the highest dose level at which DLT occurs in less than 33.3% of subjects.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>cMAX</measure>
    <time_frame>Duration of the study, estimated to be approximately 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>cMAX is the maximum plasma concentration of HL-085 or metabolite(s).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall response rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Duration of the study, estimated to be approximately 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>ORR is the proportion of patients with a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), as assessed per response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) v1.1.</description>

    <description>Subjects in the dose escalation cohorts will receive ascending doses of HL-085 until the MTD is determined. The first three subjects will receive twice-daily doses (BID) of HL-085 6 mg. Additional cohorts may receive doses of HL-085 9, 12 or 18 mg BID respectively and sequentially. If DLTs are observed in &lt;33.3% of subjects at the 18 mg dose.</description>
