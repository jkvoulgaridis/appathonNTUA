    <textblock>
      PDC-LUNG-101 trial is an open-label, dose-escalation, phase I/II study to assess the safety,
      the tolerability, the immunogenicity and the preliminary clinical activity of the therapeutic
      cancer vaccine, PDC*lung01, associated or not with anti-PD-1 treatment in patients with
      non-small-cell lung cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The therapeutic cancer vaccine, PDC*lung01 will be administered at two dose levels (low dose
      (LD) and high dose (HD)), as single agent or during maintenance treatment by pemetrexed (for
      adenocarcinomas in Cohorts A1 and A2) or added to the SoC (cohorts B1 and B2) i.e. anti-PD-1.

      In cohorts A1 (low dose cohort) and A2 (high dose cohort), NSCLC patients will be treated at
      each of the six PDC*lung01 treatment visits with low dose/high dose administered successively
      by subcutaneous and then by intravenous route.

      In cohort B1 and B2, the first PDC*lung01 injection will start within 48 hours after the
      first infusion of anti-PD-1. The fourth PDC*lung01 injection will occur within 48 hours after
      the infusion of the second cycle of anti-PD-1.

      For each patient, the study will be divided into three consecutive parts:

        -  Pre-screening (for HLA-A*02:01 positivity), only patients with positive HLA-A*02:01
           status will be proposed to be screened.

        -  Active period comprising a screening period, a treatment period (visits V1 to V6, during
           which the patient receives PDC*lung01 vaccine, at each visit) and an end-of-treatment
           (EoT) visit (V7, 4 weeks after the last injection),

        -  Follow-up period which starts after the EoT visit and lasts up to two years after the
           first IMP administration.

          7. For female patients without child-bearing potential: a documentation of tubal ligation
             or hysterectomy, ovariectomy or a post-menopausal status is available.

             For female patients of child-bearing potential: a negative serum pregnancy test at
             screening is required. The patient agrees to practice a &quot;dual method&quot; contraception
             from signing informed consent form (screening), throughout the study treatment period
             with PDC*lung01 and for at least 28 days after the last administration of PDC*lung01.

             For female patients receiving Pemetrexed in cohorts A1/A2 concomitantly with
             PDC*lung01, according to corresponding SmPC, it is required to use effective
             contraception during treatment with pemetrexed.

             of contraception up to 4 months thereafter.

             A woman is considered of childbearing potential (WOCBP), i.e. fertile, following
             menarche and until becoming post-menopausal unless permanently sterile. Permanent
             sterilisation methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy and bilateral
             oophorectomy.

             A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative
             medical cause.

             &quot;Dual method&quot; contraception is defined as the use of at least 2 methods among the
             following:

               -  Hormonal contraception (such as oral, injection, transdermal patch, implant)

               -  Monogamous relationship with vasectomized partner.

               -  Abstinence or absence of sexual relations

          8. Males with reproductive potential should use barrier method of contraception (condom)
             from signing informed consent form (screening) up to at least 28 days after the last
             dose of PDC*lung01.

             For male patients receiving Pemetrexed in cohorts A1/A2 concomitantly with PDC*lung01,
             according to corresponding SmPC, it is required to use barrier method of contraception
             up to 6 months thereafter.

          9. In the Investigator's opinion, the patient is able and willing to comply with the
             requirements of the study.

         10. Patient willing and able to sign the study informed consent form before any
             study-specific procedures are conducted.

             testing.

          3. Patient has received immunotherapy or any investigational drugs within 4 weeks before
             the first PDC*lung01 dose.

             exceeding 10 mg/day (prednisone or equivalent) during the screening period
             (administration by nasal spray, topical solution or oral inhaler is non-systemic and
             is therefore allowed).

          5. Patient has a medical history of cancer other than NSCLC, except the following: (i)
             non-melanoma skin cancer with complete resection, (ii) in situ carcinoma of the

             of baseline) or uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmias at the time of enrolment in the
             study (atrial fibrillation or flutter is acceptable).

         10. Any history of splenectomy or splenic irradiation.

         11. For female patients: pregnancy or lactation.

         12. Any condition, including autoimmune or immunodeficiency active disease that, in the
