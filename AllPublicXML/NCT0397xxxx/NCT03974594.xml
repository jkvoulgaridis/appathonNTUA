  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trifluridine and Tipiracil Tablets is a nucleoside anti-metabolic and anti-cancer compound
      developed by Taiho (Dapeng) Co., Ltd., Japan, for the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer
      that inoperable resection, and progressed or relapsed after standard treatment. This study
      mainly evaluates bioequivalence, safety and tolerance of Trifluridine and Tipiracil Tablets
      in colorectal cancer patients.
