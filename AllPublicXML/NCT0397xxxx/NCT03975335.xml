  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a before-after designed intervention study conducted in two randomly selected
      secondary schools- one was selected randomly as intervention school and the another as
      control school. A baseline survey was conducted among the students of both schools by a
      pre-tested questionnaire to attain their current status of knowledge, attitude and practices
      related to NCDs. Afterward, students were enrolled in the intervention group who met the
      eligibility criteria from the intervention school. The intervention was given through a
      health promotion session to a group of students, not more than 25 at a time, by trained
      facilitators. A post-intervention end line survey was conducted among all the participants
      from both schools using the same questionnaire three months after the baseline survey. An
      intervention has been developed based on some principals of two psychosocial theory-
      Motivational Interview and Social Cognitive Theory. Emphasis was given on motivating the
      adolescents towards a healthy lifestyle, supporting self-efficacy to be changed, guiding
      self-regulatory ways along with facilitating desired changing process by empowering them with
      choices about the preventive measures of NCDs. This intervention is expected to increase
      awareness by equipping the adolescents with specific knowledge and skills and thus,
      facilitate an eventual change in their practiced risk behaviors.

    <measure>Change in knowledge</measure>
    <time_frame>Three months</time_frame>
    <description>Knowledge about non-communicable diseases related risk behaviors such as dietary habit, physical activity, smoking and alcohol will be measured by 25 knowledge measuring questions scoring 54 in total. Answer to the questions will be regarded as correct or incorrect based on information from standard medical textbooks and guidelines. Difference of knowledge score from pre-intervention to post-intervention survey will be measured.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in attitude</measure>
    <time_frame>Three months</time_frame>
    <description>Attitude towards the risk behaviors- dietary habit, physical activity, smoking and alcohol will be measured by nine attitude measuring questions in a Likert Scale ranging from one to three. Change in attitude score from pre-intervention to post-intervention survey will be measured.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in practice</measure>
    <time_frame>Three months</time_frame>
    <description>Practice will be measured as follows-
Dietary habit: Presence of at least two of the following four habits will be accounted as having dietary risk behavior.
i. Inadequate fruit consumption: Less than five servings of fruits per day ii. Inadequate vegetable consumption: Less than five servings of vegetables per day iii. Excessive salt consumption: Taking extra or raw salt during every meal iv. Sugar Sweetened Beverage (SSB) consumption: Consuming SSB more than three days per week
Physical activity: Not meeting 60 minutes physical activity of moderate intensity per day will be regarded as physically inactive.
Smoking and alcohol: Smoking regularly in the last 30 days or exposing to passive smoking more than three days per week will be accounted as in risk of smoking. Any amount of alcohol intake or any substance abuse in the last 30 days will be regarded as at risk.
Change in practice from pre-intervention to post-intervention survey will be measured.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Body Mass Index (BMI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Three months</time_frame>
    <description>The ratio of body weight in kilogram and the height in meter square will be considered as BMI. Classification of BMI will be done as following- Underweight (Less than 18.5); Normal weight (18.5-24.9); Overweight (25.0-29.9) and Obese (More than 30.0)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Blood Pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>Three months</time_frame>
    <description>Blood pressure will be measured by an automatic digital sphygmomanometer (HEM-8712, Omron, Kyoto, Japan). Presence of systolic blood pressure ≥ 130 mm of Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 80 mm of Hg will be considered as having high blood pressure.</description>
