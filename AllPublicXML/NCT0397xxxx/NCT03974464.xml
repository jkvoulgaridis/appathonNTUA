  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluated the value of using copetin and protein S 100 b to eliminate the
      diagnosis of stroke in patients presenting with vertigo in emergency departments. All
      patients benefited from the S 100b protein assay, copeptin and brain MRI.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vertigo is a frequent reason for visiting emergency departments. Differentiating stroke from
      other causes is challenging for physicians. The role of biomarkers has been poorly assessed.
      Evaluators evaluated whether copeptin and S100b protein assessment, alone or in combination,
      could rule out stroke in patients visiting emergency departments for vertigo.

      Evaluators included patients visiting the adult emergency departments of a French university
      hospital for a new episode of vertigo evolving for less than 72 hours. All patients underwent
      standardized physical examination (HINT [Head Impulse test, Nystagmus, test of skew
      deviation] maneuvers), copeptin and S-100b protein measurement and injected brain imaging.
      Stroke diagnosis involved diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging or, if not available,
      neurological examination and contrast brain CT scan compatible with the diagnosis.

    <description>Age, sex and time between dizziness onset and ED visit were collected using Resurgences® software. PS100 concentrations were measured on serum samples by electro-chemiluminescence assay. Copeptin concentrations were measured on serum samples by the Kryptor method. The positivity threshold for copeptin was set at strictly above 10 pmol/L and that of PS100 was set at strictly above 0.105 μmol/L.
And after, we compared results with results of brain imaging: Magnetic Resonance Imaging alone, CT scan alone or both. Depending on clinical presentation, the imaging tests were performed during ED stay, during hospitalization or externally. Presence or absence of stroke was established on diffusion-weighted brain MRI . In case of normal contrast CT alone, a specialized opinion should exclude the need for diffusion-weighted MRI according to clinical presentation.</description>

      PS100 concentrations were measured on serum samples by electro-chemiluminescence assay
      (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). Copeptin concentrations were measured on serum samples by the
      Kryptor method (Thermo Scientific, Hennigsdorf, Germany)

        One hundred and fifty-one patients were included, of whom 16 were secondarily excluded
        (lost to follow-up n=1, missing biomarkers n=9, missing MRI n=6)(Figure 1). A majority of
        the remaining 135 patients were women (n=79, 59%) with an average age of 62 years .
        Specialized advice on the origin of dizziness was sought from ENT and/or neurologist in 102
        (76%) of cases. Patients received brain diffusion-weighted MRI alone in 74 cases, contrast
        brain CT alone in 11 cases and a combination of MRI and CT in 50 cases. In 122 patients
        (90%), vertigo was not related to stroke.

             in the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients without brain imaging (diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or
             contrast CT scan compatible with the diagnosis) were excluded.
