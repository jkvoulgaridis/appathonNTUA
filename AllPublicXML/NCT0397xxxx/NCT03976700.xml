  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to establish the treatment scheme of Bufei Jianpi granule for early-stage
      (GOLD stage 1 or 2) chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), delaying pulmonary function
      decline and forming high quality evidence.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COPD is a highly prevalent disease, with a prevalence among people 40 years of age or older
      of 10.1% worldwide and 13.7% in China. COPD has become the third leading cause of death
      worldwide. More than 70% of patients with COPD are in GOLD stage 1 (mild) or 2 (moderate),
      with very mild or no apparent respiratory symptoms such as dyspnea. The Tiotropium in Early
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Patients in China (Tie-COPD) trial was designed to
      investigate the effect of tiotropium on the FEV1 in COPD patients with GOLD stage 1 or 2. The
      investigator's previous studies also suggested that traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has
      effect on GOLD stage 1 or 2 COPD.

      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial to evaluate the
      effect of Bufei Jianpi granule for delaying pulmonary function decline in early-stage (GOLD
      stage 1 or 2) COPD subjects. After a 14-day run-in period, 612 subjects will be randomly
      assigned to treatment group or control group for 104-week treatment. The primary outcomes
      include pulmonary function and frequency of acute exacerbation. The secondary outcomes
      include clinical symptoms, dyspnea, exercise capacity, quality of life and treatment
      satisfaction. Safety will also be assessed.
