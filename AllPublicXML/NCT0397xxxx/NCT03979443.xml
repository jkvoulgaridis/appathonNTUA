  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      FACADE is a prospective, randomized, controlled, parallel group non-inferiority trial
      comparing the traditional hospital surveillance (inpatient, patients staying in the hospital
      for 1-3 nights after surgery) to outpatient care (discharge on the day of the surgery,
      usually within 6-8 hours after procedure) in patients who have undergone anterior cervical
      decompression and fusion (ACDF) procedure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To determine whether early discharge (outpatient care) is noninferior to inpatient care, the
      investigators will randomize 104 patients to these two groups and follow them for 6 months
      using the Neck Disability Index (NDI) as the primary outcome. The investigators expect that
      early discharge is not significantly worse (inferior) than the current care in terms of
      change in NDI. Noninferiority will be declared if the mean improvement for outpatient care is
      no worse than the mean improvement for inpatient care, within statistical variability, by a
      margin of 17.3%. The investigators hypothesize that a shorter hospital stay results in more
      rapid return to normal daily activities, shorter duration of sick leave and decreased
      secondary costs to health care system. Secondary outcomes in the study are arm pain and neck
      pain using the Numeric Rating Scale, operative success (Odom's criteria), patient's
      satisfaction to treatment, general quality of life (EQ-5D-5L), work ability score (WAS),
      sickness absence days, return to previous leisure activities, and complications.

      Patients who are eligible for the trial, but are not willing to undergo randomization, will
      be asked to be included in a simultaneous, pragmatic follow-up cohort.
