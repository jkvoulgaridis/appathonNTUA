      The aim of this study is to evaluate the remineralization potential of pearl powder on early
      ('white spot') lesions in enamel in orthodontic patients compared to casein
      phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate. The remineralisation potential will be assessed
      both visually and by standardised photographic image analysis. the follow up will be up to 12
      months.

    <description>MI paste Self-administration of the product by the patient once in the evening. A pea-size amount of the product should be applied per arch, using a dry finger or cotton pellet to distribute it evenly across all teeth and to work it into the interdental spaces. The product was then retained in the mouth for 1-3 min, and manipulated around the teeth using the tongue, before being expectorated and patient should not rinse it until 30 min.</description>
