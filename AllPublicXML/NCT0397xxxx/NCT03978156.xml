  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to address the feasibility of a randomized, double masked, cross-over
      study of dronabinol as a palliative agent in the treatment of pain, inflammation, and other
      complications of sickle cell disease (SCD).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Primary Hypothesis is that such a study will be feasible as defined by subject adherence
      to study medication and study procedures and avoidance of other cannabinoid containing
      substances during the trial period as well as by ability to mask subjects and investigators
      to treatment assignment

      Secondary hypotheses are:

      Dronabinol will:

      Reduce patient-reported pain interference Reduce patient-reported pain scores and change
      patient-reported pain quality. Reduce use of opioid pain medications. Improve
      patient-reported stiffness, nausea and vomiting, sleep, mood, anxiety, and social
      functioning.

      Reduce markers of inflammation.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient reported 7-day pain interference</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint for this study will be second treatment week 7-day pain impact as measured by the Adult Sickle Cell Quality of Life Measurement Information System (ASCQ-Me) 7-day pain impact domain. ASCQ-Me domains are validated to measure pain and other quality of life outcomes in adults with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) of all genotypes. The published mean for the validated scores is 50 and the standard deviation is 10.56 Lower scores represent more severe symptoms. When the validation cohort was placed into tertiles of severity, the tertile with most severe disease had a mean pain score of 53, the middle tertile had a score of 49, and the least severe disease tertile had a mean score of 46. This suggests that a change of 4 has clinical significance and a change of 7 has even more clinical significance. We have chosen a priori to define a difference in pain impact score of 5 points as showing superiority.</description>
