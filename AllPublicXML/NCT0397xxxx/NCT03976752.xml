    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to determine if the uptake of anti-HIV medication, called
      Genvoya®, at different time-frames, is different at several body sites, including mucosal
      tissues. This medication might be considered for on-demand PEP regimens in the future.

      Men who have sex with men (MSM) continue to be disproportionately affected by HIV. The
      majority of MSM acquire HIV after exposure to the rectal mucosa through unprotected receptive
      anal intercourse. Post-exposure-prophylaxis (PEP) is an intervention that is used to prevent
      HIV infection soon (72 hours) after a potential exposure. HIV-negative people with a possible
      exposure to HIV are instructed to take 28 days of a combination anti-HIV medication regimen,
      Truvada® + Raltegravir.

      This study is being conducted to determine if the uptake of another anti-HIV medication,
      called Genvoya®, at different time-frames, is different at several body sites, including
      mucosal tissues. This medication might be considered for on-demand PEP regimens in the
      future.

    <description>Genvoya is a fixed-dose combination anti-retroviral drug containing tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), emtricitabine (FTC), elvitegravir (EVG), and cobicistat).
At the second study visit, participants will be provided with a single dose of Genvoya, and instructed to take the dose at home with documentation by digital, time-stamped photo or video. At the third study visit, which will occur 24hrs after home dosing, participants will be given another single dose of Genvoya at the clinic.</description>
