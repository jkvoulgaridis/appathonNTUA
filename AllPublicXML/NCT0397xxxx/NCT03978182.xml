  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With a growing number of elderly persons, geriatric depression - associated with important
      morbidity and mortality- is becoming a significant health problem. Given the risk of
      polypharmacy and increased side effects, alternative non pharmaceutical treatments such as
      repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) may be a solution. Given recent positive
      results with accelerated rTMS in the elderly depressed, it is of interrest to continue to
      develop promising non-invasive treatment stimulations. The FDA approved deep brain TMS (dTMS)
      technique may be a promising option, targeting the brain underneath the neocortex with
      potentially better response and remission rates. Therefore, in a sham-controlled cross-over
      fashion, the investigators will treat 44 geriatric depressed patients with accelerated dTMS
      (5 sessions/day over 4 days only), and evaluate clinical efficacy and safety. Because new
      introduced rTMS paradigms should be rigorously neurobiologically examined before applying
      them on a regular basis, this research will include multimodal brain imaging techniques to
      elucidate the working mechanisms of this application in order to optimize treatment for such
      populations.

      An initially double-blind sham-controlled cross-over study in geriatric depressed patients to
      investigate whether accelerated (a)dTMS is a safe and effective clinical option for this
      cohort. After the first week evaluations and MRI, there will be an open label phase in which
      patients who did receive active treatment in the first week will not receive any further rTMS
      sessions, those patients who had received sham however will get their active treatment in the
      second week. The independent researcher will use the treatment allocation list to inform the
      investigators if an active treatment faze is needed in the second week.

    <intervention_model_description>geriatric depressed patients after randomization at time T1 (on a Monday for MRI) will be divided into two groups to receive 20 sessions of real or sham adTMS treatment respectively. A given patient who first received active treatment will not receive sham, because of the carry-over effects; a patient who first received sham treatment now receives active adTMS in an open phase. This treatment will be spread over the four succeeding afternoons (5 daily sessions). In the second week, strictly the same treatment schedule will be followed but with the reverse order. A second brain imaging assessment will be performed exactly 1 week after the first week (time T2) and a third time scan exactly after 2 weeks (time T3).</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Stimulation: We will use a Magstim Rapid2 Plus1 Magnetic Stimulator connected to a Brainsway H1 coil, which includes a sham option. In analogy to our former accelerated rTMS studies (2, 3), all patients will receive 20 dTMS sessions (5 sessions per day; 4 consecutive days) with a stimulation intensity of 120% of the subject's resting MT, as reported by Levkovitz et al.(4). Furthermore, we selected these FDA approved dTMS parameters, so that for one session each dTMS repetition includes 2-sec pulse trains separated by 20-sec inter-train intervals. Patients will receive 55 trains in each treatment session, for a total of 1980 pulses per session. This makes 9900 pulses/day, and in total 39600 pulses per treatment.</description>

    <description>A Magstim Rapid2 Plus1 Magnetic Stimulator connected to the Brainsway dTMS system with the H1-coil investigational device (Brainsway Ltd, Jerusalem, Israel). The coil is situated inside a helmet to achieve effective cooling during stimulation. A sham coil is also included in the same helmet. The sham coil mimics scalp sensations and the acoustic artifact of the active stimulation without inducing neuronal activation.</description>
