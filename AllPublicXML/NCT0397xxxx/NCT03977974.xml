    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to learn more about the safety and side effects of
      LY3526318 when given by mouth to healthy participants. The study will have two parts. Each
      participant will enroll in only one part. For each participant, Part A will last up to 28
      days and Part B will last up to 51 days, including screening and follow-up.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Part A Cohorts:

        - Healthy male participants (including self-reported surgically sterile males) must agree
        to the following:

          -  When engaging in sex with Women of Child-Bearing Potential (WOCBP) both the male
             participant and his female partner must use highly effective contraception consisting
             of 2 forms of birth control (1 of which must be a male barrier method such as a latex
             or polyurethane condom) from start of dosing throughout the clinical study period, and
             for 90 days after the final study drug administration

          -  Nonsurgically sterile male participants must not donate sperm at any time from start
             of dosing until 90 days beyond the administration of study drug

        All Part A and Part B Cohorts:

          -  Female participants must be nonpregnant and not lactating, or of nonchildbearing
             potential (either surgically sterilized [e.g. tubal occlusion, hysterectomy, bilateral
             salpingectomy] or physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant, or postmenopausal
             with amenorrhea for at least 12 consecutive months). Healthy female participants of
             child-bearing potential who have a fertile male sexual partner must be willing and
             able to practice effective contraception from admission to 30 days after the final
             visit. Sexually active participants must use a combination of 2 of the following
             methods of contraception, including at least 1 so-called 'barrier' method:

               -  Hormonal contraceptive (oral, transdermal patches, vaginal or injectable)

               -  Intrauterine device with or without hormones

               -  Condom ('barrier' method)

               -  Diaphragm or cervical cap

               -  Sexual abstinence

          -  Have a body mass index 18 to 32 kilograms per square meter (kg/mÂ²)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Are currently enrolled in a clinical study involving an investigational product or any
             other type of medical research judged not to be scientifically or medically compatible
             with this study

          -  Have a history or presence of medical illness including, but not limited to, any
             cardiovascular, hepatic, respiratory, hematological, endocrine, psychiatric or
             neurological disease, convulsions, or any clinically significant laboratory
             abnormality

          -  In the opinion of the investigator are considered to be a danger to themselves

          -  Have an abnormality in the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG)

          -  Have a history of clinically significant multiple or severe drug allergies or severe
             post treatment hypersensitivity reactions

          -  Have donated blood of more than 500 milliliter (mL) within the previous month

          -  Are unwilling to stop alcohol and caffeinated beverage consumption and smoking/use of
             tobacco while resident in the CRU

          -  Have an average weekly alcohol intake that exceeds 21 units per week (1 unit = 12
             ounces (oz) or 360 mL of beer; 5 oz or 150 mL of wine; 1.5 oz or 45 mL of distilled
             spirits

          -  Have an abnormal blood pressure

          -  Participants with a history of drug abuse

          -  Have received treatment with biologic agents (such as monoclonal antibodies, including
             marketed drugs) within 3 months or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer)

          -  Are unwilling to comply with the required dietary restrictions
