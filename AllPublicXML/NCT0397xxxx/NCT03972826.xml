  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will assess whether applying Provodine, an FDA-approved hand hygiene
      product with a long duration of anti-microbial action, to healthcare workers' hands protects
      against self-contamination during the removal of personal protective equipment (gloves,
      gowns, etc).

      We will perform a two-armed pilot test among 40 front-line healthcare workers (nurses,
      doctors, respiratory therapists, etc) at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics.
      Participants will serve as their own controls. First, participants will perform hand hygiene
      with alcohol-based hand rub as they normally would in clinical practice then don PPE. We, the
      research team, will contaminate participating healthcare workers' (HCW) PPE with either
      bacteriophage MS2 (twenty participants) or S. marcescens ATCC 14756 (twenty participants).
      MS2 preparation and propagation and S. marcescens culture suspensions will each be performed
      as previously described. The MS2 bacteriophage will be suspended in 0.01 M phosphate-buffered
      saline and each PPE site will be contaminated with 10^5 plaque-forming units (PFU) of MS2 in
      5 drops of 5 Î¼L each. Aliquots of 3 mL of S. marcescens broth suspension (yielding bacterial
      titers of ~1 X 10^9 CFU/ml) will be applied to each PPE site. Participants will then doff PPE
      using the Centers for Disease Control's (CDC) recommended protocol. We will sample their
      hands using the bag broth method. A research assistant will monitor participants as they wash
      their hands with soap and water then rinse their hands with 70% ethanol. Participants will
      then apply ProvodineTM to their hands and put on (don) fresh PPE. We will repeat the
      contamination, doffing, and sampling procedure. For MS2 recovery, we will assay the eluent
      using the most probable number (MPN) enrichment infectivity assay. For S. marcescens
      recovery, we will dilute the eluent, plate it, incubate the plates, and count the colonies as
      described.
