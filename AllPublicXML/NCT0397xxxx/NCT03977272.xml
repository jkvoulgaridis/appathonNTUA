  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prognosis of pancreatic cancer is extremely poor. NCCN guidelines recommend FOLFIRINOX or
      modified-FOLFIRINOX as the first-line chemotherapeutic regimen. Studies have shown that
      immunotherapy with Anti-PD-1 antibody can effectively increase the response rate and prolong
      patient survival in a number of cancer diseases. Here investigators intend to compare the
      therapeutic effects of modified-FOLFIRINOX alone and the combination of modified-FOLFIRINOX
      and Anti-PD-1 antibody in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.

      Metastatic pancreatic cancer patients will be enrolled in this trial. Investigators will
      assign patients to the treatment after randomization. The primary endpoint is overall
      survival. Response rate, progression-free survival, drugs related side effects and other
      endpoints events will be recorded and analyzed, to assess the combination treatment with
      modified-FOLFIRINOX and Anti-PD-1 antibody could or couldn't benefit the patients with
      metastatic pancreatic cancer.
