      Background:

      Stroke is highly prevalence neurological condition and causing many disabilities worldwide.
      Impaired Balance, Gait disability and limited Range of motion are the major problems in the
      chronic stage of stroke. Taping technique increases the sense of proprioception and improves
      the accurate position of joint by limiting or facilitating the movements. Calcaneal taping
      technique helps to correct the determinants of gait, improvement of balance and ankle range
      of motion.

      Aim:

      The goal of the study is to verify the effect of calcaneal taping technique on balance, gait
      and range of motion in patients with chronic stroke.

      Methods:

      This randomized clinical trial study will recruit patients with chronic stroke (≥6 months) on
      the basis of selection criteria. Patients with age between 40-80 years and grade ≥ 2 of
      modified asworth scale for ankle joint will be included. Patients with any Cognition
      problems, balance disorders, any case of fracture and history of surgery in ankle, diabetic
      foot and neuropathic joints will be excluded from the study. Participants will be selected
      randomly by criterion based sampling method and will be allocated into two groups
      (experimental and control group).Experimental group will receive calcaneal taping and
      conventional therapy whereas control group will receive sham taping and conventional therapy.
      Assessment of balance, gait and range of motion will be taken prior and after the
      intervention.

      Data Analysis:

      Estimation of normal distribution will be done by Shapiro Wilk test. Descriptive statistics
      data will be expressed as mean ± standard deviation and median ± interquartile range, based
      on the normality. Between groups comparison will be done by independent t-test /Mann Whitney
      U test and within group comparison will be done by Paired t-test/ Wilcoxon signed rank test.

      1. Introduction

           Stroke leads to many disabilities such as balance impairment,weakness in various groups
           of muscles, impairment of gait parameters and limitations of range of motion.Balance and
           gait disability are the main impairments among chronic stroke survivors.Lower extremity
           dysfunctions affect the walking ability and balance. Ankle dorsiflexion (weakness in
           dorsiflexor muscles) and increase in the tone of triceps surae (plantar flexor muscles)
           is the major leading cause of impairment of balance and gait parameters.Application of
           taping on calcaneus (favouring dorsiflexion &amp; eversion) will provide normal determinants
           of gait and improve balance, as it significantly improving the accurate joint position
           by limiting or facilitating the movement.

           1.1.Problem Statement: In patients with chronic stroke immediate effects of different
           types of taping technique &amp; targeted areas to determine its impact on balance , gait and
           range of motion has been checked.This study thus aims to evaluate the long term effects
           and application of calcaneal taping in the improvement of balance ,gait and range of
           motion in chronic stroke survivors .

           1.2.Purpose of the study: The study is targeting the calcaneus bone for the application
           of taping technique in patients with chronic stroke for the improvement of balance, gait
           and range of motion.

           1.3.Objectives of the study: To improve the balance (static &amp; dynamic), gait parameters
           and ankle joint range of motion by the application of calcaneal taping in patients with
           chronic stroke.

        2. Procedure:

      Patients with chronic stroke on the basis of selection criteria will be randomly selected for
      both groups(experimental and control group).Procedure will be explained to the patients and
      written consent will be taken from them.

      Outcome measurements will be taken prior and after the intervention.Foot print method will be
      used for the analysis of gait parameters( step length, stride length and cadence ).Balance
      error scoring system (BESS) will be used for the assessment of static balance.Timed Up &amp; Go
      test (TUG) will be performed for the assessment of dynamic balance.Universal goniometer will
      be used for the measurement of ankle joint range of motion.

      Interventions: In experimental group - Calcaneal taping will be provide to the patients by
      focusing the dorsiflexion with eversion (with stretch) in long sitting position foot out of
      edge. Conventional therapy (muscle strengthening exercises, balance related activities ) will
      be given to the patients.

      In control group- Sham taping (without stretch) will be provide and conventional therapy
      (muscle strengthening exercises, balance related activities ) to the patients.
