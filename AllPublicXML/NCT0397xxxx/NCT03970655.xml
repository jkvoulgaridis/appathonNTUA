    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of the addition of epinephrine to bilateral
      real time ultrasound guided pterygopalatine ganglion blocks on intra-operative bleeding and
      blood loss during functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      FESS is the treatment of choice in patients with medically refractory chronic rhinosinusitis
      and chronic polypous rhinosinusitis. This surgery relies on minimal surgical site bleeding to
      be performed efficiently and safely. Hemorrhage during FESS decreases visibility of the
      surgical field and this increases the risk of vascular, orbital and intracranial
      complications as well as procedural failure. Thus the importance of minimizing surgical
      bleeding in this procedure. The maxillary artery is the primary blood supply for the sinuses
      and midface. Conceptually the application of epinephrine into the pterygopalatine fossa onto
      the maxillary artery with the block should result in constriction of this artery and
      subsequently, less bleeding from the surgical site. This randomized, double-blinded,
      controlled pilot study will investigate the utility of addition of epinephrine to bilateral
      pterygopalatine ganglion blocks performed under ultrasound guidance in minimizing surgical
      site bleeding and overall blood loss and the potential for shortening the surgical time.
