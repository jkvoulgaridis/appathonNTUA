      This study aims to test the hypothesis that addition of Individual Placement and Support
      (IPS) and/or Cognitive Remediation Therapy (CRT) in addition to treatment as usual in
      patients with early psychosis will be feasible and acceptable in patients with early
      schizophrenia.

      This is an assessor blind, randomised controlled trial, employing a factorial design. This
      trial aims to assess the feasibility of IPS, CRT or their combination as an add on to
      treatment as usual. Patients with early schizophrenia spectrum disorder will be recruited
      from major psychiatric units in Pakistan. Treatment as usual (TAU) will comprise of patient's
      current antipsychotic medication as prescribed by their responsible clinician. Patients will
      be randomised into IPS, CRT, their combination or TAU, according to the 2x2 factorial
      schedule in the table. A total of 30 participants will be recruited in each cell, giving a
      total of 120 participants.
