      The overall aim of this program of research is to decrease anxiety in urogical scheduled
      patients for surgical intervention developing an nursing communication instrument: a Guide of
      Hosting for urological scheduled patients for surgical intervention.

      The purpose of the proposed project is to establish the feasibility and acceptability of this
      guide to decrease the anxiety in this patients, using a randomized clinical trial like a
      research design, which would test the effectiveness of this communication instrument in
      comparation to a control condition (patients without guide of housting).

      To achieve the investigators specific aims, the investigator conducted a randomized clinical
      trial (n=50), with two groups: intervention group (with Guide of Hosting) and control group
      (which shows a control condition).

      Valuation instruments were two validated scales: ESAS y HADS. Anxiety was the primary outcome
      variable assessed in the RCT; depression and pain were a secondary outcomes variables.
