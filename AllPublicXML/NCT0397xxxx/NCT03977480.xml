    <textblock>
      This study adopts a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, low-medium-high dose group and
      placebo parallel controlled clinical study design. After screening, patients with active
      ulcerative colitis who meet the inclusion criteria and do not meet the exclusion criteria
      will be randomized by 1:1:1:1 to Hemay007 400 mg BID group, 800 mg QD group, 600 mg BID group
      or placebo group, with proposed 72 cases in each group. After 12 weeks of double-blind
      inductive treatment period, the patients will enter the Hemay007 open treatment period of 12
      weeks when Hemay007 600 mg BID will be used as the medication regimen. All randomized
      subjects who have received the investigational drug should be subjected to a 4-week
      observation after the end of treatment.
