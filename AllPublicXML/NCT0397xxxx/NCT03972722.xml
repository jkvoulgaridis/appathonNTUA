         10. Patients must agree to provide either an archival tumor tissue sample or fresh biopsy
             sample for baseline biomarker tissue analyses, including staining for PD-L1. If
             archival tissue is not available and the patient does not have biopsy-accessible tumor
             lesions, the patient will be excluded.
