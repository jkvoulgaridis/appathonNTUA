      The purpose of this study is to determine whether IFX-1 is safe and effective in the
      treatment of pyoderma gangrenosum.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neutrophilic dermatoses are a spectrum of inflammatory disorders characterized by skin
      lesions resulting from a neutrophil-rich inflammatory infiltrate in the absence of infection.
      Pyoderma gangrenosum is associated with a neutrophilic leukocytosis, which is likely to be
      triggered by C5a. This study is set up based on the hypothesis that IFX-1 might be able to
      block C5a induced pro-inflammatory effects such as neutrophil activation and cytokine
      generation, potentially contributing to the local skin inflammation and tissue damage.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of an ulcerative form of pyoderma gangrenosum confirmed by the investigator

        In addition, the subject must fulfill at least 3 of the following 6 criteria at screening:

        History of

          -  Pathergy (ulcer occurring at the sites of trauma)

          -  Personal history of inflammatory bowel disease or inflammatory arthritis

          -  History of papule, pustule or vesicle that rapidly ulcerated

        Clinical examination (or photographic evidence) of

          -  Peripheral erythema, undermining border, and tenderness at site of ulceration

          -  Multiple ulcerations (at least 1 occurring on the lower leg)

          -  Cribriform or &quot;wrinkled paper&quot; scar(s) at sites of healed ulcers

        Subject has a minimum of 1 evaluable ulcer (≥2 cm2) on the lower extremity at screening

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pyoderma gangrenosum target ulcer for more than 3 years before screening

          -  Surgical wound debridement within the previous 2 weeks before screening

          -  Use of intravenous antibacterials, antivirals, anti-fungals, or anti-parasitic agents
             within 30 days before screening

          -  Any drug treatment for pyoderma gangrenosum including corticosteroids (&gt;10 mg),
             intralesional steroids, cyclosporine A, biologicals and immunosuppressives (with the
             exception of antibiotics for wound superinfection) used within a time of 5 half-lives
             of the drug before screening
