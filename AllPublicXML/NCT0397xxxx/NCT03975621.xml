  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Determine the acceptability and feasibility of a supportive care software platform to improve
      quality of life and function in metastatic breast cancer patients. Acceptability will be
      defined as the proportion of women offered the intervention who agree to participate.
      Feasibility will be defined as the proportion of women who consent, take a tablet home, who
      actually interact with the tablet and participate at least one month of the program.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Goals of the Nurse AMIE software program are to regularly assess psychosocial, functional,
      and symptom needs among metastatic breast cancer patients and to provide appropriate
      interventions via YouTube style videos, weekly phone calls with a patient navigator at Penn
      State, and appropriate referrals to phone or in person consultations as needed. The proposed
      Nurse AMIE software program will allow for the provision of resources (YouTube style videos,
      audio files, exercises) to intervene on many of the common symptoms and challenges
      experienced by metastatic patients. This is an identified need on the part of both metastatic
      patients and their medical care teams. Finally, it will also allow patient navigators to
      check in with patients, reviewing responses to surveys, discerning whether new or different
      interventions are needed, and connecting women to palliative care and other services if
      additional care is warranted.

    <measure>Quality of Life: Short Form 36</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36) is a 36-item, patient-reported survey of patient health. The SF-36 is a measure of health status and an abbreviated variant of it.
The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life: Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- Breast</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B), is a 44-item self-report instrument designed to measure multidimensional quality of life (QOL) in patients with breast cancer.
The FACT-B questionnaire includes 44 items, consisting of 5 subscales, all subscale items are summed to a total. The higher the score the better QOL</description>

    <measure>Physical Function: Short Physical Performance Battery</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Objectively-measured physical function will be assessed using the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB). The SPPB is an accumulation of balance tests, 4-meter gait speed, and 5-chair stands. Based on the time needed to complete the chair stands, a score is given. A summation of scores from all tests is taken, ranging from 0 -12. A higher score = Higher physical function.</description>

    <measure>Sleep: Sleep Quality Assessment (PSQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep quality and sleep problems will be assessed with the validated and frequently used Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).
In scoring the PSQI, seven component scores are derived, each scored 0 (no difficulty) to 3 (severe difficulty). The component scores are summed to produce a global score (range 0 to 21). Higher scores indicate worse sleep quality.</description>

    <measure>Pain: Brief Pain Inventory (Short Form)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Bodily pain will be assessed using the Brief Pain Inventory- Short form (BPI-SF).
The BPI gives two main scores: a pain severity score and a pain interference score. The pain severity score is calculated from the four items about pain intensity. Each item is rated from 0, no pain, to 10, pain as bad as you can imagine, and contributes with the same weight to the final score, ranging from 0 to 40. The pain interference score corresponds to the item on pain interference. The seven sub-items are rated from 0, does not interfere, to 10, completely interferes, and contributes with the same weight to the final score, ranging from 0 to 70.</description>

    <measure>Fatigue: Brief Fatigue Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) is used to rapidly assess the severity and impact of cancer-related fatigue. An increasing focus on cancer-related fatigue emphasized the need for sensitive tools to assess this most frequently reported symptom. The six interference items correlate with standard quality-of-life measures.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Immediate Intervention</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The immediate intervention group will receive the intervention at the time of consent (baseline) and will be enrolled in the intervention for a total of 6 months. Patients will receive the tablet, a pedometer and an exercise band. Patients will use Nurse AMIE while receiving weekly phone calls from a patient navigator. After 90 days of the intervention observation will take place for 90 days, the patient will be asked to continue using Nurse AMIE without a patient navigator's presence.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Delayed Intervention</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The delayed intervention group will receive the intervention 3 months after consent (6 months of intervention with 3 months delay total of 9 months); the patient will then follow the same pattern as listed above. The only difference is we will ask the delayed intervention group to wear a FitBit device for 1 week following consent in order to gain baseline data as to their activity/movement.</description>
