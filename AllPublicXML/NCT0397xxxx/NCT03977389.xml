      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of total wrist
      denervation on pain by assessing the surgery survival.

      The residual functional wrist's quality and the patients' satisfaction will also be evaluate.

    <textblock>
      The degenerative diseases of the wrist are numerous and include both post-traumatic
      osteoarthritis lesions and inflammatory diseases. In any case, one of the main reasons for
      consultation is pain. In case of inefficiency of a well-conducted medical treatment (splints,
      anti-inflammatories, infiltrations), surgical management remains difficult because of the
      multitude of treatments that can be offered: partial or total arthrodesis of the wrist,
      prosthetic arthroplasties, pyrocarbon implants or proximal row carpectomy. But these
      treatments are heavy and can potentially be sources of complications such as stiffness, loss
      of strength or progressive wear of the implant.

      Total wrist denervation is an alternative since 1966. The original technique follows an
      anatomical study of the innervation of the upper limb. This technique has been proven to
      significantly improve pain without major after effects. Several teams demonstrated a decrease
      in pain associated with conserved strength and mobility, but few studies have studied the
      long-term results of this technique, especially on the absence of residual pain.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of denervation on pain
      by assessing the surgery survival, the residual functional wrist's quality and the patients'
      satisfaction.

        Patients undergoing total wrist denervation (TWD) between January 1995 and December 2013 at
        Brest CHRU, performed by the same senior surgeon.

        TWD was indicated in a routine procedure for degenerative diseases of the wrist
        (post-traumatic osteoarthritis lesions and inflammatory diseases).

        The aetiologies are varied: SLAC-wrist, distal radius fractures, SNAC-wrist, Kienb√∂ck
        disease, chondrocalcinosis, peri-lunar luxation of the carpus, rheumatoid arthritis,
        haemochromatoses, ruptures of the luno-triquetral ligament.
