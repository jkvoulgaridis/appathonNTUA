  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In anesthesia the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications is frequent, especially
      in cardiac surgery where the incidence can reach 10%. Respiratory morbidity in cardiac
      surgery is favored by multiple factors and is higher compared to anesthesia in &quot;general&quot;
      surgery. The prevention of these complications is a major challenge in the management of
      patients.

      Influence of driving pressure level on respiratory morbidity was first demonstrated in
      management of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in resuscitation.

      More recently, this notion has been introduced in anesthesia, with a correlation between
      increase driving pressure level and increase of post-operative respiratory complications.

      A method should reduce these levels of driving pressure: performing lung recruitment
      maneuvers. This technique has been successfully tested in abdominal surgery in particular in
      a study published by Futier et al.. They systematized and standardized lung recruitment
      maneuvers and showed a decrease of postoperative pulmonary complications in abdominal
      surgery.

      Thus, the realization of lung recruitment maneuvers, already used at the discretion of the
      practitioner, is now recommended by several teams of experts. The investigators propose in
      this &quot;before-after&quot; trial to evaluate variation in driving pressure due to systematic use of
      lung recruitment maneuvers, observed in patients operated in elective or urgent surgery. The
      secondary objective is to evaluate their impact on postoperative pulmonary complications.

    <description>We collect data in consecutive patients operated after the implementation of lung recruitment maneuvers protocol. This lung recruitment maneuvers will be realised along the surgery, (After tracheal intubation, per-CPB, post-CPB). Each recruitment maneuver consisted of applying a continuous positive airway pressure of 30 cm of water for 30 seconds</description>
