  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective was to assess if performing a pre-intervention gadolinium-enhanced extracranial
      magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA) in addition to intracranial vascular imaging was
      associated with improved thrombectomy time metrics.

      Consecutive patients (912) treated by mechanical thrombectomy (MT) at a large comprehensive
      stroke center between January 2012 and December 2017 who were screened using pre-intervention
      MRI were included. Patient's characteristics and procedural data were collected. Analyses
      were performed to compare mechanical thrombectomy speed, efficacy, complications, and
      clinical outcomes between patients with and without pre-intervention gadolinium-enhanced
      extracranial MRA.
