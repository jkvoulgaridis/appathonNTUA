  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) secondary to pathologic myopia (PM-CNV) is a common
      vision-threatening complication and often affects adults of working age. Intravitreal
      injection of any anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) drugs would significantly
      suppress the activity of the CNV and finally improve the visual acuity. However, more than
      half of the patients would need one or more further injection for the recurrence or
      uncontrolled with 1+pro re nata (PRN) treatment within one year, and whether increasing the
      initial loading of intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF would be more efficacy for the
      controlling the PM-CNV remained unknown.
