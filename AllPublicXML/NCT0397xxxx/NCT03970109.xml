      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of two different doses of
      ANS-6637, 200 mg (given as 2 x 100 mg tablet) and 600 mg (given as 2 x 300 mg tablet) once a
      day, and matched placebo, on alcohol cue-elicited alcohol craving during a human laboratory
      paradigm after 1 week of daily dosing among subjects with moderate to severe alcohol use
      disorder (AUD) as confirmed by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders -
      Fifth Edition (DSM-5â„¢).

    <description>The primary efficacy endpoint is the change in the &quot;strength&quot; of alcohol craving Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score in response to an alcohol cue minus the alcohol craving VAS score in response to a water cue during the alcohol cue reactivity session at Week 2 - after one week of investigational product treatment. The VAS has a minimum=0 and maximum=20 with higher values indicative of greater craving for alcohol.</description>
