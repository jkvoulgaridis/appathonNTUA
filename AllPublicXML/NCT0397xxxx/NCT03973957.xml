  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a prospective, randomized trial comparing a new protocol to the standard
      of care. The investigators protocol and the standard of care involves a previously
      established procedure that will be completed in the investigators pulmonary procedure unit.
      The study will include using previously, well-established procedures (indwelling pleural
      catheter placement, talc slurry administration through an indwelling pleural catheter,
      pleuroscopy with talc poudrage administration) in addition to a new protocol (at home
      continuous drainage via indwelling pleural catheter).

    <textblock>
      The study design is a prospective, randomized and controlled trial comparing a new protocol
      to the standard of care. To the investigators knowledge, there is no similar protocol and
      this will be a single center, pilot study. The control arm will consist of subjects who meet
      the inclusion criteria for the study and will receive current standard of care management for
      paramalignant pleural effusion. This will consist of either an indwelling pleural catheter
      (IPC) placement with subsequent talc slurry administration and hospital admission for
      continuous drainage, or schedule medical pleuroscopy with talc insufflation poudrage and
      subsequent IPC placement for continuous drainage while in the hospital. The intervention arm
      will consist of subjects who meet the inclusion criteria and then will be scheduled for IPC
      placement in the pulmonary procedure unit as either an outpatient visit or during their
      hospital admission (if the subject is already admitted to the hospital and recruited via our
      inpatient consult service). The subjects in this arm will then go home or back to their
      original admission status with a drainage bag for continuous drainage on the same day as the
      procedure. This protocol will utilize a circuit with an IPC connected to a continuous
      drainage bag via a one-way Heimlich valve. It is important to note that while utilizing this
      circuit is a new protocol for patients with paramalignant pleural effusions, the protocol is
      the current standard of care practice for patients with pneumothorax and persistent air leak,
      and is being utilized regularly for these patients by the investigator's department as
      standard of care for patient needing long-term chest tubes while at home.

    <description>If undergoing talc slurry in the control arm, the patient will undergo IPC placement in the pulmonary procedure unit on day one of admission. The IPC will then be connected to a pleur-evac as standard of care protocol for chest tube drainage. At 1-2 hours post-IPC placement a chest x-ray will be obtained to assess for full lung re-expansion. If the lung does not fully expand the patient will be excluded from the study. Once full lung re-expansion has occurred, talc slurry will be ordered and the patient will be given 25 mcg of IV fentanyl. Talc slurry (5 g sterile talc, brand name Steritalc, mixed with 50 cc or sterile normal saline in a syringe, per Cooper University Pharmacy protocol) will be administered via the IPC. The patient will remain in the hospital, with continuous drainage measured daily for 2-5 days, depending on drainage of the effusion.</description>

    <description>An indwelling pleural catheter (IPC) will be placed during this visit. After complete drainage of the effusion, a chest x-ray will be done to determine if full lung reexpansion occurs. If there is lack of full lung re-expansion the patient will be excluded from the study at this time. If full lung re-expansion is present, the patient will receive an intravenous line (IV) by our nursing staff for analgesia prior to talc administration and will be pre-treated with 25 mcg of IV fentanyl.
Talc slurry (5 g sterile talc, brand name Steritalc, mixed with 50 cc or sterile normal saline in a syringe, per Cooper University Pharmacy protocol) will then be administered through the IPC. The IPC will then be connected to a circuit that will consist of the IPC connected to a 4-liter fluid drainage collection bag via a one-way Heimlich valve (picture of set up included in additional documents).</description>
