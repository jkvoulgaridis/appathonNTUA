  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      DLBCL has the highest frequency out of all lymphoid malignancies. With the recent development
      of antitumor agents targeting intracellular/extracellular cell signaling pathways, patients
      have access to various treatment options after relapse. Therefore, for the purpose of
      developing effective treatment strategies, large-scale genomic data accumulation is necessary
      to understand the mechanism of relapse and refractory state of DLBCL.

      -  To understand the mechanism of relapse by genome sequencing with tissues/blood obtained
           at diagnosis and relapse in patients with diffuse B cell lymphoma who relapsed after
           standard chemotherapy, to evaluate their response and survival following a salvage
           therapy depending on the genomic sequencing results, and to understand the prognostic or
           predictive value of genomic mutation.

        -  To understand the predictive value of genetic information with regard to the response to
           salvage chemotherapy and survival outcome in patients with newly diagnosed/relapsed or
           refractory large B cell lymphoma

        -  To determine the association between gene mutation, treatment response and prognosis in
           relapsed/refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and to develop a clinically
           applicable platform by establishing a genetic data register based on prospective studies

    <ipd_description>Data management of this clinical trial should be done in accordance with the ICH(International Conference on Harmonization)-GCP(Good Clinical Practice) and KGCP (Korean Good Clinical Practice)guidelines. To ensure the anonymity of subjects, each subject will be identified and managed by a randomly assigned subject number, instead of his/her name, in all documents so that persons not involved in the study could not identify subjects from their personal data.
Subjects participating in this clinical trial may have to provide some of their personal information, but such information will not be directly used or necessary in the study but will be used only for the purpose of connecting clinical data obtained for the clinical trial. Collected information will be used until the clinical trial report is complete.</ipd_description>
