  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Halitosis is the term used to define an unpleasant odor emanating from the mouth. Some lung
      diseases, such as bronchiectasis, are among the extra-oral causes of this condition. However,
      no studies have evaluated the causes and treatment of halitosis in the population of adults
      with bronchiectasis. Methods and analysis: A randomized, controlled trial is proposed. The
      patients (n=80) with halitosis patients will be divided into two groups: G1- aPDT
      (Photodynamic Therapy) (n = 40); G2- tongue scraper, 10 teeth or more (n = 40). Halitosis
      will be evaluated based on the measurement of volatile sulfur compounds using gas
      chromatography. The participants will be randomized into two subgroups: treatment with
      photodynamic therapy (n = 40) or cleaning of the tongue with a tongue scraper (n = 40). After
      the treatments, a second evaluation will be performed, along with a microbiological analysis
      (qPCR) for the identification of the bacteria P. gingivalis and T. denticola. If the
      halitosis persists, the participants will received periodontal treatment The evaluation of
      halitosis and the microbiological analysis will be repeated. If the halitosis is resolved,
      the participants will return after three months for an additional evaluation. This protocol
      will determine the effectiveness of phototherapy regarding the reduction of halitosis in
      healthy older adults and those with bronchiectasis.

      A single-center, randomized, controlled, single-blind clinical trial was designed in
      accordance with the criteria recommended for interventional trials in the SPIRIT Statement.
      The project for the proposed study received approval from the Human Research Ethics Committee
      ofNove de Julho University(certificate number: 1057901).

      Selection of individuals - characterization of sample - Two groups will be composed of adults
      in treatment at the dental clinic of Nove de Julho University. After verbal and written
      explanations of the study, those who agree to participate will sign a statement of informed
      consent approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of Nove de Julho University. The
      study will be conducted in compliance with the precepts stipulated in the Declaration of
      Helsinki (revised in Fortaleza, Brazil, 2013).

    <description>The portable Oral ChromaTM will be used for the assessment of halitosis. Oral air collection will follow the manufactured guide lines (Oral Chroma Manual Instruction). A syringe will be placed in the patient's mouth with the plunger completely inserted and the participant will breathe through the nose with the mouth closed for one minute.The plunger will then be withdrawn to fill the chamber with air. The gas injection needle will be placed on the syringe and the plunger will be adjusted to 0.5 ml. This air will be injected into the input of the device in a single motion. This procedure will be done before, immediately after aPDT or scraper and after periodontal treatment.</description>
