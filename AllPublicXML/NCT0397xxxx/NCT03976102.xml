  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the current study is to demonstrate the equivalent efficacy of
      rituximab (DRL_RI) and MabThera® in subjects with Low Tumor Burden Follicular Lymphoma
      (LTB-FL).

      Also evaluated by Pharmacokinetic, safety, and immunogenicity assessment between a proposed
      biosimilar (DRL_RI) and the RMP, as an component of clinical study program, and collectively
      providing the evidence of biosimilarity.

      The study will compare the safety and efficacy of DRL_RI vs MabThera in patients with Low
      Tumor Burden Follicular Lymphoma (LTB-FL). The primary objective is to establish comparative
      efficacy as measured by ORR at week 28

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is planned to randomise approx. 284 subjects at approximately 130 study sites worldwide.
      Subjects with LTB-FL will be randomized to receive either DRL_RI or MabThera®. Till date, 68
      patients have been randomized for the study.

      The study specific objectives are mentioned below:

      Primary Objective:

        -  To demonstrate the equivalent efficacy of DRL_RI (biosimilar rituximab) and MabThera in
           subjects with CD20-positive, LTB FL, as measured by overall response rate (ORR) at Week
           28 Secondary Objectives:

        -  To compare the progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and duration of
           response (DOR) of DRL_RI with MabThera in subjects with CD20-positive, LTB FL.

        -  To compare the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of DRL_RI with MabThera in
           subjects with CD20-positive, LTB-FL.

      Exploratory Objectives

        -  To explore the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of DRL_RI and MabThera, using a
           population-PK modelling approach.

        -  To explore the pharmacodynamic parameters of DRL_RI and MabThera.
