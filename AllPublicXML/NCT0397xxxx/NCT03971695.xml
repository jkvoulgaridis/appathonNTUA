      The main objectives are:

        -  Part I: To investigate safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of BI 706321 in
           healthy male subjects following oral administration of single rising doses.

        -  Part II: The relative bioavailability of BI 706321 after administration of tablets and
           capsules under fasted conditions will be compared with each other and the effect of food
           on the tablet bioavailability will be investigated.

          -  Inability to comply with the dietary regimen of the trial site

          -  A marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTc interval (such as QTc intervals that are

          -  A history of additional risk factors for Torsade de Pointes (such as heart failure,
             hypokalaemia, or family history of Long QT Syndrome)

          -  Subject is assessed as unsuitable for inclusion by the investigator, for instance,
             because the subject is not considered able to understand and comply with study
             requirements, or has a condition that would not allow safe participation in the study

          -  Male subjects with WOCBP partner who are unwilling to use male contraception (condom
             or sexual abstinence) from time point of administration of trial medication until 30
             days thereafter. Sperm donation is not allowed from the time point of drug
             administration until 30 days thereafter.
