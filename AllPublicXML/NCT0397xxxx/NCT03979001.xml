  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSA) is thought to lead to systemic vascular lesions that
      may be preceded by early microvascular lesions in the eyes and in particular in the retina.
      The improvement of ophthalmological imaging techniques by OCTangiography allows a precise
      non-invasive study of the retinal microvascular network. This new rapid and non-invasive
      retinal imaging tool could reveal micro-vascular lesions related to OSA. To the
      investigator's knowledge, this would be the first OCT-angiography description of a cohort of
      patients with OSA. If these results are confirmed, it would be interesting to study the
      correlation between these micro-vascular lesions and the cardiovascular risk of his patients.
