    <measure>Number of Pertussis Cases and Matched Controls Among Infants Born to Mothers Vaccinated With Boostrix Vaccine (During Third Trimester of Pregnancy) or Not Exposed to Any Tdap Vaccine During Pregnancy</measure>

    <description>Vaccine effectiveness at preventing pertussis occurrence in infants &lt; 2 months old is assessed by comparing the Boostrix immunization status during the third pregnancy trimester in mothers of infant pertussis cases and matched controls. The association between maternal Boostrix vaccination and pertussis in infants was analyzed using conditional logistic regression. The multivariate analysis was performed to obtain the adjusted values. Covariates that were statistically significant in the univariate analysis or considered as clinically significant were included in the multivariable conditional logistic regression model. Subjects with missing or unknown values, if any, for at least one of the risk factors were excluded from the model.</description>

        <title>Number of Pertussis Cases and Matched Controls Among Infants Born to Mothers Vaccinated With Boostrix Vaccine (During Third Trimester of Pregnancy) or Not Exposed to Any Tdap Vaccine During Pregnancy</title>
        <description>Vaccine effectiveness at preventing pertussis occurrence in infants &lt; 2 months old is assessed by comparing the Boostrix immunization status during the third pregnancy trimester in mothers of infant pertussis cases and matched controls. The association between maternal Boostrix vaccination and pertussis in infants was analyzed using conditional logistic regression. The multivariate analysis was performed to obtain the adjusted values. Covariates that were statistically significant in the univariate analysis or considered as clinically significant were included in the multivariable conditional logistic regression model. Subjects with missing or unknown values, if any, for at least one of the risk factors were excluded from the model.</description>

        <title>Number of Pertussis Cases Leading to Hospitalization and Matched Controls in Infants Born to Mothers Vaccinated With Boostrix (Before Pregnancy, During First or Second, Third Trimester, After Pregnancy) or Not Exposed to Any Tdap Vaccine During Pregnancy</title>
        <description>Vaccine effectiveness at preventing pertussis occurrence leading to hospitalization in infants &lt; 2 months old is assessed by comparing the Boostrix immunization status before pregnancy, during first or second, third trimester, after pregnancy in mothers of infant pertussis cases and matched controls. The association between maternal Boostrix vaccination and pertussis in infants was analyzed using conditional logistic regression. The multivariate analysis was performed to obtain the adjusted values. Covariates that were statistically significant in the univariate analysis or considered as clinically significant were included in the multivariable conditional logistic regression model. Subjects with missing or unknown values, if any, for at least one of the risk factors were excluded from the model.</description>

        <population>The analysis includes cases leading to hospitalization and at least one matched control born from mothers either unvaccinated or vaccinated with Boostrix.
