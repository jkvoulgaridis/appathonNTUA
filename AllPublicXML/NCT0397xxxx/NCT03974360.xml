      An exploratory open-label study of PPTH patients to study the efficacy and tolerability of
      erenumab in the prophylactic treatment of persistent headache attributed to mild traumatic
      injury to the head. Approximately 100 subjects will be included to erenumab 140 mg. Patients
      who have participated in study with prior provocation (Ethics Committee of the Capital Region
      of Denmark (H-1801147 and H-18050498) and who have consented to be contacted will primarily
      be included. The study will begin February 2019 and is expected to last one year. Patients
      responding to advertisement (see add) will be contacted by phone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The reasons and justification of choosing an open-label design are the following:

        1. To date, there are no evidence for prophylactic drugs treating post-traumatic headache.
           Post-traumatic headache patients are notoriously known to be refractory to prophylactic
           treatment and have usually tried several prophylactic drugs such as amitriptylin, which
           is recommended as a prophylactic drug in migraine and chronic tension-type headache, and
           other drugs developed for the treatment of primary headache disorders. First step is
           therefore to show if there is an effect at all following erenumab treatment in these
           refractory PPTH patients.

        2. The refractory nature of PPTH will lower the bias that could occur through placebo
           effects.

        3. The treatment period is also quite long, and the endpoint is assessed in the last month
           of treatment, which will also minimize a placebo effect.

        4. Furthermore, this relatively small exploratory open label study is needed to show if
           there is an effect of erenumab in post-traumatic headache at all and what this effect
           is, before initiating larger multicenter double-blind studies in this patient group.

Each of the 6 questions is responded to using 1 of 5 response categories: &quot;never,&quot; &quot;rarely,&quot;&quot;sometimes,&quot; &quot;very often,&quot; or &quot;always.&quot; For each HIT-6 item, 6, 8, 10, 11, or 13 points, respectively, are assigned to the response provided. Subjects will complete the HIT-6 monthly at each clinical visit.</description>
