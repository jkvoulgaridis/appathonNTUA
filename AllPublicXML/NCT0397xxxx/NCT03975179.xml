    <textblock>
      -  Study phase: 3

        -  Indication: Breast cancer patients undergoing breast conserving surgery

        -  Primary objectives: To determine the effect of selective omission of intraoperative
           margin evaluation via frozen section on margin positive rate Secondary objectives: To
           determine the effect of selective omission of intraoperative margin evaluation via
           frozen section on reoperation rate, local recurrence rate, operation time, resection
           volume, medical cost and patient quality-of life

        -  Hypothesis: Omitting intraoperative margin evaluation via frozen section biopsy in
           selected breast cancer patients does not increase margin positive rate

        -  Study design: Randomized controlled trial

        -  Sample size: 1292 patients

        -  Procedures: breast conserving surgery +/- margin frozen section biopsy (+/- additional
           resection)

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Resection margin status</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks after primary surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Margin status data will be obtained from pathology report. Positive margin is defined as &quot;no ink on tumor&quot; for DCIS and invasive cancer. A close margin of any distance is defined as a negative margin</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Reoperation rate</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months after primary surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Additional operation for re-excision of margin is defined as a reoperation. The decision for a reoperation is determined by the surgeon. Data regarding reoperation and reason for reoperation must be recorded.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Operation time</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after primary surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Operation time is defined by time from incision to closure, which will be obtained from anesthesia report.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cost effectiveness</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months after primary surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Data for in-hospital cost including cost for re-excision will be collected. Opportunity cost due to elongated surgery time and labor costs from the pathology department will also be calculated and included.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Resection volume</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months after primary surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Resected volume is calculated from gross specimen measurements of pathology report (volume = width/2 * height/2 * depth/2). When additional resection is performed, resected volumes are reported separately.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Local recurrence</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years after primary surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Local recurrence is defined as pathologically defined ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence. Median follow up period is 5 years. Annual clinical examination, mammography and breast sonography is warranted for evaluation of local recurrence.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Number of patients with residual cancer after reoperation</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months after primary surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Whether residual cancer cells are present in re-operation specimens for excision of resection margin. Thorough microscopic examinations are warranted for this endpoint.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Number of patients with residual cancer after re-excision according to frozen section biopsy result</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months after primary surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Whether residual cancer cells are present in additional resection specimens performed according to frozen section biopsy result of resection margin. Thorough microscopic examinations are warranted for this endpoint.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Patient quality-of-life assessment: BREAST-Q survey</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year after primary surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Quality-of-life assessment is performed by using the Korean version of the BREAST-Q survey for breast conserving therapy which is a questionnaire for patient reported outcome measurement. An assessment for physical well-being, psychosocial well-being, sexual well-being, satisfaction with breasts/outcome/care will be done. Each subscale will be reported with a scale of 0 - 100. A higher value is considered a better outcome. No total score will be calculated.
The survey module is filled out pre- and post-operatively. Postoperative module is scored 1 month postoperatively (within one month of date of final operation but before start of radiotherapy) and within 2 months of completion of radiotherapy.</description>
