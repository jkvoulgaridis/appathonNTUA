    <textblock>
      Open label randomized controlled trial comparing evidenced based physical/occupational
      therapy vs. physical/occupational therapy including blood flow restriction tourniquet in the
      treatment of lateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be randomized to one of two groups, and treatment will be open label and
      unblinded. A target of 44 patients for enrollment has been set for 80% power. Treatment will
      last for 6 visits with physical therapy with recommended visit intervals of 1 week :

      Intervention Group: Evidence based physical/occupational therapy, with the addition of
      therapeutic exercises using a blood flow restriction tourniquet.

      Control Group: Patients will receive standard evidence based physical therapy

      The primary outcome (Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation [PRTEE]) will be collected at
      enrollment, 3, 6, and 12 months.

      Secondary outcomes will be collected at the beginning and end of physical therapy
      interventions (change in: numeric pain rating scale, maximum pain free grip strength, pain
      free grip strength). We will collect treatments received after the end of physical therapy
      and before final follow up.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The diagnoses included are lateral elbow pain, lateral epicondylitis, or lateral
             epicondylalgia, more general diagnoses elbow tendinitis or elbow pain will be included
             if their clinical picture at physical therapy meets criteria for lateral
             epicondylitis.

          -  If the inclusion diagnosis is other than lateral epicondylitis or tennis elbow (such
             as elbow pain), we will confirm the diagnosis at the first therapy visit with
             tenderness at the lateral epicondyle and/or pain with resisted wrist/long finger
             extension at the lateral epicondyle.

          -  Pain for 4 weeks or more.

          -  All participants must be between the age of 18 and 70 years old and have had pain for
             4 weeks or more.

             affected elbow,

             peripheral vascular disease

          -  Injection therapy (corticosteroid, platelet rich plasma, or other injection therapy)
             in the prior 3 months to the affected site

          -  Current fracture in affected arm

          -  History of crush injury to affected arm

          -  Any surgery on affected arm in last 1 year

          -  Surgical procedure on their contralateral extremity (Changed 9/2019 to surgery within
             last year on contralateral upper extremity).

          -  History of lymphectomy (such as axillary exploration with breast surgery, lymph node
             biopsy in the affected axilla/arm)

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Active infection

          -  Current cancer diagnosis/treatment

          -  Sickle cell anemia or trait

          -  Kidney dialysis
