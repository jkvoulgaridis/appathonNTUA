  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates nutritional status, at predefined points in therapy, and the
      association with outcomes in children and adolescents undergoing treatment for cancer in
      institutions under Asociación de Hemato-Oncología Pediátrica de Centro América (AHOPCA)
      consortium in Central America. The aim of the study is to examine the effects of the
      newly-established nutritional program aimed at improving the delivery of nutritional care and
      outcomes in children undergoing treatment for cancer in Central America.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In low and middle-income countries, children with cancer are simultaneously dealing with
      malnutrition in high proportions. Without proper access to care and a minimal or basic level
      of care, these children are exposed to worse conditions. Studies have shown that more than
      half of the children with cancer are also malnourished at diagnosis. This increases
      children's risk of complications associated with the treatment as well as the abandonment of
      care, as well as decrease the level of survival rates. With an established nutritional
      education and clinical intervention program, the outcomes of these children can be improved,
      especially in Central America where the cancer rates and malnutrition is high, as shown by
      several studies.

    <description>Impact on the delivery of nutritional services, defined as utilization of nutritional interventions. Information on utilization of nutritional services will be collected on a medical nutrition support (MNS) case report form, which collects information on the provision of enteral feeds (nasogastric feeds, gastrostomy feeds), oral nutrition supplements (e.g. Pediasure®, Ensure®) and days of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) over the previous phase of treatment. The MNS form also provides information on the brand of nutritional formula and the prescribed dose (i.e. amount in grams of supplement per day). If enteral feeds are administered, the formula, rate, and duration are reported. The responses collected on the MNS form will be used to determine the rate of utilization of nutritional interventions.</description>

        Patients diagnosed with childhood cancer in participating sites in Central American
        countries specified in the protocol, will be recruited at diagnosis. A total of 1000
        patients are anticipated for the study in AHOPCA affiliated institutions. Patients will be
        recruited and consented (including parents) by a designated researcher. Demographics is
        collected from medical records, and other required data will be collected from charts
        and/or assessed by designated researcher or clinician. Accrual is anticipated to take place
        over a 3-year period. All data collection will occur on routine clinical visits or during
        hospitalization, as per treatment protocol, not requiring otherwise unscheduled visits to
        the hospital. Determination of time-points coincides with variations in therapy as per the
        treatment protocols followed by the hospital.
