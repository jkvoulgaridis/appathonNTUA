  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      15 patients with PRP will be treated with guselkumab for 20 weeks to determine safety and
      efficacy. Participants are required to travel to Portland, OR only for the first visit,
      week-4 visit, and week-24 visit. 3 visits in between these times and one follow up visit may
      be performed by secure videoconferencing.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pityriasis rubra pilaris (PRP) is a rare and poorly understood severe inflammatory skin
      disease characterized by widespread (often full-body) redness and flaking of the skin,
      painful thickening and cracking of the palms and soles, hair loss, crumbling nails, and
      severe skin itching and burning.

      There is no FDA-approved therapy for this rare disease and the commonly used medications do
      not work for many patients. There is some evidence that IL-23 may be too high in the skin of
      PRP patients. Ixekizumab is an injectable medication that blocks IL-23 by binding the p19
      subunit and is FDA-approved for psoriasis.

    <measure>Mean change from baseline PASI at week-24 after treatment with guselkumab.</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Psoriasis Severity Index (PASI) is a well-validated tool for measuring psoriasis, based on redness, thickness, scale, and body surface area assessed by the investigator, with a maximum score of 72 points for the worst disease, and a score of 0 for clear skin. This is expected to be a useful tool for PRP, since PRP is characterized by widespread bright red erythema and scale, and is often initially misdiagnosed as severe psoriasis. The mean thickness score is expected to be lower in PRP than psoriasis but the mean body surface area (BSA) is expected to be higher than psoriasis.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of subjects achieving a 4-point improvement in quality of life measured by the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) at week-24.</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life will be measured by the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). There are 10 questions covering symptoms, embarrassment, shopping and home care, clothes, social and leisure, sport, work or study, close relationships, sex, and treatment. Each question refers to the impact of PRP on the patient's life over the previous week. The highest score is 30 and would indicate a maximum (negative) impact on quality of life. A score of zero would indicate no impact on quality of life. For inflammatory skin conditions, a 4-point change in DLQI score is considered clinically important.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of subjects with sustained remission at week-36, 16 weeks after the last guselkumab dose, as measured by the mean change in PASI from week-24 to week-36.</measure>
    <time_frame>36 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will be treated with guselkumab as per the FDA-approved psoriasis treatment guidelines, and therapy will be stopped after the 20-week dose. Subjects will be monitored at 24 weeks (primary study endpoint) and then at 36 weeks to assess for sustained remission versus relapse.</description>
