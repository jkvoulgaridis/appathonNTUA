  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our previous study had proven that LDCT led to a 74.1% increase in detecting early-stage lung
      cancer compare to usual care (NCT02898441). The present one arm study is performed to
      validate our previous findings and optimize the screening procedure. 6000 high-risk subjects
      (age 45-75) were recruited to take LDCT screening. (Baseline + 2 biennial repeated LDCT
      screening). Follow-up for lung cancer incidence, lung cancer mortality and overall mortality
      was performed. Blood samples were stored in a Biobank. Management of positive screening test
      was carried out by a pre-specified protocol.
