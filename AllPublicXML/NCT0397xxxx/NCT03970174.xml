  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients being admitted to hospital are becoming more complex and they often require a team
      of health professionals (doctors from different disciplines, nurses, and allied health
      professionals) working together to meet their needs. Effective communication among this team
      and with patients is essential to providing high quality patient-centered care. Care
      Connector is an electronic tool that was developed to help health professionals communicate
      about patient care with each other. It also incorporates best practice whenever possible
      (such as the used of Patient Oriented Discharge Summary [PODS] developed at University Health
      Network) during care transitions. We want to understand whether using electronic tools can
      address the communication issues faced by patients/families, and whether they impact on
      repeat visits to the Emergency Department or the hospital after discharge. In this study, we
      will be asking patients and families who have recently been discharged from hospital to
      describe their experience with communication and care transitions through a brief telephone
      survey. All of them will be discharged from units where Care Connector was used. However,
      some of the units would have used the PODS feature while others will not. A small group will
      also be invited to participate in an in-depth telephone interview. The results of this study
      will be used to improve Care Connector and to enhance communication and patient experience in
      general.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this mixed methods study, we examine how electronic tools impact patient/family experience
      of communication in hospital and care transitions from hospital to home. Care Connector is an
      electronic interprofessional communication and collaboration platform initially designed to
      address communication challenges faced by interprofessional care team. It has been augmented
      to support care transitions through a care transition module (that include the generation of
      provider-facing discharge summary and PODS). This study examines the impact of this care
      transition module on patient/family experience of in-hospital communication and care
      transitions. The quantitative component is a controlled study where baseline data is
      collected on 4 medicine wards. The care transition module is then introduced to 2 of the 4
      medicine wards (intervention) while the other 2 (control) wards continue to operate without
      the explicit use of the care transition module. Data is then collected again on all 4 wards
      to understand impact of patient/family experience, as well as objective outcomes of ED visits
      and re-admission within 30 days. A number of care transition process measures will also be
      obtained. In the qualitative component, we will interview patients/families, as well as
      healthcare providers to understand how technology can or cannot address these issues.

    <description>Care Connector is an electronic interprofessional communication and collaboration tool. Its features include Physician Sign-Out, documentation, interprofessional care planner, messaging, and flow planner. The newest module is a care transition module which allows physicians to electronically generate discharge summaries as well as incorporation of allied health recommendation, but also will pull information into the PODS (Patient Oriented Discharge Summary) format designed by University Health Network. This results in a patient friendly discharge instruction sheet that can be provided to patient. The intervention arm will have access to the care transition feature, while the control wards do not.</description>
