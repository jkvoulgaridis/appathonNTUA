  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will treat patients with advanced NSCLC with EGFR or HER2 mutation who have
      progressed following prior therapy. This is the first time this drug is tested in patients,
      and so it will help to understand what type of side effects may occur with the drug
      treatment. It will also measure the levels of drug in the body and preliminarily assess its
      anti-cancer activity as monotherapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Aged at least 18 years old (≥ 20 if in Japan), be able to provide a signed and dated,
             written informed consent.

          2. With documented histological or cytological confirmed locally advanced or metastatic
             NSCLC with EGFR or HER2 mutations.

          3. (ECOG) performance status 0-1.

          4. Predicted life expectancy ≥ 12 weeks

          5. Patient must have measurable disease according to RECIST 1.1.

          6. Patients with brain metastasis (BM) can be enrolled under the condition that BM is
             stable, neurologically asymptomatic and does not require corticosteroid treatment.

          7. Adequate organ system function.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. For part B: Patients who have received prior treatment with Poziotinib or TAK788 or
             other EGFR/HER2 exon20 insertion inhibitors should be excluded. Prior treatment with
             currently approved EGFR TKIs for sensitizing or T790M resistance mutations, such as
             gefitinib, erlotinib, osimertinib, afatinib and dacomitinb, are allowed.

          2. Treatment with EGFR or HER2 antibodies, major surgery (excluding placement of vascular
             access), or onco-immunotherapy (e.g. immune checkpoint inhibitors PD-1, PD-L1, CTLA-4)
             within 4 weeks before screening.

          3. Any cytotoxic chemotherapy, investigational agents or other anticancer drugs from a
             previous treatment regimen or clinical study within 14 days before screening.

             bundle branch block, third degree heart block, and second-degree heart block, PR
             interval &gt; 250 msec. (3) Any factors that increase the risk of QTcF prolongation, such
             as heart failure, hypokalemia, congenital long QT syndrome, family history of long QT

             or any concomitant medication known to prolong the QT interval

         11. Past medical history of interstitial lung disease, drug-induced interstitial lung
             disease, radiation pneumonitis which required steroid treatment, or any evidence of
             clinically active interstitial lung disease

         12. Refractory nausea and vomiting, chronic gastrointestinal diseases, inability to
             swallow the formulated product or previous significant bowel resection that would
             preclude adequate absorption of DZD9008

             a similar chemical structure or class to DZD9008

         14. Women who are pregnant or breast feeding

         15. Involvement in the planning and conduct of the study.
