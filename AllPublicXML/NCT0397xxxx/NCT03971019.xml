    <textblock>
      In this study, we compared the survival benefit of breast cancer patients with dyslipidemia
      (low and medium risk of ASCVD). The control group used dietary intervention instead of
      statins intervention. The main endpoint was 5 years DFS. The subjects were breast cancer
      patients.

      A randomized, open, blank controlled, single-center clinical trial was conducted to compare
      the survival benefits of statins in breast cancer patients with dyslipidemia (low and medium
      risk of ASCVD). The control group used dietary intervention instead of statins. The main
      endpoint was 3 and 5 years DFS. The subjects were breast cancer patients. In this study, 348
      patients were randomly divided into two groups according to patients' wishes and written
      informed consent. The experimental group: control group = 1:1. Subjects were screened and
      administered continuously until the disease progressed and the toxicity was intolerable.
      Informed consent was withdrawn or the researcher decided that the drug must be discontinued.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosed as invasive breast cancer, it has been treated surgically, confirmed by
             histology, cytology or imaging.

          2. Female patients (35-75 years old);

          3. The low-risk patients with ASCVD are detailed in Annex 1.

          4. Signed written informed consent approved by IRB or IEC

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The subjects were pregnant or lactating.

          2. Pregnancy test positive (urine or serum) in women with potential pregnancy within 7
             days before administration.

          3. Other invasive tumors (including the second primary breast cancer) may affect the
             evaluation of outcomes and the compliance of schemes, but subjects who have been cured
             and survived disease-free for at least five years can be selected.

             bilirubin Serum ALT or AST &gt; 3 *ULN; Alkaline phosphatase &gt; 2.5 *ULN; Elevated ALT or
             AST may gradually recover, but with progressively increased fatigue, nausea and
             vomiting, fever, right upper abdominal pain or tenderness.

          5. Extremely high risk ASCVD patients Including acute coronary syndrome (ACS), stable
             coronary heart disease, revascularization, ischemic cardiomyopathy, ischemic stroke,
