      The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of relatively long-term use of a
      wearable device that provides personalized and intelligent cues (e.g. only when FOG is
      detected) on FOG. It is hypothesized that the use of this device will reduce FOG in the home
      and in the community more than in a group of freezers who only receive basic gait information
      unrelated to FOG-episodes.

      This study is a single- blinded bi-centric randomized controlled trial, consisting of 4 weeks
      of intervention, pre- and post- assessments and free-living monitoring. For this purpose, the
      DeFOG system was developed through a collaboration between our research group, the Sourasky
      Medical Center Tel Aviv and mHealth Technologies Bologna, Italy. The system consists of a
      smartphone, 2 foot-mounted inertial measurement units (IMU's) and earphones which enable
      transmitting feedback and auditory cues for gait, when FOG is about to occur. The patients
      will be randomized into an intervention group (DeFOG group) or a control group (N=31 per
      group). All patients will wear the DeFOG system (mHealth Technologies, mHT) and both groups
      will receive feedback about the daily number of steps produced. But, only the DeFOG group
      will receive cueing following detection of FOG. The cueing consists of a metronome, and if
      FOG persists, also a verbal instruction will be delivered. A therapist will personalize the
      settings of the DeFOG system and will support the patients in using the system (for instance
      in coping with false positives). Pre- and post- assessments will be performed by a blinded
      researcher, both before and after taking medication (in OFF and ON medication state,
      respectively), consisting of FOG-provoking tasks and questionnaires. During the
      post-assessment, the FOG provoking protocol will be repeated in both groups with and without
      the cueing option of the DeFOG system in the home situation.

    <intervention_model_description>This is an interventional study with a parallel design, consisting of pre- and post-assessments, 2x (pre- and post) 7 days of free-living gait monitoring and an intervention/control period of 4 weeks. The pre-assessment and first week of free-living gait monitoring will take place prior to randomization.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Double (Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Prior to randomization, all participants will be informed that the goal of the study is to compare the effects of two types of feedback about physical activity on freezing of gait. By withholding information about the cueing intervention, we hope that the participants in the control group will not realize that they are in the control group, in order to avoid a lack of motivation in this group. The intervention group will probably become unmasked after group allocation, as the cueing therapy was not mentioned in the informed consent.
During the post-assessment, the FOG provoking protocol will be performed with and without cueing. This induces the risk of the investigator/outcome assessor becoming unmasked, as patients in the control group may mention that this cueing option is something they haven't experienced during the intervention period. In order to prevent this, the therapist will ask patients in the intervention group to also act surprised to the cueing modality.</masking_description>
