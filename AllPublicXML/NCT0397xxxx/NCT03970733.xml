      either VLA15 with Alum (two different dose levels) or Placebo. Vaccinations will be
      administered as intramuscular injections on Day 1, Day 57 and Day 180.

      Study duration per subject will be a maximum of 19 months. Overall study Duration is
      estimated to be 21 months.

      in Clinical Evaluation of subjects are blinded), Placebo controlled, multicenter Phase 2
      study.

      A total of 250 healthy subjects,aged 18 to 65 years, will be randomized 2:2:1 to receive
      either VLA15 with Alum (two different dose levels) or Placebo. Vaccinations will be

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is aged 18 to 65 years at the day of screening (Visit 0)

          -  Subject is of good general health, including subjects with pharmacologically
             controlled chronic conditions;

          -  Subject has an understanding of the study and its procedures, agrees to its

          -  Subject has a negative serum pregnancy test at screening (Visit 0);

          -  Subject agrees to employ adequate birth control measures for the duration of the
             study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has a chronic illness related to Lyme borreliosis (LB), an active symptomatic
             LB as suspected or diagnosed by a physician, or received treatment for LB within the
             last 3 months prior to Visit 0;

          -  Subject received previous vaccination against LB.;

          -  Subject had a tick bite within 4 weeks prior to Visit 1;

          -  Subject has a medical history of or currently has a clinically relevant disease (e.g.
             cardiovascular, respiratory, neurologic, psychiatric conditions) which poses a risk
             for participation in the study, based on investigators judgement, such as individuals
             with poorly controlled or unstable disease, ongoing suspected or active inflammation,
             or poor compliance with pharmacologic treatment. Subjects with pharmacologically
             controlled conditions like osteoarthritis, depression, or asthma are eligible;

             disease, including Guillain BarrÃ© Syndrome;

          -  Subject has a known thrombocytopenia, bleeding disorder, or received anticoagulants in
             the three weeks prior to each study vaccination, contraindicating I.M. vaccination as
             judged by the investigator;

          -  Subject has received an active or passive immunization within 28 days before or after
             any vaccination; except for influenza (seasonal or pandemic) vaccines which may be
             administered outside a 7-days interval before or after any trial vaccination;

          -  Subject has received any other non-registered medicinal product in another clinical
             Trial within 28 days prior to VLA15 vaccination at Visit 1 (Day 1) and throughout the
             entire study period or has received a registered medicinal product in another clinical
             Trial within 28 days prior to VLA15 vaccination at Visit 1 (Day 1) and up to Day 208;

             immune response to the vaccine, such as subjects with congenital or acquired
             immunodeficiency, including infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Status
             post organ transplantation or immuno-suppressive therapy within 30 days prior to Visit
             1. Immuno-suppressive therapy is defined as administration of chronic (longer than 14
             days) prednisone or equivalent 0.05 mg/kg/day. Topical and inhaled steroids are
             allowed;

          -  Subject has a history of anaphylaxis or severe allergic reactions or a known
             hypersensitivity or allergic reactions to one of the components of the vaccine;
             Subject had any malignancy in the past 5 years. If treatment for cancer was
             successfully completed more than 5 years ago and the malignancy is considered to be
             cured, the subject may be enrolled;

          -  Subject had acute febrile infections within 10 days prior to first vaccination;

          -  Subject is pregnant (positive serum pregnancy test at screening), has plans to become
             pregnant during the course of the study or is lactating at the time of enrollment.
             Women of childbearing potential that are unwilling or unable to employ an adequate
             birth Control measure for the duration of the study.

          -  Subject has donated blood or blood-derived products (e.g. plasma) within 30 days or
             received blood or blood-derived products (e.g. plasma) within 90 days prior to first
             vaccination in this study or plans to donate or use blood or blood products during the
             course of the study;

          -  Subject has any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, may compromise the
             subject's well-being, might interfere with evaluation of study endpoints, or would
             Limit the subject's ability to complete the study;

          -  Subject is committed to an institution (by virtue of an order issued either by the
             judicial or the administrative authorities);

          -  Subject is in a dependent relationship with the sponsor, an investigator or other
             study team member, or the study center. Dependent relationships include close
