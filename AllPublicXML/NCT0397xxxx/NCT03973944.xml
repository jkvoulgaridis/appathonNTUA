      Rationale: Prolongation of the electrocardiographic PR interval (PR interval &gt; 200ms; also
      known as first-degree atrioventricular block) is frequently encountered in clinical practice
      and is generally considered as a benign sign. However, there is increasing evidence that a
      prolonged PR interval results in poor hemodynamic performance with elevated left ventricular
      (LV) end-diastolic pressures evidenced by diastolic mitral regurgitation. Previous studies
      have also associated a prolonged PR interval with a substantially increased risk of future
      atrial fibrillation (AF) and pacemaker-implantation, and increased risk of heart failure (HF)
      hospitalization and death. These risks stress the importance of proper atrioventricular (AV)
      coupling. Shortening of the PR interval may be especially important in heart failure patients
      and can be obtained by atrioventricular pacing. A possible adverse effect of ventricular
      pacing is that it results in ventricular dyssynchrony which may lead to worsening cardiac
      function. This effect may be prevented by applying atrio-biventricular pacing. Data from
      several previous (sub)studies have suggested this.

      Objective: The purpose of this study is to investigate the acute hemodynamic effects of
      restoration of atrioventricular coupling by atrio-biventricular pacing in patients with heart
      failure and prolonged PR interval.

      Study design: This study will be a multi-center, exploratory, prospective interventional,
      nonrandomized acute hemodynamic study, using patients as their own controls.

      Study population: The study will enroll 26 patients with symptomatic heart failure, reduced
      left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (&lt; 35%) and prolonged PR interval (&gt;230ms), but
      without seriously prolonged QRS duration (&lt;150ms) or left bundle branch block (LBBB) QRS
      pattern, who are candidates for an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) device
      according to current guidelines.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The main study parameter will be the acute hemodynamic
      change in left ventricular stroke work (SW) during atrioventricular optimization by
      atrio-biventricular pacing. Secondary parameters will be the acute hemodynamic changes in
      left ventricular dP/dt|max and left ventricular stroke volume (SV) by invasive measurements
      and in left ventricular stroke volume, diastolic mitral regurgitation and left ventricular
      diastolic filling time by echocardiography during atrioventricular optimization by
      atrio-biventricular pacing.

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness: The patients are candidates for an ICD device in whom cardiac resynchronization
      therapy (CRT) can be considered according to current guidelines. Patients in the present
      study will receive a CRT-defibrillator (CRT-D). The risk and/or complications of the CRT-D
      implantation are not additional for this study. After the implantation, acute invasive
      hemodynamic measurements will be performed with a pressure-volume catheter, which is inserted
      via the femoral artery and adds approximately 30 minutes to the standard procedure. An extra
      radiation dose of approximately 50mGy is needed to place the pressure volume catheter in the
      LV cavity. Local vascular complications of femoral artery puncture like bleeding or damage to
      the vessel wall may occur but are rare. The non-invasive echocardiographic protocol one to
      two weeks after implantation will add approximately 45 minutes to the routine outpatient
      clinic visit. The patients do not have to visit the clinic outside the routine outpatient
      clinic visits before and after a CRT-D implantation. The patients will have the potential
      direct benefit from the procedure, by finding the patient's specific optimal
      (atrioventricular) settings and thereby reducing above described risks of a prolonged PR
      interval. In case of a worse hemodynamic performance due to the procedure, the CRT-D will be
      programmed to back up pacing and there is no harm for the patient outside the above
      subscribed extra measurements.
