    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the risk for incident falls and fall-related injuries at the onset of
      neurocognitive disorders in older adults participating in the Canadian Longitudinal Study
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Falls are frequent events in adults over age 65 (up to 30% each year in Canada). They are a
      major Canadian public health concern, which negatively impacts health and quality of life of
      fallers, and health care system. Neurocognitive disorders are strongly associated with falls
      and fall-related injuries.

      Several clinical characteristics, identified previously as risk factors for falls in the
      older population and in older adults with neurocognitive disorders are selected in the
      Canadian Longitudinal Study On Aging. The performance criteria of different statistical
      models will be compared for the association of neurocognitive disorders with falls and
      fall-related injuries. Six linear statistical models (i.e., logistic regression, discriminant
      analysis, Bayes network algorithm, decision tree, random forest, boosted trees), Factor
      Mixture Models and two different artificial neural network (i.e., multilayer perceptron and
      the neuroevolution of augmenting topologies).
