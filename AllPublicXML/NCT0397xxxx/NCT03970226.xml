  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted in two phases. The first phase (phase 0) will be looking at
      patients with new or recurrent/ progressed craniopharyngioma tumors. These patients will be
      given one dose of tocilizumab before they have SOC surgery of their tumor. The objective of
      this phase is to see if drug reaches the tumor. If phase 0 is favorable and shows that drug
      is penetrating the tumor, we will submit this study to COMIRB to review and approve opening
      the second phase of the study (feasibility phase). During this phase patients will be
      administered tocilizumab every two weeks for up to 26 cycles (approximately 2 years).
      Patients will be followed for up to 5 years in the feasibility phase.
