  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the biologic processes through which exercise may prevent disease
      recurrence in patients who have completed treatment for colon cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized trial will examine the biological effects of 12-weeks of moderate-intensity
      aerobic exercise versus wait-list control in 60 subjects who have completed standard medical
      therapy for colon cancer. The primary objective is to determine if aerobic exercise can
      reduce systemic inflammation, quantified using plasma concentrations of high-sensitivity
      C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and soluble tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptor two. The
      secondary objectives are to determine if exercise can reduce: 1) insulin resistance
      quantified using an oral glucose tolerance test, and; 2) circulating tumor cells quantified
      using a microfluidic antibody-mediated capture platform. The exploratory objective is to
      determine if exercise can improve mitochondrial respiration rates and fatty acid oxidation.
