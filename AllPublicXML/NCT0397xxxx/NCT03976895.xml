  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute viral bronchiolitis is the leading cause of community-acquired acute respiratory
      failure in developed countries (20 000 to 30 000 hospitalizations each year in France).
      Between 5% and 22% of these children are hospitalized in a critical care unit to benefit from
      a respiratory support.

      Non-invasive ventilation, in particular the nasal Continuous Positive Airway Pressure
      (nCPAP), reduces the work of breathing in children with bronchiolitis and is associated with
      decreased morbidity and hospitalization costs compared with invasive ventilation. Nowadays,
      this technique is considered as the gold standard in the pediatric intensive care units
      (PICU) in France. High Flow Nasal Cannula (HFNC) has been proposed as an alternative to the
      nCPAP because of its better tolerance and simplicity of implementation. However, the
      proportion of failure remains high (35 to 50%), providing only a partial response to the care
      of these children, especially prior to the PICU.

      In a physiological study (NCT02602678, article published), it has been demonstrated that
      prone position (PP) decrease, by almost 50%, the respiratory work of breathing and improve
      the respiratory mechanics in infants hospitalized in intensive care units for bronchiolitis.

      Investigators hypothesize that prone position, during High Flow Nasal Cannula (HFNC), would
      significantly reduce the use of non-invasive ventilation (nCPAP and others) or invasive
      ventilation, as compared to supine position during HFNC, in infants with moderate to severe
      viral bronchiolitis.
