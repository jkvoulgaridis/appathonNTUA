  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Latinos with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) represent 17% of the US adult ESRD community and
      compared to non-Latino whites, they are 1.6 times more likely to develop depressive affect.
      Depressive affect among ESRD patients is associated with a reduced Health-Related Quality of
      Life (HRQOL), reduced renal therapy adherence, greater morbidity, and increased mortality. In
      addition, depressive affect is adversely affected by Limited English Proficiency (LEP) and
      many other social factors. With support from the Amos award from the Robert Wood Johnson
      Foundation (RWJF), the investigators assessed the feasibility of a 5-visit lay Peer Navigator
      intervention to support Latino ESRD patients with social challenges and to activate them to
      seek mental healthcare. The investigator's peer navigator intervention is feasible; however,
      the investigator's research showed that two-thirds of Latino ESRD patients with limited
      English proficiency report depressive affect yet do not seek care due to cultural preferences
      and language barriers. The proposed study will build on the investigator's Amos RWJF work by
      expanding the peer navigator intervention to include a bilingual Licensed Clinical Social
      Worker (LCSW) that will provide individual dialysis Chairside Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
      (CCBT) sessions while the peer navigator provides support with social factors. This
      patient-centered approach is culturally tailored and will bridge the gap to mental health
      services. The overall aims of this proposal are to: 1) engage key operational and clinical
      stakeholders early-on to develop a Peer Navigator-Licensed Clinical Social Worker (PN-LCSW)
      intervention; 2) conduct a pilot RCT of the PN-LCSW intervention versus standard care to test
      feasibility and acceptability; and 3) assess the efficacy of the intervention on depressive
      affect (primary outcome) as well as health-related quality of life and hemodialysis adherence
      (secondary outcomes).

      Specific Aim: Conduct a pilot RCT of the PN-LCSW intervention to test feasibility and
      acceptability.

      Overview: The goal of this project is to develop a culturally tailored intervention to
      improve outcomes for Latino ESRD patients with LEP and depressive affect. The investigators
      will conduct a pilot RCT study comparing a culturally tailored intervention that includes
      both a PN and a LCSW to control (standard care). In the culturally tailored intervention, the
      bilingual PN will provide support with social factors during 5 visits and a bilingual LCSW
      will provide mental health therapy during eight 60-minute dialysis Chairside Cognitive
      Behavioral Therapy (CCBT) sessions. The investigators will assess the feasibility of (1)
      referral, (2) recruitment, (3) retention, (4) intervention implementation, and (5) data
      collection. Acceptability will be assessed with qualitative interviews of patients, the PN
      and LCSW, and dialysis center staff to explore barriers and facilitators in preparation for
      the R01.

      Hypothesis: A culturally tailored intervention using a bilingual PN who provides support with
      social factors and a bilingual LCSW who provides CCBT for depressed LEP Latino ESRD patients
      is feasible and acceptable.

      Study design and setting: This will be a pilot RCT of a 20-week intervention of Latino ESRD
      patients with depressive affect (Beck Depression Inventory II score &gt;10,5)and Limited English
      Proficiency (Census-LEP) that will be randomized to one of two arms: 1) PN and LCSW Arm, in
      which a bilingual PN provides support with social factors during 5 visits and a bilingual
      LCSW provides mental health support over eight 60-minute dialysis CCBT sessions or 2) Control
      (standard care) Arm. The investigators will ask participants if they have any concerns about
      the privacy setting and have a designated room where patients can opt to have their CCBT
      session before or after dialysis. If a participant reveals intent to harm self or others, the
      investigators will notify dialysis staff and a Denver psychologist who agrees to be contacted
      in an emergency situation and will oversee the risk assessment .

      Study population: Participants will include 100 Latino adults with depressive affect, ESRD,
      and LEP.
