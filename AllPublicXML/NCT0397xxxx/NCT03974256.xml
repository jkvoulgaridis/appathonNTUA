  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The radiopharmaceuticals manipulation used in nuclear medicine department is a significant
      source of radiation for operators.

      According to Article R. 4451-13 of the Labor Code, the exposure limit for hands and skin
      (average dose over a surface of 1 cm²) received during twelve consecutive months can't exceed
      the annual dose limit 500 millisieverts (mSv).

      The radiopharmaceuticals manipulation exposes operators to the risk of exceeding this limit,
      as has been shown in a European study.

      At present, there are automatons on the market but only for radiopharmaceutical
      fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG).

      One of the advantages of such an automaton is to reduce irradiation of operators' hands
      during the radiopharmaceuticals preparation. This reduction can reach 95% according to
      certain authors and the type of automaton.

      This study therefore proposes to evaluate the effect of an original, newly designed automaton
      on operators' dosimetry and the labelled radiopharmaceuticals' quality.

      The hypothesis emitted in this study is that the use of this automaton would allow to reduce
      drastically operators' hands exposure and probably also to improve the precision of the
      prepared syringes.

      This study will be done in a paired way, require a randomization in cross-over and each of
      the subjects included will be its own witness.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, radiopharmaceuticals for diagnostic purposes are prepared by operators,
      Technologist in Medical Electro-Radiology or/and Pharmacy Technicians, manually for
      radiopharmaceuticals labelled with Technetium-99m (99mTc), or using an automaton for
      radiopharmaceuticals FDG.

      At present, there are automatons on the market but only for radiopharmaceuticals FDG.

      However, these automatons are currently only used to split into individual doses
      radiopharmaceuticals FDG, the labelling radiopharmaceuticals being carried out before
      delivery in nuclear medicine departments.

      The Sysark SAS's company has created and patented, with the collaboration of the Center of
      Research in Automatic Control of Nancy (CRAN, mixed unite of research 7039 common to the
      University of Lorraine and the CNRS) an innovative automaton for the preparation of
      radiopharmaceuticals labelled with 99mTc, used to perform scintigraphy examinations of
      nuclear medicine department.
