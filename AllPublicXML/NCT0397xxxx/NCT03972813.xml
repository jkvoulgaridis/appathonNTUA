  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Within low, middle, and upper income countries, low vaccine coverage results from both
      obstacles to vaccine access and low confidence in vaccine programs. Thus, it is critical to
      determine how best to enhance trust in vaccines as increasing numbers of vaccines are
      recommended for use. Even though the context accompanying the initial roll-out of a vaccine
      can have a large impact on people's perceptions of the vaccine and the corresponding disease,
      it is not clear how to best introduce a vaccine to increase public confidence and enhance
      uptake. The US roll-out of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine framed HPV as a sexually
      transmitted infection, which proved to be an impediment to efforts to increase vaccine uptake
      &gt;10 years after its introduction. This study will use an educational experiment, where
      parents of children will be exposed to information about the HPV vaccination in different
      ways. Parents will be introduced to the HPV vaccine through different scenarios with varying
      emphases (i.e., age at vaccination, types of transmission, type of cancer prevention). The
      aim will be to determine how the framing of the HPV vaccination across several dimensions
      affects (A) short-term and (B) sustained willingness to receive it. Parents' willingness to
      receive the vaccine will be assessed at this time and in the future.

    <intervention_model_description>In this educational intervention, there are three dimensions of variability: cancer messaging, communicability messaging, and age messaging. For cancer messaging there are two possibilities: one message focused more on cervical cancer, one message on cancer in general. For communicability, one message will have information on sexual transmission, a second on infectiousness in general, and a third will have no information about communicability. For age, one will mention that the vaccine is available for 9-45 year olds, the second will mention that and additionally recommend children 11 years old to receive the vaccine, and the third will recommend children 18 years old to receive the vaccine.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Immediately after the experimental component, parents will respond to the question &quot;If you had a daughter, how willing would you be to give your daughter an HPV vaccine at 12 years of age?&quot; This will be assessed on a 5-point scale from &quot;not at all willing&quot; (1) to &quot;very willing&quot; (5).

          <title>Many Cancers - Infectious - 18 y.o.</title>
          <description>The Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) causes cancers all over the body, from the head to the reproductive system.
HPV is an infectious disease. Currently, safe and effective HPV vaccines are available for women 9-45 years of age in China. The transition between high school and college or work is a particularly good time to think about the HPV vaccine.
Broadened information about cancers: Caregivers receive information that HPV causes more than just cervical cancer.
Information about infectious disease: Caregivers learn that HPV is infectious (but information that it is an STD is omitted).
Recommendation for children 18 years old: Caregivers are prompted to get their child vaccinated when the child is 18 years old.</description>

        <title>To Determine How the Framing of the HPV Vaccination Across Several Dimensions Affects Sustained Willingness to Receive it</title>
        <description>Three years after the experimental component, parents will respond to the question &quot;If you had a daughter, how willing would you be to give your daughter an HPV vaccine at 12 years of age?&quot; This will be assessed on a 5-point scale from &quot;not at all willing&quot; (1) to &quot;very willing&quot; (5). The proportion of parents who select &quot;somewhat&quot; (4) or &quot;very willing&quot; (5) will be tallied as the primary outcome measure.</description>

      <desc>This study is an educational/behavioral intervention. Any “physical” adverse event is not expected to occur. This study could change someone’s attitude about the HPV vaccine for the worse - a behavioral/attitudinal adverse event.
If acceptability of the vaccine is less than 40% (about 10% to 20% less than acceptability of what was found in previous studies), data collection will be temporarily stopped.</desc>
