    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind study of MSDC-0602K or placebo given orally once daily to
      subjects with pre-T2D or T2D and evidence of NAFLD/NASH. Visits will include a Screening
      Period, a minimum Treatment of 26 weeks, and a Long-Term Follow-up Period during which
      subjects will continue taking assigned treatment.

      Safety will be assessed by periodic measurement of vital signs, physical examinations, blood
      laboratory analyses, and the occurrence of adverse events.

    <description>This is a single composite outcome measure. This is derived by standardizing the values of AST, CK-18, and HbA1c by subtracting the respective study population means and dividing by respective study population standard deviations at each time point; averaging these standardized AST, CK-18,and HbA1c values (or z-scores) for a given patient at each time point; and then computing the difference from baseline to week 26 with respect to these averages.</description>
