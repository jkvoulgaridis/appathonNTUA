  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The researchers involved in this new study are interested in whether giving a HPV vaccine to
      women at the same time as conisation can lead to a greater rate of HPV clearance compared to
      conisation on its own, and a result reduce the occurrence of further infection and high grade
      CIN. The study will do this by using a specific HPV vaccine called Gardasil 9™ which protects
      against 9 types of HPV infection (types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58).

      The human papilloma virus (HPV) can cause high grade intra-epithelial neoplasia (CIN) in
      women, a condition where there are abnormal cells on the surface of the cervix (the opening
      to the vagina from the womb). High grade CIN can develop into cervical cancer, and standard
      treatment is a surgical procedure called conisation, where a scalpel or laser is used to
      remove a cone-shaped piece of the cervix containing the abnormal cells. HPV vaccines are
      routinely used in adolescent girls as part screening programmes to prevent cervical cancer
      (12-18 years of age in the UK).

      The NOVEL study will compare the vaccine approach with standard treatment in a randomised
      controlled trial, where eligible women will be randomly allocated to one of the following:

      Arm 1: Local Cervical treatment and vaccination with Gardasil 9, followed by additional
      vaccinations 2 and 6 months after conisation Arm 2: Local Cervical Treatment and Observation

      This study is for women aged 18-55 years of age with biopsy confirmed high-grade CIN. 1000
      women will be recruited at colposcopy clinics in the UK, Finland and Sweden. Women will be
      followed up for a maximum of two and a half years.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Patients who meet all of the following inclusion criteria will be considered eligible for
        this study:

          1. Female (18-55y) attending for local treatment for presumed CIN2 (cytological and
             colposcopy impression) OR presumed CIN3 (cytological and colposcopy impression) OR
             presumed cGIN/AIS (cytological and colposcopy impression) OR biopsy-confirmed CIN2 OR
             biopsy-confirmed CIN3 OR biopsy-confirmed CGIN/AIS

          2. Written informed consent obtained from the subject prior to enrolment

          3. Free of other relevant health problems as established by medical history and clinical
             examination, e.g. immunosuppression

          4. Patients who the investigator believes can and will comply with the protocol
             requirements (e.g. attendance at clinic appointments and return for follow-up visits)

        Exclusion criteria

        Patients who meet any of the following exclusion criteria will not be eligible for this
        study:

          1. Use of other investigational/non-registered product within 30 days preceding the 1st
             vaccine dose

          2. Continuous administration of immunosuppressants

          3. Previous vaccination against HPV

          4. Cancer or autoimmune disease under treatment. Patients who have a history of cancer or
             autoimmune disease but are not currently being treated for the condition will be
             included

          5. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive condition, including HIV infection
