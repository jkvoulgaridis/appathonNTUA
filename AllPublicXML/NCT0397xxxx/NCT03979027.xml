  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a school-based, randomised, controlled, parallel groups trial to examine the
      acute effect of breakfast (ready-to-eat-cereal and milk) vs. no breakfast on cognitive
      function and subjective state in 11-13 year old adolescents. It was hypothesised that the
      consumption of breakfast will have a positive acute effect on cognitive performance and
      subjective state compared with breakfast omission in 11-13 year olds.

      This study is a school-based, randomised, controlled, parallel groups trial to examine the
      acute effect of breakfast (ready-to-eat-cereal and milk) vs. no breakfast on cognitive
      function and subjective state in 11-13 year old adolescents. It was hypothesised that the
      consumption of breakfast will have a positive acute effect on cognitive performance and
      subjective state compared with breakfast omission in 11-13 year olds. The study sample
      consisted of males and females aged 11-13 years who were recruited to take part in the study
      from a UK secondary school. There were two conditions in this parallel groups study:
      Breakfast and No breakfast (fasting). The breakfast intervention consisted of ad libitum
      intake of ready-to-eat-cereal with milk. Cognitive function was assessed at baseline and +70
      and +215 minutes post-intervention. The Cambridge Neuro-psychological Test Automated Battery
      (CANTAB; Cambridge Cognition Ltd) was used to assess cognitive function. The battery
      included: Simple Reaction Time (SRT), 5-Choice Reaction Time (5-CRT), Rapid Visual
      Information Processing (RVIP), and Paired Associates Learning (PAL), which measured reaction
      time, visual-sustained attention, and visual-spatial memory respectively. Concomitant ratings
      of subjective mood, alertness, satiety, and motivation were taken throughout the morning
      using eight unipolar Visual Analogue Scales

    <description>The unipolar Visual Analogue Scale is a horizontal line, 100mm in length, anchored by the extreme intensities of a single subjective feeling (e.g. 'not at all' to 'very'). The participant marks on the line at the point that they feel represents their perception of their current state. Participants responded to each Visual Analogue Scale using a touch screen computer by moving the cursor along a 100mm line with extreme anchors at each end. The initial location of the cursor was at the 50mm mark. There were 100 points on the scale, yielding possible scores of 0-100. Higher scores indicate a worse outcome</description>

        The inclusion criteria were as follows: aged 11-13 years, willingness to consume RTEC with
        semi-skimmed cow's milk during the study, ability to follow verbal and written instructions

        psychotropic medication in the month prior to testing or during testing, food allergies or
        intolerances which prevent consumption of RTEC and milk (e.g. coeliac, lactose
        intolerance), acute illness or feeling unwell within the week prior to testing or during
        testing, and hearing impairment that precluded the normal use of headphones.
