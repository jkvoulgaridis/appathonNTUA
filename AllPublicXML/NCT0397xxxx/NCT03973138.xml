      The aim of this study is to evaluate the one-year visual outcome and prognostic factors after
      intraocular injections of ranibizumab under pro re nata treatment regimen for the patients
      with diabetic macular edema (DME). Mean change of logarithm of the minimal angle of
      resolution (logMAR) visual acuity (VA), central foveal thickness (CFT), as well as predictive
      factors including best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) were assessed.

    <description>DME patients who were diagnosed through fundus manifestations and FFA examination were treated by intravitreal injections of ranibizumab (0.5mg Lucentis®; Genentech, South San Francisco, CA) under the pro re nata (PRN) treatment regimen. The retreatment were conducted if BCVA was reduced by 0.1 logarithm of the minimal angle of resolution (logMAR) value or more from maximum acuity or if OCT central subfield thickness was more than 300μm.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  1) patients (aged＞18 years) with DME who had a best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA)
             between 20/32 and 20/200, and CRT≥300μm; 2) clinically significant DME confirmed by
             both fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) and optical coherence tomography (OCT)
             (Spectralis HRA+OCT; Heidelberg Engineering, Germany); 3) decreased vision caused by
             foveal thickening from DME, which could not be explained by any other cause.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1) previous anti-VEGF or laser treatment; 2) proliferative diabetic retinopathy who
             required immediate panretinal photocoagulation; 3) active proliferative diabetic
             retinopathy; 4) other causes for macular edema, for example, branch retinal vein
             occlusion; 5) other causes of visual loss in the study; 6) unstable systemic
             conditions, for example, uncontrolled blood pressure, stroke, renal or kidney failure.
