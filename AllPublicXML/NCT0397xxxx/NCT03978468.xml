    <textblock>
      Background: Children with medical complexity (CMC) have higher hospitalizations and
      readmissions compared to children without medical complexity. While CMC were
      institutionalized in the past, increasingly CMCs are now cared for at home. Caring for
      individuals with disabilities at home, and not congregate care settings is a Healthy People
      2020 Objective. Home health nursing, especially good-quality care, is important for CMC. The
      purpose of this research is to test whether collaboration between home health nurses,
      primary-care doctors, and the complex care team (a special team at Brenner Children's
      Hospital that provides care for children with complex chronic medical conditions (CCMC)) can
      improve the health of these children.

    <textblock>
      The specific aims of this study are to: develop and implement a model of care, Interagency
      Collaboration (ICollab) in which communication with Home Health Nurse (HHN) and Primary Care
      Provider (PCP) is maintained and clinical support is provided to HHN; evaluate whether
      ICollab is effective in reducing healthcare utilization of Children with medical complexity
      (CMC) and caregiver burden; and assess caregiver satisfaction in home health care, HHN
      retention, and collaboration with other healthcare providers.

      Methods: Investigators will develop and implement an intervention model (ICollab) that
      includes: (1) maintaining communication with HHN and PCP about clinical information about
      CMC, and (2) providing clinical support to HHN. Investigators will create an
      interdisciplinary intervention team in our children s hospital consisting of a pediatrician
      and a nurse. The intervention team will ensure communication with HHN and PCP by
      communicating clinical information (recommendations from clinic visits and emergency room
      (ER) visits, and discharge summary). The team will provide clinical support to HHN via
      collaborative meetings and availability as a resource for clinical problem-solving with HHN.
      Investigators will recruit 110 CMC discharged home on private-duty nursing services into this
      randomized trial. The intervention group (n=55) will receive the ICollab intervention for 6
      months post-discharge from the hospital, in addition to usual care. Children in the control
      group (n=55) will receive only usual care. Outcome measures will include healthcare
      utilization metrics (hospitalization rates, ER visit rates, and days to readmission),
      caregiver burden and caregiver satisfaction with home health care, HHN retention, and HHN
      collaboration with other healthcare providers. Investigators hypothesize that ICollab will
      reduce healthcare utilization and caregiver burden, and improve caregiver satisfaction with
      home health care, increase HHN retention, and increase HHN collaboration with other
      healthcare providers. Investigators will perform a systematic process evaluation of the
      implementation of the intervention and standardize the ICollab model.

      Implications: How healthcare delivery of CMC can be structured to avoid fragmentation
      especially surrounding transition across clinical settings is an understudied area. Our
      results will address this gap by providing a critically needed evidence-base for
      interventions to improve the quality of healthcare delivery for CMC

    <description>Using data obtained from the Translational Data Warehouse, the number of hospitalizations will be calculated for each child..compare the rate of hospitalizations/ 100-child years in the 2 groups. Number of hospitalizations during the observation period will be counted and the rate will be calculated as:

    <description>The intervention has the following components: 1) ICollab Component 1: The Nurse Clinician will review clinic and emergency room (ER) visit notes for clinicians' recommendations and communicate these to the home health nurse (HHN). 2) ICollab Component 2a: The intervention team will meet weekly by phone with HHNs (6 times/ child). The Nurse Clinician will document meeting notes for each child in the ER, communicate this information with the HHN, and share it with the primary care provider (PCP) by routing the note through the ER or faxing the note. 3) ICollab Component 2b: The Nurse Clinician will be available as a resource for the HHN during regular work hours for clinical problem-solving. 4) ICollab Component 2c: the intervention team physician will offer her contact information for clinical problem-solving about the child to the PCP. The Nurse Clinician will communicate with the PCP about the plan developed in the meetings, and changes to plan of care.</description>

    <description>The primary medical team identifies the need for home health nursing services for Children with Medical Complexity(CMC), and the hospital care coordinators help caregivers choose a home health agency. Hospital-based physicians write home health orders that are communicated to the home health agency. The clinic manager of the home health agency uses these orders to develop the home health plan of care, Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services(Form CMS-485) and communicates the plan to the agencies' HHNs. PCPs oversee the home health plan of care.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The Nurse Clinician will screen children for eligibility for the study (see
             Eligibility Form). Only children with medical complexity (CMC) who are discharged home
             with private-duty nursing (PDN) services will be included. CMC will be identified as
             (1) child &lt;18 years of age; and (2) presence of a chronic condition, defined as a
             health condition expected to last ≥ 12 months; and (3) complexity of the condition,
             defined as needing ongoing care with ≥ 5 sub-specialists/ services, or dependent on ≥
             2 technologies (e.g. gastrostomy, oxygen, tracheostomy, ventilator, etc.).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Children who might turn 18 during the intervention period will be excluded to avoid
             having to re-consent with adult informed consent form (ICF). Children who receive
             skilled nursing visits or personal care services only, those discharged to a long-term
             care facility or to a foster home, or whose caregivers do not speak English/Spanish,
             will be excluded.
