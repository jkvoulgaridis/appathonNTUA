      This study will investigate whether the use of talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC) in
      combination with BRAF/MEK inhibitor will result in durable regional and distant recurrence
      free survival in the neoadjuvant setting for treatment of advanced nodal BRAF mutant
      melanoma.

      This is a prospective, non-randomized, open-label, single-center interventional study looking
      at the response rate when using talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC) in combination with BRAF/MEK
      inhibitor in neoadjuvant setting for treatment of advanced nodal BRAF mutant melanoma. For
      this pilot study, a sample size of 20 participants, over 18 years of age will be included.
