  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is a serious inherited blood disorder affecting red blood cells.
      When oxygen levels drop the red cells become abnormally shaped and unable to move through the
      blood vessels easily. Blood and oxygen do not reach body organs, resulting in episodes of
      severe pain and other complications. Pregnant women with SCD have an increased risk of both
      sickle and pregnancy complications, including raised blood pressure. Their babies may grow
      more slowly in the womb, are more likely to be born early and need special care, and have a
      higher risk of dying. The only treatments currently available for women with SCD are
      Hydroxycarbamide (which cannot be used during pregnancy) and blood transfusion. Currently,
      blood transfusion is only used during pregnancy to treat emergency complications. It has been
      suggested that giving blood transfusions throughout pregnancy could improve outcomes for both
      mother and babies. In Serial Prophylactic Exchange Blood Transfusion (SPEBT), sickle blood is
      mechanically removed and simultaneously replaced with donor red cells. A trial is needed to
      assess SPEBT given every 6-10 weeks, starting before 18 weeks of pregnancy, compared to
      standard care. This trial will evaluate outcomes for women (e.g. hospital admission,
      frequency of crisis) and their infants (e.g. early delivery, birthweight). However, the
      feasibility of such a study needs to be assessed before embarking on a large multicentre
      trial. This study is therefore a feasibility study in which we will randomly allocate
      participants to have either SPEBT or standard care. The study will be carried out in multiple
      maternity units in England and last two years. The willingness of eligible women to join the
      study will be assessed, along with how many participants remain part of the study until the
      end and if participants find the intervention acceptable.

    <description>Serial prophylactic exchange blood transfusion (SPEBT) will be given via automated apheresis technology. SPEBT will be carried out on the haematology day unit or on the antenatal day unit/ward in accordance with local policies in participating units. The procedure will be carried out using standard operating procedures, by the clinical or research nurse/midwife, haematology day unit staff or specialist sickle nursing staff. Venous access will be via peripheral access if possible or by femoral line access if not.
SPEBT will be commenced between 6 and 18+0 weeks gestation. It will be repeated at 6-10 weekly intervals aiming to maintain HbS% &lt;30%. It will continue throughout pregnancy and be stopped at the end of pregnancy.
Number of red cell units used per transfusion will depend on patient weight and pre-transfusion HbS%, but will usually be between 6 and 8 units of red cells on each occasion of exchange transfusion.</description>
