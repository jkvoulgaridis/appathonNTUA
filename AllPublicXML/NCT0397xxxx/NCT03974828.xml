  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ODIN-Report study will be a randomized controlled trial of the effect of providing
      machine learning risk forecasts to providers caring for patients immediately after surgery on
      serious complications. The complications studied will be ICU admission or death on wards,
      acute kidney injury, and hospital length of stay.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single center, randomized, controlled, pragmatic clinical trial. The
      investigators will screen surgical patients enrolled in TECTONICS (NCT03923699) and
      randomized to intraoperative contact. Near the end of the operation, the investigators will
      calculate the same machine learning risk forecasts of major complications as TECTONICS, and
      enroll patients if all of the following are true: (1) No ICU admission is intended (2) ML
      mortality risk forecast is in top 15% of historical PACU patients.

      Patients will be randomized 1:1:1 to no contact, brief contact, and full contact. The
      postoperative provider (PACU physician, anesthesiologist, ward clinician) will be notified
      before arrival of the risk forecast in the contact groups, and in the full contact group an
      additional set of explanatory ML outputs will be provided. The intention-to-treat principle
      will be followed for all analyses.

    <description>Real-time data will be monitored through the AlertWatch system as well as the electronic health record. Risk forecasts of adverse events (30 day mortality, acute kidney injury, postoperative delirium, respiratory failure), PACU length of stay, and hospital length of stay will be generated by a machine learning algorithm. Additional outputs identifying the most important predictors and their effects will be combined with risk forecasts to form a report card.</description>
