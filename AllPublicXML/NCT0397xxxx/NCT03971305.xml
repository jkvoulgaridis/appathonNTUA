  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the development of molecular biology and precise medical treatment, new challenges have
      been raised in the diagnosis and treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in children. In
      recent years, the criteria for clinical staging and efficacy evaluation of NHL in children
      have been updated. Studies in Germany and the United States have shown that pathological
      types of systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) in children and adolescents, minimal
      disseminated disease (MDD) in peripheral blood or bone marrow and minimal residual disease
      (MRD) are significantly associated with prognosis, suggesting that these factors need to be
      combined in risk stratification of ALCL patients. Recent studies have also suggested that
      PET/CT is helpful in evaluating residual lesions in patients with lymphoma after
      chemotherapy. In order to keep pace with the times in the diagnosis, clinical staging, risk
      stratification, efficacy evaluation and treatment of NHL in children. We adjusted the
      original NHL-BFM-90/95 regimen, mainly in the aspects of clinical staging, efficacy
      evaluation, risk stratification and treatment regimen，etc.

      Research purpose:

        1. To study the efficacy and safety of SCCCG-ALCL-2017 regimen in children with systemic
           ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma.

        2. To explore the correlation between MDD or MRD in peripheral blood or bone marrow and the
           treat response and survival.

        3. To explore the feasibility of risk stratification combined with adverse pathological
           types, dangerous organ invasion and MDD.

        4. To investigate the effect of vinblastine maintenance chemotherapy on survival of
           patients with MRD-positive in peripheral blood after treatment.
