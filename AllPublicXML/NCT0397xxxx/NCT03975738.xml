      This is a small-scale pilot project to test out the research design and methodology. This
      pilot project will take a small-scale approach to mapping non-NHS providers that are
      currently (a) being recommended and signposted by healthcare professionals and (b) have been
      experienced by patients. A sample of around 100 participants who are (a) currently employed
      in a range of healthcare provision settings or who (b) have experienced healthcare provision
      outside the NHS and who (i) have regular access to internet access in order to access a blog;
      and (ii) have sufficient English language skills to read and understand questions posted on
      the blog, will be recruited.

      Participants will be asked to provide information via a blog about which non-NHS healthcare
      provision they would signpost or recommend. There will be opportunities both to record data
      and to communicate and form discussions with other participants on the blog. This data will
      be coded and collated onto a database and analysed thematically.
