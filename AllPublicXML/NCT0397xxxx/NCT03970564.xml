  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of routine neck ultrasound performed by respiratory physicians in patients
      with mediastinal lymphadenopathy and suspected lung cancer
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the first phase of the study a respiratory physician was trained to perform neck
      ultrasound and needle sampling of enlarged cervical lymph nodes according to preset criteria.
      In the second phase patients with suspected lung cancer and enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes
      underwent routine neck ultrasound and enlarged cervical lymph nodes were sampled using fine
      needle and or core needle biopsy.

      The outcomes of interest in the study were the rate of malignant cervical lymphadenopathy
      defined as pathological evidence of cancer in neck lymph node samples consistent with a lung
      primary, adequacy of needle sampling, patient reported experience assessed by a visual
      analogue of discomfort associated with needle neck sampling and EBUS, and the proportion of
      patients that had nodal upstaging
