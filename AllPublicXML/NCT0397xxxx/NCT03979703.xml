  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibrosing interstitial lung diseases are characterized by loss of lung function, which leads
      to a decrease in quality of life and physical capacity. Several studies have shown an
      increase in quality of life and physical capacity after increasing physical activity in
      patients. There is evicence that yoga has a positive influence in patients with chronic
      obstructive pulmonary diseases, but so far, studies examining the effect of yoga in patients
      with fibrosing interstitial lung diseases are missing.

      Study aims are to determine the feasibilty of this study, and to determine the effects of
      yoga to patients' quality of life and physical capacity.

      Twenty patients with a fibrosing interstitial lung disease will be recruited and randomly
      assigned to the intervention or control group. Several questionnaires regarding quality of
      life will be conducted. Furthermore, the 6 minutes walking test, a lung function test and a
      biomarker analysis will be conducted at baseline and follow-up. The intervention group will
      participate in a 12 week yoga class, whereas the controll group will not participate. Yoga
      classes will be offered to the control group after the study.

      In addition, focus group interviews will be conducted at baseline and follow-up with the
      intervention group.

    <textblock>
      Patients with a fibrosing interstitial lung disease will be recruited. In total 20 patients
      will be recruited, 10 for the intervention group and 10 for the control group.

      The Intervention group will participate in a 12 week yoga class with classes twice a week for
      about 1 hour. The control group will not participate in a yoga class.

      At baseline all patients will conduct a 6 minutes walking test, a lung function test, several
      surveys to measure health related quaility of life (King's Brief Interstitial Lung Disease
      Questionnaire (K-BILD), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Interstitial Lung
      Disease Anxiety questionnaire), and some blood will be drawn for biomarker analysis.

      Furthermore, participants in the Intervention group will participate in two focus group
      interviews, one at baseline and the second one at 12 week follow-up.

    <description>Quality of life will be measured with King's Brief Interstitial Lung Disease Questionnaire (K-BILD). It is a 15-item validated questionnaire assessing health status in patients with an interstitial lung disease. Questions are related to three domains: breathlessness and activities, psychological aspects, and chest symptoms. Each question has 7 possible answers. The questionnaire has a scale from 0 - 100, in which 100 means highest quality of life.</description>

    <description>Quality of life will be measured with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). It is a 14-item questionnaire, 7 items are related to depression and 7 items are related to anxiety. Each question has 4 different answer options, each scored from 0-3. Scores are summed up for each field (depression or anxiety) with 0 points as lowest possibility and 21 scores as highest (0-7 = normal, 8-10 = borderline abnormal, and 11-21 = abnormal).</description>

    <description>Quality of life will be measured with Interstitial Lung Disease Anxiety-questionnaire. This is a 37-item questionnaire with 5 answer possibilities for each question (never, rare, sometimes, often, always). Total scores are a sum of all questions. Lowest score = 0, highest score = 136. The higher the score the better is the patients' quality of life.</description>
