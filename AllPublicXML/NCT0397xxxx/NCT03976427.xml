  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study will examine the relationship between brain responses and a guided imagery
      exercise in overweight and obese individuals. Results of this work are highly relevant to
      public health because they employ neuroimaging methods to understand food decision-making.
      Findings from this study will inform health decision making and holds great potential for
      future translation across multiple health behaviors and scalable interventions to impact
      population health

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Negative health behaviors (e.g. overeating, smoking) are associated with increased negative
      health outcomes. Engaging in healthy behaviors is not always rewarding (e.g. carrot vs.
      cake). Neural models of healthy behaviors focus on the balance between reward and regulation
      brain regions. The current pilot application examines the engagement of these regions during
      the evaluation of food and nonfood cues before and after a guided imagery exercise targeting
      positive associations with food and regulation.

      The long-term goal is to understand the interaction between positive associations with
      healthy foods and thinking about future rewards may influence healthy decision-making. The
      objective of the current study is to empirically test the combined effects of positive affect
      and positive episodic future thinking on brain activation.
