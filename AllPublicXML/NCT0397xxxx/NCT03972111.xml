        Adult and pediatric patients who weigh ≥13 kg who receive FDA-approved TPOXX as part of
        their medical treatment for variola virus (VARV) infection in the United States (US). These
        patients will have suspected, probable, or confirmed smallpox. The purpose of this field
        study is to evaluate the safety, survival status, time to death, and smallpox rash
        progression in patients who are receiving TPOXX for the treatment of smallpox in the US

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Able to provide informed consent or assent themselves or through a guardian or legally
             authorized representative, receiving or initiating treatment with TPOXX, and willing
             and able to adhere to the recommended procedures in the protocol.

          -  Determined, per the clinical definition of smallpox, that the patient presenting with
             a case of acute, generalized vesicular/pustular rash meets Centers for Disease Control
             and Prevention (CDC) criteria of having confirmed, suspected, or probable smallpox
             and/or is at high or moderate risk for developing smallpox.

          -  The CDC in coordination with the Department of Health and Human Services/Assistant
             Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) has released TPOXX to the physician or
             designated health authorities for patient treatment, and the CDC has provided
             physician contact information to PPD, the contract research organization.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        • Known allergy to tecovirimat and/or excipients of TPOXX.
