  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Scoliosis is a progressive three-dimensional deformation of the spine during growth, with a
      prevalence of 80% in girls.

      The treatments currently used are surgery and rigid brace, which aim to stabilize scoliosis
      evolution. The place of rehabilitation is disputed because the methods are multiple,
      non-standardized and the sessions are infrequent.

      In a previous study (MOUVSCO, NTC02134704), researchers have identified systematic postural
      abnormalities in patients with scoliosis, and developped a virtual-brace (medical device, MD)
      to allow real-time self-correction of the trunk position.

      The aim of the present study is to evaluate for the first time the efficacy of the
      virtual-brace on the correction of the posture of scoliotic patients.

      The hypothesis is that intensified rehabilitation with the virtual-brace will improve
      pathological postures related to scoliosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study is the first evaluation of the efficacy of the virtual-brace on scoliotic
      patients.

      The efficacy of rehabilitation will be estimate on the correction of the posture of scoliosis
      patients over 6 months by comparing 2 groups: a control group of patients conventionally
      treated with a night-time brace (G0 group_conventional) and an experimental group of patients
      wearing a night-time brace, doing postural rehabilitation exercises with the virtual brace
      and follow-up visits with a physiotherapist (G1 group_virtual-brace).
