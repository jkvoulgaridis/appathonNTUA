  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study plans to learn if sending different text messages, serving as reminders or
      encouragement, may help patients take their medication more often if they have had trouble
      keeping up with their medicines.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Up to fifty percent of patients do not take their cardiovascular medications as
      prescribed resulting in increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. Mobile and
      digital technologies for health promotion and disease self-management offer an intriguing and
      as of yet untested opportunity to adapt behavioral 'nudges' using ubiquitous cell phone
      technology to facilitate medication adherence.

      Objectives: Aim 1: Conduct a pragmatic patient-level randomized intervention across three
      health care systems (HCS) to improve adherence to chronic CV medications. The primary outcome
      will be medication adherence defined by the proportion of days covered (PDC) using pharmacy
      refill data. Secondary outcomes will include intermediate clinical measures (e.g., BP
      control), CV clinical events (e.g., hospitalizations), healthcare utilization, and costs. Aim
      2: Evaluate the intervention using a mixed methods approach and applying the RE-AIM (reach,
      effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance) framework. In addition, assess the
      context and implementation processes to inform local tailoring, adaptations and
      modifications, and eventual expansion of the intervention within the 3 HCS more broadly and
      nationally.

      Setting: The study will be conducted within three HCS in metro Denver: VA Eastern Colorado
      Health Care System (VA), Denver Health and Hospital Authority, and UCHealth.

    <intervention_model_description>The study will be a pragmatic, randomized controlled study with four treatment arms. Once patients are identified through pharmacy refill data to have a 7-day gap in any prescribed CV medication refills, they will be randomized to one of four arms, described in Intervention below. Randomization will be stratified within each of the clinics, and within strata defined by number of other CV medication classes that are prescribed at randomization (1-4), using blocks of 4 patients to ensure balance within clinics over time. Thus, within each clinic and number of other medication stratum, each set of 4 consecutively enrolled subjects will be randomized to the four study arms. Treatments will be initiated immediately upon randomization, in response to the 7-day gap.</intervention_model_description>

    <ipd_description>Data collected as part of this project will be released in accordance with standard data sharing policies and procedures. Data will be made available to the broader scientific community after results are published in peer-reviewed journals.
Prior to making this data available, data will be redacted to strip identifiers and further de-identified by removing indirect identifiers that could lead to &quot;deductive disclosure&quot; of identities.
Due to the small numbers of participants in the qualitative interviews, we do not anticipate sharing raw data from individuals.
The agreement will prohibit the recipient from transferring the data to other users, require that the data's security be protected by standard means and be used for research purposes only. After a requestor completes the data-sharing agreement, we will either mail a CD with a limited dataset to the requestor, or email the data through our secure email system that requires users to create an account to receive sensitive data.</ipd_description>
