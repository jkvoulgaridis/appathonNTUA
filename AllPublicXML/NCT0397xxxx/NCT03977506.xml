  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Precise recommendations concerning the methods of evaluation for the resumption of the
      driving after a not evolutionary stroke were recommended recently by the High Authority of
      Health. These describe among others elements to be estimated during the test on the road, in
      the presence of the driving instructor who remains Gold standard.

      However, no standardized assessment grid serving as decision-making tool is at present
      validated.

      Actually the test made by the unit of evaluation of the automobile resumption of the
      university hospital on the road, in a car of apprenticeship with double pedals and in the
      presence of a professional binomial (driving instructor and occupational therapist) then
      validated by the opinion of the doctor of the service. The current standard is thus very
      subjective and lack of sensibility.

      It is necessary to study the metrological properties of both available assessment grids (that
      established from the recommendations of the HAS and TRIP), none of them reached a level of
      validation enough in this population.

      The TRIP is this day validated only at the elderly people. The hypothesis of the search is an
      insufficiency of TRIP to estimate the patients presenting aftereffects of cerebrovascular
      accident.

      The main objective of this work is to validate the new assessment grid after a study of its
      metrological properties in the situation of the driving on the road.

      The patients will benefit a medical consultation to estimate the possibility of inclusion in
      the study. During this consultation, the results of the neuropsychological and
      ophthalmological examinations will be explored and a specificity of the sensitive-driving
      deficits presented by the patient will be estimated to recommend the arrangements of
      necessary vehicle if necessary.

      All the inclusive patients will benefit then the first test of driving in &quot;ecological&quot;
      situation accompanied by a lasting driving instructor during 45minutes. The evaluation will
      be realized by a present occupational therapist and a neuropsychologist in the vehicle, on
      two different assessment grids.

      The second test on road will be for the part of included patients and will be made with the
      driving instructor and the therapist.

      Then, the third test on road will be realized after sessions on driving simulator for the
      part of the patients requiring a re-entrainment.
