  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the hospital, one out of every two elderly people is malnourished. This condition of
      undernutrition generally worsens during hospitalization, where the effects of polypathology
      and psychological distress are added. Muscle loss due to inadequate dietary intake,
      hypermetabolism and immobilization results in the onset or worsening of mobility disorders
      and functional decline. After hospitalization, 30-50% of elderly people hospitalized in
      emergency in medical departments have lost autonomy in daily life. Nutritional management and
      adaptive physical activity (APA) could have synergistic action to improve the nutritional
      status and mobility of elderly patients. The short duration of the average stay the acute
      geriatric units (10-15 days) is not enough to renew, nor to re-educate patients. It seems
      important to continue these actions at home. The implementation of programs combining
      nutrition and adapted physical activity (APA) at the hospital exit has not been studied to
      date. We formulate the hypothesis that in elderly people who are malnourished or at risk of
      undernutrition, after hospitalization, a personalized home intervention combining nutritional
      advice and appropriate physical activity will limit their loss of autonomy.

      Interventional study with minimal risk and constraints, prospective, multicentre, randomised
      and controlled.

      Population of interest:

        -  Older people at least 70 years, malnourished or at risk of malnutrition, on discharge
           from hospital

        -  Informal caregivers of patients included in study

      Intervention at home of professionals:

      Mixed intervention: nutritional support, carried out by the dieticians of &quot; Saveurs et Vie &quot;,
      in seven sessions over three months, combined with an adapted physical activity intervention
      (APA), carried out by &quot; Siel Bleu &quot; professionals, also at a frequency of seven sessions over
      three months, for a total of fourteen sessions.

      Control arm will benefit from usual support (depending on practices of the department,
      prescription or not of oral nutritional supplements and physiotherapy at home, but without
      home intervention of adapted physical activity professionals or dieticians).

      In addition to screening/inclusion visits (D0), three follow-up home visits are scheduled at
      D7, D45 and D90 for both study groups.

      Inclusion visit (D0), performed in hospital in geriatric ward prior to hospital discharge.
      Verification of inclusion criteria, collection of consent by investigator, randomization,
      collection of inclusion data (socio-educational level, family status, assessment of autonomy
      (ADL, IADL, AGGIR) number of drugs, comorbidity (CIRS-G), cognitive status, biology performed
      during hospitalization (albumin, CRP, Vitamin D) and discharge prescription (NOC, nutritional
      advice, physiotherapy) are programmed to D7, D45 and D90 for both study arms.

      Follow-up visits to D7, D45 and D90, carried out at home by a clinal research technician
      mandated by sponsor (Gérond'if). Assessment of autonomy (ADL, IADL, AGGIR scale), nutritional
      status (weight, height, self-evaluation of appetite, MNA), functional status (Grinding
      strength, 4-metre walking speed, SPPB), quality of life (EQ-5D), frequency and transit time
      of home help workers, whether family or professional. Acceptability of interventions for the
      home intervention arm.

      2 patient/arms, a total of 372 patients divided as follows:

        -  Interventional arm : Nutrition intervention with appropriate physical activity for 186
           patients

        -  Control arm: standard care for 186 other patients And up to 160 informal caregivers
           (family members) in both groups, or 80 caregivers per group (one caregiver per patient).

      Inclusion period: 15 months. Follow-up period: 3 months/subject (patients and caregivers)
      Total length of study: 18 months
