  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the addition of adjuvant chemoradiotherapy to adjuvant chemotherapy in
      the treatment of locally advanced proximal gastric adenocarcinoma after standard D2 radical
      resection.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Because of its special anatomical structure, local recurrence rate of locally advanced
      proximal gastric adenocarcinoma is still high after radical operation.

      As a local/regional therapy, radiotherapy combined with concurrent chemotherapy can kill
      local residual tumor cells and reduce the risk of local and regional recurrence.

And the original SOX regimen was continued for 4 cycles after 3-4 weeks of radiotherapy.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Voluntary Participation and Written Signature of Informed Consent.

          -  Age 18-70, gender unlimited.

          -  Gross pathology confirmed that the tumor center was within 1 cm to 5 cm of the EGJ
             line. Histopathologically diagnosed as adenocarcinoma.

          -  No neoadjuvant therapy.

          -  Transabdominal standard D2 radical operation was performed and R0 resection was
             performed. Ascites cytology was negative.

          -  The pathological stages were IIB, IIIA, IIIB and IIIC.

          -  There was no intraperitoneal implantation and distant metastasis. CT should be
             routinely performed to evaluate the tumor bed before radiotherapy. Positron emission
             tomography (PET-CT) could be accepted to determine whether there was residual or
             distant metastasis.

          -  Physical condition score ECOG 0-1.

          -  No history of serious heart and lung diseases, abnormal hematological examination and
             immunodeficiency: hemoglobin (Hb) &gt; 9 g/dL; white blood cell (WBC) &gt; 3 x 109/L;
             neutrophil (ANC) &gt; 1.5 x 109/L; platelet (Pt) &gt; 100 x 109/L; bilirubin &lt; 1.5 times the
             upper limit of normal value; glutathione transaminase (ALT) &amp; alanine transaminase
             (AST) = 2.5 times the upper limit of normal value; serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 times the
             normal value Upper limit.

          -  No other systemic tumors were found.

          -  Fertile men or women are willing to take contraceptive measures in the trial.

          -  The daily energy intake is more than 1500 kcal.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Those who had a history of malignant tumors (except skin basal cell carcinoma, thyroid
             papillary adenocarcinoma and cervical carcinoma in situ, who survived for more than 3
             years after treatment).

          -  Patients with a history of neoadjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy before operation.

          -  Study participants who participated in other clinical trials within 30 days before
             treatment.

          -  Pregnancy, lactation or fertility without contraceptive measures.

          -  Drug addiction and other adverse drug addiction, long-term alcoholism and AIDS
             patients.

          -  Those with uncontrollable infections, seizures, or loss of self-awareness due to
             mental illness.

          -  Those with a history of severe allergy or specific constitution.

          -  Researchers believe that it is not appropriate to participate in this experiment.
