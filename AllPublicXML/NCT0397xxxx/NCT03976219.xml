  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of recording evoked compound action
      potentials (ECAPs) and somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) from the spinal cord (SC) and
      Dorsal root ganglions (DRG), and their suitability as feedback signals.
