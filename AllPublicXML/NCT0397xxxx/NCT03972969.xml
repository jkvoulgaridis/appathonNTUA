      This study will test the hypothesis that two highly challenging exercise programs, one based
      at the VA medical center and the other conducted remotely, will both significantly reduce
      overall fall rates in patients with Parkinson's disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background/Rationale. Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative
      disease, affecting over one million Americans. The cardinal clinical manifestations of PD
      include resting tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability/gait disturbance. In
      addition, people with PD fall frequently, with 60% falling annually and two-thirds of these
      falling recurrently. Identifying interventions that successfully improve postural control and
      reduce fall rate is critical to reduce disability, improve quality of life, and potentially
      increase survival in patients with PD. Recent randomized, controlled trials (RCT) have
      examined the effects of exercise and physical therapy interventions on reducing falls in
      patients with PD; however, with mixed results.

      Objectives. There is a limited availability of effective treatment options to reduce falls in
      PD. In this context, some studies suggest that highly challenging exercise approaches may
      lead to better outcomes. The investigators propose investigating the effects of two
      theoretically driven, progressive, highly challenging exercise programs: 1) a structured
      exercise program at the VA and 2) a structured exercise program at home. There will also be a
      control group in which health education is provided.

      Methods. The investigators propose to conduct an RCT evaluating effects on fall rate. A total
      of 162 VA patients with mild-to-moderate PD will be randomly assigned to one of the three
      3-month interventions: in-person exercise at the VA, remotely-delivered exercise, or health
      education. Outcomes will be compared between each intervention group and the control group.
      Fall rates will be compared between groups with the use of negative binomial regression
      models.
