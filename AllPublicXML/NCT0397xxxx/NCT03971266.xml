  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial studies the use of movement and fitness trackers in determining performance status
      of patients with cancer who are taking part in early phase clinical. Movement and fitness
      trackers record movement and a number of different metrics such as steps, heart rate, and
      calories burned. The use of movement and fitness trackers can provide a more objective and
      precise estimate of patient performance status and help identify those most at risk for
      adverse events and hospitalization.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if in-office movement trackers identify those patients who are at highest
      risk for serious adverse events (SAEs) on early and developmental therapeutics (EDT) cancer
      trials.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      Secondary objectives are related to outpatient activity trackers. I. To determine the
      association between the occurrence of SAEs and early trial termination, with baseline
      measurement of activity classification using outpatient activity trackers in the 7 days after
      screening visit.

      II. To determine the association between the occurrence of SAEs and early trial termination,
      with the change in activity level classification between the week after screening visit and
      the week after the start of EDT.

      III. To determine the association between the occurrence of SAEs and early trial termination,
      with averaged activity level classification in the first 4 weeks of the EDT.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients participant in movement assessment during 2 clinical trial visits. Patients also
      wear a Fitbit to track movements and complete a smartphone based Patient Reported Outcomes
      (PRO) diary over 5-10 minutes to measure physical function, fatigue, sleep disturbance,
      social isolation, appetite, and body weight for up to 180 days.

    <description>SAEs are the grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic toxicities based on CTCAE 4.0 and documented in each therapeutic clinical trials that participants were treated on. Logistic regression will be used to test the association of average measurements of Get-up and Go, and Kinect assessments collected from screening visit day (visit 1) and the first day of Early and Developmental Therapeutics (EDT) trial (visit 2) with the occurrence of SAEs after EDT given, especially during the first 60 days on EDT trial.</description>

    <description>Will use logistic regression and correlation tests to test the association of outpatient movement ability classified based on metabolic equivalents (METS) collected from the first 7 days after visit 1 (baseline measurement) with the occurrence of SAEs after EDT given, and early trial determination; the correlation of activity hours and METS in the first 7 days after Visit 1 with number of SAEs observed will be tested.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A diagnosis of cancer.

          -  Undergoing screening for a University of Southern California (USC)/Norris therapeutic
             clinical trial operated by the Early and Developmental Therapeutics Program which
             includes both phase I and II clinical trials.

          -  Owns a smartphone.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent.

          -  Willingness to wear sensors to track physical activity, Global Positioning System
             (GPS) location, and provide symptom ratings each night during the screening period of
             their clinical trial and 180 days after starting treatments.

          -  Able to read English, Spanish, or traditional Chinese to complete patient reported
             outcomes.

          -  Able to ambulate without an assistive device.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Missing lower limbs.

          -  Symptomatic brain metastases are excluded from this clinical trial. However, those
             with asymptomatic brain metastasis are permitted. It is permissible to have the
             patient on corticosteroids to eliminate symptoms of brain metastasis.

          -  Known movement disorder such as Parkinson?s disease, choreoathetoid movement
             disorders, essential tremor if that movement disorder is of sufficient severity to
             require drug therapy.
