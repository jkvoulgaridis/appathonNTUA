      Primary Objective:

      - To confirm appropriate dose levels of fitusiran when administered to male pediatric
      participants (ages 1 to &lt;12 years of age) with severe hemophilia A or B

      Secondary Objective:

        -  To characterize the safety and tolerability

        -  To characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK)
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study duration per participant is approximately 160 weeks, including a 12-week fitusiran
      efficacy period

          -  Participants must have inhibitory antibodies to FVIII or FIX and must meet one of the
             following Nijmegen-modified Bethesda assay results criteria:

               -  Inhibitor titer of ≥0.6 BU/mL at screening, OR

               -  Inhibitor titer of &lt;0.6 BU/mL at screening with medical record evidence of 2

               -  Inhibitor titer of &lt;0.6 BU/mL at screening with medical record evidence of
                  anamnestic response.

          -  Adequate peripheral venous access, as determined by the Investigator, to allow the
             blood draws required by the study protocol.

          -  Weight requirements at the time of enrollment: 8 to &lt;45 kg
