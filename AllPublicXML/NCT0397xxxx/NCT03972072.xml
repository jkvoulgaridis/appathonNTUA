  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiotherapy is the main treatment for locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head
      and neck (SCCHN). Many advances regarding tumor control and patient survival have been made
      over the past decades. However, treatment-induced toxicity remains a crucial problem, leading
      to reduced quality of life and permanent impairment for many survivors. Xerostomia is up to
      this day the leading cause of late toxicity for these patients. Toxicity has been reduced by
      implementation of modern image guided radiotherapy (IGRT) and intensity-modulated
      radiotherapy (IMRT), but the low soft-tissue contrast of routine x-ray image guidance does
      not allow exact planning adaptation and daily imaging is associated with high radiation
      exposure. Furthermore, despite the routinely use of IMRT, rates of clinically relevant
      xerostomia (i.e. grade 2 or worse) are still common and reported in approximately 38%.
      Recently developed hybrid machines (MRidianÂ®-CE approval since 2016), consisting of a linear
      accelerator and an integrated low-field MRI, could allow a) better visualization of tumor and
      organs at risk, such as parotid glands during patient positioning and daily treatment, b)
      daily imaging without additional radiation exposure, c) narrowest established safety margins
      for the treatment volumes, and finally d) repetitive adaptation of target volumes according
      to changes in patient weight and tumor anatomy during the radiotherapy course. These
      procedures would facilitate a high-precision treatment and help reduce dose exposure of
      critical structures.

    <time_frame>6 months after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire consists of 30 questions with a maximal score of 100. Absolute scores after linear transformation will be reported as descriptive statistics The QLQ-C30 is composed of both multi-item scales and single-item measures. These include five functional scales, three symptom scales, a global health status / QoL scale, and six single items. Each of the multi-item scales includes a different set of items - no item occurs in more than one scale. All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level.
A high score for a functional scale represents a high / healthy level of functioning, a high score for the global health status / QoL represents a high QoL, but a high score for a symptom scale / item represents a high level of symptomatology / problems.
