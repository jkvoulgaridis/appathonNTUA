      To estimate the impact of having a child with serious illness (SI) on the health and
      healthcare of other members of the child's family.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although standard pediatric practice, when caring for a child with serious illness, is to
      provide support to the child's parents and any siblings, little quantitative information
      exists regarding what could be considered the &quot;collateral impact&quot; on other family members of
      having a child with serious illness in the family. This study seeks to provide such
      information, using existing claims data from the health insurance company, Cigna, to identify
      children with serious illness and then examining the health and health care of their family
      members. The investigators hypothesize that, compared to control families without a sick
      child, parents and siblings of children with serious pediatric illness (SPI) will have more
      new mental and physical health diagnoses, more new prescriptions, increased levels of
      Emergency Department (ED) and acute care services, and reduced levels of use of recommended
      chronic disease management for pre-existing conditions and of preventative services.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Cigna customers as follows:

               1. Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) cohort: infants born at 30 weeks gestational
                  age or less, or with a birthweight less than 1500 grams.

               2. Critical Congenital Heart Disease (CCHD) cohort: Newborns with critical
                  congenital heart defects who undergo surgery by 12 months of life.

               3. Oncology cohort: Patients with new onset (not relapses) pediatric oncologic
                  diagnoses including liquid, solid, and brain cancer.

               4. Severe Neurological Impairment (NI) cohort: Patients with severe neurologic
                  impairments, associated with substantial functional impairment, relentless
                  progressive deterioration, or substantially shortened life-spans.

          -  For each index patient in a particular SPI cohort, Investigators randomly identified
             up to four children of the same ages as the index patient but who do not have the
             specific SPI. The matching by age was as follows: in months if &lt; 3 years; and in years
             if age &gt; or = 3 years. Cigna then identified all family members, using both
             definitions of &quot;family members&quot; described above.
