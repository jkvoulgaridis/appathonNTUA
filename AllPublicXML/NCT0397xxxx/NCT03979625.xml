  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thrombocytopenia is a frequent and serious adverse event in patients treated with
      veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) for refractory cardiogenic shock.
      Similarly to postcardiac surgery patients, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) could
      represent the causative underlying mechanism. However, the epidemiology as well as related
      mortality regarding HIT and VA-ECMO remains largely unknown. The investigators aimed to
      define the prevalence and associated 90-day mortality of HIT diagnosed under VA-ECMO.This
      retrospective study included patients under VA-ECMO from 20 French centers between 2012 and
      2016.
