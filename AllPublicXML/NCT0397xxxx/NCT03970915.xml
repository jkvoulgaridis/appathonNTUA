  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study of adult patients with severe all-cause trauma having a body temperature less than
      36°Celsius (C) that is managed by a Mobile Emergency Service team and oriented towards a
      Vital Emergency Room.

      Currently two devices are used to warm patients during their care at the scene of an
      accident: a survival blanket and heating in the emergency vehicle. Despite these two devices
      many patients arrive in hypothermia (body temperature less than 36°C) in emergency
      departments. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a body warmer
      associated with standard warming devices on the correction of hypothermia compared to the
      standard procedure in severely traumatized patients with hypothermia .

      It is a national multicentric study with 14 participating Mobile Emergency Service centers
      and hopefully will include 612 patients.

      The study will be carried out according to a pattern of 28 successive periods of one week
      each during the winter period (October to April), for a total duration of 7 months. 14 action
      periods ON (warming standard procedure + body warmer) and 14 control periods OFF (warming
      standard procedure) will be run in random order for each center.

    <description>Coagulopathy refers to disorders of blood coagulation whether they are pathological thrombosis or haemorrhagic syndromes. The coagulopathy criteria appear early and their measurements are systematically carried on admission to the emergency room.</description>

    <measure>Proportion of patients with acidosis on arrival at the emergency room.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Acidosis is a disorder of the acid-base balance of the body corresponding to an increase in the concentration of acid in plasma and interstitial fluids. It can be metabolic or respiratory. In the case of a state of shock, lactic acid occurs in situations where the tissues of the body are poorly irrigated and lack oxygen.</description>
