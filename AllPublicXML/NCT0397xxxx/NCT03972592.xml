  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cutaneous microcystic lymphatic malformations (CMLMs) are rare conditions of children and
      adults resulting from abnormal embryologic development of lymphatic vessels. They present as
      clusters of vesicles full of lymph and blood of various extent. They ooze and bleed, inducing
      maceration, esthetic impairment, scars, pain, bacterial infections and impaired quality of
      life. Currently, treatments for CMLMs are disappointing, and their management is challenging.
      Sirolimus is an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a serine/threonine protein
      kinase involved in cell growth and proliferation, cellular metabolism, autophagy and
      angio-lymphangiogenesis. Topical sirolimus, known to be efficient and well tolerated in
      cutaneous angiofibromas linked to tuberous sclerosis, has recently been reported effective in
      few reports of patients with CMLMs. The objective of this trial is to compare the efficacy
      and safety of a 12-week application of 0.1% topical sirolimus versus topical vehicle in CMLMs
      in children and adults.

      This blinded multicentre split body randomized controlled phase 2 trial aims to include 50
      patients ≥ 6 years old who have a primary CMLM without an underlying malformation.

      The CMLM will be divided into 2 equal areas of the same severity that will be randomly
      allocated to 0.1% topical sirolimus or topical vehicle for 12 weeks. During the double-blind
      12-week period, both topical products will be applied by a nurse to avoid inter-group
      contamination and for better compliance.

      At the end of the 12-week period, the patient/parent will treat the whole area of CMLM with
      0.1% topical sirolimus on remaining lesions, for 8 more weeks. Patients will also be seen at
      week 20 (treatment will be stopped) and at month 12 to evaluate long-term efficacy.

    <masking_description>Patients, parents, nurses and investigators will be blinded for the treatment allocated to each area of the CMLM, during the first step of the study (until week 12, where primary endpoint will be assessed). To ensure the double blinding, both areas will be randomized, and the topical treatments (sirolimus and vehicle) to be applied will have similar packaging. Their appearance is similar, thus the active drug (topical sirolimus) and vehicle cannot be distinguished at drug allocation. Furthermore, the consistency of the creams is similar.</masking_description>

    <description>Standardized photographs will be performed at baseline and week 12: the experts will have to identify, at the end of the study, which area among both received the active treatment. In case of disagreement, a consensus will be reached between both experts; if consensus is not reached, a third expert will be sought for final decision. Interpretation by dermatologic experts (i.e correct identification of intervention/vehicle treated area) will be considered as correct or false, and the proportion of correct interpretation will be estimated. The proportion of correct interpretation will be compared to the theoretical 50% value, corresponding to a random assessment. Five photographs will be taken: 1) one of the patient including the malformation 2) one of the malformation (distance of 50 cm), 3) one of the malformation (distance of 15 cm), 4) profile photography and finally 5) three quarter view.</description>
