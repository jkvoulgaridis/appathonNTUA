  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early Maladaptive Schemas (EMS) are overactivated in euthymic bipolar disorders (BD) and are
      associated with poor psychosocial functioning and higher suicidality.

      The first objective of this study is to establish different clusters of EMS in euthymic
      bipolar disorders, compare these clusters according to the clinical characteristics of BD and
      neuropsychological performances and evaluate the temporal stability of these clusters at 12
      and 24 months.

      The second objective of this study is to quantify the impact of EMS on functioning in
      euthymic BD, beyond the effect of cognition and residual depressive symptoms.

    <textblock>
      Early Maladaptive Schemas (EMS) are overactivated in euthymic bipolar disorders (BD) and are
      associated with poor psychosocial functioning and higher suicidality. However, few studies
      have explored EMS in bipolar disorders, despite EMS therapy is a promising tool for the
      psychotherapy of BD.

      This study will use the data collected at the Versailles Expert Center for Bipolar disorder,
      in the local FACE-BD registry. These data will be collected at the inclusion, 12 months and
      24 months later. They included an extensive neuropsychological battery and an extensive
      evaluation of the clinical characteristics of bipolar disorder. EMS will be measured with the
      Young Schema Questionnaire Short Form 3.

      The first objective of this study is to establish different clusters of EMS in euthymic
      bipolar disorders, compare these clusters according to the clinical characteristics of BD and
      neuropsychological performances and evaluate the temporal stability of these clusters at 12
      and 24 months.

      The second objective of this study is to quantify the impact of EMS on functioning in
      euthymic BD, beyond the effect of cognition and residual depressive symptoms.

        This study included patients recruited into the FACE-BD (FondaMental Advanced Centers of
        Expertise for Bipolar Disorders) cohort at Versailles Hospital. This registry was set up by
        the Fondation FondaMental (www.fondation-fondamental. org) which created an infrastructure
        and provided resources to follow clinical cohorts and comparative-effectiveness research in
        patients with BD.

        Patients were referred by their general practitioner or by their psychiatrist.
