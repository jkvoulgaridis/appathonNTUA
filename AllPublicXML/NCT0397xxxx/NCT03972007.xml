      Introduction: Low-intensity laser therapy (LBI) is a therapeutic modality with a large number
      of clinical studies in recent years, taking into account its effectiveness in tissue repair,
      pain control and, more recently, to increase performance. It is known that LED therapy has
      immediate effects. Therefore, analyzing the TLED in the infrared spectrum for acute responses
      at different times along with fatigue resistance capabilities, heart rate variability and
      biochemical response to fatigue in handball athletes becomes necessary. Objective: To analyze
      the acute effects of LED phototherapy (940nm) on fatigue resistance and recovery after
      strenuous exercises of university athletes. Method: The study sample will consist of 32 and
      36 male athletes, for biceps brachii and quadriceps femoris, respectively. The athletes will
      be randomly assigned into four groups: Immediate TLED (TLED-I), TLED 15Min (TLED-15),
      Immediate Sham (Sham-I) and Sham 15Min (Sham-15). The tests performed will involve
      bioimpedance evaluation, blood lactate, electromyographic analysis and evaluation of maximum
      voluntary contraction by means of the maximal repetition test (1RM). Thus, the TLED will be
      applied on the muscle group to be evaluated, unilaterally, the same tests being repeated in
      the sequence. For analysis of the data, normality test will be used to verify the
      distribution and adequate statistical tests for the appropriate intra and intergroup
      comparisons, being considered two factors in the comparisons, time and group. A significance
      level of 5% will be adopted.

      It is a blinded randomized clinical trial. The athletes will undergo a previous evaluation
      (day 1) comprised by anamnesis and evaluation of the bioimpedance to analyze the body
      composition, will still carry out the evaluation of the load for a maximum repetition. Thus,
      7 days after (day 2) the previous evaluation in the times immediately after and after 15
      minutes of the LED application will be carried out new tests. These will involve assessment
      of blood lactate, heart rate variability and electromyography. In addition, during the
      execution of the fatigue protocol will be collected the number of repetitions of muscle
      contraction and its total execution time.

      Due to the number of athletes that make up the university team (n = 19), cross-over will be
      necessary, where all athletes will initially be distributed to the 04 pre-defined groups in
      each subproject, and after the 7 days, they will be divided again.
