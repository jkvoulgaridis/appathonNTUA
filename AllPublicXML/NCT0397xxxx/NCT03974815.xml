  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether transcranial direct current stimulation
      (tDCS) is effective and safe in the treatment Bipolar depression.

      Randomized, double-blind Controlled Clinical Trial. Subjects Adults (between 19 and 65 years
      of age) with Bipolar depression who meet the inclusion criteria and who agree to participate
      in the study Will recruit from clinical referrals.

        -  Active tDCS Anode - left DLPFC Cathode - right DLPFC Electric current is 2mA - Current
           is applied for 30 min

        -  Sham tDCS Same assembly is used Current is applied for 1 min

      Both groups 30~42 stimulation sessions on consecutive days.

      Baseline(visit 1), 2 week(visit 2), 4 week(visit 3), 6 week(visit 4), and 12 week(visit 5)
      Check compliance with mobile application(MINDD-CONNECT) connections.

HAM-D17
clinician-administered scale
assesses 17 items related to major depression (MD)
Individual items scored on 3 point (0 to 2) or 5 point scale (0 to 4)
; 0=absent, 4=most severe.
Total score: 0 to 66.</description>

    <description>Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale
Rating clinician-related
Main purpose to assess the severity of symptoms of anxiety
Population adults, adolescents and children
The scale consists of 14 items
Each item is scored on a scale of 0-4, with a total score range of 0-56
