  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We know precisely which patients and when they should have an imaging test to evaluate a Head
      Injury (HI). But in those patients on anticoagulant and / or antiaggregant treatment we do
      not know the exact incidence of early and late hemorrhagic lesions, and there is no specific
      recommendation on how long they should remain under observation in the emergency department
      if no initial lesions are evident. Our goal is to try to answer these two questions.

      MATERIAL: Prospective study of patients treated of HI in the Emergency Department (ED) and to
      whom an image test is performed (cranial CT scan). Collection of demographic, clinical,
      analytical, image tests, and observation time in the emergency department (from admission to
      medical discharge)

      METHODS: Separation of subjects included in the study in 4 cohorts: patients without
      anticoagulant and / or antiaggregant treatment; patients with antiplatelet therapy (ASA and /
      or clopidogrel); patients with anticoagulant treatment with acenocoumarol and INR &lt;2; and
      patients on anticoagulant therapy with acenocoumarol and INR&gt; = 2 or patients on treatment
      with direct thrombin inhibitors (dabigatran), or inhibitors of factor Xa (rivaroxaban,
      apixaban, edoxaban) or patients on treatment with low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) )
      Follow-up through analysis of clinical history and telephone interview at 2, 7, 15, 30, 60
      and 90 days.

      Statistical analysis of the results.
