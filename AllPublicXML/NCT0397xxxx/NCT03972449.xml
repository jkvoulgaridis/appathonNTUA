  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will study the effect of practicing speech sounds via beatboxing on speech
      accuracy, engagement in therapy, and functional outcomes for older children and adolescents
      with speech sound disorders (SSDs). Though SSDs exhibited by young children are often
      considered, SSDs are among the most frequent communication disorders in school-aged and
      adolescent children. SSDs can persist until adulthood. Individuals exhibit residual speech
      errors (RSE) when speech sounds are produced incorrectly after the age of eight, the age at
      which speech production is expected to be error-free. Common RSE include /r/, /s/, and /z/,
      all of which have high frequency in American English.

      Beatboxing is a unique manipulation of the speech mechanism in which the individual creates
      repetitive, percussive and other instrumental sounds by actually being the instrument.
      Beatboxing is engaging and increasingly found in a variety of musical contexts and mainstream
      culture. The broad objective of this investigation is to explore the impact of beatboxing as
      an intervention tool on the speech produced and the functional outcomes attained by children
      with RSE compared to a traditional articulation therapy approach.The effect of a beatboxing
      intervention approach (BEAT-Speech) will be compared to traditional articulation therapy and
      employs a two-group pretest-posttest design. Specifically, the research aims to 1) assess the
      impact of beatboxing on speech sound production accuracy and amount of targets produced
      during therapy; 2) examine the relative level of client engagement of individuals exposed to
      beatboxing intervention; and 3) explore influences of beatboxing experiences on
      communication, activities, and participation in social and daily interactions.

    <description>The traditional approach to treating speech sound disorders focus on one or two sounds at a time until they are mastered by the client. Perceptual and production training are used with target starting at simple (isolation) and moving to more complex (sentences). A variety of cues such as shaping and phonetic placement cues are used.</description>
