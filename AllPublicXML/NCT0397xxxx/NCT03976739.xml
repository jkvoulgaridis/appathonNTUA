      This study was a multicenter cross-sectional study. Patients were consecutively enrolled and
      divided into gastric cancer group, gastric precancerous lesions group, and chronic gastritis
      group, according to histopathological results. The bile reflux detection rate and
      Helicobacter pylori infection status were recorded for each group.
