  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During adolescence, youth undergo rapid developmental change and in some cases experience
      increases in worries and fearfulness, although the mechanisms that underlie this change are
      unclear. Previous studies indicate that heightened Attentional Bias (AB) toward
      threat-related cues may increase fearfulness, and it may be possible to change AB using a
      computerized, Attention Bias Modification task (ABM). This study will recruit healthy youth
      with elevated anxious symptoms to index attentional tendencies toward threat-related stimuli
      using cutting-edge techniques, and to test the effect of a computerized attention training
      task in altering attention to threatening cues. The investigators will also examine the role
      of ABM in changing youth's attention-related resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC), a
      neural marker of at-rest cognition.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adolescence is a critical period for increases in anxious symptoms, potentially due to
      etiologically significant Attention Biases (AB) favoring threatening cues. However, the
      specific facets of AB that drive this vulnerability as well as their neurocognitive
      correlates are unclear, due in large part to the poor psychometric properties of the
      traditional assessment of AB in this field. By using both a standard behavioral task and a
      novel eye-tracking task, this study aims to unpack the nuanced facets of AB related to
      anxiety risks. Additionally, well-controlled Attentional Bias Modification (ABM) tasks
      designed to train attention away from threatening cues can be used to experimentally
      manipulate the causal mechanisms of interest, and to test whether ABM reduces symptoms and
      alters patterns of resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC, the intrinsic brain activity
      that occurs outside specific tasks) that characterize anxiety risks.

      This study will recruit 60 11-13-year-old healthy adolescents with heightened anxious
      symptoms but without clinically significant anxiety disorders. They will be randomized to a
      six-session ABM training or a placebo task. Both before and after the training, the
      investigators will assess their anxious symptoms, AB, and rsFC. By examining the risk
      processes prior to the onset of clinically significant anxiety disorders, our work will make
      important new contributions to our understanding of how AB eventuates in anxiety and will
      have direct implications for early identification of youth at highest risk for anxiety
      disorders, and the targets that should be focused on in preventative efforts.

    <masking_description>The randomized assignment procedure will be conducted solely by the PI. All other research staff and participants will be blind to the assigned condition throughout the course of the study. The PI will use a random number generator in Excel to assign a number 1-10 for each participant. The number will be given to the study coordinator, who notes the number in the participant's file. Participants will be assessed by the coordinator or other research staff. The research staff goes to each participant's home to conduct the ABM training protocol, where the number noted in this participant's file will be entered at the start of the training task to assign the participant to either the ABM task or the control task. The PI will not run the tasks. In communicating with participants, the terms baseline, outcome, and training will not be used.</masking_description>

    <description>Participants will be presented with a fixation cross (500ms) followed by a pair of identity-matched, angry-neutral faces (1000ms). The pair presentation is replaced by a single arrow-probe (1000ms) in the position of the neural face. Inter-trial intervals (ITI) are 500ms. Participants indicate arrow direction (left or right) by pressing one of two buttons as quickly as possible. By responding to the probe that always replaces the neutral face, participants learn to attend to the non-threat cues and away from threat cues. There are 120 trials of angry-neutral faces in total, and 40 other catch trials with neutral-neutral faces.</description>
