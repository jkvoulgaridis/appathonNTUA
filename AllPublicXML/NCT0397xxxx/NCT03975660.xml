  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will attempt to objectively measure pain with an experimental device. The
      investigators will apply the device to measure patients &quot;pain&quot; due to uterine contractions
      during routine clinical care to correlate patients verbal pain ratings and analgesia
      requirements to that measured by the device.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite all the progress in our understanding of the basic mechanisms of pain, the gold
      standard for measuring pain is still a subjective verbal numeric rating scale rating (0-10)
      obtained from the individual reporting pain. This method is not objective and cannot be used
      in all patient populations. This study will attempt to objectively measure pain in laboring
      mothers with a pain measurement device. The investigators aim to 1) see correlation between
      pain scores from the device and actual pain scores reported by the patients and degree of
      nociceptive input (uterine contractions) and to 2) compare the device index score and pain
      scores (patient reported during uterine contractions) after two techniques different
      neuraxial blocks i.e. combined spinal epidural (CSE) and dural puncture epidural (DPE).
