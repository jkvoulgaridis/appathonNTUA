  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to 1) speed up access to and delivery of PrEP to young women, and 2)
      compare interventions to support and maximize the prevention-effective use of PrEP.
      Specifically, the investigators aim to answer the following two questions: 1) how can the
      study use existing community-based platforms to identify and deliver PrEP to those in need?
      and 2) which adherence support interventions are most likely to engender effective use of
      PrEP? The investigators propose to answer these questions by leveraging existing
      community-based HIV testing platforms in South Africa and use a mixed methods approach to
      optimize the PrEP cascade and evaluate a community-based PrEP adherence program for young
      women.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Worldwide, about 1.9 million people became infected with HIV in 2015, most of whom live in
      Southern and East Africa. In South Africa, the HIV incidence rate among young women ages
      15-24 (2.5%) is four times higher than their male counterparts (0.6%). Recent HIV prevention
      trials in South Africa documented incidence rates of 5-6% per year in 15-24 year old young
      women. Given this high incidence of HIV, implementing effective HIV prevention strategies -
      including PrEP - is crucial to controlling HIV globally.

      The proposed study leverages existing community-based HIV counseling and testing platforms in
      South Africa and evaluates, using a mixed methods approach, a community-based PrEP adherence
      program for young women whilst optimizing the PrEP cascade. Numerous barriers have been
      described that delay or block young women from accessing clinic-based health services,
      especially reproductive health and HIV testing and prevention services. Consequently,
      reaching young women at large scale with HIV prevention services requires delivery platforms
      outside of clinic-based facilities. Community-based counseling and testing programs have
      shown the greatest coverage and potential to achieve high levels of knowledge of HIV
      serostatus and linkage to HIV care. Using community-based counseling and testing programs,
      this proposal will deliver PrEP as part of a population-level combination prevention program,
      which is necessary to substantially reduce HIV incidence.

      The investigators propose to answer key research questions through the following; Specific
      Aims: 1) Assess young women's uptake of PrEP when delivered through large-scale
      community-based HIV counseling and testing platforms in urban and rural settings in South
      Africa, 2) Evaluate community-based scalable interventions to achieve prevention-effective
      adherence to PrEP among young women, and 3) Evaluate the cost per young woman initiated on
      PrEP and provided adherence support through community-based platforms, and the
      cost-effectiveness per incident HIV infection averted. In order to achieve Aim 1, the study
      will leverage from on-going, at-scale CBCT programs and platforms (mobile unit and systematic
      home-based testing) to identify and link young women to community-based PrEP initiation
      services. In order to achieve Aim 2, the study will perform a 3-arm randomized controlled
      trial, with participants randomized to one of the following arms: Arm 1) a group-based
      community health club akin to an ART adherence club; Arm 2) one-on-one adherence counseling
      and support; Arm 3) community-based medication dispensary.

    <description>GBHCs will be facilitated by trained Lay Health Counsellors (LHC). GBHCs will consist of a maximum 20 participants. GBHC sessions will held multiple times a month in each study area, allowing for flexibility for study participants. Sessions will be held at a safe and secure, centrally located area within the study community, and will be regularly monitored and assessed by the study coordinator. Participants will be invited to join a club-specific WhatsApp group to facilitate group communication and adherence support throughout the month. They will also be invited to partner up with another participant to provide mutual peer support. Permission will be sought from group-based adherence support participants before they are added to WhatsApp groups. Group adherence counsellors assigned will be members of WhatsApp groups, and will monitor all shared content to ensure that no inappropriate content or private information is shared in the group.</description>

    <description>IAS participants will be matched to a LHC and will schedule IAS sessions once-a-month for the duration of the study. These sessions will be held at a centralized location within the study community. The sessions will be semi-structured to allow for participant-driven discussion of any adherence challenges and key-messages. The adherence curriculum will also explore motivations for PrEP and adherence and focus on practical adherence tips, environmental cues, integration of PrEP within daily routines, short-term goal-setting, problem-solving, safe PrEP disclosure and social support, risk reduction counselling, partner communication, and HIV risk perception. A subset of IAS sessions will be audio-recorded for quality assurance by investigators and the study coordinator. These recordings are for training purposes only and will not form part of the dataset. Consent for recording IAS sessions will be sought from participants during the pre-enrolment consent process.</description>
