    <textblock>
      This is a randomized phase 2 trial aiming to assess the early efficacy of two experimental
      treatment sequences.

      Three arms are planned; (i) standard chemotherapy followed at progression by single agent
      immunotherapy with durvalumab (CT), (ii) experimental single agent immunotherapy with
      durvalumab followed at progression by chemotherapy, (iii) experimental combination
      immunotherapy with durvalumab+tremelimumab followed at progression by chemotherapy.

      The the two experimental strategies will be compared with the standard strategy in terms of
      12-month overall survival, time considered informative for the type of treatment and disease

             findings (including but not limited to active peptic ulcer disease or gastritis,
             active bleeding diatheses or psychiatric illness) or social situation that may
             interfere with the planned treatment, affect patient compliance or place the patient
             at high risk from treatment related complications.

         21. Radiotherapy treatment to the chest or to more than 30% of the bone marrow or with a
             wide field of radiation within 4 weeks of the first dose of study treatment (patients
             who have had radiotherapy ≥ 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment, but
             who are still experiencing acute toxic effects of radiotherapy are also excluded).

         22. Major surgical procedure within 28 days prior to the first dose of study drugs.
