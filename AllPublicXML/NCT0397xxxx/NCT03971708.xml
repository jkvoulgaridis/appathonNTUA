  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lidocaine is a local anesthetic that is usually used for nerve blocks to sensory/motor
      blockade. However, lidocaine can also been given intravenously, and it has been shown that
      this method can be used to help alleviate chronic pain. We wish to investigate if lidocaine
      is infused via the transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block catheter will exert systemic
      effect, hence reduce opioid consumption and pain score in patients compared with using local
      anesthetic such as ropivacaine.

      Following IRB approval and written consents, patients undergoing nephrectomy were randomized
      into 2 groups: standard 0.2% ropivacaine infusion (control) and 0.4% lidocaine infusion for
      TAP catheter. The TAP catheters were placed by the surgeons under direct vision at the end of
      surgery before wound closure. All subjects had a general anesthetic in accordance to the
      discretion of the anesthesiologist in the operating room. At the end of surgery, all patients
      received a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) in recovery for 48 hours. The primary outcome
      was the total opioid consumption at the first 27 hours post-operatively. The secondary
      outcomes were the total opioid consumption at 4/12/24/36/48/60 hours after the initiation of
      local anesthetic infusion, the numerical rating scale (NRS) at rest and on movement at
      4/12/24/36/48/60 hours after the initiation of the local anesthetic infusion, the incidence
      of nausea and vomiting, and adverse effects.

      The sample size calculation for this non-inferiority trial is based on our previous
      retrospective study on TAP in nephrectomy patients. A sample of 80 patients is needed, using
      a power of 90% with the two-sided significance level of 5%. All parametric data will be
      analyzed using mean and standard deviation. Non-parametric data will be analyzed using median
      and interquartile range. Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney U test will be used to compare
      between groups.
