  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the work is to assess the effect of the menstrual cycle on the biomechanical
      properties of the muscles. The study will be conducted among young women aged 20-25 with a
      regular menstrual cycle. During the test, muscle strength and muscle flexibility as well as
      activation times will be performed. The study will assess the effect of the stretching of the
      hamstring muscles on the biomechanical properties of the muscles in the different phases of
      the menstrual cycle.
