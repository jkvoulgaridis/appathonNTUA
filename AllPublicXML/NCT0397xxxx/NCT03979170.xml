  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, single arm, open and exploratory clinical study, with 50 cases
      planned for a period of 3 years. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the consistency and
      accuracy of a Patient-Derived Organoid (PDO) Model of lung cancer to predict the clinical
      efficacy of anti-cancer drugs, in order to predict the best chemotherapy regimen for each
      given patient.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the project is to use a combination of patient-derived organoid models:

        -  To amplify tumour tissue to obtain enough material for genomic and histological analysis

        -  to characterize the lung cancer sub-type

        -  To predict treatment (non)response.

      The following points will be addressed:

        1. First, the investigators plan to establish and characterize formation of organoids from
           biopsies of patients with lung cancer: in spheroids, in the 3D cellular model
           OncoCilAirTM (OncoTheis), and on the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM).
           Patient-derived organoids from tumoural tissue (PDO) will be characterized and compared
           to the original tumour.

        2. Second, the investigators will test the chemoresponse (chemosensitivity and
           chemoresistance) of organoids to anti-cancer treatment.

      Biospecimen retention: blood; cells; tumour tissue for immunohistochemical analysis.

      Tissue of lung cancer will be collected during surgery in a way that will not interfere with
      subsequent pathological analysis and staging. Under the premise of ensuring normal detection
      requirements, a certain volume of fresh tumour tissues will be subjected to ex vivo 3-D
      culture to establish patient-derived tumour organoid models. The lung patient-derived
      organoids will be characterized. The organs successfully cultured will be kept in liquid
      nitrogen for at least 10 years.
