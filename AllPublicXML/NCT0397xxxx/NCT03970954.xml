  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the ability of low dose IL-2 to stimulate
      peripheral blood Tregs of women with unexplained repeated early spontaneous miscarriages for
      development of a therapy to prevent fetal rejection by low dose IL-2.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      About 1 to 3% of women of childbearing age have repeated early spontaneous miscarriages that
      may be related to parental chromosomal abnormalities, uterine abnormalities, hormonal causes,
      infectious etiology, thrombophilia ... When one of these known causes is excluded, it is
      unexplained miscarriages of which half would be due to an immunological deregulation of the
      mother causing a decrease of the tolerance to the fetus.

      In this context, the stimulation of regulatory T cells (Tregs) by low dose IL-2 is a
      therapeutic option with a rational, preclinical and clinical data very favorable.

      In humans, low dose IL-2 allows preferential activation of Tregs and is very well tolerated.
      Several therapeutic trials have shown its efficiencies.

      These elements make it possible to envisage the development of a therapeutic to prevent fetal
      rejection by IL2-fd on the women with spontaneous miscarriages by an immunological
      deregulation.
