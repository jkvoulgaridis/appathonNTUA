  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare once-daily tacrolimus extended-release (Envarsus XR®)
      to twice-daily immediate release tacrolimus to find out if people taking tacrolimus extended
      release (Envarsus XR®) report fewer side effects, increased medication compliance and higher
      scores on quality of life assessments compared to people taking twice daily tacrolimus
      immediate release.

    <textblock>
      Despite improvement in short-term graft outcomes in organ transplant, transplant patients
      still have to take on complex medication regimens to achieve current results. Adherence to
      these complex medications is an important problem in light of the potential risk of acute and
      chronic rejection and the associated burden of increased hospitalization, cost, and
      diminished quality of life that results from missed doses and poor overall drug taking. Part
      of the diminished quality of life is also tied to the bothersome symptoms patient feel after
      transplant. Most patients experience symptoms that relate to either the overall transplant
      immunosuppression or medication specific side effects. In the BENEFIT and BENEFIT-EXT trials,
      &gt;60% of patients reported tiredness and lack of energy as an issue. Sleep problems, mood
      swings, restlessness, anxiety, depression, and concentration and memory difficulties appeared
      in approximately 50-60% of patients. In addition to these symptoms, &gt;38% patients also
      reported numerous others side effects that have been strongly associated with
      calcineurin-inhibitors such as tacrolimus that include dizziness, muscle cramps, trembling
      hands, tingling in hands and feet, and headache.

      The investigators hypothesize that the use of once-daily Envarsus XR® could decrease some
      transplant- and tacrolimus-related adverse symptoms and potentially lead to improvement in
      quality of life and medication adherence when compared to twice-daily tacrolimus. In order to
      assess this hypothesis, a prospective, multi-center, randomized, open-label, pilot study to
      investigate medication adherence and patient reported symptom occurrence and interference
      with daily life comparing once-daily Envarsus XR® and twice-daily immediate release
      tacrolimus in adult renal transplant recipients (SIMPLE) is being proposed.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The primary objective of this study is to compare tacrolimus formulations (Envarsus XR® versus twice a day tacrolimus) based on the difference in mean Calcineurin Inhibitor-Related Symptoms (CIRS) severity score.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The CIRS is a questionnaire that assesses five symptoms (from the Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [PRO-CTCAE]) that have been shown to be associated with calcineurin inhibitors. These symptoms include trembling hands, muscle cramps, muscle weakness, swollen gums, and increased hair growth. Each symptom is based on symptom severity in the last 7 days scaled from 0 (none) - 4 (very severe). The cumulative score ranges from 0-20.</description>

    <measure>Change in transplant-related symptoms as measured by the difference in mean transplant-related symptoms (TRS) score.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months post-transplant</time_frame>
    <description>The TRS is a multi-item questionnaire capturing 15 symptoms (from PRO-CTCAE) that have been shown to be associated with transplant and general health-related quality of life improvement. These symptoms include change in taste, constipation, diarrhea, swelling in arms or legs, palpitations, dry skin, darkening of skin, blurry vision, headache, insomnia, anxiety, sadness, discouraged, increase in appetite, and fatigue. Each symptom is based on symptom severity in the last 7 days and scaled from 0 (none) - 4 (very severe). Some symptoms also have added questions pertaining to frequency and/or interference with daily activities.</description>
