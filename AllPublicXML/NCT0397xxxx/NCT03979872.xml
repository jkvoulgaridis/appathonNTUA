    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study will be to provide undergraduate students information about skin
      cancer risk and prevention. The study will last between 2-3 months. Everyone in the study
      will be asked to answer questionnaires and receive education about skin cancer risk factors
      and prevention. We will follow-up with participants by phone, text messages or e-mail in
      between study visits

      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of four groups, the group will be in is decided
      by chance. Participant will either be assigned to:

        -  A group that gets advice about what causes skin cancer and how to prevent it

        -  A group that gets this advice and provides a saliva sample to receive personalized skin
           cancer risk genetic testing results

        -  A group that gets this advice and receives a personalized photo that shows existing skin
           damage

        -  A group that gets this advice, receives genetic testing results, and receives a
           personalized photo.

      Arm 1: Skin Cancer Education Only

      Screening: Participants will have the option to complete and online or text based screening
      form. Study staff may contact participants who screen to be eligible via phone, text, or
      email. Study staff will screen potential participants who do not complete the screening form
      on their own for eligibility. Participants will be contacted by phone, text, or email
      (starting with the method they indicated would be best to reach them) to schedule their first
      study visit.

      Enrollment

      Visit 1: All participants who consent to participate will be asked to participate in up to 3
      study visits approximately 4 weeks apart. At visit 1, all participants will be asked to
      complete informed consent procedures and a baseline questionnaire via computer (e.g., using
      Qualtrics) or paper. Participants will be randomized to receive education only, or varying
      combinations of the intervention components.

      Visit 2: At visit 2 participants will receive education on the importance of skin cancer
      prevention behaviors (e.g., sunscreen, protective clothing) and avoiding tanning and
      sunburns. All education will be delivered at this visit on a computer screen and additionally
      given to participants as a handout they can take home to review. When participants view the
      information on the computer screen, eye tracking will be used to assess participant response.
      Prior to viewing results, eye tracking equipment set up at the computer station will be
      calibrated. We will then put up their results on the screen and the imotion system will then
      track their pupillary movement, facial expression, and galvanic skin response (physiological
      arousal). Participants will be allowed as much time as they would like to review their
      results. Following this, participants will complete a post assessment. Participants will
      receive paper copies of all of the relevant information to take home with them.

      Visit 3: Visit 3 may be conducted remotely. At visit 3, participants will complete a
      follow-up assessment.

      Follow-up interview: A random sample of the participant population with be contacted to
      participate in a follow-up interview with study staff to answer questions about their
      experience participating in the RISE-UP study.

      Arm 2: Skin Cancer Education + UV Photo

      Screening: Participants will have the option to complete and online or text based screening
      form. Study staff may contact participants who screen to be eligible via phone, text, or
      email.Study staff will screen potential participants who do not complete the screening form

      complete informed consent procedures and a baseline questionnaire via computer (e.g., using
      Qualtrics) or paper. Participants will be randomized to receive education only, or varying
      combinations of the intervention components. Participants randomized to the education + UV
      photo arm will have their UV light photo taken of their face to show UV damage in the skin
      that is invisible to the naked eye. Photos will be taken with the VISIA Facial Complexion
      Analysis System, which captures high resolution imagery at the far spectrum of UVA or long
      wave UV.

      Visit 2: At visit 2 participants will receive education on the importance of skin cancer
      prevention behaviors (e.g., sunscreen, protective clothing) and avoiding tanning and
      sunburns. Participants will be provided with their personalized risk feedback based on their
      personalized photo showing their skin's existing UVR damage from UVR exposure. All
      information will be delivered at this visit on a computer screen and additionally given to
      participants as a handout they can take home to review. When participants view their results
      on the computer screen, eye tracking will be used to assess participant response. Prior to

      pupillary movement, facial expression, and galvanic skin response (physiological arousal).
      Participants will be allowed as much time as they would like to review their results.
      Following this, participants will complete a post assessment. The imagery resulting will be
      kept on file in a password protected computer. Participants will receive paper copies of all
      of the relevant information to take home with them.

      Visit 3: Visit 3 may be conducted remotely. At visit 3, participants will complete a
      follow-up assessment.

      testing arm will be asked to be provide a saliva sample. Saliva will be collected by study
      staff using a system for the collection, stabilization and transportation of DNA from saliva
      (e.g., Oragene DNA collection kits). Molecular evaluation will be performed at the genetic,
      enzymatic (protein and RNA), and cellular response levels to identify melanoma predisposition
      genes.

      Visit 2: At visit 2 participants will receive education on the importance of skin cancer
      prevention behaviors (e.g., sunscreen, protective clothing) and avoiding tanning and
      sunburns. Participants will be provided with their personalized risk feedback based on a
      summary of their MC1R genetic testing results. All information will be delivered at this
