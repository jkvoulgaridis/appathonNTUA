      The overall goal of this proposal is to test the effect of exercise to delay or avert HCC
      recurrence and gain information regarding the potential molecular mechanisms of HCC tumor
      inhibition by exercise.

      Primary liver cancer is the leading cause of cancer worldwide. The majority of primary liver
      cancers are hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and occur in the setting of cirrhosis of the
      liver. Body fat and systemic inflammation are determinants of HCC risk. Cirrhotic patients
      with HCC are often treated with locoregional therapies including transarterial
      chemoembolization (TACE) as a bridge to liver transplantation. Despite this, HCC recurrence
      rates approach 80%. There is a growing body of evidence to suggest the benefit of exercise in
      cancer patients. Exercise decreases disease recurrence and improves survival in other primary
      cancers by altering tumor biology and influencing response to treatment. Although animal
      models suggest biologic plausibility, whether or not exercise prevents HCC recurrence in
      cancer patients remains unknown. The overall goal of this proposal is to test the effect of
      exercise to delay or avert HCC recurrence and gain information regarding the potential
      molecular mechanisms of HCC tumor inhibition by exercise.

    <description>Defined as completing &gt;80% of the sessions.(46, 47) While this would be expected for patients with cirrhosis,(46) this would be five-fold larger than the proportion of oncology patients receiving systemic treatment who complete other exercise based randomized controlled trials. We expect exercise in subjects with HCC in the background of Child Pugh Turcotte (CPT) Class A cirrhosis without hepatic decompensation (e.g., ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, bleeding gastroesophageal varices) and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 0-2 functional status to be feasible.</description>
