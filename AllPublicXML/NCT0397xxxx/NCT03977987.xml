  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effective control of nucleos(t)ide analogues for patients infected with hepatitis B has
      significantly curbed the horizontal transmission of hepatitis B. However, the vertical
      transmission remains a serious threat to public health for directly increasing the burden of
      hepatitis B worldwide with the transmission rate up to 80 to 90% among high HBV DNA level if
      untreated. Currently, the effective prevention of mother-to-child transmission is credited to
      the implement of HBV vaccination and hepatitis B virus immunoglobin. To leave nobody behind,
      a growing body of evidence has been yielded to support the use of nucleos(t)ide analogues in
      the mothers during the late pregnancy. However, the clinical practice can be more complex.
      Therefore, investigators aim to assess the effectiveness of maternal antiviral therapy and
      different infants immunoprophylaxis strategy in the prevention of chronic hepatitis infection
      among children whose mothers were infected with chronic hepatitis B infection in the real
      world setting.

      From 2011 to 2017, the investigators consecutively enrolled the pregnant women with chronic
      hepatitis B infection who were less than 28 weeks pregnant and not treated with nucleos(t)ide
      analogues during pregnancy. The investigators recommended those pregnant women with HBV DNA &gt;
      2*10^6 IU/ml to receive nucleos(t)ide analogues from 28 weeks of pregnancy to delivery.
      Patients who agreed the antiviral treatment would assigned to the treatment group and those
      who declined it were assigned to the control group with high HBV DNA level. Meanwhile, those
      pregnant women with HBV DNA &lt; 2*10^6 IU/ml was assigned as the control group with low HBV DNA
      level. All infants would be instructed to receive hepatitis B vaccine and hepatitis B virus
      immunoglobulin within 24 hours after birth, defined as the standard immunoprophylaxis
      strategy and encouraged to receive immunoprophylaxis within 2 hours after birth, defined as
      the aggressive immunoprophylaxis strategy. Umbilical cord blood were collected to determine
      the HBV serological markers and HBV DNA level. Children were followed every three to four
      years until December 2018.

        In the real-world setting, we recruited consecutively HBsAg positive women who were less
        than 28 weeks pregnant and underwent routine testing for HBV at the Department of
        Infectious Diseases of Taicang First People's Hospital at least twice during pregnancy.
        Patients were excluded from participation if they had been treated with antiviral drugs
        during pregnancy. Additional exclusion criteria were drug hypersensitivity, abnormal renal
        laboratory results, coinfection with human immunodeficiency virus or other human hepatitis
        viruses.
