  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Active Surveillance (AS) is a treatment option in patients with favorable risk prostate
      cancer. According to the current guidelines patients are monitored by prostate specific
      antigen (PSA) testing (every 3 months) and regular re-biopsies. Due to histological
      reclassification and/or patient noncompliance a high number of patients discontinue AS.
      Nonetheless, because of an increasing number of diagnosed early stage tumors overdiagnosis
      and overtreatment of patients has become a major clinical problem. Therefore AS is a
      promising and important tool for patients with low and intermediate risk prostate cancer.

      Multiparametric MRI (mp-MRI) in combination with radiomics analysis, MR-guided biopsies, and
      molecular markers are promising tools to optimize patient selection and observation during
      AS.

      This prospective, single arm, multicenter phase II study evaluates mp-MRI, radiomics,
      MR-guided biopsies and molecular markers for AS with the primary endpoint of reducing
      discontinuation based on histologic reclassification.

      At the end of this study the results may allow defining a MRI-based pathway to identify and
      monitor patients suitable for AS supported by radiomics. Thus, the high rate of
      discontinuation due to misclassification at initial diagnosis will be reduced.

      Additionally, this strategy will allow reducing over-treatment of clinically insignificant
      PCA, and on the other hand, increasing early treatment of higher-risk disease. Monitoring by
      mp-MRI will reduce the number of prostate biopsies and cores per patient during AS, and thus
      increase the patient compliance. Finally, such a strategy will reduce the economic burden of
      treating insignificant prostate cancer.

      This prospective multicenter phase II study evaluates multiparametric MRI (mp-MRI), radiomics
      and MR-guided biopsies for Active Surveillance (AS) of men with low- and intermediate-risk
      prostate cancer (PCA) with the primary endpoint of reducing the rate of discontinuation of AS
      based on histologic reclassification in an observation period of 24 months.

      Men with low- or intermediate-risk PCA diagnosed by mp-MRI followed by an MR/ultrasound
      fusion-guided biopsy (FUS-GB) plus systematic ultrasound-guided biopsy (SB) will be included
      in this study.

      During the study observation period PSA values will be obtained every 3 months. After having
      obtained three values PSA doubling times (PSA-DT) will be calculated at every visit. In case
      of PSA-DT &lt;3 years patients will get a repeat mp-MRI and in case of MRI progression a repeat
      targeted FUS-GB plus SB will be performed. In case of a Gleason score upgrading by the
      targeted biopsy the patient will discontinue AS and get treatment. In cases of stable MRI or
      stable Gleason score the patient will continue with PSA controls every 3 months.

      In addition all patients with stable PSA values will undergo a mp-MRI after 12 months. If
      this MRI demonstrates progression the protocol proceeds as mentioned above for patients with
      PSA-increase. At the end of study (24 months after enrollment), all patients will receive
      another mp-MRI and FUS-GB+SB.
