  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, diffusion tensor imaging（DTI）technique was used to evaluate the brain
      microstructures and connective white matter microstructures in patients with refractory FD,
      resting fMRI was used to evaluate the functional connectivity between hemispheres, and
      neuroimaging changes after antidepressant intervention were observed to explore the
      activation patterns of resting brain homeostasis-receptive network areas in patients with
      refractory FD. We aimed to explore microstructure of white matter and gray matter and
      functional connectivity between hemispheres to explain the therapeutic mechanism of
      antidepressants.

      In this study, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to investigate the
      abnormal activation patterns of brain regions in patients with refractory FD in resting
      state, and to observe the changes of brain functions after antidepressant treatment, in order
      to find scientific evidence for exploring the etiology, neuropathological mechanism and the
      mechanism of antidepressant treatment of refractory FD.
