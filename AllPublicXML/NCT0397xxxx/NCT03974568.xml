      Peripheral perfusion index (PPI) is variable measured by Radical-7 (Masimo) device and
      reflects the ratio between pulsatile and non-pulsatile portions of peripheral circulation.
      PPI is characterized by being non-invasive, real time, and simple variable. Impairment of
      various perfusion indices (such as central venous oxygen saturation and serum lactate) during
      spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) were previously reported; however, these indices are
      characterized by being relatively invasive. We hypothesized that impairment of PPI during SBT
      might be predictive of weaning failure. The aim of this work was to evaluate the possible
      association between PPI and success of SBT

      This prospective observational study will be carried out in surgical intensive care unit
      (SICU) unit of trauma and emergency hospital at Cairo University teaching hospital. Informed
      consent will be obtained from patients' next-of-kin prior to the enrolment in the study. All
      mechanically ventilated patients for more than 48 hours presented will be consecutively
      included.

      The excluded patients are: patients &lt; 18 years, patients with peripheral vascular disease,
      patients on vasopressors, and those with hand injuries hindering which would preclude the
      application of the device probe will be excluded.

      Assessment of readiness to wean from mechanical ventilation will be done by ICU physician
      according to the ICU protocol Spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) will be applied through
      pressure support (PS) mode with PS 5 cmH2O and positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) 5
      cmH2O for 30 minutes; then, weaning parameters will be assessed again. The decision of
      extubation will be taken by the intensivist in charge who is blinded to peripheral perfusion
      index (PPI) measurements. Weaning failure will be defined according to the guidelines of
      international conference on weaning from mechanical ventilation PPI will be continuously
      monitored using Radical-7 device pulse co-oximeter (Masimo corporation, Irvine, CA) via a
      pulse oximeter probe applied to the third or fourth digit of left hand. The probe will be
      covered with an opaque shield to avoid any error by external light sources. A baseline
      reading for PPI will be obtained followed by a reading each 5 minutes till the end of the
      SBT. We calculated a PPI ratio to evaluate the change in PPI during SBT. PPI ratio is defined
      as PPI by the end of SBT / baseline PPI).
