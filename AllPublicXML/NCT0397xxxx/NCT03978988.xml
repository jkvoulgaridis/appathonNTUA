  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tandem occlusion is defined by an acute ischemic stroke (AIS) with concomitant
      steno-occlusive disease of the extra cranial carotid artery and concerned about 10% of AIS
      patients. Whereas endovascular treatment has shown its efficiency in AIS by large vessel
      occlusion (LVO), to date, there is no consensus on the endovascular management of the extra
      cranial carotid artery in tandem occlusion. Only few of them were included in previous
      randomized trials who evaluated mechanical thrombectomy and were often listed in the
      non-inclusion criteria. Therapeutic management of this population was not specifically
      addressed in recent trials. Endovascular management can be complex with the need of acute
      stenting of the extra cranial carotid lesion along with the potential need of antithrombotic
      therapy initiation, the benefit and the safety of stenting of the cervical lesion in acute
      phase of AIS have shown encouraging results but however remains to be assessed. The TITAN
      (Thrombectomy In TANdem lesion) trial aims to demonstrate the superiority of the combined use
      of intracranial thrombectomy and extracranial carotid stenting compared to intracranial
      thrombectomy alone on the complete reperfusion rate in patients with acute ischemic stroke
      due to tandem lesion.

    <textblock>
      The TITAN trial is a prospective, randomized, multi center, controlled, open-label, blinded
      clinical trial. This academic trial designed to answer the question: &quot;What is the best
      endovascular management of the extra cranial carotid artery lesion in tandem occlusion with
      LVO&quot; Patients will be recruited at 13 comprehensive stroke centers in France, all of which
      regular conduct mechanical thrombectomy and carotid stenting.

      This study will enroll adults patients admitted with cerebral infarction of the anterior
      circulation, proven by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) angiography,
      associated with tandem lesion, within 8 hours of symptoms onset, with a neurological deficit
      NIHSS &gt; 5, and eligible to thrombectomy according to the recommendations of the French
      societies of neurovascular disease and neuroradiology (SFNR and SFNV).

      Tandem occlusion of the anterior circulation will be proven on digital subtraction
      angiography, defined as a proximal intracranial occlusion and an extracranial severe internal
      carotid artery (ICA) lesion (complete occlusion or stenosis ≥90% North American Symptomatic
      Carotid Endarterectomy Trial).

      Informed Consent according to the French laws will be sought from the patient if their level
      of consciousness is sufficient or from a relative. This study will operate using an emergency
      inclusion protocol due to the nature of the condition.

      After emergency inclusion procedure according to French regulations, eligible patients will
      be randomized in two balanced parallel groups to receive either combined treatment
      intracranial thrombectomy with carotid stenting or intracranial thrombectomy alone.

      Treatment and Intervention Intravenous thrombolysis will be administered if possible.
      Standard MT will be performed with a balloon Guide Catheter (BGC). MT technique (contact
      aspiration, stent retriever, or solumbra) will be left at the discretion of the operators.

      Concerning the cervical disease, emergent carotid stenting will be performed if the patient
      is randomized in the intervention arm. The order to treat (head first or neck first), and the
      choice of a previous angioplasty of the extracranial carotid artery lesion will be left to
      the interventionist discretion. An intravenous bolus of 250mg of Aspirin will be given at the
      end of the procedure in case of absence of complication.

      Intravenous sedation or general anesthesia will be permitted.

      Primary objective :

      To demonstrate the superiority of intracranial thrombectomy and extracranial carotid stenting
      compared to intracranial thrombectomy alone on the complete reperfusion (mTICI 3 at the end
      of the endovascular procedure) rate and on the rate of NIHSS ≥ 4 points improvement at 24
      hours in AIS patients with a tandem occlusion of the anterior circulation.

      Secondary objectives :

        1. To assess the feasibility and the efficacy of the combined approach associating
           intracranial thrombectomy and extracranial carotid stenting compared to intracranial
           thrombectomy alone using a composite criterion (mTICI3 at the end of the endovascular
           procedure or NIHSS improvement ≥ 4 points at 24h).

        2. To compare the safety of intracranial thrombectomy and extracranial carotid stenting
           compared to intracranial thrombectomy alone.

        3. To evaluate the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of the combined approach compared to
           intracranial thrombectomy alone.

      Data Monitoring Body Day 1: A clinical evaluation will be performed with a NIHSS assessment.
      An imaging will be performed at 24 +/- 12 hours including an angiographic imaging (angioCT ou
      angioMR) will be performed to evaluate the carotid patency.

      In the absence of hemorrhagic classification, a clopidogrel dose (75 mg/day) will be
      administered for 3 months. In case of hemorrhagic complication, antiplatelet therapy will be
      left to the vascular neurologist decision.

      Day 90: Assessment of the clinical outcome at three months will be conducted by an
      independent committee unaware of the study group assignments. Vascular imaging (Doppler or
      angioCT) will be performed at 90 days before clinical examination in order to evaluate the
      carotid patency.

      The Data and Safety Monitored Board (DSMB) will provide subject safety oversight and make
      recommendations to the Sponsor regarding continuing enrollment, modifying, or stopping the
      study early based upon a review of safety data and more specifically the comparative rates of
      symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage and, neurological worsening (NIHSS4 points increase), at
      D1, and mortality rates. They will take into account in their decision making and
      recommendations the rates of procedure-related and device-related events in the treatment
      group.

      DSMB meetings will be organized by call conference by the sponsor before the start of the
      study and every year until the end of the study. The members will also receive the results of
      interim analyses. Additional extraordinary meetings will be set if necessary.

      It will be constituted with two independent clinicians and one expert in methodology.

      Sample Size Estimates Prior data indicate that a reperfusion rate of 30% mTICI 3 was observed
      with mechanical thrombectomy in patients with tandem lesions. Assuming acute carotid stenting
      will bring a 15% gain, a sample size of 162 patients per group will allow to evidence such
      gain with a 80% power at a 5% type I error (PS v3.0). Allowing 5% loss to follow up leads to
      include 216 patients per group, i.e. 432 patients in total
