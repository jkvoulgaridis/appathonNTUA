  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sickle cell disease (SCD) necessitates a paediatric treatment plan that considers the
      influence of psychological, family and intercultural factors. At the Louis-Mourier Hospital
      (APHP) in Colombes, France, a paediatric-psychological partnership where a clinical
      psychologist accompanies the paediatrician at programmed consultations was introduced.

      The psychological repercussions of SCD were assessed among children and their parents treated
      in Colombes and in two other paediatric units without a paediatric-psychological partnership.
