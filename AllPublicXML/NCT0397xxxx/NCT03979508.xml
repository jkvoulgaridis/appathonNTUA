      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate abemaciclib, a CDK4/6 inhibitor, in patients
      with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) who have residual disease following neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy, but prior to surgery. The goal is to assess the novel mechanisms by which
      abemaciclib may activate the immune system and decrease the likelihood of metastases in
      triple negative breast cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine the effects of abemaciclib on the CD8/FOXP3 ratio in chemotherapy resistant
      triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients following neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess abemaciclib toxicities. II. To examine the effects of abemaciclib on the percentage
      of vimentin expressing invasive cancer cells.

      III. Within TNBC molecular subtypes (basal, mesenchymal, and luminal androgen receptor
      [LAR]), to evaluate the effects of abemaciclib on the individual elements of tumor grade
      (mitoses, nuclear pleomorphism, and tubule formation).

      IV. Within TNBC molecular subtypes (basal, mesenchymal, and LAR), to evaluate the effects of
      abemaciclib on tumor proliferation (as measured by tumor Ki-67 and serum tyrosine kinase
      inhibitor [TKI]).

      V. Within TNBC molecular subtypes (basal, mesenchymal, and LAR), to evaluate the effects of
      abemaciclib on pDUB3 as well as tyrosine-protein kinase ITK/TSK (EMT) markers including
      SNAIL/SLUG, TWIST, and E-Cadherin as measured by immunohistochemistry (IHC).

      VI. Within TNBC molecular subtypes (basal, mesenchymal, and LAR), to evaluate the effects of
      abemaciclib on quantification of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (as examined by hematoxylin
      and eosin staining method [H&amp;E]).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the effect of abemaciclib on tumor ribonucleic acid (RNA)-seq data using the
      gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and CIBERSORT methods.

      II. Using the suspension mass cytometry (HeliosTM system) to evaluate the effects of
      abemaciclib on the phenotype of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) as well as
      formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor sections (imaging mass cytometry (HyperionTM
      system) which will include: a) genes directly involved in tumor cell antigen presentation
      (B2M, HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, TAP1, TAP2, TAPBP); b) interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) that
      regulate antigen presentation (e.g. STAT1, NLRC5) and other ISGs (IRFs, OAS2); c) genes
      involved in double strand (ds)RNA response (DDX58, DHX58); d) genes encoding interferons,
      including type 3 IFNs (IFNL1, IFNL2, IFNL3); e) genes indicating a cytotoxic T cell response
      (PRF1, GZMB); f) regulatory T cell (Treg)-specific transcription factor genes (FOXP3, IKZF2).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive abemaciclib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-14 or days 1-21 in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo standard of
      care surgical resection.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 30-60 days.

    <time_frame>Up to 21 days</time_frame>
    <description>A Simon optimum two stage phase II clinical trial design was chosen to test the null hypothesis that the rate of conversion to post-abemaciclib CD8/FOXP3 ratio of 1.6 or more is =&lt; 5% against the alternative that rate of conversion to post-abemaciclib CD8/FOXP3 ratio of 1.6 or more is &gt;= 20% with the target probability of a type I error and probability of a type II error set to 0.10. The probability of terminating after the first stage is 0.736, if the null hypothesis is true. A point estimate for the rate of conversion from a post NAC CD8/FOXP3 ratio &lt; 1.6 to a post-abemaciclib CD8/FOXP3 ratio &gt;=1.6 is calculated as the proportion of eligible patients whose post-abemaciclib CD8/FOXP3 ratio &gt;=1.6 among the eligible patients whose began abemaciclib treatment after a post NAC finding of a residual tumor CD8/FOXP3 ratio &gt;=1.6. A 90% confidence interval for this rate of conversion will be constructed using the Duffy-Santner approach taking into account the sequential nature of the study</description>
