    <textblock>
      This pilot trial studies the usability and usefulness of a computer-based system for
      reporting symptoms in patients with cancer undergoing treatment. Cancer patients undergoing
      cancer treatment are not always comfortable contacting the doctor when experiencing symptoms.
      A computer based platform, where patients can input symptoms, may seem less intrusive than a
      phone call and may improve patient access to care.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the usability and usefulness of a computer-based system for cancer patient
      symptom reporting.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To collect preliminary effectiveness data: quality of life outcomes with the Function
      Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General (FACT-G) and self-efficacy as measured by Chronic
      Disease Self-Efficacy Scale, Revised (CDSES-R).

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Participants receive usual care for 3 weeks, then use a computer-based symptom
      reporting system for 3 weeks. Caregivers may assist patients in the use of the computer based
      symptoms reporting system.

      ARM II: Participants use a computer-based symptom reporting system for 3 weeks, then receive
      usual care for 3 weeks. Caregivers may assist patients in the use of the computer based
      symptoms reporting system.

      After completing study intervention, participants are followed up for 30 days.

    <description>Assessed with the System Usability Scale (SUS). The SUS is a 10-item 5-point Likert scale usability measure, scored from 0 (least usable) to 100 (most usable). The mean SUS scores (only during the active cancer treatment) will be computed with the corresponding 90% confidence intervals.</description>

    <description>Evaluated using the quality of life outcome Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General (FACT-G) scale. For the FACT-G, the 4 repeated measures (excluding the baseline) will be analyzed in linear mixed effects models with the random effect of user group (patient and caregiver) and fixed effect of period, sequence. The model will be used to compute the 90% confidence intervals for the mean FACT-G on usual care and on the digital system.</description>
