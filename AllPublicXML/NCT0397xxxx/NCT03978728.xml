  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) can temporarily help patients gain time to wait
      for cardiopulmonary recovery or further treatment in patients with cardiopulmonary failure.
      Whether the blood flow provided by the ECMO can maintain the perfusion of various organs is
      an important factor affecting survival. Some ECMO patients died after the complication of
      sepsis. Our previous pilot analysis has recognized several ECMO patients with complicated
      sepsis has high endotoxin activity level. Endotoxemia can also occur in heart surgery and
      after cardiopulmonary bypass, trauma, organ transplantation, and out-of-hospital cardiac
      arrest patients. These trials used endotoxin activity analysis (EAA, EAATM, Spectral
      Diagnostics Inc., Canada) to analyze endotoxin activity. In addition, studies have indicated
      that the combination of procalcitonin (PCT) concentration and EAA activity can improve the
      accuracy of predicting sepsis. The primary aim of this study is to detect endotoxin activity
      in patients with ECMO support and compare whether the prognosis was associated with different
      level of EAA activity. The secondary aims are to analyze the risk factors leading to high EAA
      activity and investigate the diagnostic value of septic shock combining PCT examination. We
      suggest that the results of this study may help the ECMO medical team identify patients at
      high risk for septic shock and conduct adequate managements to improve patient survival and
      quality of life after survival.
