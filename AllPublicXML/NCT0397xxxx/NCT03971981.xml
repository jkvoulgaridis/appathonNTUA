  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      a double-blind cross-over in vivo study was performed to measure the salivary concentration
      of Xylitol released from the two chewing gums containing different amount of the polyol. The
      study had a cross-over design: the first half of the sample used the chewing-gum with Xylitol
      as the only sweeteners (64.5% of chewing-gum weight) and the other half use the chewing-gum
      with Xylitol among the sweeteners (22% of chewing-gum weight), after a 7-days wash-out
      period, the two sub-groups inverted the chewing gums. Subjects were instructed to consume the
      products as they normally would be consumed.
