    <description>Participants (participants pretreated with ocrelizumab) will receive a single injection of subcutaneous (SC) ocrelizumab co-mixed with rHuPH20 in the abdomen. For every new dose level, recruitment will be staggered by enrolling 1 participant in each cohort followed by a 48-hour waiting period to review safety and tolerability data by the Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) prior to enrolling subsequent participants in the same cohort. Currently, the planned dose escalation steps for patients who enroll in Group A are as follows:
Cohort A1: 40 mg of SC ocrelizumab
Cohort A2: 200 mg of SC ocrelizumab
Cohort A3: 600 mg of SC ocrelizumab
Cohort A4: 1200 mg of SC ocrelizumab</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (PPMS) or Relapsing Multiple
             Sclerosis (RMS) according to the revised McDonald 2017 criteria (Thompson et al. 2018)

          -  Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score, 0-6.5, inclusive, at screening

          -  Absence of relapses for 30 days prior to the screening visit

          -  For the dose escalation phase for participants pretreated with ocrelizumab (Group A):

        treatment with IV ocrelizumab for at least 1 year prior to screening (i.e., at least two
        600-mg doses of ocrelizumab separated by 24 weeks)

          -  For women of childbearing potential: agreement to remain abstinent or use acceptable
             contraceptive methods during the treatment period and for 6 months after the final
             dose of ocrelizumab.

          -  For female perticipants without reproductive potential:

        Women may be enrolled if post-menopausal unless the participant is receiving a hormonal
        therapy for her menopause or if surgically sterile (i.e., hysterectomy, complete bilateral
        oophorectomy).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  MS disease duration of more than 15 years for participants with an Expanded Disability
             Status Scale (EDSS) score &lt;2.0 at screening.
