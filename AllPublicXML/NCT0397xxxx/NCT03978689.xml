    <textblock>
      This is a multi center, open-label, phase 1 dose escalation and expansion study evaluating
      the safety, anti-tumor effect, and immunogenicity of CUE-101 in patients with
      recurrent/metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CUE-101 is a novel fusion protein designed to activate and expand a population of tumor
      specific T cells to eradicate human papilloma virus (HPV)-driven malignancies. HPV causes
      multiple tumor types including cervical, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and
      anal cancers. Initial testing of CUE-101 will be conducted in HPV16+ HNSCC patients.

      The primary objectives of the first-in-human trial are to assess the safety and tolerability
      of CUE-101 in subjects with recurrent/metastatic HNSCC and to determine the maximum tolerated
      dose or recommended Phase 2 dose based on markers of biological activity. Pharmacokinetics
      (PK), antitumor immune response, preliminary antitumor activity and the potential for
      immunogenicity will also be assessed. This will be an open-label multicenter phase I trial
      conducted in the U.S. involving approximately 50 patients.
