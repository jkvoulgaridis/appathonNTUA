  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are great disparities in the prevalence of obesity and chronic disease in different
      sociodemographic groups. US Hispanic adults, in particular, have a higher prevalence of
      obesity and chronic diseases than non-Hispanic whites. Population aging is also a major
      contributing factor to the high prevalence of chronic disease, and Hispanics already make up
      approximately 10% of the older population. Therefore, preventive measures are needed to
      reduce the burden of chronic disease risks for Hispanics. Current lifestyle interventions for
      weight management have been particularly ineffective in this population.

      The purpose of this pilot project is to develop a novel tailored lifestyle intervention for
      use by Hispanic older adults with obesity. The Healthy Weight for Living intervention has
      been validated among adults with mixed racial/ethnic backgrounds and has achieved clinically
      impactful weight-loss. Its design features make it particularly suitable for use in
      populations with low adherence to traditional interventions, including no requirement for
      daily food logging and no increase in physical activity.

      The final product of this project will be a culturally adapted prototype intervention in
      Hispanic older adults that accounts for cultural heterogeneity. This work has direct
      relevance to reducing health disparities and the burden of obesity-associated chronic disease
      in a particularly at-risk population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The scientific premise of this project is that appropriately tailored lifestyle interventions
      for weight loss can achieve clinically impactful weight loss in Hispanic adults with obesity.
      Older adults will be the focus, recognizing that requirements for tailoring may vary
      according to age group. Given that older adults have a higher risk of chronic diseases caused
      by obesity, there is a great need to focus on factors that disproportionately affect older
      Hispanic adults. The objective of this project is to tailor a validated lifestyle
      intervention developed and used by our team in ethnically mixed populations to older Hispanic
      adults with obesity. This novel intervention does not require food logging or a large
      increase in physical activity to achieve weight loss, making it more acceptable to population
      groups with low adherence to traditional interventions. The long-term goal of this work is to
      create an effective, culturally acceptable, sustainable, and scalable lifestyle weight
      management program for routine use in Hispanic adults with obesity. Findings from this work
      will be directly applicable to future community interventions and will be relevant for public
      health measures in this at-risk population.

      The specific aims are:

      Aim 1: To conduct focus groups in Hispanic older adults with obesity to identify factors that
      can be addressed in the tailored intervention. Information will be collected on practical and
      cultural barriers and promoters of successful weight management, including food access,
      dietary patterns, physical activity, time and financial constraints, and additional
      psychosocial and cultural factors.

      Hypothesis 1: Malleable dietary and psychosocial targets for weight loss and weight loss
      maintenance can be identified, including factors such as food cravings, hunger and
      disinhibited eating that have been shown to be effective targets in other population groups.

      Aim 2: To conduct a pilot behavioral intervention of an initially adapted program in Hispanic
      older adults with obesity. A prototype bilingual English-Spanish lifestyle intervention for
      weight reduction will be created. The prototype will then be iteratively refined during a
      series of short-term tests (two tests lasting 4 weeks, followed by a final test lasting 12
      weeks) of intervention delivery. In these interventions, % weight loss, % drop-out, and
      safety benchmarks will be monitored. Participant-reported barriers to adherence identified
      during group meetings and exit interviews will be targets for improvement in successive
      iterations.

      Hypothesis 2: Successive refinement of the program will result in progressive improvements in
      mean % weight loss and participant retention.

      The final products of this project will be: a) a prototype adapted intervention in older US
      adults of Hispanic background, accounting for cultural heterogeneity in this population; and
      b) identification of additional barriers that can be addressed in subsequent iterations of
      the intervention.

    <description>The Healthy Weight for Living (HWL) intervention, previously developed at the Energy Metabolism Laboratory (HNRCA), is broadly informed by the same behavior change theories as other interventions. For example, it also recognizes individual and environmental factors as potential areas to support behavior change for weight regulation, and provides practical tools for facilitating new habits. However, the HWL places greater emphasis on the role of biology in influencing eating behavior, giving a central role to hunger and food cravings as modulators of eating behavior. Therefore, HWL does not emphasize self-monitoring food intake and does not require increasing physical activity for effectiveness. The new intervention also targets autonomous motivation and prioritizes ease of implementation.
Information from focus groups and sequential pilots will be used to develop a culturally tailored prototype version of Healthy Weight for Living that is acceptable for Hispanic older adults.</description>
