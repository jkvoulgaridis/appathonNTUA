  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypothyroidism, defined by elevated thyrotropin (TSH) levels, is a common endocrine
      complication in chronic kidney disease patients, and prior evidence shows that higher TSH
      levels, even within the normal laboratory range, are strongly associated with impaired
      quality of life and cardiovascular disease in this population. Levothyroxine is one of the
      most frequently prescribed medications in chronic kidney disease, yet its efficacy and safety
      in these patients have not been well-studied. Hence, this study will investigate 1) whether
      levothyroxine improves patient-centered (e.g., health-related quality of life, physical
      performance, strength) and 2) cardiovascular (e.g., coronary artery calcification,
      endothelial function, systolic function) outcomes in dialysis patients, and 3) if thyroid
      hormone replacement exerts classic metabolic effects (i.e., changes in body fat and resting
      energy expenditure) in this population.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Data spanning over three decades show that hypothyroidism is highly prevalent in the chronic
      kidney disease (CKD) population, affecting 25% of those receiving dialysis therapy. In the
      general population hypothyroidism, defined by elevated thyrotropin (TSH) levels, has been
      associated with impaired health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and cardiovascular (CV)
      morbidity and mortality, but until recently there was a paucity of data regarding its
      prognostic implications in CKD. Our research has been the first to show a link between
      high-normal TSH levels and worse HRQOL Short Form 36 scores in dialysis patients,
      particularly among subscales centered on physical health (e.g., physical function,
      energy/fatigue). Our studies have also advanced the field by showing that elevated TSH levels
      even within the &quot;normal&quot; range (&gt;3.0mIU/L) are associated with heightened risk of CV disease
      and death across multiple dialysis cohorts. However, there remains considerable controversy
      as to 1) whether thyroid dysfunction is causally associated with adverse patient-centered and
      CV outcomes, and 2) if elevated TSH levels represent thyroid functional disease vs.
      non-thyroidal illness in CKD. While levothyroxine is one of the most commonly prescribed
      medications in CKD, little is known about its efficacy in this population.

      To address these knowledge gaps, we propose to conduct a randomized double-blind
      placebo-controlled trial among 336 hemodialysis patients with high-normal or subclinical
      hypothyroid range serum TSH levels to determine the effects of 24 weeks (i.e., 6 months) of
      levothyroxine vs. placebo on 1) HRQOL Short Form 36 (SF36) Physical Component Score and 2)
      coronary artery calcifcation (CAC) progression (co-primary endpoints).

      As secondary endpoints, we will also examine 1) HRQOL measured by the ThyPRO survey, 2)
      physical performance, 3) endothelial function, 4) vascular calcification inhibitor levels,
      and 5) total body fat percentage. In a sub-study of 108 hemodialysis patients, we will also
      examine exploratory secondary endpoints of 1) muscle strength, 2) systolic function, and 3)
      resting energy expenditure.

    <time_frame>Week 0 (pre-trial/baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>We will assess CAC Volume Score using a 256-multidetector CT test. Volume score will be calculated by multiplying the number of voxels with calcification by the volume of each voxel for each calcified lesion, and summing individual lesion scores from the four main coronary arteries (left main, left anterior descending, circumflex, and right coronary artery).</description>

    <time_frame>Weeks 0 (pre-trial/baseline) and 24 (post-randomization)</time_frame>
    <description>We will measure physical performance using the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), which tests 1) gait speed (faster of two timed, usual pace 15-foot walks), 2) balance (balance test measuring ability to stand with feet in side-by-side, semi-tandem, and tandem positions for 10 seconds), and 3) chair raises (timed series of five attempts to arise from a chair unassisted without use of arms), with each component ranging from 0 to 4 (score 0-12; higher score indicates better performance).</description>

    <measure>Endothelial Function - Digital Thermal Monitor</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 0 (pre-trial/baseline) and 24 (post-randomization)</time_frame>
    <description>We will measure endothelial function using digital thermal monitor (DTM) testing, which is based on the principle that changes in fingertip temperature during and after an ischemic stimulus (blood pressure [BP] cuff occlusion) reflect changes in blood flow. In normal endothelial function, cuff inflation results in a 1-3 degree Celsius temperature decline, followed by rapid temperature rise to above baseline during cuff deflation due to compensatory vasodilation. Temperature (temp) will be measured before, during, and after a 2-minute BP cuff inflation in the non-vascular access arm in order to measure Area Under the Temp Curve (TMP-AUC), defined as area under the curve between the maximum and minimum temp.</description>

    <time_frame>Weeks 0 (pre-trial/baseline) and 24 (post-randomization)</time_frame>
    <description>We will assess muscle strength using BioDex dynamometry, which will be used to measure Isometric Quadriceps Maximal Strength (Peak Torque, Newton-meters), in which patients will perform three maximal knee-extension efforts at a knee angle of 60 degrees using the dominant leg; each trial consists of a repetition of five seconds of concentric quadriceps contraction, followed by at least 90-seconds of resting recovery.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Systolic Function - Global Longitudinal Strain</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 0 (pre-trial/baseline) and 24 (post-randomization)</time_frame>
    <description>We will measure systolic function using Global Longitudinal Strain (GLS) using speckle-tracking 2D-echocardiography, which measures the contraction/deformation of myocardium during systole and is represented by a negative value (i.e., more negative GLS indicates better function).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Resting Energy Expenditure (REE) - Indirect Calorimetry</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 0 (pre-trial/baseline) and 24 (post-randomization)</time_frame>
    <description>We will measure REE using indirect calorimetry, in which following an overnight fast, patients will undergo a 20-minute resting period, after which oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide expiration will be recorded for 20-minutes while remaining under resting conditions, which will be used to calculate REE using the Weir formula.</description>

    <description>Patients will be randomized to levothyroxine or placebo (similar in size, shape, and color to levothyroxine) via permuted blocks stratified by two TSH levels (&gt;3.0-5.0 and 5.0-10.0mIU/L) to ensure treatment balance across TSH levels. The study medications will be prepared in pill form. In the treatment arm, initial L-T4 doses will be 25mcg vs. 50mcg among patients whose TSH is &gt;3.0-5.0mIU/L vs. 5.0-10.0mIU/L, respectively. Patients in the placebo arm will receive an equivalent number of placebo pills daily depending upon TSH level.
The intervention period is 24 weeks. Patients will undergo up to two subsequent dose titrations after 8- and 16-weeks of treatment, based on interim TSH measurements at these time points. Patients whose TSH levels are higher or lower than the therapeutic TSH target of 0.5-3.0mIU/L will undergo a dose adjustment (+/- 25mcg), while those whose TSH levels are in target range will continue the prior dose.</description>
