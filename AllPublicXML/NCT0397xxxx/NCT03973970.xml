  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this clinical research study is to demonstrate performance of the
      normalized TB specific lymphocyte response (NTBSLR) in identifying patients with active TB
      disease. The secondary exploratory objective is to demonstrate that active TB cannot be
      identified using an antigen-to-mitogen ratio derived from an ELISA-based IGRA.

      This study will enroll up to 202 subjects (assumes 15 % exclusion/drop-out rate). The target
      number of subjects is 75 active TB (recruited from subjects presenting at TB clinics) and 100
      active TB excluded (recruited from subjects in the community).

      All subjects enrolled in this study will be men or women, aged 18 years or older.

      Duration: 1 year
