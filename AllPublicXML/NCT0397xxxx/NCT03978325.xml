  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment for people with cancer of the lung or the oesophagus (food-pipe) often involves
      surgery. This surgery is complex and there is a high risk that patients will develop severe
      complications afterwards, leading to a longer hospital stay and higher hospital costs, and
      impacting greatly on recovery and quality of life. If patients' lungs and heart can be
      optimised before surgery, then recovery may be improved. While fitness can be improved by
      exercise, the lead-in time to surgery following a cancer diagnosis is often very short, and
      research is needed to examine what types of exercise might be most effective at increasing
      fitness over a short period.

      This project will investigate if high intensity interval training (HIIT) can increase fitness
      levels in people scheduled for surgery for cancer of the oesophagus or the lungs. HIIT
      alternates between periods of high intensity exercise, cycling on a stationary bike, followed
      by a period of more relaxed exercise. This approach is known to improve fitness but has not
      previously been investigated in patients awaiting complex cancer surgery.

      Groups will be compared for changes in pre-surgery fitness levels, any complications they may
      experience after surgery, general physical recovery after surgery and the cost of care after
      surgery. The investigators anticipate that patients who undergo HIIT before surgery will have
      less complications and better recovery after surgery, a significantly improved quality of
      life, and lower costs of care.

    <textblock>
      Patients with cancer of the lung or oesophagus, undergoing curative treatment, usually
      require a thoracotomy and a complex oncological resection. These surgeries carry a risk of
      major morbidity and mortality, and risk assessment, preoperative optimisation, and enhanced
      recovery after surgery (ERAS) pathways are modern approaches to optimise outcomes.
      Pre-operative fitness is an established predictor of postoperative outcome, accordingly
      targeting pre-operative fitness through exercise prehabilitation has logical appeal. Exercise
      prehabilitation is challenging to implement however due to the short opportunity for
      intervention between diagnosis and surgery. Therefore, individually prescribed, intensive
      exercise training protocols which convey clinically meaningful improvements in
      cardiopulmonary fitness over a short period need to be investigated. This project will
      examine the influence of exercise prehabilitation on physiological outcomes and postoperative
      recovery, evaluation of health economics, the impact of the programme on hospital costs.

      This study will take the form of a randomised controlled trial aimed primarily at improving
      pre-operative fitness with high intensity interval training (HIIT). HIIT prescribes aerobic
      exercise which alternates between periods of high intensity training and active recovery.
      This form of exercise training stimulates greater improvements in cardiopulmonary fitness
      over short periods compared to continuous aerobic training and therefore may be ideally
      suited to exercise prehabilitation. The primary outcome, cardiopulmonary fitness, will be
      measured by cardiopulmonary exercise testing and explored further using a suite of pulmonary
      and physical performance measures. Secondary outcomes will examine the impact of individually
      prescribed HIIT on postoperative outcome, postoperative physical recovery, restoration of
      pre-treatment fitness levels and both acute and sub-acute hospital costs. The investigators
      anticipate that this mode of exercise prehabilitation will attenuate postoperative risk and
      improve postoperative recovery, thus improving patient quality of life and having
      considerable economic benefits for the healthcare system.

    <description>The HIIT intervention will take the form of a supervised programme, completed for at least two weeks, up to 5 days per week preoperatively. The HIIT intervention will be performed on a cycle ergometer. Exercise sessions will be individually supervised and scheduled at a time of convenience for each participant. Each exercise session will last 40 minutes and will include warm-up, exercise training and cool-down components. Lactate threshold, measured during the baseline CPT, will be used to determine the exercise intensity.
The training protocol will prescribe 15 second intervals of exercise and passive recovery. The highest resistance reached during the baseline CPET (measured in watts) will be recorded as the peak power output (PPO). During training, participants will undergo a 5-minute warm-up at 50% PPO, followed by up to 30 minutes of HIIT with intervals of 15 seconds at 100% PPO with 15 second recovery periods at 0 watts.</description>
