  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, observational clinical trial investigating the morphological and
      volumetric changes in the brain following cranial Radiation Therapy in pediatric patients
      with brain or skull base tumors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Brain injury is a known complication of cranial RT, but little is known about the factors
      that predispose patients to such injury. The brain is a highly interconnected organ linked
      through neuronal connections, cellular migration, and vascular supply and is endowed with
      exquisitely radiosensitive stem cell niches responsible for neuro-regeneration. To date, the
      effects of brain radiation have been quantified in few brain substructures. The majority of
      publications on this topic have focused on regions receiving higher doses. Even low dose
      radiation exposure, however has global implications on brain development and function, and
      its effects are less well studied. It is increasingly recognized that radiation damage to one
      brain region can potentially affect brain development more broadly. This has important
      implications on RT planning and the potential for understanding its long-term effects.

      In this protocol, the investigators aim to measure serum inflammatory cytokine levels and
      other molecular biomarkers at baseline and post-exposure in an exploratory manner to
      investigate potential associations with the risk of developing volumetric changes in the
      brain and radiation-induced toxicities.

      This study will observe sixty (60) patients under the age of 21 with brain or base of skull
      tumor. The study team will observe the effect of radiation therapy per the study protocol
      versus standard of care.

        The study sample size will be 60 patients. This sample size was selected to ensure an
        adequate distribution of primary tumor diagnoses and dosimetric variation in major brain
        substructures treated based on tumor location/brain regions treated. The estimated case
        distribution based on historical data from 2007-2015 will be: Craniopharyngioma 20%,
        Ependymoma 20%, Low Grade Glioma 20%, Medulloblastoma/PNET 15%, Sarcoma 10%, Other 15%.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient (parent) must give study-specific informed consent on an IRB-approved consent
             prior to any research related procedures or study treatment. Written assent will be
             obtained as per Institutional guidelines.

          -  Patients (Age equal to or less than 35 years old) that are planned to receive photon
             or proton RT to the brain according to standard of care are eligible to participate.

          -  Patients that are planned to receive fractionated RT at 1.2-2.0 Gy RBE dose per
             fraction per standard of care are eligible to participate. If patients are planned to
             receive an alternative dose/fractionation regimen, then they should be treated
             according to standard of care and should not be enrolled.
