  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this proposal is to test if anti-BAFF antibody can restore a normal threshold of
      tolerance in patients in two auto-immune diseases along the RITUX-PLUS study in immune
      thrombocytopenia, and along the Believe study in SLE. This work would help to conclude
      whether or not the 'double hit' therapy may help to reset the immune system toward a more
      tolerogenic profile.

      The aim is to compare the polyreactivity and autoreactivity, of immature (central tolerance)
      and naïve B cells (peripheral tolerance) in the peripheral blood along the RITUX-PLUS STUDY
      and the BLISS BELIEVE study before and after treatment (B-cell reconstitution time).

    <description>The samples from the blood samples carried out within the framework of Bliss Believe will be collected for a biological collection. Samples will be obtained the day of inclusion, at the week 36, 40 and week 52.To improve the number of timepoints, patients already included in Bliss Believe can be included in this study if W36, W40, W52 can be obtained. It will be 7ml X 3 (21 ml) of blood every time.
The samples of patients included in RITUX-PLUS STUDY are already collected according to the protocol at baseline, W36, W52.</description>
