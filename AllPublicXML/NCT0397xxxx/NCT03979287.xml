    <textblock>
      Objectives: To analyze the number of sessions needed to achieve a positive impact after
      combining interferential current therapy and therapeutic exercise, compared with therapeutic
      exercise alone, on self-reported pain, disability and range of motion in subjects with
      chronic neck pain.

      Design: A randomized, single-blind, controlled trial. Subjects: Patients between 18 and 65
      years old, with idiopathic chronic neck pain.

      Methods: The experimental group who will perform a combined treatment using Interferential
      current therapy and therapeutic exercise for two weeks. The control group will receive the
      same program of therapeutic exercise during the same period of time.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Neck pain intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to immediately after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will rate the intensity of their neck pain at rest on an 11-point numeric pain rating scale, where 0 is no pain and 11 maximum pain. The subjects will be ask to indicate the pain levels that they experienced before treatment and after treatment.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Disability</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to immediately after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The Neck Disability Index (NDI) will be used in the Spanish version to measure level of disability of the neck area during the daily life activities.
where under 9 denotes No Disability; from 10 to 29 denotes Slight Disability; from 30 to 49 denotes Moderate Disability; from 50 to 69 denotes Severe Disability and more tan 70 denote Complete Disability.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Range of movement (ROM)</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to immediately after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary outcome measure will be the active cervical range of motion assessed with the CROM device (Performance Attainment Associates, Lindstrom, MN). The measurements will be made separately for each direction and in a standard sequence: flexion, extension, right lateral flexion, left lateral flexion, right rotation and left rotation. Two measurements will be recorded for each movement and the average of the two measurements will be used in the analysis of results</description>

    <description>The Interferential Current Program will be based on a bipolar application using the Sonopuls 692 device (Enraf Nonius, Rotterdam, The Netherlands). The current parameters will be: a) 4000Hz carrier frequency; and b) 60 Hz AMF with a modulation frequency of 90 Hz. The intensity of the current will be adapted to the sensitivity of each patient.
The Therapeutic Exercise Program will be applied by a physiotherapist and will consist of:
Ergonomic advices on reducing repetitive movements and/or maintained positions
A protocol of active physiotherapy for neck and shoulder muscles. This protocol will include: active stretching exercises; isometric muscle strengthening exercises; reeducation of the ocular and neck muscles with control retraining exercises</description>
