  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Health literacy (HL) is defined as skills and competencies enabling people to obtain and
      interpret health information and apply their knowledge to inform health-related
      decision-making. It's also defined as &quot;the degree to which individuals have the capacity to
      obtain, understand, and process basic health information and services needed to make
      appropriate health decisions&quot;.

      Health literacy is defined in the Healthy People 2020 objectives of the U.S. Department of
      Health and Human Services as &quot;the capacity to obtain, interpret and understand basic health
      information and services and the competence to use such information and services to enhance
      health&quot;. The concept of health literacy was defined more broadly in the World Health
      Organization Health Promotion Glossary as &quot;the development of the cognitive and social skills
      which determine the motivation and ability of individuals to gain access to, understand and
      use information in ways that promote and maintain good health&quot;. Arab women in East Jerusalem
      are at high risk of low health literacy due to lower levels of education and low
      socio-economic status. According to a study published by the Brookdale institution, Arab
      communities in Israel have lower health literacy and reduced knowledge of the relation
      between certain behaviors and their effect on health. They found as well that most of the
      health materials and brochures available in Arabic are poorly translated from another
      language, which may lead to unintentional misrepresentation and loss of content. In addition,
      these translated materials are often culturally inappropriate and full of medical jargon that
      is difficult for the layperson to understand. A cross-sectional national survey was conducted
      by Clalit Health Services on 600 Clalit Members (57% female), using an adapted research
      instrument which included Health Literacy Survey-Europe -Q-16 (HLS-EU-Q-16.) This study
      reported significant differences between Arab and non-Arab Clalit members in three of the 16
      questions, including perceived difficulty in understanding the way to treat health problems,
      difficulty in coping with mental health problems and stress management. The study population
      included a very small and non-representative sampling of Arabs of East Jerusalem. In summary,
      very little is known about the health literacy level of Arab women in East Jerusalem.

  <detailed_description>

      The proposed study consists of a limited assessment of the health literacy needs of Arab
      women in East Jerusalem. This will be assessed through qualitative data collection. Six
      different focus groups will be conducted at three of the six municipality community centers
      in East Jerusalem.

      Recruitment Investigators will recruitment participants through the identified community
      centers. Participants will participate in focus groups at the community center.

      Focus groups: Each group will meet once for up to two hours. The study will be explained to
      them by an investigator who has been trained in the administration of focus groups, and they
      will be asked to sign a consent form. Once they have signed, the investigator will begin
      asking them prepared questions concerning health issues. The meeting will be recorded without
      the names of the participants (they will be instructed not to use their names once the
      recording begins). At the end of the meeting, each participant will receive a bag and
      pamphlets with information regarding women's health.

      Sample and Sample Size Calculation The size of each focus group will be around 127 Arab women
      attending the three different community centers in East Jerusalem (AL-Tur, Shufat, and
      Issawiyeh). Two focus groups will be done in each community center (six8 focus groups).
      (investigators will recruit up to 72 women)

      Interventions The study consists of data collection for qualitative evaluation and
      assessment, aiming to assess the level of health literacy in Arab women in East Jerusalem

    <description>the assessment will be done through conduction of focus groups. Focus groups will be audio- recorded, transcribed and analyzed using Systematic text condensation, a descriptive and explorative analysis strategy. Which consists of four steps: 1) total impression - from chaos to themes; 2) identifying and sorting meanings units - from themes to codes; 3) condensation - from code to meaning; 4) synthesizing - from condensation to descriptions and concepts. It is expected that six focus groups will be sufficient to achieve saturation of themes. If results are not sufficient, investigators will ask to increase the number of focus groups.</description>
