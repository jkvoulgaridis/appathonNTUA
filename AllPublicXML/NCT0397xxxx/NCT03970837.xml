    <textblock>
      This study [contRAst 2 (201791: NCT03970837)] is a phase 3, randomized, multicenter, double
      blind study to assess the safety and efficacy of GSK3196165 in combination with csDMARD(s),
      for the treatment of adult participants with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis
      (RA) who have had an inadequate response to csDMARD(s) or bDMARD(s). The study will consist
      of a screening phase of up to 6 weeks followed by a 52 week treatment phase in which
      participants will be randomized in a ratio of 6:6:3:1:1:1 to receive GSK3196165 150
      milligrams (mg) subcutaneous (SC) weekly, GSK3196165 90 mg SC weekly, tofacitinib capsules
      (cap) 5 mg twice a day or placebo (three arms, each placebo arm will have 12 weeks placebo
      followed by 40 weeks active treatment) respectively, all in combination with csDMARD(s).
      Participants who, in investigator's judgement will benefit from extended treatment with
      GSK3196165 may be included in the long-term extension study [contRAst X (209564:
      NCT04333147)]. For those participants who do not continue into the long term-extension study,
      there will be an 8 week safety follow-up visit following the treatment phase.
