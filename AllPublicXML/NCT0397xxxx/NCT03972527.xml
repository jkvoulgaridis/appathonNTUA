      The overall purpose of this clinical study is to evaluate safety and efficacy of the MuReva
      Phototherapy System with a light delivery mouthpiece to reduce the incidence of severe oral
      mucositis (OM) in adult patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, oropharynx,
      tonsils and base of tongue receiving concurrent radiation and chemotherapy.

      Study Design: A prospective, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled,
      adaptive sample size, two-treatment parallel, pivotal clinical study.

      Protocol-eligible subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 allocation to receive either the
      active MuReva Phototherapy System or sham control. Both the subjects and clinician evaluating
      the patients will be blinded to the treatment assignments. The sham device will be placed in
      the patient's mouth and operated in the same manner as the active device, but not deliver any
      therapy.

      Subjects will begin device treatment sessions on the first day of chemoradiotherapy (CRT)
      treatment immediately prior to radiation treatment (RT) and will continue to receive once
      daily treatments prior to RT with their assigned device for 5 days per week for the duration
      of their CRT treatment (approximately 6 to 8 weeks, for a total of 30 to 40 device sessions
      depending on the standard of care regimen for the type of cancer). Each device treatment
      session will last 5 minutes. Light therapy parameters for the MuReva Phototherapy System will
      be as follows for all subjects receiving active light therapy: mouthpiece 660nm, 2-8 J/cm2,
      irradiance &lt; 75mW/cm2. Subjects who stay on CRT treatment past 6 weeks will continue to
      receive treatment with their assigned device up through 8 total weeks of treatment (for a
      maximum total of 40 device sessions). In addition, all subjects, regardless of randomization,
      will be kept on standard oral care, oral hygiene and oral pain protocols.

      All subjects will visit the study site once during the Screening period (Days -28 to 1) an
      anticipated 30 to 40 times during the treatment period (i.e., 5 days during each of the 6-8
      CRT treatment weeks) and for one 2-week post RT follow-up visit. Weekly, subjects will be
      evaluated for QOL, pain, OM and for device safety. At the conclusion of the final CRT session
      and evaluation, each subject will complete a user validation survey. There will be one 2-week
      post RT follow-up visit.

    <masking_description>The sponsor, clinical research organization (CRO), subjects, research staff and Investigators performing the weekly OM evaluations for the study will be blinded to the treatment assignments. Subjects will be mandated to use light-blocking eyewear.
Only the research staff delivering treatment will be unblinded. No other personnel or visitors will be allowed in the treatment room during active/sham treatment.
The Investigators will not administer the daily treatment and will not visit or observe the patient during device use in order to remain blinded. The Investigators will also remain blinded to the patients' responses to the weekly Self-Assessments.</masking_description>

    <description>The MuReva Phototherapy System consists of Light Control Unit and a Mouthpiece Cable Assembly. Subjects will begin device treatment photobiomodulation sessions on the first day of radiotherapy (RT) treatment. They will receive once-daily investigative device photobiomodulation treatments prior to radiation therapy (RT) with their assigned Mouthpiece for 5 days per week for the duration of their CRT treatment. Each device treatment session will last up to 5 minutes, not including up to 5 additional minutes for treatment breaks. All subjects will visit the study site once during the Screening period (Days -28 to 1) and an anticipated 30 to 40 times during the treatment period. Each patient will be assigned their own Mouthpiece Cable Assembly.</description>

    <description>The MuReva Phototherapy System (or sham control) is a Light Control Unit and a Mouthpiece Cable Assembly. The sham control Mouthpiece Cable Assembly will appear identical to the active Mouthpiece Cable Assembly, and will be used in the same manner as the active cohort. However, the sham control device will be configured where the mouthpiece will not emit any light at any time during the study. The same Light Control Unit will be used with sham and active Mouthpiece Cable Assemblies. Each patient will be assigned their own Mouthpiece Cable Assembly.</description>
