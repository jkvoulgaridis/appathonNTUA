  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic immune central nervous system (CNS) disease of unknown
      cause. Recent studies suggest that gut microbiota could be a trigger for the
      neuro-inflammation in MS and abnormal gut microbiota composition has been reported in MS
      patients. These data provided scientific rationale for microbiota-directed intervention, like
      stool transplant, for the treatment of MS.

      A subject (n-of-1) clinically diagnosed with Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS),
      by Rush University Neurologists, volunteered and provided written informed consent to
      participate in this study conducted by Rush University Medical Center's department of
      Digestive Diseases and Nutrition. The RRMS subject underwent a fecal microbiota
      transplantation (FMT) administered outside the United States, at Taymount Clinic in the
      Bahamas, for the treatment of their MS. Being one of the investigators' patients, the subject
      volunteered to donate their stool samples to the Rush University Medical Center
      Gastrointestinal (GI) tissue repository for microbiota interrogation at the following time
      points: before FMT (baseline), 3, 13, 26, 39, 52 weeks (1 year) after FMT, to determine the
      impact on their microbiota composition and sustainability of the change. The subject also
      agreed to donate their blood during the above stated time points to see if FMT affected
      markers of bacteria translocation and systemic inflammation. The subject also agreed to have
      their GI symptoms, diet, sleep, and MS related symptoms (rating scales or questionnaires),
      MRI (brain &amp; spine), as well as their gait metric activity objectively assessed to see if the
      FMT affects these symptoms and whether any observed improvement is sustained, in this
      proof-of-concept study. Based on this research, the investigators hypothesize that the FMT
      will significantly altered the overall microbial community structure to promote the growth of
      short chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing beneficial bacteria, which in turn could potentially
      improve the MS subject's health outcomes, neurological symptoms, and walking metrics over
      time. More clinical trials (larger sample size) will be needed to study the potential of FMT
      for the treatment of MS and to examine the long term effects. FMT is an emerging treatment
      approach for MS. The donor selection, the separation of fecal bacteria, the frequency of FMT,
      the way of infusion, the long-term safety, and efficacy are still uncertain and need to be
      examined.

    <description>Single-Arm, Non-Randomized, Time Series, Single-Subject Study. Observational study of the FMT intervention.
Single subject studies are based on repeated observations within an individual over time and are acknowledged as an important research method for generating scientific evidence about the health or behavior of an individual. This design is desirable when the available patient pool is limited and thus it is not optimal to randomize participants to a control arm. The subject serves as his/her own control, rather than using another individual/group.These designs are used primarily to evaluate the effect of a variety of interventions in early stage clinical research development.</description>

        One of the investigators' patients planned to have a fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) for
        treatment of their MS, at the Taymount Clinic in the Bahamas, volunteered to donate
        multiple sample collection time points for stool and blood. Additionally, the subject would
        undergo gait metric activity and MRI (brain &amp; spine), as well as completing MS rating
        scales and various GI, diet and sleep clinical questionnaires.
