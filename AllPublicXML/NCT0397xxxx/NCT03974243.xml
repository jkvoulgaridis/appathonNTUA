      The purpose of this dose-escalation study is to assess the safety and tolerability of
      treatment with Chiauranib and Chidamide administered orally over a range of doses in patients
      with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, in the meantime, exploring the
      pharmacodynamic profile and latent biomarkers accompany with Chiauranib and Chidamide , as
      well as the relevancy of which and clinical benefit.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the tolerability and safety include adverse events,
      vital signs, laboratory tests ,etc., of a range of doses of Chiauranib and Chidamide in
      patients with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and to determine the dose limit
      toxicity and the maximum tolerable dose.

      In the meantime, exploring the pharmacodynamic profile and latent biomarkers accompany with
      Chiauranib and Chidamide , as well as the relevancy of which and clinical benefit.
