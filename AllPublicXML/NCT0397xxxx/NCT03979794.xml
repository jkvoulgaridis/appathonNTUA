  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to examine initial effectiveness of a brief (2 preoperative, 2
      postoperative session) cognitive behaviorally-based telephone intervention compared to
      standard care on postoperative outcomes for patients who are scheduled to undergo a
      cancer-related surgery in 12 or more days and screen positive for distress (4 or higher on
      0-10 Distress Thermometer). The intervention focuses on improving emotional and physical
      health through relaxation, behavioral activation, increased physical activity, and adherence
      to medication and wound care. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive the
      intervention or to receive standard care. Outcomes assessed 4 and 6 weeks post-operatively
      will include: Depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-8), anxiety (Generalized Anxiety
      Disorder-7), health-related QOL (SF-36 MCS and PCS), number and type of complications, length
      of stay, and 30-day readmission.
