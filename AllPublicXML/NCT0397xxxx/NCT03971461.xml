    <textblock>
      This single arm, open-label study will evaluate the efficacy of Lutathera (177Lu-DOTATATE)
      administered intravenously every 8 weeks for a total of 4 doses in patients with progressive
      WHO I-III or residual high-risk Ga-DOTATATE PET-MRI positive meningioma. Ga-DOTATATE PET-MRI
      scans will be obtained prior to initiation of Lutathera treatment and 6 months after the
      initiation of Lutathera treatment. The latter will be performed within the 14 days prior to
      the last dose of Lutathera treatment.
