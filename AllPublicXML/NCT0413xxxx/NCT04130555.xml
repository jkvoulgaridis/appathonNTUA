  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The general objective of the study is to confirm the medium/long-term safety and clinical
      performance of the CELLIS Rectopexy membrane used in rectal prolapse repair by ventral
      rectopexy and to identify emerging risks in comparison to the clinical data related to other
      types of fixation material.

      The present study will be a prospective multicentric non-randomized and non-controlled trial
      involving 55 patients followed for 24 months. The study will be conducted in France in 3
      investigational centres.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be prospective, multicentric, single-arm, observational (non-interventional)
      to evaluate the safety and performance of CELLIS Rectopexy used in rectal prolapse repair by
      ventral rectopexy.

      All evaluations will be performed and products used according to the usual practice, without
      additional or unusual diagnostic, treatment and monitoring procedure.

      The study will be conducted in France in 3 investigational centres including 55 patients
      scheduled for the repair of rectal prolapse.

      Each patient will participate in one assessment period including a screening visit, followed
      by the day of surgical procedure and a hospitalization period. Patients will return for
      ambulatory visits at Day 30 (+/- 7 days), Month 6 (+/- 2 weeks), Month 12 (+/- 2 weeks) and
      Month 24 (+/-2 weeks).

      The surgical technique used to repair rectal prolapse will be either Laparoscopic Ventral
      Rectopexy (LVR) or a robotic assisted rectopexy with the use of the da Vinci Surgical System
      (Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA).
