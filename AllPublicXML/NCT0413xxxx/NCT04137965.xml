      The purpose of this study is to evaluate testicular function measured as testosterone level
      and semen quality.

    <textblock>
      Men having undergone surgery for testicular torsion between 01.01.2003 - 12.31.2012 will
      receive a invitation to participate in this study. It is expected that 110 patients can be
      identified and about 65% of them will participate. These men will undergo a andrological
      evaluation, deliver a semen sample, have a blood sample taken and undergo a testicular
      ultrasound.

      Control group:

      Men attending the fertility counseling at Herlev hospital will be offered participation in
      this study. The fertility counseling demands that men who contact the clinic have never had
      their sperm analyzed, have not tried to get pregnant with their partner for more than a year
      and that they have no prior knowledge of their fertility.

      Primary endpoint:

      Semen quality measured as sperm concentration Total testosterone level

      Secondary endpoint:

      Semen parameters

        -  Volume

        -  Concentration

        -  Motility

        -  Morphology

        -  MAR test

      Hormones

        -  FSH

        -  LH

        -  Testosterone

        -  Estradiol

        -  Inhibin B

        -  SHBG

      Data points:

        -  Paternity

        -  Time to pregnancy

        -  Partner (yes/no)

        -  Any fertility treatment?

        -  Pain? (VAS score)

        -  Symptoms of testesterone deficiency symptoms

        -  Andrological evaluation

        -  Testicular ultrasound

        -  Testicular torsion events in the family

        -  Date of surgery
