  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research project explores how non-invasive brain stimulation can be used to detect and
      ameliorate loss of muscle strength after inactivity. At present, there is a limited
      understanding of how to maintain muscle strength during inactivity. Increasing evidence
      indicates that reduction in muscle strength following immobilisation is associated with
      reduced cortical motor output. Therefore, the aim of the study is to test if brain
      stimulation, can maintain cortical motor output and ameliorate the loss of muscle strength
      following immobilisation.

    <measure>Change in Motor Evoked Potentials (MEPs) across time points</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 24, 48, and 72 hours</time_frame>
    <description>MEPs are elicited via TMS to primary motor cortex and index the excitability of the motor pathway. They are recorded non-invasively from muscles using surface electrodes. At each time point of the study (0, 24, 48, 72 hours) record MEPs will be recorded pre and post-intervention from the hand muscles of the dominant (immobilised) arm, and non-dominant (non-immobilised arm), to evaluate changes in excitability. Specifically, the peak-to-peak value of the MEPs from the hand will be measured, which reflects the amplitude of the MEP response. The latency of the MEP to index neural conduction speed will also be measured.</description>

    <measure>Change in grip strength across time points</measure>
    <time_frame>0, and 72 hours.</time_frame>
    <description>Grip strength of the dominant and non-dominant hands will be assessed using an isokinetic dynamometer at 0 and 72 hrs post-immobilisation. This will measure the strength of the hand muscles.</description>

    <intervention_name>Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)</intervention_name>
    <description>TMS is a safe and non-invasive technique, which involves the generation of brief magnetic pulses applied to the head through a coil. The magnetic pulses pass through the scalp and skull and induce weak electric currents in the neural tissue directly underneath the coil. When TMS is applied in repetitive, patterned trains of pulses (rTMS), it can induce cortical plasticity specifically in the targeted brain region.</description>
