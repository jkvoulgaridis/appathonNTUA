  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Publicly available outcome assessments for transplant programs do not make salient that some
      programs tend to reject many of the hearts they are offered, whereas other programs accept a
      broader range of donor offers. The investigators use empirical studies to test whether
      transplant center performance data (i.e. transplant and waitlist outcome statistics) that
      reflect center donor acceptance rates influence laypersons to evaluate centers with high
      organ decline rates less favorably than centers with low organ decline rates. 1000 lay
      participants will be recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk and randomized to one of five
      different information presentation conditions. Participants will be given an introduction to
      the donor organ match process, then asked to view the table of transplant outcomes
      corresponding to the condition they were randomized to. Each participant is asked to choose
      between two hospitals: one hospital with an non-selective, &quot;accepting&quot; strategy (takes all
      donor heart offers), and one hospital with a more selective, &quot;cherrypicking&quot; strategy (tends
      to reject donor offers that are less than &quot;excellent&quot; quality).

      Publicly available outcome assessments for transplant programs do not make salient that some
      programs tend to reject many of the hearts they are offered, whereas other programs accept a

      transplant center performance data (i.e. transplant and waitlist outcome statistics) that
      reflect center donor acceptance rates influence laypersons to evaluate centers with high
      organ decline rates less favorably than centers with low organ decline rates. 1000 lay
      participants will be recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk and randomized to one of five
      different information presentation conditions:

        1. Condition 1 (&quot;baseline&quot; condition): view only combined transplant survival (e.g.
           transplant survival rate not stratified by number and quality of donor hearts accepted
           at each center)

        2. Condition 2: view combined transplant survival + total survival (e.g. overall survival
           rate at each center, computed from survival rates of both transplant and waitlist
           patients)

        3. Condition 3: view only stratified transplant survival (e.g. transplant survival rate
           stratified into patients who received excellent donor organs and patients who received
           less than optimal donor organs)

        4. Condition 4: view stratified transplant survival + total survival

        5. Condition 5: view only total survival

      Participants will be given an introduction to the donor organ match process, then asked to
      view the table of transplant outcomes corresponding to the condition they were randomized to.
      Each participant is asked to choose between two hospitals: one hospital with an
      non-selective, &quot;accepting&quot; strategy (takes all donor heart offers), and one hospital with a
      more selective, &quot;cherrypicking&quot; strategy (tends to reject donor offers that are less than
      &quot;excellent&quot; quality). In order to identify the decision process that underlies this choice
      pattern, the investigators will examine a putative mediator. Specifically, participants will
      be asked to rate the extent to which they considered patients' chances of getting an
      excellent heart, avoiding a less-than-optimal heart, and getting any type of heart when
      making their choice between the two hospitals.

    <description>The outcome variable will be a measure of binary choice between two hospitals: one with a selective donor-heart acceptance strategy and one with a non-selective donor heart acceptance strategy.
Participants will respond to the question &quot;Which Hospital is a better choice for patients? Please click on one of the two tables below to indicate which hospital is the better choice.&quot; Participants will choose been two outcome tables featuring the selective and non-selective hospital (counterbalanced, such that each of the two choices is equally likely to be presented at top of the choice scenario in each condition). The number of participants that choose each hospital will be the measured outcome variable used in analyses.</description>

    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>On the next page of the survey, participants will respond to three mediator questions: &quot;There are many reasons why one transplant hospital might outperform another. Which reasons were most important in your decision? Please move the slider to indicate how much you considered each of the reasons below (0=reason was not important, 100=reason was extremely important).&quot;
Participants will then move a slider bar (0-100) to indicate the importance of the following three items:
Patients were more likely to receive an excellent donor heart at the hospital I picked.
Patients were less likely to receive a marginal donor heart at the hospital I picked.
Patients were more likely to receive any kind of heart at the hospital I picked.
The third item (more likely to receive any kind of heart) will be the only variable that is included in the planned mediation analysis.</description>

    <description>The overall or &quot;total&quot; survival rate at each center is displayed in the table of outcome statistics.
Total survival is computed from survival rates of both transplant and waitlist patients: [(number of patients surviving after transplant at end of year + number of patients alive on waitlist at end of year)] / [number of patients alive on waitlist at start of year].</description>

    <description>The transplant survival rate in the table of outcome statistics is stratified into two groups: (i) patients who received excellent donor organs and (ii) patients who received less than optimal donor organs.
Stratified transplant survival is computed from survival rates of transplant patients who received each quality category of organ.
excellent transplant survival = [number of patients surviving after transplant with excellent organ]/[number of patients for whom excellent organ was accepted for transplant] marginal transplant survival = [number of patients surviving after transplant with marginal organ]/[number of patients for whom marginal organ was accepted for transplant]</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Participants who are already qualified mTurk workers with Worker Accounts meeting the above
        criteria will be asked to participate if they confirm the following inclusion criteria in
        the consent form.

          1. 18 years of age or older

          2. must read and understand the information in the consent form

          3. must want to participate in the research and continue with the survey

          4. must live in United States

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Participants on mTurk will not be allowed to participate if they fail to pass the
             initial &quot;bot screening&quot;, a multiple-choice question that asks, &quot;What phone number
             should you dial when there is an emergency?&quot; The obvious correct response in this
             screening question is &quot;911&quot;, so participants who select one of the incorrect responses
             (i.e. &quot;1-800-ANTIBOT&quot;, &quot;1-877-MTURKER&quot;, &quot;123&quot;) are filtered out and not allowed to
             complete the survey.

          2. Participants on mTurk will be allowed to participate, but excluded from data analysis,
             if they submit a nonsense response to the free-response question which reads, &quot;In your
             own words, why do you think patients should choose the hospital you picked?&quot; This
             question takes place after the participant has viewed the choice stimuli and selected
             their response. If participants input nonsense in the text response box, they will be
             permitted to complete the survey and paid, but filtered out from the data analysis.

    <ipd_description>The PI will make all of the raw IPD files - together with statistical analysis protocol descriptions and information for proper analysis available for download a minimum of 1 year, and a maximum of 3 years, after publication of the corresponding manuscripts. All human subjects data are anonymized immediately when they are initially written from the online survey platform to the server, and thus participant confidentiality will not be compromised by this plan for data sharing.
All hypotheses, methods, and planned analyses for the applicant's studies will be pre-registered on ClinicalTrials.gov and Open Science Framework.</ipd_description>
