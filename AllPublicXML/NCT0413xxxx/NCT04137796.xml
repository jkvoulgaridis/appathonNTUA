      This study will give an update on the breastfeeding prevalence and infant nutrition in
      Austria.

      Key aspects for this study are:

        1. the current breastfeeding rates

        2. further insights on factors influencing breastfeeding such as the information mothers
           have about breastfeeding, their attitude, support they received for breastfeeding
           problems as well as sociodemographic factors and

        3. complimentary feeding. All postpartum women in Austria were eligible for participation.
           It consists of representative and prospective data recordings of breastfeeding and
           infant nutrition for the participating mother-child pairs via online questionnaires at
           four times of measurement over a period of one year.

      The results of the present study will give us an update about the development of
      breastfeeding rates in Austria and a better understanding of entry points for interventions
      on child nutrition and child health.
