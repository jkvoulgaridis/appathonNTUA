  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I study to test the safety of a combination of ASTX727 with talazoparib in
      patients with triple negative breast cancer or hormone resistant/HER2-negative metastatic
      breast cancer
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The phase I portion will use a traditional 3 + 3 design and standard definitions of DLT based
      on toxicity experienced during the first cycle of therapy. Patients with triple negative
      breast cancer (TNBC) and hormone resistant/HER2 negative (HRBC) metastatic disease will be
      enrolled and analyzed together during the dose escalation cohorts. Once the maximum tolerated
      dose is determined, we will enroll a small expansion cohort to further characterize safety
      and provide preliminary efficacy estimates.The expansion cohort will be limited to 14
      patients; 7 with TNBC and 7 with HRBC. The dose level selected for expansion will be based on
      the totality of the data available including toxicity during the DLT evaluation period,
      toxicity during subsequent cycles, and correlative results.

    <intervention_model_description>The dose escalation phase will begin by enrolling 3 patients to the cohort 1 dose level. Patients will be observed for 28 days or one cycle of therapy for dose limiting toxicity (DLT).
If 0 of 3 patients experience a DLT, the study will proceed to cohort 2. If 1 patient experiences a DLT, 3 additional patients will be enrolled into cohort 1. If 1 of 6 patients experience a DLT, the study will proceed to the cohort 2 dose level. If &gt; 2/3 or 2/6 patients in cohort 1 experience DLT, we will de-escalate to cohort -1. Identical DLT evaluation and dose escalation/de-escalation decision rules will be used in subsequent cohorts. A total of 6 patients will be treated at the highest dose level achieved to ensure that 6 patients have been treated at the proposed maximum tolerated dose before proceeding to the expansion cohorts.</intervention_model_description>
