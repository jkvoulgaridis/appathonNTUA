    <description>The C-SSRS rates an individual's degree of suicidal ideation (SI) on a scale, ranging from &quot;wish to be dead&quot; to &quot;active suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent.&quot; The scale identifies SI severity and intensity, which may be indicative of an individual's intent to commit suicide. C-SSRS SI severity subscale ranges from 0 (no SI) to 5 (active SI with plan and intent).</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline of Simpson-Angus Scale (SAS) Results</measure>
    <time_frame>At Baseline, Day 7, 14, 21, 28, 31</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluating Extrapyramidal symptoms using the SAS. The SAS consists of a list of 10 symptoms of parkinsonism (gait, arm dropping, shoulder shaking, elbow rigidity, wrist rigidity, head rotation, glabella tap, tremor, salivation, and akathisia). Each item is rated on a 5-point scale, with a score of 0 representing absence of symptoms and a score of 4 representing a severe condition. The SAS total score is the sum of the scores for all 10 items.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline of Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) Results</measure>
    <time_frame>At Baseline Day 7, 14, 21, 28, 31</time_frame>
    <description>The AIMS assessment consists of 10 items describing symptoms of dyskinesia. Facial and oral movements (items 1 through 4), extremity movements (items 5 and 6), and trunk movements (item 7) are observed unobtrusively while the subject is at rest, and the investigator also makes global judgments on the subject's dyskinesias (items 8 through 10). Each item is rated on a 5-point scale, with a score of 0 representing absence of symptoms (for item 10, no awareness), and a score of 4 indicating a severe condition (for item 10, awareness, severe distress). In addition, the AIMS includes 2 yes/no questions that address the subject's dental status.
The AIMS Movement Rating Score is defined as the sum of items 1 through 7 (ie, items 1 through 4, facial and oral movements; items 5 and 6, extremity movements; and item 7, trunk movements).</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline of Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS) Results</measure>
    <time_frame>At Baseline, Day 7, 14, 21, 28, 31</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluating Extrapyramidal symptoms using the BARS. The BARS consists of 4 items related to akathisia: objective observation of akathisia by the investigator, subjective feelings of restlessness by the subject, subjective distress due to akathisia, and global clinical assessment of akathisia. The first 3 items are rated on a 4‑point scale, with a score of 0 representing absence of symptoms and a score of 3 representing a severe condition. The global clinical evaluation is made on a 6-point scale, with a score of 0 representing absence of symptom and a score of 5 representing severe akathisia.</description>

             for any of these 5 C-SSRS Suicidal Behavior Items occurred within the last 2 years, OR

         12. Subject with a positive urine drug screen for illicit drugs or a positive breathalyzer
             test for alcohol are excluded and may not be retested or rescreened. Subjects with a
             positive urine drug screen resulting from use of marijuana (any cannabinoids),
             prescription, or over-the-counter medications or products that, in the investigator's
             documented opinion, do not signal a clinical condition that would impact the safety of
             the subject or interpretation of the trial results may continue evaluation for the
             trial following consultation and approval by the medical monitor.

         13. Subjects with a 12-lead ECG demonstrating any of the following: • Abnormal ST-T-wave
             morphologies that may interfere with QT analysis, such as flat or poorly defined end
             of the T wave or prominent U waves • Left ventricular hypertrophy • QT interval
             corrected for heart rate using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) &gt;450 msec (average of 3
             ECGs obtained at the Screening Visit) • QRS interval &gt;110 msec at the Screening Visit
             • Left or right bundle branch block • PR interval &gt;240 msec • Heart rate &lt;50 bpm or
             &gt;90 bpm • Second- or third-degree atrioventricular block

         14. Subjects with any of the following abnormalities in clinical laboratory tests at the
             Screening Visit, as assessed by the central laboratory and confirmed by a single
             repeat measurement, if deemed necessary: • AST or ALT ≥3 × ULN • Total bilirubin ≥1.5
             × ULN. Subjects with a history of Gilbert's syndrome may be eligible provided the
             direct bilirubin is &lt;ULN 15. Systolic blood pressure ≥130 mmHg and/or supine diastolic
             blood pressure ≥80 mmHg at Screening or Day -1, or symptomatic hypotension, or
             orthostatic hypotension, which is defined as a decrease of ≥20 mmHg in systolic blood
             pressure and/or a decrease of ≥10 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure after at least 3
             minutes of standing compared with the immediately previous supine blood pressure at
             Screening or Day -1. Subjects who are receiving chronic treatment with
             antihypertensive medications at Screening are also excluded.

         15. Systolic blood pressure ≥130 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥80 mmHg at
             Screening or Day -1, will be taken with subjects in the supine/semi-recumbent
             position, or symptomatic hypotension, or orthostatic hypotension, which is defined as
             a decrease of ≥20 mmHg in systolic blood pressure and/or a decrease of ≥10 mmHg in
             diastolic blood pressure after at least 3 minutes of standing compared with the
             immediately previous supine blood pressure at Screening or Day -1. If blood pressure
             exceeds these values, the reading should be repeated 2 more times and the average of
             the 3 values should be used to determine subject eligibility. Subjects who are
             receiving chronic treatment with antihypertensive medications at Screening are also
             excluded.

         16. Subjects with other abnormal laboratory test results, vital sign results, or ECG
             findings unless, based on the investigator's judgment, the findings are not medically
             significant and would not impact the safety of the subjects or the interpretation of
             the trial results.

         17. Subjects who would be likely to require prohibited concomitant therapy during the
             trial.

         23. Subjects with a history of neuroleptic malignant syndrome.

         24. Subject who refuses to abstain from grapefruit-containing foods or beverages or
             Seville orange-containing foods or beverages from 14 days prior to Day -1 through the
             Follow-up Visit.

         25. Prisoners or subjects who are compulsorily detained (involuntarily incarcerated) for
             treatment of either a psychiatric or physical (eg, infectious disease) illness.
