  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study looks at the safety and tolerability of the new medicine NNC0268-0965 (referred to
      as insulin 965), its concentration in the blood and its effect on the blood sugar for the
      treatment of diabetes. The study will test how insulin 965 is tolerated by the body, how it
      is taken up in the blood, how long it stays there and how the blood sugar is lowered.
      Participants will either get the new insulin 965 or the already marketed insulin glargine
      U100 (LantusÂ®) - which treatment is decided by chance. Participants will get six injections
      (one per day) of either insulin 965 or insulin glargine U100 under the skin of the left
      thigh. The study will last for about 5 weeks. Participants will have 6 clinic visits with the
      study doctor. Participants can only be in the study if the study doctor thinks that there are
      no risks for their health. Women can only take part in the study if they can't have children.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female, aged 18-64 years (both inclusive) at the time of signing informed
             consent.

          -  Diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus 180 days or more prior to the day of
             screening.

          -  Male subject or female subject of non-child bearing potential. Non-child bearing
             potential being surgically sterilised (i.e. documented hysterectomy, bilateral
             salpingectomy or bilateral oophorectomy) or being postmenopausal (as defined as no
             menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause) prior to the day of
             screening.

          -  Current total daily insulin treatment between 0.25 (I)U/kg/day and 1.2 (I)U/kg/day
             (both inclusive).

          -  HbA1c equal to or below 9.5%

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Male of reproductive age who, or whose partner(s), is not using adequate contraceptive
             methods (adequate contraceptive measures as required by local regulation or practice).

             intercourse and that the partner practices adequate contraception (risk of pregnancy
             must be lower than 1%).

          -  Use of GLP-1 receptor agonists (e.g. exenatide, liraglutide, semaglutide) within 3
             months prior to screening.
