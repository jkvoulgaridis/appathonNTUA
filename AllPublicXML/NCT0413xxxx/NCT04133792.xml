  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled multicenter study.

      A total of 700 patients will be included.

      The study will include patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) for daily intake of
      40 mg simvastatin/placebo for 5 years. The aim is to study effect of prognosis of PSC by long
      term intake of simvastatin. Outcome measures are death, liver transplantation,
      cholangiocarcinoma or bleeding from esophageal varices.

      Subjects will be randomized (1:1) between Simvastatin and placebo.
