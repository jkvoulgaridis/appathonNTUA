    <textblock>
      Lymphedema is defined as the excessive and persistent accumulation of fluid, extracellular
      proteins, and fat in tissue spaces, caused by inefficiency of the lymphatic drainage system.
      It is a chronic, progressive condition. Several researchers have investigated the influence
      on health-related quality of life in upper limb lymphedema after breast cancer treatment
      using patient reported outcome instruments. Responsiveness of only one of the lymphedema
      assessment scale, ''Lymphedema Quality of Life Inventory'', has been investigated.
      Responsiveness of lymphedema assessment scales validated in Turkish has not been examined in
      detail, thereby limiting their use in clinical trials. Therefore, the aim of this study is to
      investigate and compare responsiveness of current lymphedema assessment scales validated in
      Turkish. Patients with breast cancer related lymphedema with International Society of
      Lymphology-ISL lymphedema stage 2,3 will be included in the study and will receive complex
      decongestive therapy phase I including meticulous skin and nail care, manuel lymphatic
      drainage, compression bandages, and remedial exercises. All patients will receive manual
      lymphatic drainage for three times a week (Monday-Wednesday-Friday) during 4 weeks, 50
      minutes a day (a total of 12 sessions) by a trained lymphatic massage therapist. Limb volume
      will be calculated based on truncated cone method from circumference measurements. Patients
      will complete Lymphedema Life Impact Scale (LLIS), Patient Benefit Index-Lymphedema(PBI),
      Lymphedema functioning, disability and health questionnaire(Lymph-ICF), European Organization
      for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Breast Cancer (EORTC-QLQ-30) and Short
      Form 36 (SF-36) before and after treatment. Changes in limb volumes will be compared in
      changes in scales after treatment. Responsiveness of the subscales will be will be determined
      by calculating the effect size (change in all patients), standardized mean response (effect
      size in a group with improvement), and Guyatt's Responsiveness Index.

    <description>The LYMQOL-Arm has been developed to assess the impact of lymphedema of the arms on the QoL of the patients. It consists of four domains with 28 items. These domains are symptoms, appearance, function, and mood. The answers were evaluated on a four-point Likert scale (1= not at all 2= a little, 3= quite a bit, 4= a lot). Each item received a score between 1 and 4, with higher scores indicating a worse QoL.</description>

    <time_frame>before treatment (T0)</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Benefit Index (PBI) methodology allows for a more direct measurement of patient-relevant treatment.benefit. In the first part the Patient Needs Questionnaire (PNQ)patients rate the importance of a list of patient relevant treatment goals on a five-step scale from &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;very&quot;. In the second part the Patient Benefit Questionnaire (PBQ) patients rate to what extent the treatment goals have been achieved on the same five-step scale. Alternatively, they can choose &quot;does not apply to me&quot; for each treatment goal in both questionnaires. Thus, the patient directly evaluates treatment benefit instead of rating her/his current HRQoL before and after treatment. A PBI weighted global score ranging from 0 (no benefit) to 4 (maximum benefit) is computed for each patient. The weighting algorithm8 ensures that the achievement of important treatment goals will have higher impact on the global score than the achievement of less important goals.</description>

    <description>The Lymph-ICF questionnaire is composed of 29 questions. Each question is answered using a visual analog scale (VAS) ranging from 0 to 100 mm. The anchors for the impairments in function (e.g. &quot;Does your arm hurt?&quot;) are &quot;not at all&quot; and &quot;very much,&quot; and those for the activity limitations and participation restrictions (e.g. &quot;Are you able to carry heavy weights?&quot;) are &quot;very well&quot; and &quot;not at all.&quot; The Lymph-ICF has 5 domains: physical function, mental function, household activities, mobility activities, and life and social activities. The total score of the Lymph-ICF is equal to the sum of the scores of the questions divided by the total number of answered questions.</description>

    <description>The EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire is a survey conducted to evaluate the quality of life in patients with breast cancer. It consists of 30 questions which assess symptoms that occurred in the previous two weeks. Responses are given on a Likert scale: 1 - not at all, 2 - a little, 3 - quite a bit, 4 - very much. The global health scale consists of two questions asking patients to classify their general health and quality of life in the previous week, by rating it from 1 to 7, in which 1 means poor and 7, excellent. The questionnaires are divided into three scales: global health scale (GHS), functional scale (FS) and symptom scale (SS).</description>

It has eight sections: Physical functioning (10), role limitations due to physical health (4), role limitations due to emotional problems (3), energy/fatigue (4), emotional well-being (5), social functioning (2), pain (2), and general health (5). Each scale is transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each scale carries equal weight. The lower the score, the more disability.</description>
