    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective study. The subject will select 440 cases of pregnant women with
      high hepatitis B virus load, and one group will take maternal and child blockade treatment
      with propofol fumarate. One group will take tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. Broken treatment,
      compare the failure rate of maternal and child blockade and the incidence of maternal and
      child adverse events in the two groups, and explore the efficacy and safety of propofol
      flavuril for the treatment of hepatitis B mother-infant block.

    <textblock>
      This study was a prospective cohort study. Because propofolofofovir is not covered by medical
      insurance and is more expensive, and there are factors such as renal function damage and the
      risk factors that can not use tenofovir, it is difficult to conduct randomized controlled
      cases. The subject will select 440 cases of pregnant women with high hepatitis B virus load.
      After signing the informed consent form, according to the patient's wishes, one group will
      take the mother-infant blockade of propofol fumarate, and one group will take fumaric acid.
      In the case of maternal and child blockade of benifovir, the incidence of maternal and child
      block failure and the incidence of maternal and child adverse events were compared between
      the two groups, and propofol fumarate was used for maternal and child blockade of hepatitis
      B. The effectiveness and safety of the treatment.
