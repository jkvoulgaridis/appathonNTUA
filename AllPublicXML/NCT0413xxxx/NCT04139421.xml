  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the effects of Shinrin-Yoku (forest bathing) as an intervention for
      enhancing psychological well-being in Chinese population. The main component of Shinrin-Yoku
      is the use of 5 senses in various activities, which typically includes forest walking,
      meditation, yoga etc. While Shinrin-Yoku has been widely recognized in Japan as a means of
      preventative health and stress management, it is still a new concept in some countries. In
      the existing literature, there is increasing evidence demonstrating the efficacy of
      Shinrin-Yoku for improving for health promotion. However, there is very limited research
      examining the effectiveness of Shinrin-Yoku in different types of natural environment and the
      sustainability of its effects.

      This study will be a pilot randomized controlled trial on the effects of Shinrin-Yoku (forest
      bathing) as an intervention for enhancing psychological well-being in Chinese population.
      Prior to all study procedures, an online informed consent (with phone support) will be
      obtained from potential participants. Around 30 eligible participants will be randomly
      assigned to either the natural forest group or the urban green area group in a ratio of 1:1.

    <measure>Change in the Profile of Mood States-Short Form</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-, post-intervention and 1-month post-intervention</time_frame>

These include: Tension or Anxiety, Anger or Hostility, Vigor or Activity, Fatigue or Inertia, Depression or Dejection, Confusion or Bewilderment.

However, recommended cutoff scores for conventional severity labels (normal, moderate, severe) are given in the DASS Manual.</description>
