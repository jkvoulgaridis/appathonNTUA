  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, with the investment from government in the health management of the elderly,
      community management of hypertension in the elderly has made great progress in management
      rate and standardized management, but the management of young and middle-aged patients with
      hypertension is still blank.

      Workplace pressure measurement may be more suitable for most of the young and middle-aged
      patients to find high blood pressure and monitor blood pressure changes in time.

      However, there is not much research on workplace pressure measurement. Whether blood pressure
      measurement in the workplace can reduce the white coat effect, and how it relates to home
      blood pressure and ambulatory blood pressure is still unclear.
