      Primary Objective:

      To demonstrate the superior relative effectiveness of QIV-HD as compared to QIV-SD among
      persons 65 years of age and older for the prevention of cardiovascular and/or respiratory
      hospitalizations

      Secondary Objective:

        -  To assess the clinical relative effectiveness of QIV-HD as compared to QIV-SD in
           prevention of:

        -  inpatient hospitalization for selected circulatory and respiratory causes

        -  death, either all-cause or cardiovascular or respiratory causes

        -  inpatient hospitalization (using primary and secondary discharge diagnoses)

        -  inpatient hospitalization (using admission diagnoses)

        -  hospital emergency room visits

        -  primary care visits to physician or

        -  major acute cardiovascular events (MACE)

        -  To assess the characteristics of inpatient hospitalization or hospital emergency room
           visits or primary care visits to physician by QIV-HD and QIV-SD groups

        -  To describe the clinical relative effectiveness of QIV-HD as compared to QIV-SD:

        -  by age group and by group with specific comorbidities

        -  for different periods of observation

        -  To describe all serious adverse events (SAEs) (including adverse event of special
           interest [AESIs]) for all subjects in both QIV-HD and QIV-SD groups
