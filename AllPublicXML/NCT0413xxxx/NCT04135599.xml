  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive, safe and easy-to-operate
      neuro-electrophysiological technique, which becoming an emerging therapeutic option for many
      mental disorders.It can modulate cortical excitability of target brain region, neuron
      plasticity and brain connections. Previous studies suggest that tDCS could reduce cue-induced
      craving in drug addiction.

      Objective:In this study, the investigators employed real and sham tDCS of the bilateral
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) to test the effect of whether it could reduce
      cue-induced craving, influence cognitive function in alcoholics and explore its underlying
      mechanism with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).

      Methods: The investigators perform a randomized sham-controlled study in which 40 inpatient
      alcoholics will be randomized to receive 10 sessions of 20min sham or 1.5mA tDCS to the
      bilateral DLPFC (anodal right/cathodal left). The neuroimaging data, craving after exposed to
      alcohol-associated cues and the cognition task at baseline and after stimulation will be
      collected.

      The investigators hypothesized that tDCS stimulating the DLPFC decreases cue-induced craving
      and improves cognition, which might be associated with the functional connectivity
      alterations.

    <description>Participants were instructed to pay close attention to real alcoholic beverages and rate their level of craving after smelling and recalling the last time they engaged in alcohol use. Craving was assessed by visual analog scales (VAS), with 0 mm being &quot;no craving&quot;and 100 mm representing &quot;most craving ever experienced for alcohol&quot;.</description>

    <description>Chinese version of the CogState Battery was used to assess cognitive function. We selected two tasks: Two back task (working memory) and Identification task (attention) which were displayed on a green screen with standardized instructions before each task beginning.The accuracy in Two back task and the speed in Identification task are our focus.</description>
