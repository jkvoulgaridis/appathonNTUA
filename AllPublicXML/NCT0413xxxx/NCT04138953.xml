    <textblock>
      The long-term objective initiated with this study is to determine which brain areas
      functionally contribute to learning a motor skill. The primary hypothesis of this trial is
      that premotor cortex (PMC) is necessary to learn a new motor skill. Participants may undergo
      a MRI scan to acquire a structural image of their brain to target noninvasive stimulation,
      using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to one of two brain areas: PMC or primary motor
      cortex (M1). A third group of individuals will undergo a placebo stimulation protocol. For
      all three groups, stimulation will be used to create a transient 'virtual lesion' during
      motor skill training. Temporarily disrupting the normal activity of these brain regions
      during training will allow us to determine which regions are causally involved in learning a
      new motor skill. The primary outcome measure will be the change in skill after training in
      each group.

    <textblock>
      Recent findings in humans suggest that motor sequences are represented in the premotor cortex
      once learned. Studies in animal models have also shown that the premotor cortical areas
      encode sequence-specific information. However, it is currently unknown if premotor cortical
      areas are involved in the acquisition or consolidation of sequences in humans. In this
      project, the investigators will evaluate the functional contributions of human premotor
      cortex to sequence learning. The primary overarching research objective is to determine the
      brain regions causally involved in motor skill acquisition and consolidation. The main
      hypothesis is that disrupting premotor cortex activity during motor sequence learning will
      reduce the acquisition and consolidation of the skill. Transcranial magnetic stimulation
      (TMS) will be used to temporarily disrupt activity of premotor cortex or primary motor
      cortex, and skill learning will be assessed in both groups. A sham stimulation group, where
      participants will feel the coil on their head and hear the click of the TMS pulses but not
      actually receive stimulation to the brain, will be used as a control. Participants will be
      randomly assigned to be in the premotor cortex, primary motor cortex, or sham stimulation
      group. Participants may be asked to undergo a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan at Wesley
      Woods prior to TMS testing, which will occur at the Emory Rehabilitation Hospital. The MRI
      scan would be used to help target TMS to the intended brain area. Participants will be
      recruited using flyers around the local community. Consent forms will be provided with ample
      time for the participant to read it over and ask any questions that may arise. Participants
      will be compensated for their time. The proposed work will be the first to evaluate the
      causal role of premotor cortex in motor sequence learning in humans. Findings from this
      project are expected to inform the design and application of therapeutic interventions that
      improve motor functioning and learning in clinical populations.
