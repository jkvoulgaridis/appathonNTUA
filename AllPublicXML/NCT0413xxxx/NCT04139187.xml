  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is the most frequently injured knee ligament during
      performance of recreational activities and sports. In the United States, the annual incidence
      is 68.6 per 100,000 people per year and in Brazil, the estimation of ACL reconstruction
      increases 64%. There are different biomechanical profiles of risk factors for an ACL injury
      variable, the ligament dominance, the quadriceps dominance, the trunk dominance, and the leg
      dominance. Thus, the purpose of this study is to investigate the biomechanics adaptations
      after power and strength combined training protocol in healthy individuals. A second aim is
      to determine the effect of the training on knee injury risk factors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a parallel randomized clinical trial comparing the effect of combined training with
      power and strength exercises on lower extremity biomechanics in healthy individuals.

      The sample size was calculated with G*Power software using the ANOVA: Repeated measures,
      within-between interaction, 90% power, alpha 0.05, and 30% drop-out. Data from the tuck jump
      test (knee flexion range) by Makaruk (2014) were considered for this calculation with effect
      size 0.46. Thus, a total of 32 individuals (16 per group) is required for this study. To
      ensure the proper simple size, after collecting the first five participants per group, the
      sample size will be checked again.

      The participants will be randomized in experimental and no intervention groups inside each
      risk profile group. Randomization ratio will be 1:1 and interventions will last 10 weeks,
      with two weekly sessions for the exercise arms.

      The outcomes will include functional clinical tests, kinematic and kinetic variables during
      landing tasks, and strength of knee and hip muscles.

      The data analysis will be performed by intention to treat and per protocol. Generalized
      estimating equations will be used to identify interaction effects of groups and time followed
      by Bonferroni post-hoc. When effect are found, effect size will be estimated. Missing data
      will be estimate by statistical analysis.
