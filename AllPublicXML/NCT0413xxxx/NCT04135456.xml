  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) tended to lead to a sudden increase in
      intracerebral pressure (ICP), which can cause decreased cerebral perfusion and transient
      global cerebral ischemia. Early clipping and coiling of aneurysms and surgical evacuation of
      intracerebral hematoma were recommended for aSAH patients. However, the high ICP made it
      difficult to separate the subarachnoid space during the operation. Effective reduction of ICP
      was the key to the succession of the operation. But there is a lack of consensus on the
      management of raised ICP in aSAH. Mannitol is widely used to reduce ICP in patients with
      cerebral edema. The potential mechanism including decreasing the viscosity of the blood
      improving regional cerebral microvascular flow and oxygenation and increasing intravascular
      volume due to increased plasma osmolality. The magnitude of the pressure reduction was
      correlated with the intact intracranial automatic adjustment function. However, the
      hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis, hypernatremia, hypokalemia and renal failure associated
      with mannitol overdose must be considered and the effective dose and the duration of its
      administration were still unknown. The aims of this study were to determine the most
      appropriate mannitol dose to provide adequate brain relaxation in aSAH patients with the
      fewest adverse effects.

denoting bulging or the condition that additional methods for brain relaxation are immediately and always required in order to continue the surgical procedure because of brain swelling; firm or the condition that additional methods for brain relaxation are occasionally required to continue the surgical procedure; adequate; perfectly relaxed. All patients received conventional frontotemporal pterional approach, and the time from skin incision to dural opening was constant for 30 minutes. At the time of dural opening, the degree of cerebral relaxation was evaluated, and the satisfactory cerebral relaxation was defined as 3 or 4 points.</description>
