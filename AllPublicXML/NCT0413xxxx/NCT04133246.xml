  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore and collect the perceptions, expectations and needs
      of CF patients about parenting. This will be done in the context of several small groups of
      patients led by a psychologist who will ensure that all the participants express themselves;
      he will encourage them to develop their points of view, their divergences and their common
      points about what constitutes to be a parent.

      The collected information should make it possible to develop and propose adapted
      medico-psycho-social interventions, if necessary, in connection with patient associations

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Life expectancy has improved significantly in cystic fibrosis in recent years. From
      paediatric disease, it has become a disease of the adult, with the emergence of new issues,
      such as becoming a parent. Parent patients still face the risk of complications and death
      while their child is still young. However, there is very little data in the literature on
      parenting in cystic fibrosis.

      Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore and collect the perceptions, expectations
      and needs of CF patients and their spouses about parenting.

      All patients with children, followed in 2 large adult CF centers, and their spouses will be
      invited to participate in a 6 to 10-person discussion group (focus group) led by a
      psychologist. He will ensure that all the participants express themselves and are encouraged
      to develop their points of view, their divergences and their common points about what
      constitutes to be a parent. The discussions will be recorded and transcribed.

      Patients who cannot participate in groups (e.g. patients colonized with Burkholderia cepacia
      complex) but wish to be included in the study will benefit from an individual interview with
      the psychologist, also registered and transcribed. A thematic analysis will be carried out
      from the transcriptions of group contents. For individual interviews, phenomenological
      interpretative analysis (IPA) will be used. A synthesis of the two analyses will then be
      done.

      The collected information should make it possible to develop and propose adapted
      medico-psycho-social interventions, if necessary, in connection with patient associations.
