      Background:

      Please refer to National Cancer Institute Surgery Branch (NCI-SB) protocol 18-C-0049,
      Amendment F.

      Objective:

      Under Individual Patient Expanded Access, to treat a patient with metastatic prostate cancer
      with autologous peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) that have been transduced with genes
      encoding T-cell receptors that recognize the mutated TP53 shared oncogene in the autologous
      cancer.

      Eligibility:

        -  Must have measurable, metastatic disease as assessed per RECIST v1.1 criteria.

        -  Must sign the informed consent document.

        -  Willing to sign Durable Power of Attorney Form.

        -  Must have all regulatory approvals prior to start of treatment.

      Design:

        -  Please refer to NCI-SB protocol 18-C-0049, Amendment F.

        -  The patient will be treated with a non-myeloablative, lymphodepleting preparative
           regimen of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, followed by the infusion of autologous
           transduced PBL and then high-dose aldesleukin. The patient will also receive
           pembrolizumab on Day -2 prior to cell administration and additional doses every 3 weeks
           following cell infusion until the time of disease progression.
