  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The potential value of biological and biosynthetic meshes is their ability to integrate and
      remodel the wall in a contaminated environment in complex surgical situations. However,
      postoperative morbidity and recurrence rate for biologic prostheses are high. The delay to
      evaluate biosynthetic prostheses is not enough at present, and the high cost of biological
      prostheses requires a parsimonious use of this type of material. The interest of absorbable
      biosynthetic prostheses remains to be demonstrated in terms of postoperative complications
      and long-term recurrence. Current studies have been done on groups with few subjects and in
      clean surgery.

      The primary purpose is to describe the number of complications of the operative site at 12
      months, including infectious and noninfectious complications as hematoma and seroma type. The
      secondary purpose is to describe the number of recurrent ventral hernia at 12 months.

      The ventral hernia repair is a frequent operation of general surgery. Thanks to this
      descriptive work considering the new therapeutic offer with absorbable polymers, it would
      make possible to update the knowledge of the surgeons and to bring new elements of discussion
      in the surgical decision.
