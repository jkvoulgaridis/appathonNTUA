  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There has been growing interest in the relationship between reward processing and clinical
      symptoms of depression such as anhedonia (loss of interest and response to pleasurable
      activities).

      The aim of the study is to investigate the acute effects of a single dose of selegiline (an
      irreversible monoamine oxidase B inhibitor) on reward and emotional processing in healthy
      volunteers.

    <textblock>
      There has been growing interest in the relationship between reward processing and clinical
      symptoms of depression such as anhedonia (loss of interest and response to pleasurable
      activities). Studies in animals have suggested that the neurotransmitter, dopamine, plays a
      key role in reward processing. This has given rise to the suggestion that in depression,
      decrements in dopamine activity lead to impaired reward processing which cause symptoms such
      as anhedonia and low motivation.

      Research in humans into dopamine and reward is limited by suitable pharmacological means to
      manipulate dopamine activity safely and effectively.

      To our knowledge, no previous research has studied the effects of acute administration of the
      licensed drug, selegiline, on reward and emotional processing. However, a single dose of
      selegiline effectively inhibits monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B), which should lead to increased
      dopamine availability in the CNS. Therefore, selegiline may be a useful tool to explore the
      effect of modifying dopamine availability on reward processing. Acquiring such knowledge
      through this study could assist in the clinical use of MAO-B inhibition as a target to
      ameliorate symptoms such as anhedonia as well as increasing our general understanding of
      reward processing in healthy individuals.

      The aim of this study is to explore the effects of acute administration of a standard (10mg)
      dose of selegiline on reward and emotional processing versus a placebo, in healthy
      volunteers. At this dose selegiline only has an -MAO-B function therefore the specific impact
      of MAO-B blockade on reward and emotional processing can be explored.

      Research Question: What effect will the administration of a single dose of selegiline have on
      reward and emotional processing in healthy volunteers?

    <masking_description>A randomisation code will be drawn up by a researcher not involved in the study using a randomisation tool online (https://www.sealedenvelope.com/simple-randomiser/v1/lists). The study randomisation code will be kept in a sealed envelope in a dedicated cabinet in Neurosciences Building of The Department of Psychiatry. At the end of the study, the randomisation blind will be broken by the principal investigator by opening the randomisation code envelope.
Blinding will be achieved by identical encapsulation of the selegiline and the placebo using the Departmental Standard Operating Procedure for drug encapsulation.</masking_description>

    <measure>Total monetary amount won in reward learning task.</measure>
    <time_frame>Tested one hour after selegiline/placebo ingestion</time_frame>
    <description>During this task participants have to repeatedly choose between 2 options. On each trial one of the options, if chosen by the participant, will result in the participant winning money. The participant simply has to learn which is the best option to choose so as to win as much money as possible.</description>

    <measure>Reaction Time (milliseconds) on the Faces Dot Probe Task (FDOT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Tested one hour after selegiline/placebo ingestion</time_frame>
    <description>The FDOT assesses attention to positive versus negative stimuli using a reaction time measure. Two faces are presented vertically on the computer screen and replaced by a pair of dots, to which the participant has to respond by indicating whether the dots are vertically or horizontally aligned. On some trials, one of the two faces presented has an emotional expression (fearful or happy). On half of the trials, the faces are presented very briefly and immediately replaced by a jumbled face mask. The reaction time to respond to the dots can be used as a measure of attention to the emotional faces.</description>

    <measure>Reaction time (milliseconds) in an Emotional Categorisation Task (ECAT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Tested one hour after selegiline/placebo ingestion</time_frame>
    <description>The ECAT assesses speed to respond to positive and negative self-referent personality descriptors. Sixty personality characteristics (30 per valence) selected to be disagreeable (eg, sneering, untidy, hostile) or agreeable (eg, cheerful, honest, optimistic) are presented. The participants are asked whether they would like or dislike to be referred to as each characteristic.</description>

    <measure>Performance (number of words recalled) in an emotional recall task (EREC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Tested one hour after selegiline/placebo ingestion</time_frame>
    <description>The EREC is a surprise free recall task to assess the incidental encoding of emotional stimuli. Participants are asked to recall as many of the words previously presented in the ECAT task (See Outcome Measure 4) as they can. The relative recall of positive versus negative words gives a measure of emotional biases in memory. This task is not computerised - participants write the recalled words on paper.</description>

    <measure>Percentage Accuracy(%) on facial expression recognition task (FERT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Tested one hour after selegiline/placebo ingestion</time_frame>
    <description>The FERT assesses the interpretation of facial expressions. Faces with seven different basic emotions (happiness, fear, anger, disgust, sadness, surprise, neutral) are displayed on the screen and participants are required to indicate the expression on the face via a button-press. Different intensity levels of each emotion are presented, which increases the ambiguity of the facial expression and the sensitivity of the task.</description>

    <description>The EMEM measures recognition memory for affective words. Participants are presented with a series of words comprising the pleasant and unpleasant personality words that were previously presented to them in the ECAT, and a set of previously unseen distracter words. For each word, participants are required to report whether they have previously seen the word.</description>
