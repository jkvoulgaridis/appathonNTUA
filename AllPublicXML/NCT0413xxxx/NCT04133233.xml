    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study will be to demonstrate improvement of the T regulatory cells (Treg)
      response, under add on low-dose Interleukin 2 (ld-IL2) in patients with bipolar disorders
      experiencing a depressive relapse

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A hypothesis still under study concerning the pathophysiological mechanisms of bipolar
      disorder concerns an immunological disorder that could possibly be involved in this disease
      and during a depressive episode. In particular, that the multiplication of a certain category
      of white blood cells called &quot;regulators&quot; that block the toxic effect of more aggressive white
      blood cells could improve these disorders.

      The aim of this research is therefore to check the effectiveness and safety of injections of
      Interleukin 2 (IL-2) to induce this multiplication of regulatory white blood cells.

      IL-2 is a natural protein released by white blood cells that is used for the proper
      functioning of the immune defence system. The favourable effects of injecting small doses of
      IL-2 are known and assessed in other diseases, including autoimmune diseases.

      The secondary objective of this study is to assess the effect of these injections on
      patient's mood, which could be improved by this treatment.
