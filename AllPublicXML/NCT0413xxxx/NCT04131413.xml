      The primary goal of this phase I open label study is to determine the safety and tolerability
      of pNGVL4aCRTE6E7L2 DNA vaccine, as administered by intramuscular (IM) injection with
      TriGrid™ electroporation to both HIV- or HIV+ adult female subjects (≥ 19 years), with biopsy
      confirmed cervical intraepithelial (CIN) II or III that is human papillomavirus (HPV) 16+.

    <description>The dose escalation will start from the lowest dose level of 0.3 mg. This dose cohort will consist of 3 participants and a monitoring period of one week after the final dose mandated. If there are 0 participants in the 0.3 dose level cohort that experience dose limiting toxicities (DLT), a new cohort of 3 participants will be vaccinated at the 1.0 mg dose level. If there are 0 participants in the 1.0 mg dose level that experience DLT, then a new cohort of 3 participants will be vaccinated at the 3.0 mg dose level. If there is 1 participant experiencing DLTs, an additional cohort of 3 subjects will be enrolled and treated at the current dose level. If there are 2 or more participants experiencing DLTs in the 3 or additional cohort of 3 vaccinated at the current dose level, then the next lower dose level will be determined as the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD).</description>

               2. Two HIV-1 RNA values ≤200 copies/mL at least 24 hours apart performed by any
                  laboratory that has Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)

          -  Age ≥19 years. Also due to Alabama law the age a person is no longer a minor needing
             parental consent is 19, so all participants need to be 19 or older.

          -  The effects of pNGVL4aCRTE6E7L2 DNA vaccine on the developing human fetus is unknown.
             For this reason, women of child-bearing potential must agree to use two forms of
             acceptable contraception, including one barrier method, prior to study entry and for 3
             months after study completion. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is
             pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her study physician
             immediately.

               1. Women of childbearing potential are defined as any female who has experienced
                  menarche and does not meet the criteria for &quot;women not of childbearing potential&quot;
                  defined below.

               2. Women not of childbearing potential are defined as follows:

             i. Women who are permanently sterilized (e.g., tubal occlusion, hysterectomy,
             bilateral salpingectomy, bilateral oophorectomy) ii. Women who have experienced total
             cessation of menses for at least 1 year OR who have a previous clinical follicle
             stimulating hormone (FSH) value &gt; 40 mIU/mL c. The following are acceptable forms of
             barrier contraception: i. Male or female condom, ii. Diaphragm, cervical/vault cap, or
             contraceptive sponge when used with spermicidal foam/gel/cream/suppository.

             d. The following are acceptable forms of secondary contraception, when used with a
             barrier method and spermicide: i. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) ii.
             Established use of oral, injected, or implanted hormonal methods of contraception

             requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with high-grade cervical intraepithelial lesions (CIN2/3) that are HPV16
             negative

          -  For the HIV+ cohort only: patients with AIDS related symptoms comprising an active
             AIDS-associated infectious process that, in the view of the investigator, would limit
             the subject's ability to comply with study procedures.

          -  For the HIV+ cohort only: patients with an HIV viral load &gt;200 cp/mL.

          -  Administration of chronic (defined as more than 14 days) immunosuppressants or other
             immune-modifying drugs within 6 months of study entry; For corticosteroids, this will
             mean prednisone, or equivalent, greater than or equal to 0.5 mg/kg/day; inhaled and
             topical steroids are allowed.

          -  Due to interference with the immunologic measurements and compromising the analysis of
             the safety of the vaccine, participants with active or chronic infection of hepatitis
             C virus (HCV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV) are excluded as well as those who have

             congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, unstable cardiac arrhythmia, or
             psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
             requirements.

          -  Participants with a history of autoimmune disease such as systemic lupus
             erythematosus, celiac disease, autoimmune hepatitis, multiple sclerosis, exclusive of

          -  Pregnant and breastfeeding women are excluded from this study because pNGVL4aCRTE6E7L2
             is a vaccine with unknown potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to pNGVL4aCRTE6E7L2 DNA vaccine.

          -  Participants with a metal implant(s) at the site of injection or any electronic
             stimulation device, such as cardiac demand pacemakers, automatic implantable cardiac

          -  Individuals in whom the ability to observe possible local reactions at the eligible
             injection sites (deltoid region) is, in the opinion of the investigator, unacceptably
             obscured due to a physical condition or permanent body art.

          -  Acute or chronic, clinically significant hematologic, pulmonary, cardiovascular, or
             hepatic or renal functional abnormality as determined by the investigator based on
