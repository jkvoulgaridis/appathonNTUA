  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind, parallel-arm study in a
      two-staged approach that will assess the effect of two different doses of G-PUR® on enteral
      lead absorption in healthy adults using a stable lead isotopic tracer (204Pb).
