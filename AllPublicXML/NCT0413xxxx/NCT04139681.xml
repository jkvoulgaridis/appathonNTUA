      Aim of this study is to investigate safety and efficacy of A. Vogel Sore throat lozenges for
      the treatment of of acute sore throats
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      75 patients aged 12-75 years with acute sore throats (symptoms not older than 48 h) were
      recruited by the study site/CRO via local general practitioners and are allocated to acute
      treatment with A. Vogel Sore throat lozenges. The patients who are confirmed to meet the
      study entry criteria and after having given written informed consent will be assigned to
      receive a study treatment according to study procedures described in the study plan.

      The patients will visit study site twice. At the first visit (Visit 1) a screening will be
      performed to finally decide if patient will be included/excluded in the study. Then he or she
      will be taking one single lozenge under supervision of the investigating physician and acute
      efficacy/safety ratings recorded before intake and repeatedly every 15 minutes for 90 minutes
      after intake of first lozenge. He or she will be supplied with the remaining 19 lozenges in a
      bottle and provided with patient diaries for home recording of efficacy/safety. After four
      days (max 5 days) or until complete resolution of symptoms the patients were obliged to
      return to the study centre for final visit 2. Daily ratings of efficacy/safety was done by
      the patient once in the morning and once in the evening. Daily dosage was 5 lozenges per day
      every 3rd hour during daytime.

      At final visit 2, patients will be evaluated physically by the physician at the study centre
      and again assessed for safety/efficacy parameters. At last, patients returned their patient
      diaries and remaining study medication before compensation is handed out and patients finally
      excluded from the study.
