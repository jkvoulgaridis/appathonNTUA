    <textblock>
      In this pilot study the feasibility of continous monitoring of health data with a small,
      on-skin wearable device (the Everion®, by Biovotion, Zurich) in pediatric patients under
      chemotherapy for cancer, is studied. Feasibility is assessed by the number of patients
      wearing the device on seven consecutive days for at least 18h/day, what will be measured by
      monitored heart rate. Study duration for each participant is 14 days.

    <textblock>
      No study has proved feasibility of continuous monitoring of health data with a small wearable
      device such as the device Everion® in pediatric patients. It is not known if children
      tolerate the device and if data quality sustains with smaller arm circumferences or when worn
      on the upper leg. Neither is it known if parents and/or patients can and are willing to
      handle the device in ambulant setting. Therefore, this pilot study assesses the feasibility
      of continous monitoring of health data with a small, on-skin wearable device (the Everion®,
      by Biovotion, Zurich) in pediatric patients under chemotherapy for cancer.
