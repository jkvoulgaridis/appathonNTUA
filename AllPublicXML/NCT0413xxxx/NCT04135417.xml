      This is a Phase 2, prospective, multicenter, open-label, single-arm study of the Human
      Acellular Vessel (HAV).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, prospective, multicenter, open-label, single-arm study. Subjects who sign
      informed consent would undergo study-specific screening assessments within 45 days from the
      day of informed consent.

      Eligible study subjects will receive a HAV and will be followed to 12 months
      post-implantation at routine study visits regardless of patency status. After 12 months,
      subjects with a patent HAV will be followed (while the HAV remains patent) for up to 3 years
      (36 months) post implantation at study visits every 6 months.

    <description>The HAV is a tissue-engineered vascular conduit (6mm diameter) for hemodialysis access in patients with end-stage renal disease. HAV for this study will be manufactured using the commercial manufacturing system.It will be implanted in the forearm or upper arm using standard vascular surgical techniques. All subjects will be required to start taking daily aspirin (75 or 325 mg) on Day 1 after surgical implantation of HAV unless they are already taking another antiplatelet agent. If low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is administered post-operatively, aspirin or other antiplatelet agents should be initiated after stopping LMWH. Subjects who are known to be aspirin-sensitive should take another antiplatelet agent at the discretion of the Principal Investigator.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with ESRD who are not, or who are no longer candidates for creation of an
             autologous AV fistula and therefore need placement of an AV graft in the arm (upper or
             forearm) for hemodialysis therapy.

          3. At least 18 years of age at Screening.

          4. Suitable arterial and venous anatomy for implantation of straight or looped conduits
             in either the forearm or upper arm (not crossing the elbow).

          5. Hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL and platelet count ≥ 100,000 cells/mm3 prior to Day 0 (within 45
             days).

          6. Other hematological and biochemical parameters within a range consistent with ESRD

             previous failed access on that extremity.

         10. Active local or systemic infection (white blood cells [WBC] &gt; 15,000 cells/mm3 at
             Screening). If the infection resolves, the subject must be at least 1 week post
             resolution of that infection before implantation.

         11. Known serious allergy to planned antiplatelet agent.

         12. Pregnant women, or women intending to become pregnant during the course of the trial.
