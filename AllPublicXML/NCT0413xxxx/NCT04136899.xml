  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The suffering of caregivers is constantly increasing. General medicine, because of its
      primary role in primary care, is particularly exposed to the risk of burn-out and must
      protect itself. The aim of this study was to find an inverse relationship between
      health-related quality of life and being severely burned by French general practitioners.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Assesment of Burn-out</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Maslach Burn-out Inventory scale, 22 Items sort to 0 (never) at 6 (every day) 3 class : An emotional exhaustion (EE), depersonalization (DP) and a reduction of personal accomplishment (AP)
The emotional exhaustion (when emotional resources are exhausted, when the workers can no longer give their best, psychologically speaking.)
The Depersonalization (reflects withdrawal, indifference to work)
The lose of personal accomplishment (devaluation, negative self-evaluation at work)
Our study focused on severe burn-out, defined by the combination of high EE and DP scores and low AP scores:
A high EE is defined by a score &gt; 30
A high PD is defined by a score &gt; 12
A low PA is defined by a score &lt; 33.</description>

    <measure>Assesment quality of life: Dukes Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Duke Health Profile 17 items questionnaire. It assesses health-related quality of life and has 10 dimensions.
The score of each of the 10 dimensions matches with the sum of the item scores, standardized from 0 to 100:
For the 6 health scores (general, physical, mental, social, perceived health and self-esteem) 100 specifies the best HRQoL,
For the 4 scores of the dysfunction dimension (anxiety, depression, pain, disability), 100 specifies the most significant dysfunction</description>
