  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is an important treatment for breast cancer patients. Patients with
      triple negative or Her2 enriched subtype who achieved pCR after neoadjuvant chemotherapy
      would have longer survival. But the overall pCR rate of breast cancer was about 20%. So,
      different methods have tried to improve pCR rate.Drug sensitivity screening in vitro for
      different chemotherapy drugs was a promising method for improving pCR rate. But there was no
      method could select effective drugs accurately for breast cancer patients until now. This
      study will explore whether drug screening by culturing breast cancer cells in vitro from
      breast cancer tissue could improve pCR rate compared with traditional neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy. Breast cancer patients who were candidates for neoadjuvant chemotherapy will be
      allocated two group. One group will receive neoadjuvant cheotherapy according physician's
      choices. Another group will receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy according results of drug
      sensitivity results by in vitro cell culture. pCR rate will be compared between two groups to
      explore whether drug sensitivity screening could improve pCR rate.

      Neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer could make unresectable breast cancer be
      resectable and improve breast conservation rate. Patients with triple negative or Her2
      enriched subtype who achieved pCR after neoadjuvant chemotherapy would have better survival.
      But the overall pCR rate of breast cancer was about 20%. And patients with luminal like
      subtype were less reactive for neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Improving pCR rate maybe could
      achieve better survival. So, different methods have tried to improve pCR rate.Drug
      sensitivity screening in vitro for different chemotherapy drugs was a promising method for
      improving pCR rate. But there was no method could select effective drugs accurately until
      now. This study will explore whether drug screening by culturing breast cancer cells in vitro
      from breast cancer tissue could improve pCR rate compared with neoadjuvant chemotherapy
      depend on physician's choice. 200 breast cancer patients who were candidates for neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy will be allocated to two group. One group with 100 patients will receive
      neoadjuvant cheotherapy according physician's choices. Another group with 100 patients will
      receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy according results of drug sensitivity results by in vitro
      cell culture. pCR rate will be compared between two groups to explore whether drug
      sensitivity screening could improve pCR rate.
