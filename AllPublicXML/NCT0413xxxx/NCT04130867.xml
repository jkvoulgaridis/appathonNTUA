  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oropharyngeal dysphagia, or difficulty swallowing, is a devastating condition that affects
      physiological and psychosocial functioning in 1 in 25 adults. Many dysphagia treatments
      exist, but our ability to adequately measure treatment outcomes is limited. Pharyngeal
      high-resolution manometry (pHRM) directly measures swallowing pressures, providing an
      objective measurement of physiology that characterizes the basic mechanisms of swallowing.
      pHRM is well-poised to measure outcomes of dysphagia treatments due to its direct, objective,
      and reproducible measures of swallowing function.

      This proposed project will address a central hypotheses that objective swallowing measures
      (including (pHRM) will reveal treatment-mediated swallowing changes, will align with
      patient-reported outcome measures, and will be able to predict who will benefit from
      treatment. The investigators will follow a cohort of participants with oropharyngeal
      dysphagia as they undergo either pharyngeal strengthening therapy or relief of upper
      esophageal sphincter outlet obstruction at three time points: baseline, mid-treatment (4-6
      weeks) and post-treatment (10-12 weeks). The investigators will compare participants to
      healthy controls using pHRM, videofluoroscopy, diet assessment, functional reserve tests, and
      patient-reported outcome measures.

    <measure>Change in Sydney Swallowing Questionnaire between timepoints</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, mid-treatment 4-6 weeks, post-treatment 10-12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Sydney Swallowing Questionnaire is a 17-item inventory scored on a visual analog scale (VAS) (with the exception of Q12) developed to measure symptomatic severity of pharyngeal dysphagia. Each VAS is 100 mm, where the left side of the scale is lesser symptoms and the right hand of the scale is increased symptoms. Scoring is measured in distance (mm) from the left. Maximum range in the scoring is 0 - 1700, the higher the score, the more severe the symptoms.</description>

    <description>The Eat Assessment Tool is a 10-item survey where each item is scored 0-4 where 0 is no problem and 4 is severe problem. The total range in score is 0-40 where higher scores indicate increased severity of symptoms.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline, mid-treatment 4-6 weeks, post-treatment 10-12 weeks</time_frame>

    <measure>Change in Maximum Isometric Pressure between timepoints</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, mid-treatment 4-6 weeks, post-treatment 10-12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Iowa Oral Pressure Instrument (IOPI) will be used to measure maximum isometric pressure. IOPI will be used to evaluate anterior and posterior maximal isometric tongue-pressures. A small (3.5 cm long and 4.5 cm in diameter) air-filled plastic pressure bulb will be placed in the mouth at two different positions: directly posterior to the incisors and at the posterior oral tongue. Participants will be asked to squeeze the bulb against the roof of the mouth with maximal effort and to perform saliva swallows. Three tasks in each position will be recorded and participants will rest for 10 seconds between each trial.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Dietary Assessment between timepoints</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, mid-treatment 4-6 weeks, post-treatment 10-12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will undergo diet assessment by using International Dysphagia Diet Standardisation Initiative Framework. This framework defines and scores food textures/consistencies for participants with dysphagia. Liquids are scored 0-4 where 0 is thin and 4 is extremely thick. Foods are scored from 3-7 where 3 is liquidized food and 7 is regular food.</description>

        300 adults will be recruited to participate in the study. Participants will include 250
        patients with heterogeneous causes of dysphagia undergoing active swallowing treatment and
        50 age- and sex-match control participants with healthy swallow function. Participants will
        be stratified into the following goals of swallowing rehabilitation: Group A) Pharyngeal
        strengthening (n=125); and Group B) Relief of upper esophageal sphincter (UES) dysfunction
        or pharyngeal outlet obstruction (n=125). Classification will be based on clinician-driven
        diagnoses and treatment goals based on standard of care evaluation. The control group of
        healthy individuals will be Group C (n=50).

        Participants' age may range from 18-99 years old; as dysphagia is more frequent in the
        elderly, the sample will most likely include individuals age 60 and over.
