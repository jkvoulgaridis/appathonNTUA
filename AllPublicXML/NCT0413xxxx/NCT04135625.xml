  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project targets vulnerable populations of smallholders, women and children and should
      lead to increased poultry production, increased egg consumption of children, improved
      nutrition, and increased household level resilience. This innovative intervention will be the
      gifting of chickens by religious leaders to children ages 6 to 12 months coupled with
      integrated nutrition and agricultural trainings.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study involves innovative behavioral change theoretical methodology to empower
      caregivers as smallholder poultry producers by improving their access to livestock production
      resources and agricultural extension services, providing tools for improved decision making,
      and enhancing nutrition based knowledge. Smallholder production is important in eliminating
      food insecurities and building resilience to improve nutrition in children under 5. Based on
      the results of the Ethiopian egg project, through messaging and education, this study will
      foster favorable attitudes and consequent behavioral changes, including increased egg
      consumption.
