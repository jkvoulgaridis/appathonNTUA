  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Magnesium plays a role in an array of critical body functions, controls normal adenosine
      triphosphate function, the metabolism of glucose, and cardiac muscle function, as well as the
      maintenance of cell membrane function. Low magnesium intakes and blood levels have been
      associated with a number of chronic diseases including hypertension, type 2 diabetes,
      metabolic syndrome, vascular disease, osteoporosis, and colon cancer. Magnesium deficiency is
      common. In the U.S. population, nearly 4% of men and 7% of women have hypomagnesemia
      (typically defined as a serum concentration &lt;0.75 mmol/L, or &lt; 17mg/L), which has been
      previously shown to be associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality after 30
      years of follow-up. In addition, hypomagnesemia is seen in approximately 11% of hospitalized
      patients and 52% of patients in coronary care units. Approximately half of the U.S.
      population does not currently reach the estimated average requirement (EAR) for magnesium
      from food. Yet magnesium deficiency is often overlooked.

      Magnesium is relatively well absorbed by the gut; oral bioavailability varies from 35 to 70%
      and depends on a variety of factors such as the form of the magnesium salt (organic vs.
      inorganic), its rate and extent of uptake from the intestine into the blood, and its transfer
      into tissues because magnesium is primarily an intracellular cation. The absorption rate
      increases when dietary intake is low. In terms of the effectiveness of oral dietary
      supplements, bioavailability and tolerability of various formulations are important
      considerations. Similar bioavailability has been demonstrated between inorganic formulations
      (magnesium oxide vs. magnesium chloride), however some studies have shown magnesium oxide to
      be less bioavailable. Diarrhea and abdominal cramping are side effects that are commonly
      reported from oral oral supplementation. These symptoms are thought to be due to the osmotic
      activity of unabsorbed salts in the intestine and colon and the stimulation of gastric
      motility. A new picometer-ionic form of magnesium chloride, was developed to efficiently
      deliver stabilized magnesium ions that are similar in size to plant magnesium. Picometer
      magnesium is smaller in diameter than the body's cell mineral ion channels, therefore it has
      the potential to be completely absorbed and not cause adverse side effects in the
      gastrointestinal system (e.g., diarrhea). The aim of this research is to assess the
      bioavailability of this new picometer-ionic form of magnesium chloride by comparing its
      bioavailability to that of a standard magnesium oxide and magnesium citrate supplement in
      healthy, adult, normotensive subjects.

    <description>Ionized magnesium in whole blood is the primary outcome measure which will be measured by using a magnesium selective electrode clinical analyzer (Stat Profile Prime® Model, Prime Electrolyte System) at multiple time points following the oral doses of the magnesium supplements (MgCl vs MgO vs placebo). The time points will be -15 minutes prior to dose and post dose at 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hour, 3 hour, 4 hour, 6 hour, 8 hour and 24 hour.</description>

    <description>Total magnesium in serum and urine are the secondary outcome measures which will be measured by using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) at multiple time points following the oral doses of the magnesium supplements (MgCl vs MgO vs placebo). The time points for serum total magnesium will be -15 minutes prior to dose and post dose at 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hour, 3 hour, 4 hour, 6 hour, 8 hour and 24 hour. Complete urine collections will be obtained at pooled intervals that coincide with timing of blood draws.</description>
