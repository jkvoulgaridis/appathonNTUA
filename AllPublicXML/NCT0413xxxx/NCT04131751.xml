  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infection of the ascitic fluid is a serious complication associated with high morbidity and
      mortality. This fluid is often colonized with bacteria that can cause infection of the
      peritoneum and possibly sepsis. Many bacteria of the human intestinal microbiome can't be
      cultured by standard methods; therefore it seems likely that many of the relevant bacteria
      are not discovered in routine diagnostics, but may be relevant to pathogenesis.
      Culture-independent approaches such as NGS (Next generation Sequencing) have in principle
      made it possible to study or prove complex microbial colonization. Because NGS is a
      relatively new technology, microbiological diagnostic protocols need to be further customized
      and refined to integrate with the standard diagnostic workflow, if necessary. For
      microbiological diagnostics, material is collected from the appropriate ascites patients and
      sent for microbiological diagnostics. Afterwards the cultural diagnostics are carried out as
      part of the patient care at the university hospital. In this study the investigators plan to
      use these samples to analyze and compare the presence of bacteria by NGS in parallel to the
      culture diagnostics, and then compare it to the patients' gut microbiome, to understand the
      possible effect of the microbiome on ascites pathogenesis and outcome.

        The study will include adult consent intensive care patients who undergo parenthesis for
        diagnostic purposes to exclude ascitic infection, regardless of the clinical picture. The
        indication for puncture is provided by the attending clinician regardless of the study.
