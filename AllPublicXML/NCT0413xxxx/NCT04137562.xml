      A Multicenter, Randomized, Single-Blind, Phase Ⅱ Clinical Trial and Open Label Long-term
      Observation Study of ADSTEM Inj. to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy in Patients with
      Moderate to Severe Subacute and Chronic Atopic Dermatitis.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ADSTEM Inj. against Placebo
      in the treatment of atopic dermatitis in patients with moderate to severe acute and chronic
      atopic.

      This clinical trial is designed with multi-organization, random assignment, single-blind,
      second-phase clinical trials and open long-term follow up studies, and is intended for
      patients with secondary or above subacuteal and chronic atopic dermatitis. If the test
      subjects voluntarily agree in writing to participate in this clinical trial, they shall
      conduct the examination and examination required for four weeks prior to administration of
      the investigational product (visit 1) in accordance with the clinical trial plan. As a result
      of the suitability assessment of the test subjects, those who comply with the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria, adipose tissue will be collected through the liposuction method
      and randomly assigned to each arms. Subjects who are eligible for administration of the
      investigational product on the day of administration (visit 2) under the investigator's
      judgment are given intravenous administration of the clinical trial medication once at the
      date of administration (visit 2, visit 3) and follow-up inspection is conducted at 4 weeks, 8
      weeks, 12 weeks, and 16 weeks after the first administration of the investigational product
      and safety and efficacy assessments are conducted for a total of 16 weeks. The test subjects
      assigned to the placebo group shall be compensated by administering a experimental drug on
      demand after the visit 6. It is a principle to administer the test drug prepared from the
      previously obtained adipose tissue, and it is possible to carry out further adipose tissue
      collection if necessary. However, no safety and efficacy assessments of compensatory
      treatments will be collected. Safety and efficacy will be analyzed after all the subjects has
      completed visit 6. For the experimental group only, long-term observation study for safety
      assessment is conducted at the point of 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, 30 months,
      36 months, 48 months, and 60 months after the second administration of the investigational
      product for a total of 5 years.
