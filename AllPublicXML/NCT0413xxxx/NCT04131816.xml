  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this implementation trial is to execute a nurse-led, home-based cardiac
      rehabilitation (HBCR) program, evaluate the program's impact on patient outcomes over 6
      months; and compare outcomes of HeartHome (HH) participants to a group of participants in
      traditional cardiac rehabilitation (CR).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite being recognized as a class 1 recommendation by the American Heart Association (AHA),
      traditional CR is underused: only 20% of patients who need CR are referred, and only half of
      those referred enroll in the program. The primary barriers to enrollment in CR include the
      failure of providers to refer patients; systems that lack a clear, streamlined referral
      process; and patients who face multiple barriers, including knowledge, transportation, cost,
      time, and social-family support.

      The HeartHome program is adapted from MULTIFIT, an evidence-based, interdisciplinary model of
      care developed at Stanford University was originally designed to provide coronary risk factor
      modification in post-MI patients, and later modified to implement consensus guidelines for
      providing HBCR to individuals with CVD using nurse managed care via telephone follow-up.
      HeartHome will combine nurse home visits with telephone and electronic supports for
      participants in a HBCR program that allows them to engage in cardiac rehabilitation programs
      at home.

      In this trial, nurses will deliver the 12-week educational program to 150 participants.
      Participants will then complete follow-up assessments at the end of the program (3 months
      post enrollment), and then at 6-months post enrollment. The data collected will be compared
      to a control group that contains de-identified data from 150 patients that attend the
      traditional cardiac rehab program.
