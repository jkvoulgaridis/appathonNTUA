  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to collect data on the safety and use of intravitreal aflibercept injections
      into the eye for the treatment of eye disorders that cause blurred vision or a blind spot due
      to abnormal or blocked blood vessels. Data will be collected from patients who are being
      treated for such eye disorders in Mexican routine clinical practice.

      The primary objective is to assess the safety of intravitreal aflibercept injections in
      patients with wet age-related macular degeneration (wAMD), myopic choroidal
      neovascularization (mCNV), diabetic macular edema (DME), macular edema secondary to central
      retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) or macular edema secondary to branch retinal vein occlusion
      (BRVO).

      Secondary objectives comprise the comparison of the aflibercept safety profile between
      defined subgroups and the assessment of the real-world application of intravitreal
      aflibercept injections with special focus on CRVO, BRVO and mCNV indications.

          -  Patients that were already treated with anti-VEGF or steroids are allowed to be
             enrolled only if they received the last dose of anti-VEGF 3 or more months ago and in
             the case of a steroid implant 6 months after the last dose;

          -  Current treatment with other intravitreal therapies

          -  Contra-indications according to Eylea's / Wetlia's local marketing authorization:

               -  Ocular or periocular infection

               -  Active intraocular Inflammation
