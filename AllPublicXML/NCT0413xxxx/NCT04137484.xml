  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total hip and knee arthroplasty are among the most common surgical procedures for which blood
      transfusion is prescribed. Patient blood management program has been proposed to decrease the
      need for transfusion. This program involve three pillars: preoperative improvement of
      erythropoiesis, intraoperative reduction of bleeding and postoperative management of anemia.

      Among the different steps of this program, reduction of bleeding and optimization of anemia
      are gaining popularity, but preoperative improvement of erythropoiesis is underused. The
      preoperative step of the blood management program is not systematically used because it
      requires a complex organization, is considered expensive, and finally because the others
      available techniques to reduce blood transfusion are easier to implement.

      The aim of this study was to assess, within a patient blood management program, the
      effectiveness of erythropoietin on reducing allogenic blood transfusion and anemia in
      patients requiring elective total hip or knee arthroplasty. &quot;

      This is a post-hoc analysis using part of the patients involved in the Cross Iron Study
      (Anesthesiology. 2018 Oct;129(4):710-720 ) Included patients were all the patients scheduled
      for elective primary total hip or knee arthroplasty and assessed by an anesthesiologist
      involved in the Cross Iron Study. Exclusion criteria were pregnancy, age under 18 years old,
      systemic infection, bilateral arthroplasty, revision arthroplasty, and participation in a
      preoperative autologous donation program.

      This was a observational study. The patient blood management program included: erythropoietin
      with iron supplementation if preoperative hemoglobin was lower than 13 g/dl; tranexamic acid
      during surgery; intravenous iron postoperatively and use of prespecified thresholds for
      homologous blood transfusion. Blood transfusion and anemia were assessed until day 5 or
      discharge, whichever came first. Major thromboembolic or cardiovascular events were assessed
      during admission and one month after discharge.
