      Background

      The mental, physical, and emotional health of caregivers is negatively affected by the burden
      of caring for of persons living with dementia. Caregivers are usually reported as feeling
      frustrated, angry, exhausted, guilty, helpless and unable to bear the heavy burden of their
      caregiving responsibilities. In addition to depressive symptoms and other mental health
      problems among caregivers, the physical stress of caring for someone who is unable to perform
      daily activities such as bathing, grooming and other personal care, has been shown to be a
      serious threat to caregivers' physical health outcomes. Evidence has shown that greater
      levels of stress, anxiety, depression, frustration, and lower subjective well-being and
      self-efficacy are exhibited in a greater amount among family and friends who care for persons
      living with dementia compared to those who do not have the burden of caring for a persons
      living with dementia. Caregivers have been shown to use alcohol and other drugs at a higher
      rate than those who do not need to care for others as a reaction to this increased stress.
      Studies has also shown that caregivers are more likely than non-Caregivers to use opioid or
      psychotropic medications. One over five caregivers (22%) feel tired when they go to bed at
      night.

      Objectives

      This study relies on a mobile application (Caring4Dementia) that provides people, caring for
      a person living with dementia, with a useful and intuitive training tool targeting
      communication skills. The aims of this study are to evaluate the feasibility and
      acceptability of using Caring4Dementia within a self-administered program and the preliminary
      efficacy of the Caring4Dementia intervention.

    <description>Measured by the Caregiver Well-Being Scale to determine the frequency in which basic needs and activities of living have been met for the caregiver within the last three months. Items in this self-reported scale are scored on a 5-point scale [ranging form &quot;Rarely (1)&quot; to &quot;Usually (5)&quot;], with a higher dimension score indicating greater intensity in that dimension. The highest score possible is 70, meaning a higher well-being.</description>

    <description>Measured by the Short version of the Burden Scale for Family Caregivers. This is a 10-item instrument. Each item is a statement that is rated on a 4-point scale with the values &quot;strongly disagree&quot; (0), &quot;disagree&quot; (1), &quot;agree&quot; (2), and &quot;strongly agree&quot; (3). The scale ranges from 0 to 30, with a higher dimension score indicating greater intensity in that dimension.</description>

    <description>Measured by the Adult Carer Quality of Life Questionnaire, a 40-item instrument that measures the overall quality of life for adult carers, and subscale scores for eight domains of quality of life. Scores on the overall questionnaire have a possible range of 0 to 120 with higher scores indicating greater quality of life.</description>

    <description>The experimental group will receive Careing4Dementia downloadable on their smartphone or tablet. Caring4Dementia will tell and show caregivers of a person living with dementia how to 1) manage difficult behaviors, 2) deal with refusal, 3) deal with tensions and 4) manage work-life demands. The app is self-administered and self-paced and contains surveys referring to the outcome measurements tools used in the study. The intervention will be for 30 days without any restriction or limitation in terms of timing, location or frequency of use.</description>
