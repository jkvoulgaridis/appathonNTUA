    <textblock>
      The Survey of Activities and Fear of Falling in the Elderly (SAFE) was originally developed
      in English to determine the level of fear of falling and its interactions with activities of
      daily living. The purpose of this study was to translate and cross-culturally adapt the SAFE
      instrument into Turkish and investigate its psychometric properties.

      The Survey of Activities and Fear of Falling in the Elderly (SAFE) was originally developed
      in English to determine the level of fear of falling and its interactions with activities of
      daily living. The purpose of this study was to translate and cross-culturally adapt the SAFE
      instrument into Turkish and investigate its psychometric properties. One hundred eleven older
      adults (72 females) with a mean age of 69 years (SD=7.22; range=60-87) were included. For
      cross-cultural adaptation, two bi-lingual translators used the back-translation procedure.
      Within a 5-to-7-day period after the first assessment, the participants completed the Turkish
      version of SAFE (SAFE-T) to evaluate test-retest reliability. Cronbach's alpha (α) was used
      to assess internal consistency. The correlation with the Turkish version of the Falls
      Efficiency Scale-International (FES-T) was determined to check the validity.

    <time_frame>Baseline (First assessment)</time_frame>
    <description>The Survey of Activities and Fear of Falling in the Elderly (SAFE), is a reliable (α = 0.95) and valid (r = 0.91) questionnaire for evaluating activity level, fear of falling, and activity restriction. SAFE assesses 11 community-based and home-based activities. SAFE is scored as the following:
Activity level is scored as the number of activities being done. Maximum score is 11 and higher scores indicate a higher activity level.
The fear of falling score is computed as the average worry scores across the 11 activities (or across as many of the activities that are done, i.e., if yes to A). Each activity is scored in the range 0 to 3 by recoding the answer. The recoding is described as 0=4 (Not at all worried), 1=3 (A little worried), 2=1 (Somewhat worried) and 3=1 (Very worried). In totally, higher scores indicate a greater fear of falling.
Activity restriction is scored by counting the number of activities which is responded &quot;less than you used to&quot;.</description>

    <measure>Falls Efficiency Scale-International</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (First assessment)</time_frame>
    <description>Falls Efficiency Scale-International (FES-I) is a 16-item self-administered questionnaire that was designed to assess fear of falling in community-dwelling older people. It provides information on the level of concern about falls during daily living activities. Each item is rated on a four-point scale, where 1=not at all concerned, 2=somewhat concerned, 3=fairly concerned, and 4=very concerned. The total score ranges from 16 (no concern about falling) to 64 (extreme concern about falling). The Turkish version of FES-I (FES-T), which was previously reported as a reliable (α = 0.94) and valid (r = - 0.83) instrument, was used in the present study.</description>
