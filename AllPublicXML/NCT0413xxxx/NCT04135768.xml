  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intra-articular fractures of the distal radius are common in urban populations and result in
      significant morbidity in terms of time away from work. Volar plating of the distal radius is
      a commonly used mode of surgical fixation of this fracture. The joint haematoma resulting
      from the fracture has been hypothesized to contribute to the post-injury disability. As such,
      this study aims to examine if the evacuation of the haematoma during volar plating results in
      superior functional outcomes at three months post surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Distal radius fractures have an incidence of up to 50% of all fractures, with up to two
      thirds being intra-articular fractures. While most fractures treated with a variety of
      methods achieve satisfactory patient reported outcomes at one year post treatment, patients
      experience pain and functional impairment up to 3 and 6 months post treatment. Open reduction
      and internal fixation using volar plates is one popular mode of treatment. It is relatively
      widely available and allows almost immediate post operative mobilisation and rehabilitation.

      One theory which could explain the delay in functional recovery is the persistence of the
      intra-articular haematoma. The evacuation of this haematoma may be partly responsible for the
      satisfactory results published by authors who perform wrist arthroscopy assisted distal
      radius fixation.

      In our literature review, it is not routine to evacuate this haematoma during conventional
      volar plating of the distal radius. As such, we aim to study if the evacuation of the
      haematoma in conjunction with volar plating confers functional benefits in the short term,
      particularly at 3 months post surgery.

    <description>After plating of the distal radius is performed, a small incision is made on the wrist joint capsule. This is the portal for fluid efflux. An intravenous cannula is used to puncture the wrist joint capsule adjacent to the first incision and normal saline is infused through this cannula into the wrist joint. The infusion continues until the fluid efflux from the first portal is clear and no longer blood stained. This will be the point at which the washout is considered to be complete.</description>
