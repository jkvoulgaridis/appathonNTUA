    <textblock>
      Many patients with stroke have a severe motor deficit in the upper limb impacting their
      independence. Electroencephalogram (EEG) Neurofeedback is a re-education technique that
      improves cerebral plasticity and motor gain in these people during the chronic phase of
      stroke. The visual feedback usually used tends to diminish the subject's attentional
      resources, while the proprioceptive feedbacks appear to be more effective on cortical
      excitability. Vibration feedback inducing movement illusion has been shown to be effective in
      healthy subjects, but has not been tested in people with stroke.

    <description>The objective is to evaluate if certain virtual visual conditions can increase the illusion of movement induced by the tendon vibration of the upper limb.
Thirty healthy volunteers and 20 post-stroke subjects will test 3 different situations of vibration applications, with no EEG Neurofeedback session. It will be applied to the subject (healthy and post-stroke) according to a randomized order a vibrator for a few minutes on his non-dominant (or deficit) hand hidden from view, with a screen representing a static virtual hand, then a vibrator on his hand hidden with a screen representing an animated virtual hand, then a vibrator on his hand hidden with a screen representing an empty background.</description>

    <description>In this phase of Test 2 in post-stroke subjects, the aim is to study the modification of the cortical excitability related to simple vibration stimulation, in subjects with supra-tentorial vascular cerebral lesions. For this step, we broaden the criteria for inclusion of post-stroke subjects.
Twenty healthy volunteers and 20 post-stroke subjects test 3 separate electroencephalographic recording conditions without Neurofeedback. It will be applied to the subject (healthy and post-stroke) an EEG headset recording brain activity during the application of vibration stimulation producing the illusion of movement on the non-dominant hand (or deficit), or during a task Mental imagery of the upper limb, or during the joint application of vibratory stimulation and a mental imaging task on the affected upper limb in a randomized order.</description>

    <description>Twenty-one healthy volunteers participate in the study. The healthy subject performs a session of Neurofeedback (on the non-dominant limb) of 30 minutes, trying in a random order the 3 modalities of feedback for 10 minutes each (visual, vibratory, visual combination + vibratory). The subject evaluates by a satisfaction questionnaire immediately after the session the tolerance of each modality and its possible preference. An analysis of the recorded EEG signals will then be performed.</description>

    <description>Twenty-one healthy volunteers participate in the study. The healthy subject is evaluated on the Finger Tapping test and the NHPT to assess the motor skills of his 2 upper limbs. Then he performs 6 sessions of Neurofeedback (on the non-dominant limb) lasting 45 minutes each, spread over 2 weeks, according to the feedback modality that has been drawn randomly (visual, vibratory, visual combination + vibratory). A second visit after the first session of NFB and a third visit after the last session of NFB evaluates the motor skills of the 2 upper limbs (Finger Tapping test, NHPT) and a satisfaction questionnaire is given to the subject to assess tolerance and satisfaction compared to the feedback mode assigned. Evaluation of changes of EEG sensorimotor rhythms at the end of the program.</description>

    <description>The post-stroke subject is evaluated on clinical tests (FMA, ARAT, MAL, NHPT, Finger Tapping test) during the first visit.

A second visit after the first NFB session and a third visit after the last NFB session evaluates the motor skills of the trained upper limb (FMA, ARAT, MAL, NHPT, Finger Tapping test) and a satisfaction questionnaire is given to the subject for evaluate tolerance and satisfaction with the feedback modality assigned.
