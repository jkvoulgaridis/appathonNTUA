      This study evaluate the adequate dose of mutonpain for laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the
      management of post operative pain. The investigators will randomize patients into three
      groups to compare the analgesia effects and side effects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nalbuphine is a FDA approved noncontrolled drug of opioid. And it had been applied for post
      operative pain for different surgeries, claiming that less nausea and vomiting with the same
      analgesic effect when comparing with morphine.

      However, several studies concerning post pain management usually used nalbuphine 0.15-0.3
      mg/kg for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. If the analgesic effect of nalbuphine is similar with
      morphine, less nalbuphine injection could reduce the side effects of opioid.

      The investigators will randomize patients into three groups of different initial nalbuphine
      dose for post laparoscopic cholecystectomy surgical pain, and set patient control analgesia
      machine with nalbuphine for further pain management. If the pain or side effects of opioid
      were intolerable, the investigators will change pain medications into NSAIDs or other
      adequate medications to comfort the patient.

      The primary outcome were numerical rating pain score and consumption of nalbuphine. The
      secondary outcomes were nausea, vomiting, pruritus and satisfactory score, and if any other
      medications use.

    <description>The Numerical Pain Rating Scale is a subjective measure in which individuals rate their pain on an eleven-point numerical scale. The scale is composed of 0 (no pain at all) to 10 (worst imaginable pain). The investors will measure the pain score at rest state and upon movement state at post-operative 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 24 hours, 36 hours.</description>
