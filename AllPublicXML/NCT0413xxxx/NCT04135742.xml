  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This goal of this study is to explore the effects of transcranial alternating current
      stimulation(tACS) combined with computerized cognitive training(CCT) on improving cognition
      for patients with mild cognitive impairment(MCI). The study will recruit 195 patients with
      MCI. Participants will undergo baseline cognitve assessment, EEG and structural and
      functional MRI. Participants will be randomized to active tACS+CCT group, sham tACS+CCT group
      and active tACS+sham CCT group. At the end of the intervention, 3-month, 6-month and 12-month
      follow-up, all subjects will repeat the baseline assessments.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      tACS is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique that uses a low-intensity alternating
      current (1 to 2 mA) to apply a sinusoidal current to the scalp, directly interacting with the
      oscillating cortical activity at a given frequency with a given stimulus intensity. Studies
      have shown that simultaneous tACS on the left prefrontal lobe and left temporal lobe can
      significantly improve working memory in healthy older adults. The 40 Hz tACS is gamma
      oscillation, and more and more studies have pointed out that gamma oscillation regulation
      disorder is associated with impaired working memory function.CCT can improve the cognition in
      patients with MCI. We hypothesized that tACS combined with CCT can produce synergistic
      effects in sensitive brain areas.
