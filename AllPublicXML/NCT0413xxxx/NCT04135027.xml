  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The course of Crohn's disease (CD) varies considerably between patients, but reliable
      prognostic markers are not available in clinical practice. Even though several parameters
      have been associated with prognosis in CD—including clinical features, serology and genetic
      variants—none are sufficient to guide therapy in clinical practice. Trying to find out the
      mechanisms influencing the effectiveness of treatments and develop a personalized therapy is
      an urgent problem in the era of biologics as the investigators now have a growing
      armamentarium of IBD therapies. Several scientists found that the levels of T cells subsets
      ratio and inflammation cytokines were significantly increased in the intestinal mucosa and
      serum in active IBD patients, whereas mucosal innate lymph cells had specific effects in
      inflammation. However the studies about the differences of lymph cell levels between
      subgroups of IBD patients and their relationships with effectiveness of treatments are
      relatively rare. Based on above, the investigators plan to recruit patients newly diagnosed
      and suspicious of Crohn's disease, keep track of their therapy and response, collect their
      blood sample at specific points of time, to investigate the mechanisms of heterogeneity of
      therapy effectiveness.

        Patients aged 18-80 years old, newly diagnosed or suspicious of Crohn's disease according
        to WHO criteria for Crohn's disease, who were not receiving concomitant corticosteroids,
        immunomodulators or biological therapy, were recruited from a specialist IBD clinic. A
        stable dose of topical or oral 5-ASA was permitted if patients had been diagnosed
        previously.
