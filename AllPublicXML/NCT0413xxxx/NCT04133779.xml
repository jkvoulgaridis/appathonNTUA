  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicentre observational study which involves 43 of the major Italian centres that
      treat MS. The duration expected for the study participation of each subject was exclusively
      the necessary one for the screening visit and execution of the ecocolor-Doppler test, which
      could have also been executed on the same day.

    <measure>The presence of CCSVI</measure>
    <time_frame>29.12.2010-30.05.2012</time_frame>
    <description>The protocol provided that the presence of CCSVI was evaluated according to the Zamboni criteria at local level. Therefore, the ecocolor-Doppler images were sent in a randomized process to a central assessor who performed the first centralized reading. In case of disagreement with the local reading, the same images were to be sent to other two central readers, preserving the anonymity, in order to obtain a final evaluation in regards to the CCSVI presence.</description>

    <description>Age 18-55 years;
Unisex patients diagnosed with MS according to McDonald criteria and successive relapse (38, 39), and subjects with CIS;
Course of the disease: RR—SP—PP—CIS;
Disease duration (starting from diagnosis): from 1 month to 25 years for subjects with RR, SP, and PP; a maximum of 5 years for subjects with CIS;
Not in clinical relapse (at least 30 days after the last clinical relapse);
Subjects treated or non-treated with immunomodulatory and immunosupressive drugs;

The subjects included in this group could be, for example, unrelated relatives or spouses of those affected by MS or other diseases in the study, or linked to these by affinity restrictions (such as, the father-in-law with the son-in-law, the husband with his wife's brother, etc.) or accompanying persons or operators of other centres.</description>

    <description>For the subjects diagnosed with MS (group A), who did not need to be in a period of clinical relapse of the disease (at least 30 days from the last clinical relapse), the duration and the form of the disease was indicated (CIS, RR, SP or PP). The Investigator has submitted these subjects to a neurological examination which included the standard neurological examination, the Kurtzke EDSS (Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale) comprising the functional systems of Kurtzke and the Barthel scale. After completing the selection phase following the previous examinations, the subjects were directed towards the qualified practitioner for the ecocolor-Doppler examination which was performed in blind.</description>

    <description>For the subjects affected by OND and ONDi, as in the groups C and D respectively, the Investigator has performed, beside the anamnesis and the physical examination, a specific neurological evaluation which included the compilation of the Barthel scale for the disability evaluation. After completing the selection phase following the previous examinations, the subjects were directed towards the qualified practitioner for performing the ecocolor-Doppler examination which was performed in blind.</description>

After completing the selection phase following the previous examinations, the subjects were directed towards the qualified practitioner for the ecocolor-Doppler examination which was performed in blind.</description>
