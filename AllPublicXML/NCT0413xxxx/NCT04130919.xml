      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy of GS-4875 compared with
      placebo control in achieving clinical remission per modified Mayo Clinic score (MCS) in
      adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC).

          -  Males, or non-pregnant, non-lactating females, at least 18 years of age based on the
             date of the screening visit.

          -  UC of at least 3 months duration before randomization confirmed by endoscopy and
             histology at any time in the past AND a minimum disease extent of 15 cm from the anal
             verge. Documentation of endoscopy and histology consistent with the diagnosis of UC
             must be available in the source documents prior to the initiation of screening.

          -  Moderately to severely active UC as determined during screening by a centrally read
             endoscopy score ≥ 2, a Rectal Bleeding subscore ≥ 1, a Stool Frequency subscore ≥ 1
             and Physicians Global Assessment (PGA) of ≥ 2 as defined by the Mayo Clinic Score;
             total MCS must be between 6 and 12, inclusive.

          -  Previously demonstrated an inadequate response (primary non-response) or loss of
             response (secondary non-response) to a tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) inhibitor
             (ie, infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, or biosimilars). The induction treatment
             regimen resulting in inadequate response or loss of response should have been in
             accordance with local prescribing information/guidelines or as outlined below.

               -  Infliximab: 5 mg/kg at Weeks 0, 2, and 6

               -  Adalimumab: 160 mg on Day 1 (given in 1 day or split over consecutive days),
                  followed by 80 mg 2 weeks later (Day 15), 40 mg 2 weeks later (Day 29) and every
                  2 weeks thereafter until Day 57

               -  Golimumab: 200 mg on Day 1 followed by 100 mg at Week 2

          -  May be receiving concomitant therapy for UC at the time of enrollment as specified in
             the protocol, provided the dose prescribed has been stable as indicated prior to

               -  Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 60 ml/min (1.0 mL/sec) as
                  calculated by the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI)
                  Cystatin C formula as described in protocol.

               -  Hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL (≥ 80 g/L)

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 × 10^3/μL (≥ 1.5 GI/L)

               -  Platelets ≥ 100 × 10^3/μL (≥ 100 GI/L)

               -  White blood cells (WBC) ≥ 3 × 10^3/μL (≥ 3 GI/L)

               -  Absolute lymphocyte count ≥ 0.75 × 10^3/μL (≥ 0.75 GI/L)
