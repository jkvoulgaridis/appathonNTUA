      The AlloSure test is approved by the FDA for use in Medicare patients to assess the
      probability of allograft rejection in kidney transplant patients. The pivotal DART study
      discusses the use of the non-invasive AlloSure test to measure donor derived cell-free DNA
      (dd-cfDNA) and the Allosure test can by used to discriminate active rejection in renal
      transplant patients. Pancreas allograft rejection still remains a major clinical challenge
      and is a primary cause of death censored pancreas allograft loss. Pancreas transplant
      rejection is diagnosed by biopsy, however it is not commonly performed because of the
      complications such as pancreatic leak, graft loss and patient death. Currently at Rush
      surveillance biopsy of the pancreas are not performed routinely due to the above risks.

      At RUMC, patients are followed post-transplant with series of labs at set intervals that
      include lipase, DSA, C-Peptide, and GAD65 for surveillance of rejection

      The AlloSure test was introduced for routine use in kidney transplant recipients at Rush
      University Medical Center in October 2017, after FDA approval and then as part of the KOAR
      Study in May of 2018. AlloSure test has been included as part of the routine labs for
      surveillance of rejection in pancreas transplant recipients at RUMC since September 2018
      after it was approved for compassionate use. The addition of AlloSure has helped to improve
      surveillance of rejection in pancreas transplant recipients and has reduced the need for the
      kidney biopsy as a surrogate marker of rejection in the pancreas.

      Our goal is to determine if AlloSure can be used for surveillance for rejection in recipients
      of Simultaneous Pancreas and Kidney (SPK) Transplant recipients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective and retrospective cohort study of recipients of simultaneous pancreas
      and kidney transplant recipients (SPK).

      New SPK transplant recipients and previous SPK transplant recipients from September 2012 will
      be enrolled in the study, expected duration of participation will therefore range from a
      minimum of 1 year to a maximum of 5 years for each participant.

      The visits are incorporated into the current standard of care in our program and no extra
      visits are required. Mobile draw for AlloSure can be obtained if the patient is not due for a
      visit when the AlloSure draw is due.

      AlloSure labs will be drawn on all new SPK patients and results obtained as well as
      retrospective results that have already been received on past SPK recipients. The AlloSure
      will be added to the standard of care schedule for all SPK patients.

      The schedule will be the following:

      For newly transplanted patients, AlloSure will be checked at 14 days post-transplant

      For all subjects:

      From 1 month to 12 months post transplant: AlloSure will be obtained monthly with their
      transplant date as the reference time point

      From 12 months to 36 months: AlloSure will be obtained every 3 months

      From 36 months to 60 months: AlloSure will be obtained every 6 months.

      AlloSure may be obtained more frequently than the above schedule, with other clinical data or
      allograft biopsy, if there is graft dysfunction or suspicion for rejection.
