  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Childhood arthritis is an important cause of pain for affected children and youth
      (adolescents). Many youth with arthritis also have trouble sleeping. They often struggle to
      sleep through the night, wake up earlier, and are sleepier during the day compared to healthy
      children. Our research group, among others, has shown a strong link between sleep and pain.
      The main purpose of this study is to assess the impact of changing sleeping patterns on pain,
      and disease activity, in teenagers with arthritis. We think that better sleep will directly
      lead to better health.
