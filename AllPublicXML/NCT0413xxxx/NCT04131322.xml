      Loss of response of the Adalimumab biosimilar compared with the original drug.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A single-site Unicentric, randomized, parallel-group, non-inferiority open study including
      patients diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease and Ulcerative Colitis)
      who were in clinical remission with Adalimumab original for at least 6 months prior to the
      start of the study.

      A total of 216 patients with inflammatory bowel disease from the Inflammatory Unit of the
      Virgin Macarena University Hospital will be randomized 1:1 to receive the study drug,
      Adalimumab biosimilar (AMGEVITA®) subcutaneous 40mg every 15 days or maintain the original
      drug (Humira®) 40 mg subcutaneous every 15 days.

      The dosage of the medication will be administrated according to the product's approved label
      by SmPC (Summary of Product's Characteristics)by technical file. Administration will be
      accepted every 7 days, if the patient after inclusion criteria is included with intensified
      dose.
