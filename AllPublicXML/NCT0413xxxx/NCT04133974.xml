    <textblock>
      The study assessed the efficacy of a methadone-induced memory retrieval-extinction procedure
      on heroin craving and relapse. Male participants aged 18-55 years old and prescribed MMT to
      treat heroin dependence were included in the present study, and randomly assigned to receive
      methadone, or receive methadone plus 10 minutes plus extinction, or receive methadone plus 6
      hours plus extinction. The intervention persisted 3 times per week for 4 weeks. Then the
      subjects were followed up once a month for cue induced heroin craving and relapse.

    <textblock>
      In the present study, we explored the effect retrieval-extinction procedure on heroin craving
      and relapse in heroin addicts using the methadone (a commonly used µ-opioid receptor agonist)
      instead of heroin as the trigger to reactivate drug memories. The subjects were randomly
      divided into 3 groups, in which they received methadone alone or extinction sessions 10 min
      or 6 hours after methadone administration. The extinction sessions were given 3 times per
      week for 4 weeks, each lasted for 30 min. During the extinction procedure, the subjects were
      exposed to images, heroin paraphernalia and mimic heroin. Subjective craving, morphine urine
      test and physiological responses were recorded monthly for 4 months.

    <description>Drug memory is not invariably stable and can be induced transiently labile again by drug-related cues or drug itself, which is termed as 'reconsolidation'. Previously we and other groups have demonstrated that extinction coincided with reconsolidation weakened the drug memory and decreased drug craving and relapse. In the present study, we tried to interfere the methadone-induced heroin addiction memory reconsolidation by extinction given at different times following methadone administration.</description>
