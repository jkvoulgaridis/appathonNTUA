  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic anterior knee pain with a stable patella is often associated with overload and
      increased pressure on the lateral facet due to pathologic lateral soft-tissue restraints.
      &quot;Lateral pressure in flexion&quot; is a term describing the pathologic process of increasing
      contact pressure over the lateral patellar facet as knee flexion progresses. Eighty patients
      were involved in this study, and it was divided into 2 random groups; Group A (40
      patients)(odd number) were treated with open release after diagnostic arthroscopy and Group B
      (40 patients)(even number) were treated by arthroscopic release. All these patients are
      diagnosed as lateral patellar compression syndrome depending on clinical features, MRI and
      diagnostic arthroscopy. All patients were followed by Lysholm knee scaling score before
      surgery and two weeks , six weeks then 6 months after surgery.

      This study was done by two orthopedic surgeons working in three hospitals from March 2016 to
      April 2018, Eighty patients were involved in this study, and it was divided into 2 matched
      groups; Group A (40 patients) were treated with open release after diagnostic arthroscopy and
      Group B (40 patients) were treated by arthroscopic release. All these patients are diagnosed
      as lateral patellar compression syndrome depending on clinical features, MRI ( figure 1)and
      diagnostic arthroscopy. All patients were followed by Lysol knee scaling score before surgery
      , two weeks , six weeks then 6 months after surgery. The two groups are matched related to
      age and gender. 52 patients are females and age ranged from 21-48 years.

      Exclusion criteria are 1. Smoking 2.Patellar instability 3. D.M 4. Knee osteoarthritis 5.
      Previous knee surgery 6. Knee deformities involving Varus , valgus or recurvatum 7. Ligament
      laxity
