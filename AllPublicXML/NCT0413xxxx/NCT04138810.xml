  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative follow up is necessary following any surgical procedure and has been conducted
      in the same manner since the field of surgery began. The study will determine feasibility and
      patient satisfaction of innovative postoperative virtual clinical encounters utilizing mobile
      video conference technology for women undergoing pelvic reconstructive surgery through a
      randomized controlled trial.

    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective randomized control study comparing postoperative virtual clinical
      encounters versus traditional in-office postoperative visits in women undergoing pelvic
      reconstructive surgery. The postoperative experiences of both groups will be assessed via
      surveys. Virtual Clinical Encounter Group: - Receive video-conference call from office nurse
      48-72 hours post discharge from hospital - Receive video-conference call from fellow and/or
      attending physician approximately 30 days (4-6 weeks) from surgery -- Complete telephone
      survey one day later - Have in-office postoperative visit with fellow and/or attending
      physician approximately 90 days (10-12 weeks) from surgery -- Fill out surveys after office
      visit Traditional Office Group: - Receive telephone call from office nurse 48-72 hours post
      discharge from hospital - Have in-office postoperative visit with fellow and/or attending
      physician approximately 30 days (4-6 weeks) from surgery -- Complete telephone survey one day
      later - Have in-office postoperative visit with fellow and/or attending physician
      approximately 90 days (10-12 weeks) from surgery -- Fill out surveys after office visit

    <description>PSQ-18 is a validated eighteen item patient satisfaction questionnaire that has been utilized across diverse healthcare settings. It measures satisfaction across the following domains: general satisfaction, technical quality of care, interpersonal manner of healthcare provider, communication, financial aspects of care, time spent with healthcare provider and accessibility/convenience of care. Total scores range from 18 to 90, with higher scores indicating higher patient satisfaction.</description>

    <description>As per standard of care, all subjects will be scheduled for a nursing clinical encounter 48-72 hours following discharge from the hospital from their surgery. The VCE group will conduct their encounter via the videoconference section of the MyChart mobile applications. At the end of this nursing encounter, the office nurse will schedule the patient for a 30 day postoperative visit within 4 to 6 weeks after their surgery.</description>
