  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Using gene therapy to express active telomerase (hTERT) in humans has the potential to treat
      many of the age related diseases, including Aging itself.

      This study will entail treating subjects with hTERT delivered via transduction using AAV. The
      goal is to extend the telomeres to prevent, delay, or even reverse Aging.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects willing to participate who meet with the inclusion - exclusion criteria, will be
      treated with a single dose of LGT delivered intravascularly (IV).

      Baseline will be performed within 8 weeks of beginning the treatment regimen. The treatment
      regimen will begin with IV delivery of AAV-hTERT, defined as &quot;Day 0.&quot; Safety and efficacy
      analyses will be conducted at Weeks 1, 4, 13, 26, 39, and 52 post-treatment.

      Study objectives

      Primary: Safety and Tolerability

      1. Investigate the safety and tolerability of AAV-hTERT by intravenous (IV) administration.

      Secondary: Provisional Efficacy

        1. To determine changes from baseline in hTERT expression, telomerase activity, and
           telomere length in cells after treatment with AAV-hTERT.

        2. To determine changes from baseline in health and aging-related biomarkers after
           treatment with AAV-hTERT.

        3. To determine changes from baseline in the immune system after treatment with AAV-hTERT.

        4. To determine changes from baseline in physical function measures after treatment with
           AAV-hTERT

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects must meet the following inclusion criteria at the screening visit.

          1. Age of 45 years or older.

          2. Subjects, or their authorized representatives, must be adequately informed and
             understand the nature and risks of the study and must be able to provide a signature
             and date in the Informed Consent Form (ICF).

          3. Women must undergo a negative serum pregnancy test at the screening assessment.

          4. Subjects, or their representatives, must be able to communicate effectively with the
             study staff.

          5. Subjects, or their authorized representatives, must certify that they are able and
             willing to follow all protocol requirements and study restrictions.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects are not eligible for the study if they meet any of the following criteria at the
        screening visit, unless otherwise specified.

          1. Subjects who have a history of allergy, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to any
             medications, components, or excipients of the investigational product, which cannot be
             resolved by the staff conducting the study.

          2. Female subjects who are pregnant, expected to become pregnant, or lactating/nursing.

          3. Subjects who are sexually active and who are unwilling or unable to use a method of
             effective contraception (e.g., hormonal and/or barrier) during their participation in
             the study.

          4. Subjects who are intolerant of, or do not wish to receive, IV or IT injections.

          5. Subjects who are currently alcoholics and/or use psychoactive substances.

          6. Subjects who cannot tolerate venipuncture and/or venous access.

          7. Subjects who have donated or had a significant loss of whole blood (480 ml or more)

             screening assessment, or plan to participate in another clinical trial, while in this
             study if in the opinion of the principal investigator, may place the subject at risk
             due to participation in the study, or may influence the results of the study or the
             subject's ability to complete the study. If more than 30 days have passed since
             participation in another clinical trial, the study staff must ensure that the subject
             has recovered from any adverse event (AE) associated with the research product used.

         11. Subjects who have a history of any other clinically significant disease or disorder
             that, in the opinion of the principal investigator, may place the subject at risk due
             to participation in the study, or may influence the results of the study or the
             subject's ability to complete the study.
