    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a short course of radiation therapy is effective
      to treat rectal cancer in older patients. A shorter course of radiation treatment may be
      better tolerated than a longer course or surgery for the treatment of rectal cancer in the
      elderly.
