      This project aims to assess the short- and long-term safety and efficacy of bariatric surgery
      in children and adolescents compared to adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity affects children and adults across all age groups. More than 30% of children and
      adolescents in the United States are currently overweight or obese, whereas the prevalence of
      obesity is as high as 21.4% in young children.This increase in prevalence is associated with
      significant short- and long-term health implications and necessitates effective interventions
      that induce significant weight loss and ameliorate associated conditions.

      The results of weight loss surgery in children and adolescents are still scarce, despite
      recent studies suggesting favorable short- and intermediate-term outcomes that are comparable
      to those in adults. Although evidence continues to emerge, this solution is still denied to
      young children.

      Bariatric surgery has proven safety and efficacy in inducing significant weight loss and
      co-morbidity resolution in children and adolescents. However, long-term evidence in this age
      group is yet to be reported. This project aims to study long-term weight loss, cardiovascular
      risk factors, growth and morbidity in severely obese children and adolescents (aged 5-21
      years) who undergo laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG).

      This study aims to narrow the current evidence gap by studying the long-term effects of
      bariatric surgery in children and adolescents with severe obesity.
