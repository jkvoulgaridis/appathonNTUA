      This study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of vaporized alpha-pinene
      and THC administered via inhalation.

      The proposed study will be conducted at the Johns Hopkins Behavioral Pharmacology Research
      Unit (BPRU). Participants will complete 9 acute drug administration periods in which they
      will administer THC alone, pinene alone, THC and pinene together, or placebo. Subjective drug
      effects, cognitive performance, and vital signs will be assessed following drug
      administration. Each participant will receive all 9 dose conditions in a randomized order
      using a placebo controlled within-subject crossover design. The study will help the
      investigators understand the individual and interactive effects of THC and pinene, two common
      constituents found in cannabis.

          -  Blood pressure at Screening Visit does not exceed a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of
             150 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of 90 mmHg

          -  Have no allergies to any of the ingredients used to prepare vapor (THC, pinene).

          -  Demonstrate competency on cognitive performance measures at screening visit (e.g.,

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Non-medical use of psychoactive drugs other than, nicotine, alcohol, or caffeine 3
             month prior to the Screening Visit;

             psychiatric illness (e.g. psychosis) judged by the investigator to put the participant

             other study procedures.

          -  Use of an over-the-counter (OTC), systemic or topical drug(s), herbal supplement(s),
             or vitamin(s) within 14 days of experimental sessions; which, in the opinion of the
             investigator or sponsor, will interfere with the study result or the safety of the
             subject.

          -  Use of a prescription medication (with the exception of birth control prescriptions)
             within 14 days of experimental sessions; which, in the opinion of the investigator or
             sponsor, will interfere with the study result or the safety of the subject.

          -  Use of dronabinol (Marinol®) within the past month.

          -  Average use of cannabis more than 2 times per week in the prior 3 months.

          -  History of clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias or vasospastic disease (e.g.,
             Prinzmetal's angina).

          -  Abnormal EKG result that in the investigator's opinion is clinically significant.

          -  Enrolled in another clinical trial or have received any drug as part of a research
             study within 30 days prior to dosing.

          -  Having previously sought medical attention to manage adverse effects following acute
             cannabis use.

          -  Individuals with anemia or who have donated blood in the prior 30 days
