  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bifico (also known as &quot;bifidobacterium trifidum live powder&quot;) is a probiotic preparation that
      has been marketed and widely used in China. The number of live bacteria of lactobacillus
      acidophilus and bifidobacterium per gram should not be less than 1.0×107CFU. At present, it
      is mainly used for diarrhea and abdominal distension caused by intestinal flora imbalance. It
      can also be used for treating mild to moderate acute diarrhea and chronic diarrhea.
      Lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacteria have been fully proved in basic studies to
      improve gut microbiological environment and inhibit colorectal cancer. A recent paper
      published by Nature Biomedical Engineering reported that chemotherapy can effectively enhance
      the efficacy of colon cancer by regulating intestinal flora. Based on the above evidence, we
      propose that the current standard chemotherapy plus targeted therapy regimen combined with
      Bifico can exert a more powerful synergistic anticancer effect. To sum up, this study put
      forward innovative joint regulating intestinal flora environment with standard chemotherapy
      and target therapy of new concept and mode, to assess Bifico combined with standard
      chemotherapy plus targeted therapy compared to standard chemotherapy plus targeted therapy
      for efficacy and safety of metastatic colorectal cancer, combined with the intestinal flora,
      probiotics patient blood DNA analysis, etc. New technology, explore flora index correlation
      with the prognosis of patients' immune system function, and its potential as a predictive
      marker. It is worth noting that this study will closely combine the current most advanced
      intestinal flora 16S microbial polymorphism detection and single-cell sequencing technology,
      so as to truly achieve accurate and individualized treatment, evaluation and prognosis
      prediction.

      Patients were randomized to either standard therapy (i.e., chemotherapy + targeted therapy)
      or standard therapy combined with Bifico. We will provide patients with first-line,
      second-line and third-line treatment with full intervention, including maintenance treatment.
      The standard treatment regimen, first-line (FOLFOX regimen + cetuximab) : oxaliplatin 85mg/m2
      intravenous infusion 2 hours day1 + calcium leucofolate (LV) 400mg/m2 intravenous infusion 2
      hours day1 + 5-fluorouracil (5-fu) 400mg/m2 intravenous infusion day 1, and then 1200mg/
      (m2·day) ×2 days continuous intravenous infusion + cetuximab 500mg/m2 intravenous infusion
      over 2 hours day 1, repeat every 2 weeks. First-line treatment 4 to 6 months after the
      effective disease control or stable but still no radical surgery opportunity, can enter
      maintenance treatment: 5 - FU + LV (dose with a line), repeat every 2 weeks, or capecitabine
      oral 2 1250 mg/m2 / day day 1-14 + beacizumab 7.5 mg/kg intravenous day 1, repeat every 3
      weeks, or stop the systemic treatment, until a progression, and immediately to the next line
      treatment; Second-line (FOLFIRI regimen + bevacizumab) : irinotegam 180 mg/m2 iv infusion
      over 30-90min day 1 + LV 400mg/m2 iv infusion 2 hours day 1 + 5-fu400 mg/m2 iv infusion day
      1, then 1200mg/ (m2·day) ×2 days continuous intravenous infusion + bevacizumab 5mg/kg
      introvenious infusion day 1, repeat every 2 weeks. Third line: fuquinib 160mg oral 1/ day day
      1-21, repeat every 28 days, or regofenil 5mg oral 1/ day day 1-21, repeat every 28 days.
      Bifico 2g oral 3/ day, take the medicine daily.
