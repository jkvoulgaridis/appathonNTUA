  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is the first study in humans to evaluate the effectiveness of SJP-0132 in the treatment
      of dry eye disease. This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, efficacy, and
      pharmacokinetics of single- and multiple-dose regimens of SJP-0132 in subjects with dry eye
      disease
