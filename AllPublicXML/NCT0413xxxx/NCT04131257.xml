      The study aims to improve diabetes prevention, access to care and advocacy through a novel
      cost-effective nurse-led continuum of care approach that incorporates diabetes prevention,
      awareness, screening and management for low-income settings, and furthermore utilizes the
      endeavor to advocate for establishing standard diabetes program in Nepal.

      The purpose of this study will be to improve diabetes prevention, access to care and advocacy
      through a novel cost-effective nurse-led continuum of care approach that incorporates
      diabetes prevention, awareness, screening and management for low-income settings, and
      furthermore utilizes the endeavor to advocate for establishing standard diabetes program in
      Nepal.

      We will conduct a two-arm, open-masked stratified cluster randomized controlled trial of a
      NUrse-led COntinuum of care for people with diabetes and pre-diabetes (NUCOD), with primary
      care centers (Outreach centers and Government health posts) as a unit of randomization. NUCOD
      will be delivered through the trained diabetes nurses in the community to the intervention
      group and the outcomes will be compared to the enhanced usual-treatment group at 6 and 12
      months of the intervention. The primary outcome will be change in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c)
      level among diabetes and progression to type 2 diabetes among pre-diabetes, and
      implementation outcomes measured using the RE-AIM (reach, effectiveness, adoption,
      implementation, and maintenance) framework. Outcomes will be analyzed on an intention to
      treat basis.

      The results of this trial will provide information about the effectiveness of the NUCOD
      program in improving clinical outcomes for diabetes and pre-diabetes individuals, and
      implementation outcomes for the organization.

    <measure>Change in Blood Pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The blood pressure will be measured using mean of three measurements of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, using a Microlife automatic blood pressure measuring device</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>LDL and HDL will be measured using the elimination method (Dialab, Austria); triglyceride using GPO-PAP (Dialab, Austria); and total cholesterol using CHOD-PAP (Dialab, Austria)</description>

    <measure>Change in the &quot;Reach&quot; of people participating in the program</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Reach will be measured by the number of people participating in the program divided by the number of people eligible to be recruited into the program</description>

    <measure>Change in the &quot;Adoption at the patient level&quot; measured by the Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Adoption at the patient level will be measured by the proportion of people adherent to the clinical advice in lifestyle and self-care. These will be measured by the self-reported Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities scale. Five areas are assessed by the scale: Diet, Exercise, Blood-glucose testing, Foot care, and Smoking status. Scale of 0-7 is used. Higher the score better is the outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the &quot;Adoption at the patient level&quot; measured by the Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire will be used to measure patient perception of the treatment. It is composed of eight questions, each of which is scored by patients on a scale ranging from zero (e.g., &quot;very dissatisfied&quot;, &quot;very inconvenient&quot;) to six (e.g., &quot;very satisfied&quot;, &quot;very convenient&quot;). More satisfied the patient, better is the outcome.</description>

    <measure>Change in the &quot;Adoption at the clinic level&quot;</measure>
