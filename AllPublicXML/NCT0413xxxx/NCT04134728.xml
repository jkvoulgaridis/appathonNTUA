  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study (contRAst 3 [202018: NCT04134728]) is a Phase 3, randomized, multicenter,
      double-blind study to assess the safety and efficacy of GSK3196165 in combination with
      conventional (cs) DMARD[s]) or the treatment of adult participants with moderate to severe
      active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who have had an inadequate response to biologic (b)
      DMARD[s]) and/or JAK inhibitors. The study will consist of a screening phase of up to 6 weeks
      followed by 24 week treatment phase in which participants will be randomized in ratio of
      6:6:6:1:1:1 to GSK3196165 150 milligrams (mg) subcutaneously (SC) weekly,GSK3196165 90 mg SC
      weekly, sarilumab 200 mg SC every other week or placebo (three arms) respectively, all in
      combination with background csDMARD(s). At Week 12, participants in the three placebo arms
      will switch from placebo to active intervention (either GSK3196165 150 mg SC weekly,
      GSK3196165 90 mg SC weekly, or sarilumab 200 mg SC every other week). Participants who, in
      investigator's judgement will benefit from extended treatment with GSK3196165, may be
      included in the long-term extension study (contRAst X [209564: NCT04333147]). Any participant
      who does not transition into study 209564 will undergo a safety follow-up visit at Week 34
      (corresponding to 12 weeks after the last potential dose of sarilumab, at Week 22).

        Key inclusion criteria:

          -  &gt;=18 years of age

          -  Has had RA for &gt;=6 months and was not diagnosed before 16 years of age

          -  Has active disease, as defined by having both:*

               -  &gt;=6/68 tender/painful joints (tender joint count [TJC]), and

               -  &gt;=6/66 swollen joints (swollen joint count [SJC])

          -  Has had an inadequate response despite currently taking at least one and at the most
             two concomitant csDMARDs for at least 12 weeks, from the following:

               -  Methotrexate (MTX)

               -  Hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine

               -  Sulfasalazine
