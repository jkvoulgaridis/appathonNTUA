    <textblock>
      This early phase I trial studies how well transcranial direct current stimulation works in
      reducing pain in cancer patients with chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy.
      Transcranial direct current stimulation is used for patients with brain injuries such as
      strokes as well as for mental health issues such as depression and may help to control pain
      in cancer patients with chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in reducing
      chemotherapy induced painful peripheral neuropathy (CIPPN).

      Ia. Evaluate the change in pain scores Ib. Assess for changes in other symptoms (i.e
      insomnia, feeling of well-being, depression and anxiety).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the following with the treatment of tDCS:

      Ia. Assess for changes in using pain medications. Ib. Assess for changes in functioning
      (daily activities). Ic. Assess for changes in quality of life. Id. Assess for changes in
      neuropathy. Ie. Assess overall satisfaction with the tDCS treatment.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate tDCS treatment related side-effects.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo tDCS once daily (QD) over 20 minutes 5 days each week (Monday-Friday) for 3
      weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up weekly for 3 weeks and at 4-6
      weeks.
