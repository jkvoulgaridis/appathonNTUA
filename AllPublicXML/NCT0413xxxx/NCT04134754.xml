  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to better understand what causes Sudden Unexpected
      Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP). This study will enroll subjects from the University of Iowa
      Hospitals and Clinics (UIHC) Epilepsy Monitoring Unit (EMU) and Epilepsy Clinics. The
      investigators will analyze the effects of seizures on breathing, on the cardiovascular
      system, and on arousal. The investigators are studying these effects because some cases of
      SUDEP might be due, in part, to an inability to wake up or sense elevated carbon dioxide
      (CO2) levels when breathing is impaired. Subjects will be followed for ten years after
      enrollment to monitor their health.

      In this study, the investigators will only enroll adults with confirmed or suspected
      epilepsy; there is no control group. Patients admitted to the UIHC Epilepsy Monitoring Unit
      (EMU) for continuous VideoEEG will undergo video recordings of their face and body,
      electroencephalography (EEG), and electrocardiogram (ECG) as part of their normal clinical
      care. Research subjects will undergo noninvasive cardiorespiratory monitoring during their
      EMU stay for the purpose of correlating heart rate and breathing patterns with EEG patterns
      related to their seizures.

      Eligible subjects will undergo several respiratory tests. This may include sniffing and
      breath holding and breathing through tubes of different sizes. One test, called the
      hypercapnic ventilatory response (HCVR), will have you rebreathe a gas mixture of 6% carbon
      dioxide and 50% oxygen to look at how more you breath in response to the increase in carbon
      dioxide levels. The investigators will then measure how much more subjects breathe in
      response to the increase in carbon dioxide levels, and also how breathing feels at the end of
      the test. The investigators will analyze the relationship between the HCVR and
      cardiorespiratory changes from seizures. The investigators will also analyze the effect of
      seizures on the HCVR. The HCVR test will be done by our respiratory therapist during
      subjects' stay in the EMU.

      Some subjects will be asked to participate in repeat testing of the HCVR 3 more times as an
      outpatient over the next 2 years. Additional subjects will also be enrolled from the clinic
      and will also undergo HCVR testing 4 times over the 2 years. All subjects will agree to
      undergo an interview in person or by phone, email, or questionnaire annually for ten years.
      They will also provide consent for follow-up with a personal contact in the event of subject
      death, for the purpose of ascertaining whether the death was due to SUDEP.

    <description>Subjects will wear a nosepiece and breathe through a Y-valve that allows switching from room air to two 5-liter rebreathing bags pre-filled with 50% O2, 6% CO2, and balance N2. Ventilation and respiratory gases will be measured using a pneumotachograph and rapid gas analyzers (Ultima PFX pulmonary function/stress testing system, Medical Graphics Corp). In subjects who experience clinical seizure-like activity, we will repeat the HCVR. This repeat test will occur 2 or more hours after a generalized convulsive seizure (GCS). We will repeat the HCVR at least 30 minutes after a non-GCS. Finally, we may repeat the HCVR at least 18 hours after the last seizure (GCS or non-GCS). It is anticipated that some subjects may exhibit frequent seizures that necessitate the adjustment of this schedule. Subjects may also be asked to sniff, hold their breath, and breathe through tubes of different sizes.</description>
