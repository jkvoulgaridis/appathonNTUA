  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is a communal malignant disease between Saudi females, with a popularity of
      21.8%. Since binding to somatostatin receptors (SSTR) induces no immunogenicity in vivo,
      somatostatin analog (veldoreotide) (VELD) may be suitable for delivering anti-cancer drugs to
      target and bioimaging the cancer cells. This work aimed to deliver CdS/ZnS core-shell type
      quantum dots with carboxylic acid-functionalized (QDs-COOH) which is bioimaging and
      anticancer nanoparticles decorated VELD as SSTR agonist with anti-cancer activity in the form
      of topical cream to be deposited deep in the breast periphery.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      QDs-COOH will be conjugated to the N terminal of phenylalanine of VELD when the reaction
      proceeded at pH 7. Topical cream will be adapted to deliver the conjugated system for maximum
      deposition through breast cancer cells using emulsion technology. The formulated
      nanoparticles and cream will be characterized for size using dynamic light scattering,
      drug-polymer interaction using FTIR, and morphology using SEM. Cellular uptake, permeability
      and cell viability study of the successful system of interest will be studied in cell culture
      models using different breast cell lines. Moreover, the in vivo study will also proceed on
      rats induced breast cancer. Finally, the nanoparticles loaded in a topical cream will be
      applied with clinical trial approvement on the human breast cancer for bioimaging and
      treating breast cancer. This work is to present a novel formulation for treatment and
      bioimaging of breast cancer which can deliver safely to the patients in a high dose to the
      affected tumor cells.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Women, 25 to 60 years old.

             cancer in any specimen;

             exception of cutaneous basal cell carcinoma and cervical in situ carcinoma that has
             been healed. In other instances, investigators do not feel the topics are acceptable
             for study participants.

         10. Pregnant or lactating women (women of childbearing age should receive a negative
