      The purposes of this study are: 1) to determine the mechanisms responsible for the
      development of cardiometabolic complications in some, but not all people with obesity; 2)
      determine the best dietary approach for cardiometabolic health; and 3) understand why some
      people have a stable metabolic phenotype over time whereas cardiometabolic health improves or
      worsens in others.

    <textblock>
      Excess adiposity causes alterations in metabolic function including impaired glucose
      homeostasis and insulin resistance, which are important risk factors for type 2 diabetes
      (T2D) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Not all people with obesity experience the typical
      metabolic complications associated with obesity. Approximately 25% of people with obesity are
      protected from the adverse metabolic effects of excess fat accumulation and are considered to
      be metabolically healthy based on their normal response to insulin. The mechanism(s)
      responsible for the differences in metabolic function among people with obesity is not known,
      but is likely to be multifactorial including dietary intake. The risk for developing T2D and
      CVD is also well known to increase with age, however, not all people that are metabolically
      healthy convert to a metabolically unhealthy phenotype over time. The mechanisms responsible
      for the stability of health status in some, but not all adults, are unclear. The overall
      goals of this study are to: i) determine the mechanisms responsible for the development of
      cardiometabolic complications in participants who will be carefully characterized into 3
      distinct groups [metabolically normal lean, metabolically normal obese and metabolically
      abnormal obese], ii) to determine the optimal dietary approach for cardiometabolic health
      independent of weight change in people with metabolically abnormal obesity, and iii) perform
      a comprehensive longitudinal assessment of cardiometabolic health to understand why some
      people have a stable metabolic phenotype over time whereas cardiometabolic health improves or
      worsens in others.
