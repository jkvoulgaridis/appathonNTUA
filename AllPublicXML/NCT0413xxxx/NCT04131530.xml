  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (pCLE) is an endoscopic technique that enables to
      evaluate the inflammation activity of ulcerative colitis with excellent correlation with
      histopathology. However this requires much experience, which limits the application of pCLE.
      The investigators designed a computer-aided diagnosis program using deep neural network to
      make diagnosis automatically in pCLE examination and contrast its performance with
      endoscopists.
