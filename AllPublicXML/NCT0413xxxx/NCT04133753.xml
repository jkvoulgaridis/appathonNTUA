  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized clinical trial of an intervention to improve outcomes for patients
      and their family by using ICU nurse facilitators to support, model, and teach communication
      strategies that enable patients and their families to secure care in line with patients'
      goals of care over an illness trajectory, beginning in the ICU and continuing to care in the
      community.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The impact of critical illness is increasing due to an aging population as well as advances
      in effectiveness and availability of critical care. Critically ill patients and their
      families suffer a high burden of symptoms of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress
      due, in part, to fragmented medical care that is often poorly aligned with their goals.
      Fragmented care includes numerous transitions for patients and families across clinicians and
      across settings, starting in the intensive care unit (ICU) and extending to acute care,
      skilled nursing facilities, or home. As illness progresses, patients and families struggle to
      navigate the spectrum of goals of care, to match their values and goals with treatments, to
      communicate their goals to their clinicians, and to make difficult medical decisions without
      letting unmet emotional needs interfere. Poor communication exacerbated by these transitions
      compounds an already stressful experience, causing distress to patients and their families.
      Taken together, these issues lead to ineffective communication during and after the ICU which
      can often result in high intensity &quot;default&quot; care that may be unwanted.

      Using a randomized trial, this project aims to evaluate an innovative model of care in which
      ICU nurse facilitators support, model, and teach communication strategies that enable
      patients and families to secure care in line with their goals over an illness trajectory,
      beginning in the ICU and continuing into the community. Facilitators use communication
      skills, attachment theory, and mediation to improve: 1) patients' and families' self-efficacy
      to communicate with clinicians within and across settings; 2) patients' and families' outcome
      expectation that communication with clinicians can improve their care; and 3) patients' and
      families' behavioral capability through skill building to resolve barriers to effective
      communication and mediate conflict. Facilitators work with seriously ill patients and their
      families beginning with a critical care unit stay and following them over the course of three
      months.

      The intervention's effectiveness will be measured with patient- and family-centered outcomes
      at 1-, 3-, and 6-months post-randomization. The primary outcome is family members' burden of
      symptoms of depression over the 6 months. The investigators also evaluate whether the
      intervention improves the value of healthcare by reducing healthcare costs while improving
      patient and family outcomes. Finally, investigators use qualitative methods to explore
      implementation factors (intervention, settings, individuals, processes) associated with
      improved implementation outcomes (acceptability, fidelity, penetration) to inform
      dissemination of this type of intervention to support patients and their families. This study
      aims to address key knowledge gaps while evaluating a methodologically rigorous intervention
      to improve outcomes for patients with serious illness and their families across the
      trajectory of care and the spectrum of goals of care.

    <measure>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) - family</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Family member symptoms of depression and anxiety assessed with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), which has become standard for ICU and post-ICU studies. The HADS is a reliable and valid 14-item, 2-domain (anxiety and depression) tool used to assess symptoms of psychological distress. Seven items evaluate anxiety and seven evaluate depression. Each item is scored on a 4-point scale (ranging from 0-3) with scores for each subscale (anxiety and depression) ranging from 0-21. HADS has been used in over 700 studies with evidence of reliability, validity and responsiveness among critically ill patients and their family.</description>

    <measure>Goal-concordant care (SUPPORT items) - patient and family</measure>
    <time_frame>1-, 3-, and 6-months after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Concordance between the care patients want and the care they are receiving will be measured with two questions from the SUPPORT study. The first defines patients' preferences: &quot;If the patient had to make a choice at this time, would the patient prefer a course of treatment focused on extending life as much as possible, even if it means having more pain and discomfort, or would the patient want a plan of care focused on relieving pain and discomfort as much as possible, even if that means not living as long?&quot; The second question assesses perceptions of current treatment using the same two options. The outcome is a dichotomous variable of whether the preference matches the report of care received. Although this creates a &quot;false dichotomy&quot; in that many patients want both, this &quot;forced choice&quot; helps identify patients' top priority. Based on prior studies, we expect only 50-60% of controls will report goal-concordant care.</description>

    <measure>PTSD Checklist-Civilian (PCL) - Post-traumatic Stress Symptoms - patient</measure>
    <time_frame>1-, 3-, and 6-months after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>The PTSD Checklist-Civilian (PCL) uses 17 self-report items to assess the intrusive, avoidant, and arousal PTSD symptom clusters. Responses are recorded on a 5 points scale that ranges from &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;extremely&quot;. The measure can be scored continuously or for symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of PTSD. The measure is reliable and valid across diverse populations. It has also demonstrated responsiveness in a randomized trial of stepped collaborative care for trauma survivors.</description>

    <description>We will use the Perceived Health Competence Scale (PHCS), an 8-item questionnaire assesses family self-efficacy, outcome expectations, and behavioral capacity for healthcare. It has been used to predict health behaviors and outcomes in older adults, people with chronic disease, women with breast cancer, and patients in dialysis. It has internal consistency reliability from 0.82-0.90. Construct validity was supported with a single factor structure underlying the total score and concurrent validity was supported by significant correlations with health status. It is a mediator of psychosocial outcomes and found to be an important explanatory variable linking access to information and psychosocial health outcomes.</description>

In-person contacts include visits to patients' homes and/or care facilities; phone contacts include calls to patients, families and clinicians. Patients and families have access to facilitators through phone and email. Facilitators may attend clinic visits with patients. In addition to checking directly with patients/families during regular contacts, facilitators also access the electronic health record to ensure they have accurate information about appointments and treatment plans and to document key points for the clinical team. Facilitators encourage referral to inpatient or outpatient palliative care services when needs are identified.</description>
