  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects are divided into two groups, (1) Control (Ctrl) and (2) Smart Exercise (SE) group.
      Ctrl group are instructed to maintain their daily life. SE participants are instructed to do
      exercise with smart exercise system twice per week for 12 weeks. The physical fitness tests
      and questionnaire of both group are performed before and after the 12-week exercise program.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The smart exercise system contain an upper extremity cycle ergometer (UEE) and a lower
      extremity cycle ergometer (LEE). SE group are instructed to do once session of UEE and once
      session of LEE per week, 30 minute per session, lasting for 12 weeks. Before each exercise,
      the physiological parameter are measured to ensure safety. During exercise, heart rate of
      user and revolutions per minute (RPM) of the ergometer is detected per second. After each
      session of exercise, the rating of perceived exertion (RPE) of user is also inquired and
      recorded.

Do you often get bored? YES/ no
Do you often feel helpless? YES/ no
Do you prefer to stay at home rather than going out and doing new things? YES/ no
Do you feel pretty worthless the way you are now? YES/ no When using the 5-item GDS two or more answers in capitalization, are suggestive of a depression warranting further assessment.</description>

    <description>EQ-5D is a standardized instrument with 5-item questionnaire for measuring generic health status. EQ-5D was first introduced in 1990 by the EuroQol Group. In which health status is measured in terms of five dimensions (5D); mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Rated level can be coded as a number 1, 2, or 3, which indicates having no problems for 1, having some problems for 2, and having extreme problems for 3. As a result, a person's health status can be defined by a 5-digit number, ranging from 11111 (having no problems in all dimensions) to 33333 (having extreme problems in all dimensions).</description>
