  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over 90% of people living with dementia (PLWD) experience behavioural and psychological
      symptoms of dementia, including apathy, depression, sleep disruptions, wandering, repetitive
      behaviours and anxiety. These symptoms can result in poor quality of life, burden for
      caregivers, and an increased risk for physical abuse of PLWD.

      This study aims to evaluate the acceptability, feasibility, and efficacy of a reminiscence
      therapy intervention using virtual reality technology, to reduce symptoms associated with
      dementia in older adults. Further, the investigators will assess if the intervention improved
      the quality of life of participants and the relationship between the person living with
      dementia and their caregiver.

      Background: Over 90% of people living with dementia (PLWD) experience behavioural and
      psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) including apathy, depression, sleep disruptions,
      wandering, repetitive behaviours and anxiety. BPSD can also result in poor quality of life,
      burden for caregivers, and an increased risk for physical abuse of PLWD. Incorporating the
      family caregiver into the plan of care may improve satisfaction and lower the burden
      associated with providing care for PLWD in a nursing home. New evidence suggests limited
      benefits of pharmacological interventions and increased risks for adverse events for PLWD.
      Results from systematic reviews suggest that Reminiscence Therapy (RT) has positive outcomes
      for people with dementia, such as elevated mood, improved cognition and enhanced behaviours.
      An additional systematic review indicates there are significant benefits of using information
      communication technology (ICT) for RT interventions. Virtual reality (VR) is emerging as a
      promising non-pharmacological approach for reducing symptoms of dementia and allows for
      tailoring of technological intervention to the user. To our knowledge, VR scenarios have
      never been developed as a RT intervention for PLWD and their caregiver.

      Purpose and Objectives: The purpose of this innovative, interdisciplinary study is to design
      and test a VR technological intervention with older adults with dementia and their
      caregivers, guided by RT. The main research question is: Can a tailored VR intervention
      reduce BPSD among PLWD and improve the caregiving relationship? Study objectives are to: (1)
      interview caregiving dyads to collect historical data to create tailored VR interventions
      using iterative design process; (2) test VR intervention with the caregiving dyads to assess:
      (a) impact on BPSD among PLWD and quality of the relationship between the PLWD and their
      family caregiver; and (b) impact of the intervention on family caregiver outcomes.

      Study Design: The proposed feasibility (repeated measure design) study will be conducted in
      two phases and will include qualitative and quantitative data collection.

      In PHASE 1 (design), 5 PLWD and their family caregiver will participate in 2-3 interviews
      which will be used to generate their personalized VR scenarios.

      In PHASE 2 (testing), the tailored VR sessions from phase 1, will be used as a weekly
      intervention with each caregiving dyad over 10 weeks. Each tailored session will be 30
      minutes in length. Participants will be positioned beside each other in stabilizing chairs,
      both wearing the 3D glasses, and viewing the same scenario.

      Participants will be evaluated at 4-time points [week 1 (baseline), week 5
      (mid-intervention), week 10 (conclusion of intervention) and week 15 (5-week follow up)].
      Using previously validated measures, participants living with dementia will be assessed on:

        1. Behavioural or psychological symptom of dementia (Neuropsychiatric Inventory-
           Questionnaire)

        2. Perceptions of person-centred care (Person-centered Climate Questionnaire-patient
           version)

        3. Quality of Life (World Health Organization Quality of Life Instrument)

      Family Caregiving participants will be assessed on:

        1. Caregiving experience (A. Caregiver Reaction Scale, and B. Modified Caregiver Strain
           Index)

        2. Quality of Life (World Health Organization Quality of Life Instrument)

    <intervention_model_description>We will select 5 people living with dementia and their family caregiver. All participants will participate in developing their own tailored VR scenario and receive a weekly VR intervention (30 minutes) over a period of 10 weeks.
Participants (i.e. person living with dementia, family caregiver) will complete outcome measures at baseline (week 1), mid-intervention (week 5), the conclusion of intervention (week 10), and 5-weeks following the intervention (week 15).</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Caregivers will complete the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Questionnaire (NPI-Q). This is a self-administered scale that is completed by the family caregiver. The scale has 12 items (dichotomous response) related to the behavioral or psychological symptoms of dementia. If the respondent indicates 'Yes,' a symptom is present, they are asked to rate the severity and distress. The severity of the symptoms is rated on a 3 point scale (mild, moderate, severe) over the last three months, and Distress is measured on a 5 point scale (no distress, minimal, mild, moderate, severe, very severe) indicating the amount of distress on the caregiver. The individual items are added together for an overall Severity and Distress score (minimum score 0- maximum score 96). Higher scores reflect worsening behavioural/psychological symptoms of dementia and increased caregiver distress.</description>

    <description>Participants living with dementia will complete the Person-Centered Climate Questionnaire (patient version). The Person-Centered Climate Questionnaire (patient version) measures the extent to which the psychosocial environment of a setting is perceived as being person-centred. The tool has 17 items in which respondents are asked to agree or disagree by selecting an answer on a 6 point scale, from &quot;No, I disagree completely&quot; to &quot;Yes, I agree completely.&quot; The items are added together for an overall score, with a minimum scale score of 0 and a maximum scale score of 85. Higher scores reflect a more person-centred environment.</description>

    <description>Participants living with dementia will complete the World Health Organization Quality of Life Instrument (Brief). The World Health Organization Quality of Life Brief Instrument measures the quality of life through the following four domains and two overall health and quality of life items: physical health, psychological, social relationships, and environment. The four domain scores are scaled in a positive direction with higher scores indicating a higher quality of life. There are three items that are reversed scored. The possible raw score ranges for each domain are as follows: Physical Health =28, Psychological =24, Social Relationships =12, and environment =32.</description>

    <description>Caregivers will complete the Caregiver Reaction Scale. The Caregiver Reaction Scale is a brief self-report measure, containing 8 subscales related to multiple dimensions of caregiving: caregiver's role captivity, overload, relational deprivation, caregiving competence, personal gain, family beliefs and actions and employment. The scale has a total of 54 items, which are scored on a 4-point scale where 1=not at all and 4 = completely. Scores for each subscale are averaged, with higher mean scores indicated high levels of negative and positive experiences. Subscales scores are interpreted independently.</description>

    <description>Caregivers will complete the Modified Caregiver Strain Index. The tool has 13 items that measure strain related to care provision, and it measures the following domains: financial, physical, psychological, social, and personal. Each item is scored on a 3 point scale (yes [2 points], sometimes [1 point], no [0 points'). Scores range from 0 to 26, and a higher score indicated a higher level of caregiver strain.</description>
