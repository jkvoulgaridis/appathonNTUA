  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to investigate the efficiency of pain relief and the safety of
      NPC-06 for the acute pain in herpes zoster in the placebo-controlled double-blind parallel
      group trial, in addition to explore the effective concentration of NPC-06.
