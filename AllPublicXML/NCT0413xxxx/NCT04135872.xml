      This registration enrolled patients with acute ischemic stroke within 72 hours after stroke
      ictus. Patients was identified as first-ever stroke based on past medical histrory. Admission
      CT was conducted to exclude hemorrhagic stroke, but not those bleeding transformation after
      ischemia injury. Baseline characteristics, including demographics, vascular risk factors, lab
      tests and neuroimagings were collected. Patients were followed up for cognitive assessments.

      This is a perspective stroke registry cohort study. Stroke patients were included if ：(1)
      acute first-ever ischemic stroke and admitted within 72 hours after onset; (2) clinical
      stroke diagnosis was confirmed with positive diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging
      (DW-MRI), those with isolated posterior circulations infarcts were exclude ; (3) presented
      with mild stroke severity ( admission NIHSS score ≤5); (4) age between 40 and 80 years.

      Clinical data including demographic characteristics, risk factors, and baseline NIHSS score
      were assessed and collected using a standardized table by experienced neurologists. Lab tests
      were performed with fasting venous blood samples within 18 hours of admission.

      Patients were followed up for 6 months. The cognitive functions were assessed using the
      Chinese version of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).

      Contributing factors to post-stroke cognitive impariment (PSCI) were determined by comparing
      clinical data between PSCI and non-PSCI groups. All potential confounders were introduced
      into the multivariate regression models.
