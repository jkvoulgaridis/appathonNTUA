  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being undertaken in order to enhance our understanding how human airways are
      being constricted in healthy people and in individuals with asthma. There is an unmet need
      for identification of new pathways (mediators) related to enhanced constriction of the
      asthmatic airways that would reveal new targets for therapy. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is
      a naturally occurring bioactive lipid molecule that has been suggested to play an important
      role in asthma. Physiologically, S1P can be detected in human blood but local tissue
      concentrations (for example in the lung) are very low. Upon activation many cells can secrete
      S1P. Increased concentrations of S1P have been detected in airways of asthmatic subjects
      after allergen inhalation. When studied in animal models, S1P did not cause contraction of
      airways in healthy animals but contracted airways in animal with pulmonary inflammation. In
      laboratory experiments S1P has been shown to be a potent constrictor of cells responsible for
      contraction of human airways. As yet, however, we lack evidence that S1P actually causes
      constriction of airways in real life. Establishing S1P as a molecule capable of causing
      airway constriction in humans and perhaps specifically in asthmatics will have important
      implications for our understanding of physiological and pathophysiological responses in human
      airways and could open new windows for therapeutic strategies in diseases like asthma.
