  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      YES! We can PLAY: A Physical Activity and Nutrition After-School Program for 6th Graders, is
      a collaborative partnership between the University of Alabama at Birmingham and the
      Birmingham City Schools District to decrease health disparities in obesity and
      obesity-related diseases by increasing physical activity levels and healthy eating behavior
      among Birmingham youth. Because physical activity levels often decline as students transition
      to middle school, the proposed program seeks to impact the sports readiness of students by
      providing opportunities for 6th graders to participate in 60 minutes of daily moderate to
      vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Beginning with 6 middle schools, we aim to expand to 11
      schools by the end of this project. Through the daily after-school program in which children
      choose from a menu of sports programming that changes every 8 weeks, the proposed
      intervention will increase physical literacy of the students through education related to
      both physical activity and nutrition as well as social-emotional learning which will increase
      students' ability to integrate the information and activities of the program into their lives
      moving forward.

    <intervention_model_description>This research study uses a cluster randomized design between 2 groups with one randomized experimental group and one randomized comparison group. We will randomly select students to the experimental group from all the students that choose to participate in the intervention schools. For the control group, we will randomly select students from comparison schools that do not participate in the intervention. Wave 1 comparison schools (2 Schools) have a total of 267 6th graders, and 84 students will be randomly selected to participate in the comparison group and will have measurements taken at baseline and 6 months.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>In Fall of 2019, all 6th graders in Wave 1 intervention schools (6 schools), which include 561 total 6th graders, will be invited to participate the intervention. Of those who choose to participate in the intervention, we will randomly select 84 students to participate into the experimental group. Those in the experimental group will complete all measures according to the timeline. Those not in the experimental group will also complete the intervention, but will not participate in measurements. In Fall 2020 all 6th graders who attend the Wave 2 intervention schools (schools that were the control schools in 2019), will be invited to participate the intervention. Of those who choose to participate, 84 will be randomly selected into the experimental group. Those in the experimental group will complete all measures on schedule.</description>

    <intervention_name>Sports Readiness Intervention</intervention_name>
    <description>Sixth graders will participate in a 6 month after-school program in which each daily session will last 90 minutes, 60 minutes of which will be moderate to vigorous physical activity. Two sports tracks will be offered during each 8-week season, and children will choose which they prefer. Coaches will be trained through a one day capacity building session and will receive online training throughout the program. Coaches will integrate sports readiness/physical activity programming, nutrition and healthy eating, and social emotional learning into the program with a focus on habit formation. A text-based platform will be utilized to encourage habits learned in the active portion of the program during June and July as well as on weekends during the intervention. Parents will be sent fliers weekly summarizing concepts addressed, and will be invited to cooking classes to watch students compete.</description>
