      PROMETEO II is a single-arm window of opportunity trial to evaluate biologic and
      anti-proliferative effects of palbociclib and letrozole in HR+/HER2-negative operable breast
      cancer (BC) patients with residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and help to
      identify biomarkers for better patient selection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm window of opportunity trial to evaluate biologic and anti-proliferative
      effects of palbociclib and letrozole in HR+/HER2-negative operable BC patients with residual
      disease after NAC and help to identify biomarkers for better patient selection.

      The primary endpoint will be the Complete Cell Cycle Arrest (CCCA) determined by Ki67&lt;2.7%,
      centrally assessed at surgery after 4 weeks of palbociclib and letrozole.

      Tumor measurement will be performed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for disease
      evaluation at screening at the end of NAC. The biopsy after chemotherapy will only be done if
      the tumor is equal or larger than 1 cm in its greatest diameter by MRI. Ki67% ≥ 10% after NAC
      by local determination will be necessary to be included in the study.

      Patients will be administered palbociclib at a dose of 125 mg once daily, day 1 to day 21
      followed by 7 days off treatment in a 28-day cycle and letrozole: oral, 2.5 mg per day
      continuously, one cycle of treatment.

      After finalization of the neoadjuvant treatment, patients will undergo surgery. Surgery
      specimens will be collected for histological examination and biomarker analysis

      The end of the study is defined as the date of post-surgery visit and will take place 4 weeks
      (+/- 7days) after the surgery in order to monitor the patient's safety and collect the
      surgery information.
