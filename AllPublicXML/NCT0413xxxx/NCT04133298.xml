    <textblock>
      This study evaluates laser de-epithelialized gingival graft to be as effective as
      subepithelial connective tissue graft in management of multiple gingival recessions using
      tunneling technique. half pf participants will be treated from gingival recession using
      tunneling technique with laser de-epithelized gingival graft, while the other half will be
      treated using tunneling technique with subepithelial connective tissue graft.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tunneling technique is a minimal invasive method for coronal advancement during gingival
      recession coverage. The technique provide better blood supply which enhances wound healing
      and results in successful root coverage and attachment gain. Tunneling technique is suggested
      to be incorporated with a soft tissue tissue for better recipient site outcome.

      In a systemic review and meta-analysis conducted in 2019 there was limited evidence available
      comparing subepithelial connective tissue graft to the de-epithelialized gingival graft.
      However the de-epithelialized gingival graft showed superior mean root coverage, keratinized
      tissue gain and clinical attachment gain over the subepithelial connective tissue graft
      making it the technique of choice when incorporated with coronal advancement flap in
      treatment of gingival recession. Laser de-epithelization may enrich the advantages of the
      conventional de-epithelization method where more uniform predictable epithelization can be
      obtained.

    <measure>Gingival Thickness gain</measure>
    <time_frame>6 month</time_frame>
    <description>it will be calculated based on volumetric difference of a defined area located on attached gingiva above the site to be corrected surgically, that is by taking a base line digital impression and superimpose it to another digital impression 6 month postoperatively. Buccal tooth surface will be used as a reference for the superimposition procedure. The digital measurements will be taken to nearest 0.01mm. Finally, gingival thickness gain will be calculated as the measured volume gain per measured area, [Gingival thickness gain (mm) = volume (mm3) / area (mm2)].</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean root coverage and percentage</measure>
    <time_frame>6 month</time_frame>
    <description>it will be calculated digitally by comparing base line digital impression to a 6 month postsurgical digital impression. A digital ruler will be used to measure the distance from gingival margin to the cemento-enamel junction on a point mid-buccally pre-surgically then post-surgically. The digital measurements will be taken to nearest 0.01mm.
Mean of root coverage and its percentage will be calculated. Mean root coverage will be measured in millimeters and percentage in percent.</description>

    <description>Patients will be evaluated six montsh post-operative about five variables. These variables are: level of the gingival margin, marginal tissue contour, soft tissue texture, mucogingival junction alignment, and gingival color.</description>

    <measure>Post-operative pain score</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be questioned in arabic after two weeks post-operative to assess pain, number of analgesic pills taken and number of days pills were taken. That will be assessed by visual analog scale (VAS) graduated from one to ten, where one indicates minimal pain and ten refers to severe pain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be questioned in arabic about the palatal wound after two weeks of the surgery. The questionnaire will include four graduated visual analog scales to describe pain intensity, hemorrhage intensity, fear of jeopardizing the palatal wound, their chewing ability, their willingness to perform the surgery another time if needed and their satisfaction about the esthetic outcome after the surgery. Graduation will be from one to ten, where one indicates minimal and ten refers to severe.</description>

    <description>After administration of local anesthesia. A single incision will be made to the bone in a horizontal direction 3mm apical to the gingival margin of the maxillary teeth. The length of the incision will be determined by the dimensions of the graft required. A partial-thickness dissection will be then made within the single incision aiming to harvest an average thickness of two mm subepithelial connective tissue. Then, the graft will be carefully elevated from the palate with the use of the blade. Primary closure will be obtained using 4-0 polyglycolic acid.</description>
