      Homeless youth have a much higher rate of substance use than non-homeless peers with evidence
      suggesting that homeless youth have the highest rates of opioid use among youth subgroups in
      the country (Brands et al., 2005); heroin using homeless youth also appear to have the
      highest rates of IV drug use and HIV (Rhoades et al., 2014). Given the high rates of opioid
      use, exposure to violence, mental and physical health challenges, and high rates of mortality
      in homeless youth, it is surprising that no study to date utilizes a randomized controlled
      design to test prevention of opioid and other drug use among this vulnerable population.
      Resolution of youth homelessness through housing and prevention services, often referred to
      as &quot;Housing First&quot;, as proposed in the current study, has great potential to reduce the
      likelihood for the development of an opioid use disorder as well as other problem behaviors
      associated with living on the streets. However, only 20-30% of homeless youth samples report
      ever having stayed at a crisis shelter, 9% report having ever accessed mental health
      services, and 15% report ever having received substance use treatment (Ray, 2006) indicating
      a need to reach and engage youth in services that are feasible and acceptable. This study
      will provide essential information for researchers and providers on the efficacy of housing +
      opioid and related risk prevention services in an RCT on opioid use, how moderators affect
      the response, and mechanisms underlying change.

      The overarching goal of this application is to evaluate a comprehensive intervention for the
      prevention of opioid use disorder and for increasing other resilient outcomes in this special
      population of high-risk young adults. Phase I of the study includes a nonrandomized pilot
      study with a sample of 21 youth to assess initial efficacy, feasibility of recruitment and
      acceptability of the housing + opioid and related risk prevention services. Upon meeting
      transition milestones, 240 youth will be randomized into housing + opioid and related risk
      prevention services versus opioid and related risk prevention services alone for Phase II. In
      this study, we seek to determine if adding housing to opioid and related risk prevention
      services yields a significant benefit above and beyond the benefit yielded by opioid and
      related risk prevention services alone. Phase II follow-up will be conducted at 3, 6, 9 and
      12-months post-baseline to assess stability of effects. Sample inclusion criteria,
      recruitment and screening will be identical for both phases, as described below. The unique
      components of Phase I and Phase II are then described separately.

      Sample Inclusion Criteria.

        1. We will include youth between the ages of 18 to 24 years. Our experience is that
           landlords will not accept leases signed by youth ages 16-17 years. &quot;Homeless youth&quot;
           commonly refers to those up to the age of 24 years (Robertson &amp; Toro, 1999; USICH,
           2010), thus, this age range generally reflects the age range of the homeless youth
           population served by providers across the country.

        2. Youth meets the criteria for homelessness as defined by the federal McKinney-Vento Act
           (2002) as &quot;lacking a fixed, regular, stable, and adequate nighttime residence&quot; and
           includes &quot;living in a publicly or privately operated shelter designed to provide
           temporary living accommodations, or a public or private place not designed for, or
           ordinarily used as, regular sleeping accommodations for human beings.&quot;

        3. Youth fails to meet DSM 5 criteria for Opioid Use Disorder as assessed by the SCID
           (First et al., 2015).

      Participant recruitment and sample availability. Columbus is ranked the 16th largest city in
      the U.S. Many consider Columbus a &quot;typical&quot; American city because of the mix of races, range
      of incomes, urban, suburban, and nearby rural areas. Columbus has one drop-in center for
      homeless youth between the ages of 14-24 years (founded by MPI Slesnick). Last year (2018)
      approximately 1200 unduplicated homeless youth between the ages of 14-24 years were served at
      the drop-in center, with 70-95% of homeless youth reporting problem substance use, similar to
      national samples (e.g., Baer et al., 2003). The single adult shelters have a total of 457
      beds for single men and 97 for single women on any given night. Service-connected youth will
      be recruited from the drop-in and adult shelters, non-service connected youth will be
      recruited through outreach to local soup kitchens, sandwich lines, the streets, parks and
      library. Given the high rates of homeless youth in Columbus, we do not anticipate any
      recruitment problems.

      Screening and intake. Project staff will maintain offices within the drop-in center. Youth
      who are engaged on the streets will be transported to the drop-in center. An RA will engage
      and screen youth to determine basic eligibility for the study. After the brief screening and
      stated interest in the project, written consent will be obtained and the Structured Clinical
      Interview for DSM-5 Disorders (SCID) (First, Williams, Karg, &amp; Spitzer, 2015) section on
      Opioid Use Disorder, will be administered to determine formal eligibility.

      Community Engagement. Too often, interventions do not reach those for whom the interventions
      were developed (Spoth &amp; Greenberg, 2005). Implementation science promotes the integration of
      research in to practice and policy, with implementation science studies often focused on
      investigating the bottlenecks that impede the uptake and adoption of interventions. Several
      calls have sought to transform translational science so that research supported interventions
      can quickly reach the targeted populations in need (Fogarty International Center, 2013), with
      the Institute of Medicine (IOM) noting that &quot;there is no time to lose&quot; (IOM, 1999). The IOM
      has emphasized a greater focus on engaging community stakeholders from the earliest phases of
      research, as such continuous involvement improves dissemination and uptake (Spoth &amp;
      Greenberg, 2005). Indeed, multiple guidelines and lessons learned from dissemination of
      evidence-based interventions have been published (e.g., Collins &amp; Sapiano, 2016). Standards
      for dissemination include that the program has the ability to go to scale, has training and
      technical support available, and a statement of the causal mechanisms relating the
      intervention to the outcome (Flay et al., 2005). This study will provide a solid base for the
      next step in translating research to practice and policy. At the end of the study, the
      materials and knowledge will be in place to conduct an effectiveness or broad-based
      dissemination effort.

      The Community Advisory Group, including homeless providers, homeless youth, landlords,
      substance use treatment experts and policy makers will meet throughout the project period,
      shaping study procedures, and easing transition of intervention to practice by the end of the
      study. Furthermore, Nationwide Children's Hospital (NCH) has led several large housing
      initiatives in the city, and MPI Kelleher's primary appointment is with NCH, where he works
      with the City, United Way and housing developers. Engagement will continue beyond the study
      period between researchers and community partners in order to support implementation of the
      prevention intervention. Also, at the end of the study period, a conference will be held at
      The Ohio State University to engage executive directors and their staff from drop-in centers
      from around the country, as well as other homeless youth researchers and providers.

      Phase I (UG3) Using the same recruitment strategy, eligibility criteria and assessment
      package (including stress biomarkers) as Phase II, a non-randomized pilot of the housing +
      opioid and related risk prevention services intervention (N = 21) will be completed in year
      1. The sample size of 21 reflects three months of recruitment of seven youth/month. All youth
      will receive the 6-month housing + opioid and related prevention services intervention. Youth
      will be assessed at baseline, 3 and 6-months using the proposed assessment battery, and
      qualitative interviews. The primary purpose of this phase is to document feasibility of
      recruitment, acceptability of the intervention, and initial pre-post change on targeted
      outcome measures. However, other activities, including creating a base of landlords to
      provide rentals to youth and initiating the Community Advisory Group, will also be a focus.
      As the housing + prevention services and assessment battery are identical in Phase 1 and
      Phase II, they are described in detail following the description of Phase II. Those aspects
      unique to Phase I are discussed immediately below.

      Phase I: Assessment of acceptability, feasibility and initial efficacy of the intervention.
      Several studies assess intervention acceptability, feasibility and initial efficacy using
      similar procedures to those described below (von Haastregt et al., 2007; Zlotnick et al.,
      2003). Acceptability of the intervention will be assessed by the retention of youths in the
      intervention, the total number of advocacy sessions attended, length of time remaining in
      project supported housing, and by the percentage of eligible youth who agree to participate
      in the study. In addition, the extent to which landlords consent to continuing participation
      in the second phase of the trial is essential. Assessment of feasibility includes
      documentation of 1) whether participants can be recruited, engaged, and maintained in the
      housing + opioid and related risk prevention services as proposed, data which can be obtained
      from RA screening forms and advocate records (meetings attended, maintenance of housing), and
      2) whether the timeline proposed for housing youths (anticipated to average 4 weeks, and time
      to housing will be tracked) and other intervention procedures can be maintained as proposed.
      In order to estimate initial efficacy, we will assess youth at baseline, 3 and 6-months to
      determine change in identified targeted outcomes (e.g. opioid and other substance use,
      homelessness and related problems). In addition to the quantitative analysis, qualitative
      interviews with each youth will provide a fuller understanding of the youths' response to the
      intervention.

      Phase I: Quantitative Analysis. Repeated measures ANOVA will be used to test the efficacy of
      the intervention (time effects). Three testing occasions (e.g., baseline, 3, and 6 months)
      will be the within-subject dependent variables. The primary outcome is opioid use, and
      secondary outcomes are listed below under &quot;dependent variables.&quot; It is predicted that there
      will be a main effect of time; youth will show reductions in opioid use, and improved
      functioning in other domains at post-intervention (6-months).

      Phase I: Qualitative Analysis. In order to increase our understanding of youths' response to
      the intervention such as experiences associated with differing levels of housing success and
      satisfaction with services, each youth at 6 months post-baseline will be interviewed
      regarding their experiences in the study. Supplementing the quantitative findings, interviews
      can provide better understanding of factors that promote engagement and success among youth
      as well as factors that prevented youth from successfully maintaining their housing.
      Additionally, qualitative data can help explain any unexpected findings, and provide a
      greater richness when reporting and interpreting the quantitative outcomes. Dr. Brittany
      Brakenhoff conducted a mixed methods study (funded by NIDA, R36DA041530) in which youth were
      interviewed regarding their perceptions of barriers to safe sex. She is an expert in
      qualitative methods and will lead the qualitative data collection. The qualitative portion
      will follow a phenomenological approach, which provides a framework for collecting and
      analyzing qualitative data as a way to better understand how youth experienced the
      intervention providing insight into youths' perceptions of whether they benefited from the
      intervention in a way that was meaningful to them (Creswell, 2012). Youth will be asked about
      their overall experience in the research study as well as their perception of how the
      intervention impacted their life. Youth will be asked to discuss aspects of the intervention
      they benefited from, aspects they did not find helpful, and how to make the intervention more
      helpful. All interviews will be independently coded by three members of the research team and
      discrepancies in coding will be discussed until an agreement is reached. NVivo 11 (QSR
      international) will be used to assist with coding. Member checking will provide additional
      verification of the results, a subsample of 5 youth who participated in the non-randomized
      pilot will be asked to review and provide feedback on the initial qualitative findings. While
      quantitative data can show whether participants changed their behavior, qualitative data can
      determine if those changes actually resulted in perceived meaningful improvements in the
      participants' lives.
