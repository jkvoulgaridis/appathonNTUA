             months prior to screening, including one in the last 6 months; A visual field test
             will be performed at screening if not already performed within the last 6 months prior
             to screening) in each eye.

          7. Post-washout IOP ≥ 22 mmHg in at least one eye (defined at baseline visit [Day 1] by

          8. Post-washout IOP ≤ 32 mmHg (defined at baseline visit [Day 1] by IOP measurement at
             both 9:00 am ±1 hour and 4:00 pm ±1 hour) in both eyes.

          9. Ability to discontinue their current topical IOP-lowering medication for the required
             washout period. Washout periods should be as follows;

               -  Prostaglandin analogs = 4 weeks

               -  Topical beta blockers ≥ 3 weeks and ≤ 4 weeks

               -  Topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors ≥ 5 days and ≤ 4 weeks

               -  All other IOP lowering medication ≥ 2 weeks and ≤ 4 weeks

         10. Snellen best corrected visual acuity score of 20/100 or better in each eye

         11. Patient must be willing to discontinue wearing contact lenses during the study.

         12. Adequate health for study participation as determined by the investigator

             complying with protocol requirements

         14. Patient must be willing and able to undergo and return for scheduled study-related
             examinations.

             glaucoma, and pigmentary glaucoma in either eye.

          2. IOP at any time point during the Screening or Baseline visits (Visits 1 or 2) of &gt; 32
             mmHg in either eye.

             in either eye or with an oral drug within 6 months prior to screening.

             applanation tonometer in either eye.

          5. Central corneal thickness ≤ 480 µm or ≥ 600 µm in either eye (historical data or at
             the screening visit).

          6. Significant visual field loss (absolute defect in the 10° central point or mean
             deviation worse than -12 dB) or progressive field loss during the year before
             screening in either.

          7. Significant optic nerve abnormality, other than glaucomatous abnormalities in the

             antagonists, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors and/or angiotensin II receptor
             blockers), unless the subject and the medication dosage have been stable for three

             the study.

         22. Anticipated change in dosage of or introduction of new medications for chronic
             cardiac, pulmonary or hypertensive conditions.

             not using a medically acceptable, highly effective method of birth control.

         24. Current enrolment in an investigational drug or device study or participation in such
             a study within 30 days prior to screening.

         25. History of drug or alcohol abuse.

         26. Patient has any condition or situation that, in the Investigator's opinion, might
             confound the results of the study, may put the patient at significant risk or might
