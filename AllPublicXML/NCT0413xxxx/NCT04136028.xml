    <textblock>
      &quot;Kineret&quot; (INN: Anakinra) neutralizes the biological activity of interleukin-1α (IL-1α) and
      interleukin-1β (IL-1β) by the concurrent inhibition of binding to interleukin-1 receptor I
      (IL-1RI). Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is the main pro-inflammatory cytokine that mediates many
      cellular responses. Anakinra inhibits the reactions caused by IL-1 in vitro, including the
      induction of nitric oxide and prostaglandin E2 and / or the formation of collagenase by
      synovial cells, fibroblasts and chondrocytes. According to published data, patients with the
      chronic granulomatous disease have an increased secretion of interleukin-1, which contributes
      to the development of granulomatous inflammation. Blocking interleukin-1 reduces the activity
      of the main pro-inflammatory complex - the inflammasomes, and also restores the autophagy
      process impaired in patients with chronic granulomatous disease. In this way, inhibition of
      the IL-1 receptor prevents the activation of innate immunity cells and prevents the
      maintenance of pathological pro-inflammatory signaling in conditions of IL-1 overproduction.
      The efficacy and safety of therapy with the above drug is based on the results of
      international studies on the using of anakinra in patients with chronic granulomatous
      disease.

      The research will include a group of patients with a molecular-genetic confirmed diagnosis of
      chronic granulomatous disease, which has granulomatous complications on the basis of an
      initial comprehensive survey.

      This examination will include clinical data; laboratory tests - clinical and biochemical
      analysis of blood (with an assessment of inflammatory activity); molecular-genetic methods
      for detecting mutations in the genes CYBB, CYBA, NCF2, NCF1 or NCF4; methods for studying the
      functional activity of neutrophils (chemiluminescence of neutrophils, test with rhodamine);
      methods for assessing pro-inflammatory interleukins; microbiological testing of
      bronchoalveolar lavage; histological studу of lung biopsies; as well as the results of
      visualization techniques (ultrasound investigation of the abdominal organs, CT scan of the
      chest and abdominal organs). Negative galactomannan and lack of microorganism growth in
      bronchoalveolar lavage and/or lack of response to complex antibacterial and antifungal
      therapy for two to three weeks confirm the presence of granulomatous complications in
      patients. The next step is therapy with an inhibitor of IL-1 receptor (Anakinra). Evaluation
      of the efficacy and safety therapy is based on the results of control examinations after 3-6
      months from the start of treatment and includes an assessment of the level of C-reactive
      protein and pro-inflammatory cytokines, as well as the results of CT scan of the chest and
      abdominal organs.
