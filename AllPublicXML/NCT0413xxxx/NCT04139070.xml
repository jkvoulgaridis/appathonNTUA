        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must be mentally capable of understanding the information given.

          -  Patients must give written informed consent.

          -  Histologically verified gastric cancer (adenocarcinoma, including Siewert Type II and
             II)

          -  Non-curable disease according to MDT decision

          -  Age ≥ 18 years.

          -  ASA class I-III (Classification of the American Society of Anesthesiology)

          -  Thrombocytes ≥ 50 billions/l, INR &gt;1,2. Medical correction is allowed, e.g. correction
             of elevated INR by means of vitamin K or administration of freshly frozen plasma.

          -  Performance status ECOG/WHO ≤2

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Locally advanced non-metastatic EGJ/GC patients that may become resectable after
             pretreatment

          -  Inability to perform upper endoscopy with attached equipment.

          -  Uncorrectable coagulation disorder

          -  Patients with ICD or pacemaker units

          -  Myocardial insufficiency, defined as NYHA class &gt;2

          -  Concurrent treatment with an investigational medicinal product.

          -  Renal impairment, defined as GFR &lt;40 ml/min

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Concurrent inclusion in a medical trial where the intervention may affect safety
             measures used in the current protocol.

          -  Patients with any other clinical condition or prior therapy that, in the opinion of
             the investigator, would make the patient unsuitable for the study or unable to comply
             with the study recruitments.

          -  Acute pulmonary infection.

          -  Medical history of severe pulmonary disease.

          -  Previous allergic reactions to bleomycin.

          -  Previous cumulative dose of bleomycin exceeding 250mg/m2.
