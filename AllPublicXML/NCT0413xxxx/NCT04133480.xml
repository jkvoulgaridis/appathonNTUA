    <description>For the first 7 days of the treatment period, participants are to take GWP42003-P at a dose of 5 milligrams per kilogram per day (mg/kg/day), administered as 2 equally divided doses (i.e., 2.5 mg/kg in the morning and 2.5 mg/kg in the evening). On Day 8, participants are to increase the dose to 10 mg/kg/day, administered as 2 equally divided doses (i.e., 5 mg/kg in the morning and 5 mg/kg in the evening). The 10 mg/kg/day dose should be maintained for the remainder of the treatment period; however, per labeling, investigators may increase the dose to a maximum of 20 mg/kg/day if clinically warranted by titrating an additional 5 mg/kg/day each week until reaching the maximum dose. GWP42003-P will be taken b.i.d. (morning and evening).</description>

             onset within the last 5 years. This includes certification from the investigator of
             prior electroencephalogram (EEG) documenting slow spike wave (&lt; 3 Hertz [Hz]) during
             the participant's history and evidence of more than 1 type of generalized seizure,
             including drop seizures (atonic, tonic, or tonic-clonic), for at least 6 months.

          -  Investigator can confirm that the addition of GWP42003-P to the participant's existing
             antiepileptic drug (AED) regimen is warranted.

          -  Participant must have at least 1 drop seizure each week during the first 28 days of
             the baseline period.

          -  A minimum level of general intellectual functioning as assessed at screening with the
             Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test

             care practitioner (if they have one) and consultant (if they have one) to be notified

             period.

          -  Participant has any prior exposure to GWP42003-P.

          -  Participant has initiated felbamate within the last 12 months.

          -  Participant has had clinically relevant symptoms or a clinically significant illness,
             other than epilepsy, in the 4 weeks prior to screening or Visit 2.

             significantly abnormal in the investigator's opinion.

          -  Participant tests positive for Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) or cannabidiol (CBD) at
             screening.

          -  Participant has any known or suspected hypersensitivity to cannabinoids or any of the
             excipients of GWP42003-P.

          -  Participant has significantly impaired hepatic function at the screening visit,
             defined as any of the following:

               -  Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &gt; 5 ×
                  upper limit of normal (ULN);

               -  Serum ALT or AST &gt; 3 × ULN and (total bilirubin [TBL] &gt; 2 × ULN or international
                  normalized ratio [INR] &gt; 1.5);

               -  Serum ALT or AST &gt; 3 × ULN with the presence of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right
                  upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia (&gt; 5%).

          -  Participant has received an investigational medical product within the 3 months prior
             to the screening visit.

          -  Participant has any other significant disease or disorder, which, in the opinion of
             the investigator, may either put the participant at risk because of participation in
             the trial, may influence the result of the trial, or may affect the participant's
             ability to take part in the trial.

          -  Any abnormalities identified following a physical examination of the participant that,
             in the opinion of the investigator, would jeopardize the safety of the participant if
             he/she took part in the trial

          -  Participant has been previously enrolled into this trial.
