      The primary objective of this trial is:

      Part A

      - To determine the Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the recommended dose (RD) of BI 891065
      monotherapy for further development in Asian patients with advanced solid tumours

      Part B

      - To determine the MTD and/or the RD of BI 891065 in combination with a fixed dose of BI
      754091 at 240 mg for further development in Asian patients with advanced solid tumours

      The secondary objectives are:

      Part A

      - To document the safety and tolerability, and characterise pharmacokinetics (PK) of BI
      891065 as monotherapy in Asian patients with advanced solid tumours

      Part B

      - To document the safety and tolerability, and characterise PK of the combination therapy of
      BI 891065 and BI 754091 in Asian patients with advanced solid tumours

             Investigator's judgement

          -  For Part B: Patients must have at least 1 tumour lesion amenable to biopsy, and must
             be willing to undergo a biopsy prior to first treatment and after 3 weeks while on
             therapy.

             weeks prior to the first administration or planned within 12 months after screening
             (e.g., hip replacement), or moderate surgeries (moderate according to the
             Investigator's assessment) performed within 4 weeks prior to the first administration.

          -  Presence of active invasive cancers other than the one treated in this trial within 5
             years prior to screening, except for appropriately treated basal cell carcinoma of the

             by local treatment

          -  Patients who must or wish to continue the intake of restricted medications or any drug
             considered likely to interfere with the safe conduct of the trial

             within 4 weeks or within 5 half-life periods (whichever is shorter) prior to first
             administration of BI 891065

          -  Persistent toxicity from previous treatments that has not resolved to ≤ Grade 1
             (except for alopecia and Grade 2 neuropathy due to previous treatments)

             immune-related adverse event (irAE)

          -  History (including current) of interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis within 5 years

          -  Any of the following cardiac criteria:

               -  Mean resting corrected QT interval (QTcF) &gt;480 msec

               -  Any clinically important abnormalities (as assessed by the investigator) in
                  rhythm, conduction, or morphology of resting Electrocardiograms (ECGs), e.g.,
                  complete left bundle branch block, third degree heart block

               -  Any factors that increase the risk of QTc prolongation or risk of arrhythmic
                  events such as heart failure, hypokalaemia, congenital long QT syndrome, family
                  history of long QT syndrome or unexplained sudden death under 40 years-of-age, or
                  any concomitant medication with known or possible risk of QT interval
                  prolongation

               -  Patients with an ejection fraction (EF) of either &lt;50% or less than the lower
                  limit of normal of the institutional standard will be excluded, whichever is
                  lower. Only in cases where the Investigator (or the treating physician or both)
                  suspects cardiac disease with negative effect on the EF, will the EF be measured
                  during screening using an appropriate method according to local standards to
                  confirm eligibility (e.g., echocardiogram [ECHO], multi-gated acquisition scan
                  [MUGA]). A historic measurement of EF no older than 6 months prior to first
                  administration of study drug can be accepted provided that there is clinical
                  evidence that the EF value has not worsened since this measurement in the opinion
                  of the Investigator or of the treating physician or both

             lesion(s)

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &gt;3 times the ULN if no demonstrable liver

             or active ulcers (gastro-intestinal tract, skin) or laboratory abnormality that may
             increase the risk associated with trial participation or trial drug administration,
             and in the judgment of the Investigator would make the patient inappropriate for entry
             into the trial.

          -  Chronic alcohol or drug abuse or any condition that, in the Investigator's opinion,

          -  Untreated brain metastasis(es) that may be considered active. Patients with previously
             treated brain metastases may participate provided they are stable (i.e., without
             evidence of Progressive disease (PD) by imaging for at least 4 weeks prior to the
             first dose of trial treatment, and any neurologic symptoms have returned to baseline),

             immunosuppressive).
