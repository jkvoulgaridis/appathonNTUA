  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patient derived xenografts (PDX) from mammary tumors are usually made from metastatic tumors.
      Indeed, PDX from primitive mammary tumors or after neoadjuvant treatment are still rare.
      However, the realization of such PDX (from primitive mammary tumors or after neoadjuvant
      treatment) would make it possible to have a better knowledge of the tumor heterogeneity to
      the therapeutic response, to explore the models of tumor evolution during metastatic
      progression and also observe the mechanisms of tumor resistance in the case of non-metastatic
      tumors. It therefore seems necessary to develop PDX from primitive tumors in order to observe
      firstly the success rate of PDX; on the other hand, the drift of the initial heterogeneity,
      measured by comparison of the histomolecular profile of the tumors with that of the PDXs. It
      aims to develop xenografts from tumor samples from surgical specimens of patients with triple
      negative or luminal B breast cancer.
