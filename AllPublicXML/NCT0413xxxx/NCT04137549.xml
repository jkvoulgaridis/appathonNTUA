  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) is a major innovation in the history of
      hypertension diagnosis. In clinical practice, the most well established indication for using
      ABPM is to identify patients who have high BP readings in the office but normal readings
      during usual daily activities outside of this setting or vice versa, and to identify varying
      24-h BP profiles. However, in recent years, there has been increasing interest in BP values
      during sleep, and nocturnal BP is now recognized to be superior to daytime BP in predicting
      fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events (stroke, myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular
      death), especially in medicated patients.

      The current direction in the management of hypertension is toward earlier and lower BP
      control for 24 hours, including the nocturnal and morning periods. Therefore, it may be of
      great significance to pay attention to the management of nocturnal blood pressure so as to
      reduce the increased cardiovascular risks.

      Information of nocturnal hypertensive patients defined by ABPM was prospectively registered
      nationwide, and then to investigate whether there was difference in cardiovascular prognosis
      according to the control of ambulatory nocturnal blood pressure.
