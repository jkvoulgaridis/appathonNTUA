  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the potential efficacy and safety of using virtual reality gaming in
      conjunction to standard therapy regimen care as an approach to promote upper-limb motor
      recovery, cognitive function and quality of life after stroke. The investigators believe that
      allowing users to interact with a computer-simulated reality environment will result in a
      pleasant experience, which will likely result in motivation and therapy engagement.

    <description>The Virtual Reality (VR) interface will be used during patients stay at the rehabilitation center. A research employee will install the VR system in the patient's room. Participants will be comfortable sitting while in VR session. Each interface consists of a head mounted display (HMD) allowing participants to see their arms and legs represented in the virtual environment. Participants will be able to control their virtual legs using hand controllers, which will allow them to &quot;walk&quot; through several virtual environments and gather &quot;points&quot; (no additional gaming elements are included).</description>
