    <textblock>
      A Phase 1 open label trial of intravenous administration of MVA-BN-Brachyury vaccine in
      patients with advanced cancer. Patients with metastatic or unresectable locally advanced
      malignant solid tumors will be enrolled and treated according to a 3+3 dose escalation
      scheme. Up to 3 dose levels will be explored. Patients will receive MVA-BN-Brachyury every
      three weeks, three administrations in total. Patients will be hospitalized after each
      vaccination, over 48 hours. Trial duration will be approximately 24 weeks per patient
      including 3 months after the last vaccination follow up (FU) period.

                  diabetes mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune condition only
                  requiring hormone replacement, and psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment are
                  permitted.

               -  Immunosuppressive therapy for post-organ transplant.

                  planned dose of MVA-BN-Brachyury vaccine. Use of inhaled steroids, nasal sprays,

             controlled hypertension and hemodynamic effective pericardial effusion.

         10. Known history of, or any evidence of active, non-infectious pneumonitis or primary
             pulmonary fibrosis.

         11. Psychiatric illness/social situations that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would
             limit compliance with trial requirements.

         12. Pregnant or breastfeeding women.

         13. Any other condition, which in the opinion of the Investigator, would indicate the
             subject is a poor candidate for treatment with MVA-BN-Brachyury vaccine or would
             interfere with the evaluation of the trial endpoints.
