  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates whether increasing sleep duration can increase neural and behavioral
      response to rewards and decrease depressive symptoms in 18- to 22-year-old women with
      insufficient sleep and depressive symptoms.

    <description>Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale score. The CESD-R is a 20-item measure of the frequency of depressive symptoms, with each item rated on a scale from 0 (not at all or less than one day) to 5 (nearly every day). Total scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating greater number and frequency of depressive symptoms.</description>

The I-PANAS-SF is a 10-item scale that asks participants to rate the extent to which 5 positive and 5 negative adjectives describe them on a scale of 1 (never) to 5 (always). Scores for each positive adjective are summed to produce a Positive Affect (PA) score ranging from 5 to 25, with higher scores indicating more positive affect.</description>
