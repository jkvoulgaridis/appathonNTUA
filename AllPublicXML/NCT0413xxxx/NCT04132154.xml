  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nowadays, caesarean sections account for about 7% of all surgical procedures worldwide. Over
      30% of the patients undergoing a caesarean section experience a fall of the body core
      temperature under 36°C during the procedure. Following a retrospective case-control design,
      this study aims to examine the magnitude of hypothermia in the parturient and newborn
      population as well as the impact and efficiency of forced-air warming on preventing it. The
      researchers plan to conduct a before-and-after retrospective analysis of the caesarean
      section treatment protocol at our institution over a period of 5 months including
      approximately 300 patients who underwent both elective and emergency caesarean sections.

      This research seeks to address the necessity of standardizing the use of forced-air warming
      and monitoring the maternal temperature during caesarean sections. We will also examine the
      impact of the maternal hypothermia on the newborn temperatures at the time of partus and also
      2 hours after birth. The key research question of this study is whether the use of forced-air
      warming will significantly lower the hypothermia rates and account for a faster temperature
      recovery in our parturient patients.

      A major contribution of our research is that it provides modern high-resolution, continuous
      and user-error free thermometry. This is achieved through zero-heat-flux technology and
      automatically recorded by data-loggers. Also, the heterogeneity of our study population,
      which has not been attended in previous studies, corresponds to the clinical reality of the
      most obstetric clinics.

      This research could provide new information about the necessity of standardizing the use of
      forced-air warming and monitoring the maternal temperature during caesarean sections, in the
      concept of bonding the babies to the mother's chest immediately after birth, and derive
      practical implications on the efficiency of intraoperative warming for the standard clinical
      routine of the majority of the obstetric clinics.
