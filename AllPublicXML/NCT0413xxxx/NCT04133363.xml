  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effect of Leukocyte Platelet Rich Fibrin and freeze-dried bone
      allograft in a layered technique on the bone quantity and quality following socket grafting
      in preparation for endosseous implant placement.

      Pre (baseline)- and post-grafting (3 months) clinical as well as 2- and 3-dimensional
      radiographic measurements will be used to evaluate the dimensional ridge changes between
      sites grafted with L-PRF/FDBA layered technique vs. L-PRF/FDBA and L-PRF alone.

      Histological analysis will be performed by a bone biopsy taken at time of surgical re-entry
      (after 3 months) of grafted sites to place the dental implant and assessed for differences in
      new bone formation between the three types of graft.

      This study is a prospective, three-arm randomized trial that will evaluate and compare the
      bone healing following ridge preservation of extraction sockets using either L-PRF/FDBA
      layered technique or L-PRF/FDBA or L-PRF alone in a total of 30 patients (10 in each arm).

      Qualifying participants and defects will be randomized following a computerized permutation
      block to receive either technique on day of surgery. Tooth extraction will be performed with
      a flapless minimally invasive technique, followed by socket grafting with a randomized graft.

      The mineralized cortico-cancellous bone allograft that will be used in this study will be
      obtained from the same donor, lot and tissue bank to account for variation in age, race,
      gender and related healing potential of different graft sources.

      Bone core biopsies will be harvested at time of implant placement 3 months following socket
      grafting. Bone cores will then undergo histological and histomorphometrical analyses to
      determine qualitative and quantitative healing differences between three treatment groups.

      Clinical measurements are gathered at 2 time points (grating and implant placement) at all
      defects and will be compared for differences.

      Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) initial scans are conducted immediately following socket
      grafting and second scans obtained prior to implant placement. Virtual implant planning
      software will be utilized to assess and compare the 2- and 3-dimensional changes for all
      defects.

    <measure>Measurements of clinical dimensional changes at alveolar ridge 3 months after ridge preservation procedure using L-PRF alone, L-PRF/FDBA, and L-PRF/FDBA layered technique</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Compare quantitative clinical alveolar ridge dimensions (in mm) 3 months after ridge preservation between the three groups using an intraoral scan and direct clinical assessment. Clinically we will measure the bone width of the ridge at time of extraction and after three months during the implant placement procedure. The dimensional changes will be calculated by subtracting the follow measurement from the initial measurement.</description>

    <description>Compare quantitative clinical and radiographic alveolar ridge dimensions (in mm) 3 months after ridge preservation between the three groups using a CBCT scan and implant planning software. The bone width at the extraction site will be measured on the CBCT taken directly after the extraction. The same measurement will be taken at the 3 month follow up CBCT. The dimensional changes will be calculated by subtracting the follow measurement from the initial measurement. In addition the two CBCT's will be overplayed and using specialized software we will measure the change in bone width at the various aspects of the site, lingual mesial buccal and distal.</description>

    <description>Compare quantitative and qualitative histologic characteristics of new bone between the three groups after 3 months of ridge preservation by quantifying the distribution (in %) of new vital bone, connective tissue, residual graft particles, and artifact at the healed socket site. Using specialized software the distribution of new bone, redial graft and other tissues will be quantitated. The quality of the bone created will analyzed using a descriptive analysis.</description>
