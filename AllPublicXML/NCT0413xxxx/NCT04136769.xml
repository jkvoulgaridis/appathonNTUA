  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer continues to have a poor prognosis. Many patients are diagnosed with
      advanced disease. In a considerable proportion of these patients, the tumor has contact with
      or invades into arterial blood vessels supplying the liver or bowel. Moreover, some patients
      have anatomical variations or Stenosis of these vessels. All such cases require a surgical
      reconstruction of the blood vessels upon pancreatic cancer resection in order to prevent that
      the liver or bowel are not sufficiently supplied with blood anymore. Performing such arterial
      reconstruction in one operation along with tumor resection is associated with a relevant risk
      of complications or even death.

      This trial evaluates if the approach of 'visceral debranching', i.e. surgical reconstruction
      of arterial blood vessels supplying the liver or bowel, prior to chemotherapy and finally
      tumor resection in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer, is feasible.

    <description>After trial enrolment, patients undergo visceral debranching.
After visceral debranching, patients proceed to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The therapy as such is not a formal part of the trial protocol. The specific chemotherapy regimen and its duration are decided individually by treating physicians.
Tumor resection should be performed two to four weeks after completion of chemotherapy. Prior to resection, re-staging and verification of vascular reconstruction patency are carried out. The specific procedure for tumor resection and intestinal tract reconstruction is at the choice of the treating surgeon. It should follow oncological principles and aim at complete removal of the tumor and regional lymph nodes. Usually, resection will be done as pancreatoduodenectomy with or without distal gastrectomy (Whipple's procedure or pylorus-preserving Whipple's procedure), distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy, or total pancreatectomy with splenectomy.</description>

    <description>Visceral debranching is defined as a vascular reconstruction with the aim of ensuring a sufficient arterial blood flow to the mesentery and liver after the subsequently planned tumor resection, which usually comprises ligation of the gastroduodenal artery or other relevant collateral vessels. All open vascular procedures can be employed for visceral debranching. Examples are aorto-visceral or iliaco-visceral bypasses using autologous vein or an allogeneic graft, or re-insertion of the superior mesenteric artery or celiac trunk into the aorta.</description>
