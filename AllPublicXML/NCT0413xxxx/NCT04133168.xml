      System for treatment of symptomatic, drug refractory, recurrent, paroxysmal atrial
      fibrillation (AF).

      Multi-center, open label, prospective, single arm study to document the safety and
      performance of Boston Scientific's Cryoablation System. The Cryoablation System is intended
      for cryoablation and electrical mapping of the pulmonary veins for pulmonary vein isolation
      (PVI) in the ablation treatment of patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF). All
      subjects fitting the enrollment criteria, signing the consent and undergoing the index
      procedure with the study devices will be followed up for twelve (12) months after the index
      procedure.
