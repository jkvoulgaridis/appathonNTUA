  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-center study involving
      Japanese participants. The purpose of the study is to assess the safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) after single subcutaneous (SC) dose of
      GSK2330811 in healthy Japanese participants. GSK2330811 is a humanized immunoglobulin G1
      (IgG1) monoclonal antibody that binds and inhibits the action of Oncostatin M (OSM) and is
      being developed for the treatment of Crohn's disease (CD) and Systemic sclerosis (SSc).
      Participants will be randomized to receive either GSK2330811 or placebo in an approximate
      ratio of 7:3. Approximately 10 eligible participants will be enrolled in the study. The study
      duration, including screening and follow-up, will not exceed 163 days for any participant in
      the study.
