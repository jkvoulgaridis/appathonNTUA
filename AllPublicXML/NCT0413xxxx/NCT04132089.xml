  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Creation of a mobile health application for individuals with type II diabetes. This
      application was designed to improve knowledge, self-efficacy and self-care. The application
      delivered educational material and provided push notifications (messages). It also allowed
      for the participants to key in blood glucose levels, carbohydrate consumption and daily
      exercise.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      capABILITY (the mobile health application) was designed to cover three main diabetes content
      areas which the investigators call modules: diet (module 1), exercise (module 2) and
      self-management (module 3) (i.e. medication adherence, glucose monitoring). The length of the
      study was 9 weeks in duration with three weeks of content per module. Within each module new
      material was delivered each week through capABILITY. Essentially, every Monday started a new
      week's worth of educational material that was intended to last until Sunday. Each participant
      was randomly assigned to either the control group (no triggers), spark trigger group or
      facilitator trigger group. At the beginning of each module the participants would be randomly
      assigned to one of the three aforementioned classification groups (this was a 2-Factor
      Cross-Over Design).

      The investigators utilized the Perceived Diabetes Self-Efficacy Scale , Diabetes Knowledge
      Test developed by Michigan University, and the Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities
      Measures scale (SDSCA) . All the participants completed the perceived diabetes self-efficacy
      scale along with the knowledge test and SDSCA Pre/Post intervention. In addition, the
      participants answered one self-efficacy, knowledge, self-care and goal question at the
      conclusion of each week within capABILITY.

    <measure>20 participants baseline self-efficacy score will be measured at baseline and after the utilization (9 weeks) of the mHealth application capABILITY.</measure>
    <time_frame>9 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants completed the Perceived Diabetes Self-Management Scale at baseline and post intervention to measure their self-efficacy. The measure (scale) consists of eight questions ranging from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (5). All items are scored so that high scores equals higher perceived self-efficacy.</description>

    <measure>20 participants baseline diabetes knowledge score will be measure at baseline and after the utilization (9 weeks) of the mHealth application capABILITY.</measure>
    <time_frame>9 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants completed the Brief Diabetes Knowledge Test (DKT2) at baseline and post intervention to measure their overall type II diabetes knowledge. The measure (scale) consists of twenty- three multiple choice knowledge questions. The score was calculated based on the number of questions answered correctly with higher scores representing a higher knowledge level.</description>

    <description>Participants completed the Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities Questionnaire at baseline and post intervention to measure their diabetes self-care. The measure (scale) consists of twenty five questions ranging from a score of 1 (days per week) to 7 (days per week). All items are scored so that high scores equals higher self-care.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Participants will login and use capABILITY quicker (time measured in seconds) after receiving a behavioral trigger message than those participants who don't receive a behavioral trigger.</measure>
    <time_frame>9 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will engage quicker with capABILITY after they receive behavioral triggers (Sparks and Facilitators) than those participants who don't receive behavioral triggers. Participants in the Spark and Facilitator groups received push messages (triggers) on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday at 10:00 am. Time was measured in seconds and the calculation was the time between push notification delivery (10:00am) and the participant login to capABILITY. The smaller the number in seconds the quicker the login time from push notification delivery.</description>

    <description>All participants utilized the designed capABILITy application. The application consisted of education material and persuasive messaging. There were two types of messaging components named facilitators and sparks. This created three groups consisting of: control, facilitators and sparks. Participants spent 1 month in each group (total duration of the study was three months).</description>
