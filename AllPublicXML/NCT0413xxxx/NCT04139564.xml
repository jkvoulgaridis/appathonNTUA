  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      EaseVRx, a software-based virtual reality (VR) medical device, is intended to offer users a
      prescription pain management tool that manages the symptoms associated with chronic pain and
      reduces or eliminates the risk of opioid dependence. The investigators will conduct a
      proof-of-concept randomized study to assess the feasibility and efficacy of using EaseVRx as
      a 56-day, VR-based, at-home program among 100 chronic low back pain patients by gathering
      pilot data on the efficacy of the intervention in decreasing pain, reducing opioid/non-opioid
      pharmacotherapy, and improving pain-related quality of life.

      EaseVRx, a software-based virtual reality (VR) medical device, is intended to offer users a
      prescription pain management tool that manages the symptoms associated with chronic pain and
      reduces or eliminates the risk of opioid dependence. EaseVRx is based on principles of
      cognitive behavioral therapy, pain psychology, mindfulness-based stress reduction,
      biofeedback, and distraction therapy commonly used in interdisciplinary pain rehabilitation
      programs. The investigators will conduct a proof-of-concept randomized study to assess the
      feasibility and efficacy of using EaseVRx as a 56-day, VR-based, at-home program among 100
      chronic low back pain patients by gathering pilot data on the efficacy of the intervention in
      decreasing pain, reducing opioid/non-opioid pharmacotherapy, and improving pain-related
      quality of life. While VR has been tested in academic medical centers and shown to be
      efficacious in the management of acute pain, this study will investigate the feasibility of
      VR use at home to manage chronic pain in preparation for a larger efficacy trial.
