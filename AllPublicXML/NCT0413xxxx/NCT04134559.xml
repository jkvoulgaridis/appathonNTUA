      This research study is studying an immunotherapy drug (pembrolizumab or KEYTRUDA) as a
      possible treatment for pediatric hepatocellular carcinoma.

      Patients who fulfill eligibility criteria will be entered into the trial to receive
      pembrolizumab or KEYTRUDA

      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a
      specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied. In the case of this
      trial, the investigators are studying whether pembrolizumab can treat pediatric
      hepatocellular carcinoma.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved pembrolizumab for your
      specific disease but it has been approved for other uses in adults. Checkpoint inhibitors are
      in early-phase study in pediatric patients across diagnoses.

      In this research study, the investigators plan to investigate whether pediatric patients with
      hepatocellular carcinoma experience stable disease or response to pembrolizumab. In addition,
      the investigators would like to explore different biological factors of the tumor and immune
      system that might help us predict whether pediatric patients with HCC may benefit from
      treatment with pembrolizumab.

             require approval by each institution's Institutional Review Board.

          -  The effects of pembrolizumab on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this
             reason, patients of child-bearing and child-fathering potential must agree to use
             adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior
             to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for 4 months after
             completion of pembrolizumab administration. Should a female become pregnant or suspect
             she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should
             inform her treating physician immediately. Males treated or enrolled on this protocol
             must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of
             study participation, and 4 months after completion of pembrolizumab administration.

          -  Women of child bearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy
             test within 24 hours of each treatment.

          -  A tumor sample must be available for submission to the central laboratory (Dana-Farber
             Cancer Institute, see Section 9). If surgery was performed at the time of recurrence,
             this sample, in addition to a diagnostic sample should be submitted. If no
             re-operation was performed, archived tissue from diagnosis or the most recent
             procedure should be submitted (see section 9 for further details regarding tissue
             specifications).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents are not eligible.

          -  Participants who have received checkpoint inhibitors (PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA-4
             inhibitors) are not eligible.

          -  Participants who have received antibody-based therapies are not eligible if they are
             within 3 half-lives of receipt of the last antibody dose.

          -  Participants who are receiving chronic steroids are not eligible.

          -  Participants who are receiving anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive medications are
             not eligible.

          -  Participants with known autoimmune disease, with the exceptions of childhood asthma or
             atopic dermatitis, are not eligible.

          -  Patients with a history of a positive test for human immunodeficiency virus or
             acquired immunodeficiency syndrome are not eligible.

          -  Patients with a history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar
             chemical or biologic composition to pembrolizumab are not eligible. History of severe
             allergy to monoclonal antibody therapies (i.e. anaphylaxis) are likewise an exclusion.

          -  Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing
             or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, or psychiatric
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements are not
             eligible.

          -  Patients with prior solid organ transplantation are not eligible.
