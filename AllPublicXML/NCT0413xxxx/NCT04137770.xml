  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial evaluating whether application of ice packs and
      scheduled ketorolac to the surgical site after laparoscopic hysterectomy reduces need for
      narcotic medications.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who undergo laparoscopic hysterectomy and chose to participate in the study will be
      randomized to either receive the standard post-surgical analgesic protocol (control group) or
      the standard post-surgical analgesic protocol plus scheduled ketorolac and surgical site ice
      packs. Usage of narcotic analgesics for breakthrough pain will be monitored and compared
      between cohorts. All care received by test subjects will be standard of care, with the only
      difference being the use of ice packs and scheduled ketorolac.
