  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to help further understand how MR-guided adaptive RT in conjunction
      with the Integrated Magnetic Resonance Linear Accelerator (MRL) can improve patient outcomes.
      This study will include participants who will be receiving radiotherapy using the MRL machine
      to target their cancer more precisely. Participants will be asked to have a few extra MR
      scans taken during their RT planning and to complete a few quality of life questionnaires.
