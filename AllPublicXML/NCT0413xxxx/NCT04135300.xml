    <textblock>
      GT2019001 is a Phase 1, open- label, non- randomized, uncontrolled, single dose pilot study
      to evaluate the safety, tolerability and kinetics of a single intravenous infusion of
      BBM-H901 in hemophilia B subjects with ≤2IU/dl residual FIX levels. BBM-H901 is an
      adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector designed to drive expression of the human factor IX
      (hFIX) transgene and raise circulating levels of endogenous FIX.

      GT2019001 is a Phase 1, open- label, non- randomized, uncontrolled, single dose pilot study
      to evaluate the safety, tolerability and kinetics of a single intravenous infusion of
      BBM-H901 in hemophilia B subjects with ≤2IU/dl residual FIX levels. Three subjects will be
      enrolled and administered with single infusion of BBM-H901, an AAV at one dose level of
      5x1012 vg/Kg.Subjects will provide informed consent and then undergo screening assessments up
      to 4-8weeks prior administration of BBM-H901. All subjects will undergo 52(+- 2) weeks safety
      observation and will be encouraged to enroll in an extension study to evaluate long- term
      safety of BBM-H901 for a total 5 years.The first subject will be dosed at 5x1012 vg/Kg and
      undergo 2 months safety observation of which the data will undergo review by an independent
      safety committee. The dosing to the second subject will not be performed until acquiring the
      approve from independent safety committee.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Be able to understand the purpose and risks of the study and provide signed and dated
             informed consent and authorization to use protected health information (PHI) in
             accordance with national and local privacy regulations;

          2. Be male and ≥18 years of age;

          3. Have hemophilia B with ≤2 IU/dL (≤2 %) endogenous FIX activity levels as documented by
             a certified clinical laboratory at the time of screening. If the screening result is
             &gt;2% due to insufficient washout from FIX protein product, then the severity of
             hemophilia B may be confirmed by documented historical evidence from a certified
             clinical laboratory demonstrating ≤2% FIX coagulant activity (FIX:C) ;

          4. Have had ≥50 prior exposure days (EDs) to any recombinant and/or plasma-derived FIX
             protein products based on historical data from the subject's record/history;

          5. a. Prophylaxis subjects: have had bleeding events and/or infusions with FIX protein

             virus-DNA positivity or hepatitis C virus-RNA viral load positivity, respectively.
             Negative viral assays in two samples, collected at least six months apart, will be
             required to be considered negative. Both natural clearers and those who have cleared
             hepatitis C virus on antiviral therapy are eligible;

          2. Currently on antiviral therapy for hepatitis B or C;

          3. Have significant underlying liver disease, as defined by a preexisting diagnosis of
             portal hypertension, splenomegaly, encephalopathy, reduction below normal limits of
             serum albumin or evidence of significant liver fibrosis (fibrosis stage ≥ 3) within
             the past 6 months prior to or at Screening as determined by any of the following
             diagnostic modalities: AST-to-Platelet Ratio Index (APRI) &gt;1;

          4. Have serological evidence of HIV-1 or HIV-2 with CD4 counts ≤200/mm3. Subjects who are

             the opinion of the Investigator, makes the subject unsuitable for participation in the
             study;
