    <textblock>
      The investigators are testing the efficacy of Smartphone-delivered cognitive behavioral
      therapy (CBT) treatment for obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). The investigators
      hypothesize that participants receiving app-CBT will have greater improvement in YBOCS scores
      than those in the waitlist condition at treatment endpoint (week 12).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to test the efficacy of a Smartphone-based CBT treatment for
      adults with OCD recruited nationally. In a prior study (Clinical Trials Identifier #
      NCT03221738), the investigators developed and pilot-tested the feasibility, acceptability,
      and preliminary efficacy of a CBT for BDD app in an open pilot trial. The investigators are
      now further testing these outcomes in a randomized controlled trial. Eligible subjects (N=
      58) will be randomly assigned to 12-weeks of Smartphone-delivered CBT for OCD either
      immediately, or after a 12-week long waiting period (50/50 chance).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference in OCD severity (YBOCS) at the end of treatment/waitlist period.</measure>
    <time_frame>Endpoint (week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>The Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) is the gold-standard, semi-structured clinician-administered assessment of OCD severity. It contains 10 items ranging from 0 to 4, which are summed to generate a total score (range = 0-40). Higher scores indicate more severe OCD symptoms. The Y-BOCS will be used to assess change in OCD symptoms from baseline to endpoint.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference in depression at the end of treatment/waitlist period</measure>
    <time_frame>Endpoint (week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>The QIDS-SR is a self-report measure of depressive symptoms consisting of 16 scale items with responses ranging from 0 to 3, including one suicide item (item #12). Higher scores correspond with greater depression severity, and the measure is a well-validated, sensitive measure of symptom severity in depression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference in functional impairment at the end of treatment/waitlist period</measure>
    <time_frame>Endpoint (week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>The SDS uses a Likert scale from 0 (not at all) to 10 (extremely) to assess impairment in occupational, social, and family domains. Higher scores indicate greater impairment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference in quality of life at the end of treatment/waitlist period</measure>
    <time_frame>Endpoint (week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>The Q-LES-Q-SF is a self-report measure of subjective quality of life, containing Likert items ranging from 1 (Very Poor) to 5 (Very Good). Total scores are presented as a percentage of the maximum value (i.e., ranging from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating greater quality of life).</description>

    <description>12-week Smartphone-delivered CBT for OCD. In-person cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an empirically supported treatment for OCD. The app-delivered CBT in this project includes modules such as cognitive skills (e.g., cognitive restructuring, core belief work), behavioral skills (e.g., exposure with ritual prevention), and mindfulness skills.</description>
