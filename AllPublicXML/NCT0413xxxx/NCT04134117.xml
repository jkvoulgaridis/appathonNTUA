      This research study is a Pilot Study, which is the first time investigators are examining
      this intervention in people with primary central nervous system lymphoma.

        -  The name of the study intervention is tisagenlecleucel. Tisagenlecleucel is an
           investigational treatment that uses the participants own immune cells, called T cells,
           to try to kill the cancerous cells

        -  The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment
           including, leukapheresis, evaluations, and follow up visits.

        -  The study treatment will be one day and participants will be followed for up to 2 years.

        -  It is expected that about 6 people will take part in this research study
