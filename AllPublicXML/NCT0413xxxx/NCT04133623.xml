  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain is the leading cause of access to the paediatric emergency department (ED) and present
      in up to 78% of cases.

      Acute osteoarticular traumatic pain is often treated inadequately, and there is little data
      about the best treatment for children. The ibuprofen and ketorolac are respectively the most
      used and one of the most powerful NSAIDs. In literature, there is no direct comparison
      between those two medications.

      The objective of the study depends on the level of pain:

        -  in severe traumatic acute pain (&gt;=7 points): to evaluate if ketorolac is superior to
           ibuprofen in the treatment of pain (n=130 children, 65 allocated to ketorolac and 65 to
           ibuprofen)

        -  in moderate traumatic acute pain (&lt;7 points): to evaluate if ibuprofen is not inferior
           to ketorolac in the treatment of pain (n=120 children, 60 allocated to ketorolac and 60
           to ibuprofen)

    <description>NRS scale will be asked after 60 minutes from the administration of the drug. To evaluate the NRS scale the patient is asked to express how much pain he feels through a number ranging from 0 to 10 in which 10 is the maximum pain. This is one of the most used methods in pain assessment.
The difference will be calculated from the baseline.</description>
