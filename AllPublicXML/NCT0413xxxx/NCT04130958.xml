  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This neuroimaging study is a clinical trial investigating the effectiveness of intermittent
      theta-burst transcranial magnetic stimulation (iTBS-TMS) to the inferior parietal lobule
      (IPL) in reducing suicide risk in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and
      borderline personality disorder (BPD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This neuroimaging study aims to determine the effectiveness of iTBS-TMS to the IPL in
      reducing suicide risk in patients with MDD and BPD. This study also aims to identify the
      structural and functional circuit properties that characterized the suicidal brain and the
      signatures that explain the clinical severity of suicidal risk. Moreover, this study aims to
      determine biological and dimensional predictors of anti-suicidal response to iTBS-TMS and its
      mechanism of action.

    <description>The sham version of iTBS-TMS involves placing the magnet over the same target brain region but the device will not be turned on during the treatment. There will be two electrodes placed on the scalp that mimic the sensation of iTBS-TMS but does not induce focal electrical currents.</description>
