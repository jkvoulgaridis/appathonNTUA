Responses use a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 'never' to 'very often.' Global scores range from 0 to 100 and scores by domains range from 0 to 100, where 0 indicates highest quality of life and 100 lowest quality of life.</description>

Each item on the questionnaire is scored from 0 to 3, which means that a person can score between 0 and 21 for either anxiety or depression. Recommended cut-off scores are 8 to 10 for doubtful cases and greater than or equal to (&gt; or =) 11 for definite cases.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>

It is a self-administered PRO instrument designed for adults aged 18 years or older with a recall period of two to three weeks, or since the last medication use. Version TSQM-9 includes three domains: effectiveness (three items), convenience (three items), and global satisfaction scale (three items).</description>
