  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infections is known to be a high-risk factor to induce cervical
      cancers. To date, EBV-related head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is still a major
      concern in east Asia, especially in China. Concurrent therapies for HNSCC have limited
      response rate and high chance of relapse. However, EBV-induced cancers provided an ideal
      target for T cell-based immunotherapy due to the non-self origins. Engineered T cells bearing
      a TCR (TCR-T) that can specifically recognize the presented EBV antigen become a viable
      approach to treat this type of cancer. Though engineered T therapies have been
      well-recognized in hematological cancers, solid cancer treatment has been a major hurdle due
      to the immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment. One key mechanism of tumor-elicited
      suppression is the PDL1-PD1 interaction which induces T cell exhaustion. Therefore, TCR-T
      cells armed with a PD1 antagonist could further enhance the efficacy of TCR-T in solid
      cancers.
