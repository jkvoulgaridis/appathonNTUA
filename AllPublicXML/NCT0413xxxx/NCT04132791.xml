  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a comparative effectiveness research to determine the difference in major
      adverse cardiovascular events between the group with aspirin after awakening and placebo
      before bedtime and the group with placebo after awakening and aspirin before bedtime.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aspirin is the cornerstone of preventive cardiovascular disease (CVD) treatment and bedtime
      intake of aspirin (chronotherapy) has been shown to reduce morning activity of platelets. It
      has been shown that platelet reactivity follows a clear circadian rhythm, with a peak of
      platelet reactivity during the morning (6-12 AM). Importantly, studies have shown in
      meta-analyses that high platelet activity is predictive of adverse cardiovascular outcomes in
      patients with stable CVD. Given this knowledge, it is highly likely that the morning peak of
      platelet reactivity contributes to the morning peak of cardiovascular events and that
      reduction of morning platelet activity prevents cardiovascular events during morning hours.
      This may be achieved by intake of aspirin at bedtime instead of on awakening. This study will
      be a comparative effectiveness research to determine the difference in major adverse
      cardiovascular events between the group with aspirin after awakening and placebo before
      bedtime and the group with placebo after awakening and aspirin before bedtime.

    <time_frame>maximum of 4 years follow up</time_frame>
    <description>the difference in number of participants with a major adverse cardiovascular events, defined as the composite of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke, transient ischemic attack, need for repeat revascular√≠zation by redo-CABG or repeat percutaneous intervention.</description>

    <time_frame>maximum of 4 years follow up</time_frame>
    <description>It is expected that bedtime aspirin reduces the number of participants with primary outcome (major cardiovascular events) more during morning hours (6-12h) compared with the rest of the day. So we will compare the mornig events, afternoon/evening and night events between the two groups and compare the difference.</description>

    <measure>Incidence rate of side-effects between the 2 groups</measure>
    <time_frame>maximum of 4 years follow up</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>cost-effectiveness of the intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>maximum of 4 years follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Comparing the relative costs and outcomes (effects) between the 2 groups. Data from questionnaire (use of health care) and data from the primary and secondary health care systems. We can compare the use of health care between the two groups en we can calculate the difference in cost between the two groups. So we can estimate if our intervention is cost-effective.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>difference in quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>maximum of 4 years follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Health status is measured in terms of five dimensions (5D); mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Rated level per dimensions can be coded as a number 1-5, which indicates having no problems for 1 and having extreme problems for 5. We can define 3,125 (=55) different health states. We compare the average health status of the groups at the beginning and at the end of the study. See if there is a difference in health status/ quaulity of life between the two groups.</description>
