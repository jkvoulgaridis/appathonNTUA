  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During the VATS procedure, some pulmonary nodules are relatively small or far away from the
      pleura, resulting that they are difficult to be accurately located during the procedure.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of using disposable pulmonary
      surgical markers to localize pulmonary nodules in subjects prior to the resection of
      pulmonary nodules by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS).

      It is a prospective, multicenter, single group target value clinical trial. The subjects will
      undergo VATS within 24h after the placement of the Marker, then the Marker and targeted
      nodule will be removed during VATS. Subjects will be followed up intraoperatively,
      immediately after placement procedure to the end of VATS resection, 7 days after placement
      procedure/before discharge (whichever occurs earlier), and 30 days after Marker placement
      procedure. Demographic and baseline information of subjects, immediate operation success rate
      of marker placement, positioning success rate, and adverse events will be collected and
      recorded in this study.
