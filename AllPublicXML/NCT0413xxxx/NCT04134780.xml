  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This work explores the possibility of using ultrasound imaging and spectroscopy as a way of
      monitoring cell death, hence, tumour response to treatment. The hypothesis here is that it
      can be used as a way of monitoring early response to cancer treatment and predicting which
      patients continue on in their therapy to have a complete pathological response as a primary
      endpoint and tumour size decrease as a secondary endpoint. If this work is successful it
      could be used in the future early on in a cancer patient's treatment to predict whether or
      not a course of chemotherapy or radiotherapy is going to be successful. For example, in
      patients in which the analysis indicates a poor response the chemotherapy regimen could be
      changed to a more efficacious one or for those receiving radiotherapy predicted to have a
      poor response a radiosensitizing agent could be used to improve outcome.

      The primary objective in this study is to identify optimal ultrasound spectroscopy parameters
      that can be used as an early predictor of pathological complete or partial response in women
      with locally advanced breast cancer receiving treatment with chemotherapy or combined
      modality chemotherapy and radiotherapy. A secondary objective is to perform an inter-user
      variability comparison by comparing second site data analysis outcomes with central
      co-coordinating site data analysis. The overarching goal of this research is to transform the
      delivery of neoadjuvant chemotherapy using quantitative ultrasound, which is non-invasive,
      inexpensive and portable to assess breast cancer therapies through functional imaging, in
      which tumour cell death is detected. By detecting cell death early in a treatment on the
      order of hours to days, rather than traditional anatomical assessments that take place weeks
      to months after the completion of therapy, ineffective therapies could be switched to more
      efficacious treatments or aggressive salvage therapy which has shown to already benefit
      patients. This has the potential of improving survival in addition to sparing patients
      unnecessary side effects of treatments that may span weeks to months. The investigators will
      use these quantitative methods to evaluate treatments with neoadjuvant chemotherapy in women
      with locally advanced breast cancer. This investigation will track the spatio-temporal
      changes in quantitative ultrasound surrogates of treatment response during neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy of locally advanced breast cancer and use these parameters to adapt clinical
      treatment. The study specifically will expand on single- institution research underway and
      involve a second clinical site. Data will be independently collected and analysis carried out
      at that site and at the co-ordinating site for comparison evaluating technology-use
      feasibility and reproducibility of results.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically or cytologically confirmed locally advanced breast carcinoma which has
             not been treated with any first-line therapy and will be treated with neoadjuvant
             chemotherapy or neoadjuvant combined chemo-radiotherapy

          2. Measurable disease by ultrasound, or MRI performed within 28 days prior to treatment

          3. Eastern Co-operative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 or 1

          4. Life expectancy of at least 6 months

          5. Patients should have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written
             informed consent document. Signed informed consent must be obtained prior to any study
             specific procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition

          2. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, and cardiac
             arrhythmia

          3. Psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
             requirements

          4. Any condition that is unstable or could jeopardize the safety of the patient and their
             compliance in the study.
