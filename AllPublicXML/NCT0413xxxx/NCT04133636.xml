  <brief_summary>

      rate of participants who receive JNJ-68284528.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple myeloma is characterized by the production of monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig)
      proteins or protein fragments (M proteins) that have lost their function. The main aim of the
      study is to determine the safety and efficacy of JNJ-68284528 in various clinical settings.
      JNJ-68284528 is an autologous chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy that targets
      B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA). The study comprises of a Screening Phase (less than or
      equal to [&lt;=] 28 days prior to apheresis) followed by Apheresis (will occur upon enrollment);
      a Treatment Phase including a conditioning regimen followed by infusion of JNJ-68284528 and
      post-infusion assessments from Day 1 to Day 100 (participants who receive an infusion of
      JNJ-68284528 should continue all subsequent assessments); and a Post-treatment Phase (Day 101
      and up to the end of each study cohort). Safety evaluations will include a review of adverse
      events, laboratory test results, vital sign measurements, physical examination findings
      (including neurologic examination), assessment of cardiac function, immune effector
      cell-associated encephalopathy (ICE) score, and assessment of Eastern Cooperative Oncology
      Group (ECOG) performance status grade. Efficacy evaluations will include measurements of
      tumor burden/residual disease, myeloma proteins, bone marrow examinations, skeletal surveys,
      extramedullary plasmacytomas, and serum calcium corrected for albumin. The overall duration
      of the study is up to 2.5 years.
