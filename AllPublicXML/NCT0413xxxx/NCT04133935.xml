  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) is a highly prevalent concern within the female population.
      Although mid urethral slings (MUS) have been the first line treatment for SUI for almost
      twenty years, due to recent FDA warnings and many countries banning the use of vaginal mesh,
      a significant portion of patients now request non-mesh anti-incontinence procedures. In such
      cases, Burch colposuspension would be the next option discussed with patients.

      In the short term, the efficacy of Burch colposuspension is comparable to MUS. However, the
      noteworthy disadvantages of Burch colposuspension include a high rate of urinary retention.
      This increased risk of urinary retention is due to the acute angle of the stitches, and is a
      problem that Burch colposuspension shares with the retropubic sling, a type of acutely-angled
      MUS. A variant of the retropubic sling, the transobturator tape (TOT), has shown that a
      rounder angle of elevation significantly reduces the risk of urinary retention. As such, this
      study proposes a novel technique of laparoscopic obturator urethropexy (LOU) as an
      alternative to the traditional Burch colposuspension.

      In this new proposed technique, stitches are placed into the obturator internus fascia rather
      than Cooper's ligament, reducing the angle of elevation of the bladder neck, aiming to lower
      the risk of post-operative urinary retention. The aim of our randomized control trial is to
      assess the effectiveness of LOU compared to Burch colposuspension in terms of urinary
      continence. Our secondary aim is to report on perioperative and postoperative complications,
      functional outcomes including urinary retention, recurrent urinary tract infection,
      recurrent/persistent urgency, de novo urgency, recurrent SUI, and sexual function, as well as
      overall quality of life.

    <masking_description>Upon recruitment to the study, the surgeon will then open a sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelope that will randomize the patient to either receiving Burch colposuspension or LOU. The patient will not be made aware of the group they were allocated to.
A clinical staff who was not involved with the surgery and blinded to the allocation of the patient will complete the Post-operative Follow-up Form at each visit.</masking_description>
