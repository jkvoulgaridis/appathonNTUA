      A Phase 1, Multi-center, Open-label, Dose Escalation Study to Evaluate Safety, Tolerability,
      Pharmacokinetics, and Clinical Activity of Orally Administered LP-108 in Subjects with
      Relapsed or Refractory Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS), Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia
      (CMML), or Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>

      The primary objectives are to assess the safety and tolerability profile, determine the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and/or the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of LP-108
      administered daily as a single agent dosed orally in adult subjects with relapsed/refractory
      MDS/CMML/AML; to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) profile of LP-108 in adult subjects
      with relapsed/refractory MDS/CMML/AML.

      Secondary objectives are to evaluate preliminary efficacy regarding the effect of LP-108
      (monotherapy or combination therapy) on objective response rate (ORR) for AML (including rate
      of complete remission [CR]with or without minimal residual disease [MRD], CR with incomplete
      platelet recovery [CRp], CR with incomplete blood count recovery [CRi], morphologic
      leukemia-free state (MLFS), and partial remission [PR]), and ORR for MDS (CR with or without
      persistent dysplasia, PR, and marrow CR), and ORR for CMML (including CR, complete
      cytogenetic remission, PR, marrow response, and clinical benefit), progression-free survival
      (PFS), duration of response (DOR) (for all subjects achieving an objective response),
      event-free survival (EFS), and overall survival (OS) for AML, MDS and CMML.

      Exploratory objectives are to explore blood borne biomarkers that may influence development
      of hematological malignancy and/or response to treatment (where response is defined broadly
      to include efficacy, tolerability, or safety); to study genes/genetic variation that may
      influence PK or response (ie, absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, safety,
      tolerability, and efficacy) to treatment, and/or genetic drivers of hematological malignancy
      such as AML, MDS, and CMML; to explore the relationship between PK and selected endpoints
      (ie, blood borne biomarkers), where deemed appropriate.

      Once the MTD is declared and the RP2D is established, additional subjects will be enrolled in
      a cohort expansion phase (Phase 1b) that might adapt combination therapies with other agents
      such as hypomethylating agents (HMA), and in the United States and ex-US sites.

    <intervention_model_description>A classic &quot;3+3&quot; design will be used to establish dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), MTD, and RP2D. Three to 6 subjects per treatment cohort will be assigned to receive sequentially higher oral doses of LP-108 on a once daily schedule for 28 days (a &quot;Cycle&quot;), starting at a dose of 100 mg. Once all subjects in a given cohort have reached Cycle 1 Day 28, these data will be reviewed by the Safety Review Committee (SRC) for decisions on dose escalation for a new dose cohort. Subjects will receive once-daily oral dose of LP-108 until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or a clinical observation satisfying another withdrawal from treatment criterion is noted. Treatment cycles will occur consecutively without interruption, except when necessary to manage AEs. There will be no intra-subject dose escalation.</intervention_model_description>

          7. Subject has a significant history of renal, neurologic, psychiatric, pulmonary,
             endocrinologic, metabolic, immunologic, cardiovascular, or hepatic disease that, in
             the opinion of the Investigator, would adversely affect his/her participation in this
             study. For subjects who have required a surgical intervention for any above diseases

                  study drug administration (at the discretion of the Investigator, if the fever is

             blood sampling, and urine sampling during the study (the diagnosis and evaluation of
             hematologic malignancy can be made by bone marrow core biopsy when an aspiration is
             unobtainable and/or is not a part of the standard of care; bone marrow biopsy is
             required in case of &quot;dry tap&quot; or unevaluable aspiration usually due to diluted
             hemodiluted specimen).

         15. Subjects with known and active central nervous system (CNS) involvement (radiographic
             or cytologic) at Screening; subjects with history of CNS involvement who have no
             symptoms suggestive of CNS disease and have had at least 2 success lumbar punctures
             without cytologic evidence of leukemia may be included after discussion and approval
             of Medical Monitor. (Evaluation of cerebrospinal fluid is only required if there is a
             clinical suspicion of CNS involvement by leukemia during screening in subjects without
             a history of CNS involvement).

         16. Subjects with immediate life-threatening, severe complications of leukemia such as
             uncontrolled bleeding, pneumonia with hypoxia or shock, and/or disseminated
             intravascular coagulation.
