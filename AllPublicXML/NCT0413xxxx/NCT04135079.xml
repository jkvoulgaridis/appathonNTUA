    <textblock>
      This study propose to investigate the immune repertoire of MM patients at the time of
      diagnosis vs. 1st vs. 2nd vs. 3rd relapse. This study will provide insights into the immune
      status of MM patients before and after disease transformation and help identify patients who
      will benefit from immunotherapy. It will also allow us to predict the efficacy of these
      immune-mediated strategies and their associated toxicity. By understanding the
      immune-microenvironment in MM patients during disease progression, the investigator will be
      able to better design immunotherapeutic strategies for maximal success.

      Background: Immunotherapy has emerged as a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of
      multiple myeloma (MM). The current immune-based strategies include the FDA-approved
      monoclonal antibodies elotuzumab1 and daratumumab2 targeting SLAMF7 and CD38 respectively, as
      well as immune approaches undergoing active clinical investigations such as bispecific T-cell
      engager,3 antibody-drug conjugate4 and cellular therapies like chimeric antigen receptor T
      cells.5-7 All of these treatment strategies are currently being tested in relapsed and
      refractory MM. However, MM patients, particularly those in the later stage of the disease,
      often have an impaired immune system.8-13 Given their curative potential, the investigator
      believe that immunotherapies should be used up front when the patient's immune system is
      still capable of mounting a normal immune response. Here the investigator propose to
      investigate the immune repertoire of MM patients at the time of diagnosis vs. 1st vs. 2nd vs.
      3rd relapse. This study will provide insights into the immune status of MM patients before
      and after disease transformation and help identify patients who will benefit from
      immunotherapy. It will also allow us to predict the efficacy of these immune-mediated
      strategies and their associated toxicity. By understanding the immune-microenvironment in MM
      patients during disease progression, the investigator will be able to better design
      immunotherapeutic strategies for maximal success.

      Samples: Peripheral blood samples from 20 newly diagnosed, 20 relapsed and/or refractory MM
      patients and 10 healthy donors will be collected before therapy. An additional peripheral
      blood sample will be collected at relapse in patients experiencing an early relapse (within
      12 months from the start of therapy).

      The project will include both a retrospective collection and a prospective collection of
      samples. Samples will be used for the current study after informed consent from the patient.
      The samples will be processed by Ficoll Paque gradient to isolate peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Peripheral blood serum will be collected as well.

      Enrollment time: 9 months

    <description>PBMC samples will be subjected to bulk and single cell RNA sequencing for a comprehensive analysis of their immune transcriptomes, including but not limited to the gene expression profiles of high-resolution subsets of B cell, T cell, NK cell and myeloid compartments.</description>

    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>PBMCs will be subjected to CyTOF14, 15 for detailed immune cell analysis. All the major immune cell compartments including subsets of B cells, T cells, NK cells and myeloid cells will be assessed for their potential prognostic relevance in disease progression.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluate the cytokine profile in the peripheral blood of MM patients at diagnosis and relapse by cytokine arrays.</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Peripheral blood serum will be subjected to cytokine arrays16 to screen for biomarkers that may predict potential adverse effects such as a cytokine storm. This cytokine profiling can potentially be used as a predictor of therapy-induced immune response, and thereby a treatment response. The cytokines that will be assessed are: 4-1BB, 4-1BB ligand, APRIL, B7-1, B7-2, B7-H1, B7-H2, BAFF, BCMA, CD27, CD40, CD40L, Fas, Fas L, Ferritin, GM-CSF, HVEM, ICOS, IFNg, IL10, IL12p40, IL12p70, IL-15, IL-17, IL-1b, IL-2, IL-2 Ra, IL-2 Rg, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, L-selectin, MIP-1a, PD-1, PECAM-1, TGFb1, TIM-3, TNFa</description>
