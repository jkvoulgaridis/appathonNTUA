  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a major public health issue in both children and adults,
      present in 1-5% of children and 10-30% of adults. It is characterized by repeated episodes of
      airway obstruction during sleep, leading to brain arousal, sympathetic activation, oxygen
      desaturation, sleep fragmentation, and non-restorative sleep. Patients report daytime
      tiredness, insomnia, and morning headaches. Children with OSA experience daytime somnolence,
      difficulties at school, behavioral problems, enuresis, and reduced quality of life. If left
      untreated, OSA can lead to numerous complications including hypertension, cardiovascular
      disease, stroke, and insulin resistance. Sleep partners are also affected, with patients
      viewing their disorder as a burden and sleeping in separate rooms. Further, disease
      prevalence is increasing as obesity increases.

      Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the current gold standard treatment for OSA. If
      used effectively and consistently, it can improve patient symptoms. However, adherence is
      generally poor, with patients experiencing physical discomfort, chest discomfort, and dry
      mouth. For those patients that cannot tolerate CPAP, surgical intervention is an option. In
      children, this typically starts with adenotonsillectomy. However, 20-75% of children will
      have persistent symptoms after adenotonsillectomy. In adults, anatomic factors including
      tonsil hypertrophy and redundant pharyngeal tissue can contribute to upper airway obstruction
      and may also necessitate higher pressures for effective CPAP treatment. Even if surgical
      intervention does not cure the OSA, it may make CPAP more tolerable and improve CPAP
      adherence.

      Sleep-related airway obstruction is a complex phenomenon potentially involving multiple
      anatomic levels. For patients with persistent symptoms despite initial therapy or intolerance
      to CPAP, further evaluation of the upper airway is clinically valuable. Polysomnography (PSG)
      is the gold standard for diagnosing OSA, but it does not provide information on the
      location(s) of upper airway obstruction. Knowledge of the precise sites of obstruction is
      critical to planning effective sleep surgery. Currently, this is accomplished with
      drug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE). DISE was originally proposed in 1991 and involves
      administering anesthetic to a patient to simulate a sleep state, and then visualizing the
      upper airway using transnasal flexible endoscopy. Sites of obstruction at key locations
      including the adenoids, soft palate, lateral oropharynx, tongue base, and epiglottis can be
      identified.

      Though DISE offers valuable clinical information, it has notable limitations. First, it
      cannot evaluate the entire upper airway simultaneously, as any obstruction occurring
      superiorly precludes visualization of any obstruction occurring more inferiorly. Second,
      interpretation of DISE is subjective and there is no universally accepted system for
      analysis. Rating systems are qualitative, using grades such as complete, partial, or no
      obstruction as opposed to quantitative measurements.

      The optimal sleep assessment would be quantitative, reliable, and provide information on the
      entire upper airway simultaneously. A potential alternative to DISE which could meet these
      criteria is sleep manometry. Measurement of upper airway pressures captures the effects of
      obstruction along the entire upper airway, from the nasopharynx to larynx. Prior studies have
      attempted to employ manometry, but have been limited primarily by inadequate equipment and
      suboptimal methods of data analysis. Woodson et al. used a solid-state manometer with
      diameter of 2.3 mm and 5 sensors to detect palatal obstruction and tongue base obstruction in
      patients with OSA. They also used the same approach to detect persistent tongue base
      obstruction following uvulopalatopharyngoplasty. While these studies help demonstrate that
      manometry can be a useful adjunct to OSA assessment, they are severely limited both by the
      type of manometer used as well as the lack of a clear, detailed description of the method of
      data analysis.

      High-resolution manometry (HRM) uses pressure censors spaced 1 cm apart to allow for pressure
      measurement along the entire upper airway. The investigators have previously applied HRM to
      assessment of swallow physiology. Sophisticated methods of automated data analysis have been
      developed that have been shown to be reliable for both expert and novice users . Further,
      pattern recognition techniques have been applied to identify dysphagia and specific
      swallowing abnormalities. Application of this technology and modification of existing data
      analysis platforms will allow for a quantitative, reliable, and comprehensive assessment of
      upper airway obstruction during sleep in both children and adults, with potential for
      development of algorithms to predict effects of targeted surgical therapy at all levels of
      the upper airway.

    <description>Number of participants identified with upper airway obstruction during sleep will be a parameter to compare the efficacy of HRM and to evaluate if HRM can compliment DISE for diagnosing the level of obstruction.

    <measure>Apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) as obtained from polysomnography</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 hour</time_frame>
    <description>To determine the relationship between manometric variables and standard assessment used to evaluate OSA, apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) will be obtained from polysomnography.
AHI is an index used to indicate the severity of sleep apnea. It is represented by the number of apnea and hypopnea events per hour of sleep. The apneas (pauses in breathing) must last for at least 10 seconds and be associated with a decrease in blood oxygenation. Combining AHI and oxygen desaturation gives an overall sleep apnea severity score that evaluates both the number of sleep disruptions and the degree of oxygen desaturation (low oxygen level in the blood).
The AHI values for adults are categorized as:
Normal: AHI&lt;5 Mild sleep apnea: 5≤AHI&lt;15 Moderate sleep apnea: 15≤AHI&lt;30 Severe sleep apnea: AHI≥30 For children, because of their different physiology, an AHI in excess of 1 is considered abnormal. Pediatric patients presenting with AHI of 2 or greater will often be referred for treatment.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire score as an indicator of OSA severity</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 hour</time_frame>
    <description>To determine the relationship between manometric variables and standard assessment used to evaluate OSA, Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire score will be obtained.
This scale contains 22 symptom items that ask about snoring frequency, loud snoring, observed apneas, difficulty breathing during sleep, daytime sleepiness, inattentive or hyperactive behavior, and other pediatric OSA features. If eight or more statements are answered &quot;yes&quot;, child is referred for sleep evaluation. Higher score correlates to more severe OSA.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Epworth Sleepiness Scale score as an indicator of OSA severity</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 hour</time_frame>
    <description>To determine the relationship between manometric variables and standard assessment used to evaluate OSA, Epworth Sleepiness Scale score will be obtained.
The Epworth Sleepiness Scale is widely used in the field of sleep medicine as a subjective measure of a patient's sleepiness. The test is a list of eight situations in which participants rate their tendency to become sleepy on a scale of 0, no chance of dozing, to 3, high chance of dozing. When they finish the test, the values are added up. The total score is based on a scale of 0 to 24. The scale estimates whether the participants are experiencing excessive sleepiness that possibly requires medical attention. Scores range from 0 to 24, having scores above 9 implicate that the person is considerably sleepy to seek medical attention.</description>

    <measure>To determine the relationship between manometric variables and STOP-BANG Sleep Apnea Questionnaire score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 hour</time_frame>
    <description>To determine the relationship between manometric variables and standard assessment used to evaluate OSA, STOP-BANG Sleep Apnea Questionnaire score will be obtained.
The snoring, tiredness, observed apnea, high BP (STOP) and snoring, tiredness, observed apnea, high BP-BMI, age, neck circumference and gender (STOP-Bang) questionnaire consists of 8 yes/no questions.
For general population Low risk of OSA: Yes to 0-2 questions Intermediate risk of OSA: Yes to 3-4 questions High risk of OSA: Yes to 5-8 questions or Yes to 2 or more of 4 STOP questions + male gender or Yes to 2 or more of 4 STOP questions + BMI &gt; 35 kg/m2 or Yes to 2 or more of 4 STOP questions + neck circumference (17&quot;/43cm in male, 16&quot;/41cm in female)</description>

    <measure>Efficacy of manometric variables to predict which subjects benefit from surgical interventions for OSA</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>

    <measure>Correlation between the outcome of surgery and manometric variables as assessed by the number of participants with improved Apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) after surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>In this study, &quot;improvement&quot; in OSA symptoms will be defined as at least a 50% change in AHI or questionnaire score. Logistic regression analyses will be performed to determine if there is a difference in the aforementioned manometric parameters between patients who improve and do not improve for interventions at a given level (velopharynx, oropharynx, tongue base, epiglottis).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Pharyngeal pressures from spontaneous saliva swallows occurring during the DISE exam in pediatric and adult subjects.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Data will only be analyzed from spontaneous swallows that occur while the subjects are under an anesthesia-induced sleep state. Thus, all spontaneous swallows will only be saliva swallows (i.e., no food or liquid will be delivered to the subjects, as they will be under anesthesia and any bolus swallows would not be safe).
Manometric data will be collected during spontaneous swallows (both adults and children) and pressure variables normally calculated for awake adult swallowing will be extracted from the velopharynx, tongue base, hypopharynx, and upper esophageal sphincter regions. Data for this aim will only be analyzed descriptively</description>

        Majority of subjects will be those children and adults who will be undergoing DISE as part
        of their standard clinical care.

        However, it is desirable to have cleaner controls without obstruction at any level to
        confirm that the visual absence of obstruction also represents a manometrically normal
        respiration. Thus, subjects without symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea who are undergoing
        a surgical procedure will be recruited. Simultaneous performance of DISE (to confirm no
        obstruction) and HRM in such subjects would take about 5 minutes. Further, the time
        required is within the variability typically expected at an academic center where trainees
        may participate in cases.
