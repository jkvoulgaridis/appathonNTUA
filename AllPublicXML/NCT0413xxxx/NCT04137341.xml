  <brief_title>A Study in Healthy Volunteers to Compare Different Tablet Formulations of the Test Medicine, GLPG1972, Against the Current Tablet Formulation, and to Assess the Effect Food Has on One of the Test Medicines</brief_title>
  <official_title>A Randomized, Open-label, Four-period, Single-dose Cross-over Study in Healthy Male Subjects to Assess the Relative Bioavailability of Two Candidate Tablet Formulations Versus the Current Tablet Formulation of GLPG1972 and to Assess the Food Effect of the Tablet Formulation Selected for Phase 3 in Period 4</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The sponsor wants to investigate two new tablet formulations (recipes) of the test medicine,
      and how they are taken up by the body in comparison to the current tablet formulation (study
      periods 1 to 3). If one of the 2 new tablets has a more favourable profile than the current
      tablet in periods 1 to 3, the sponsor will then investigate the effect that food has on this
      new tablet in study period 4. However, if the new tablets do not have a more favourable
      profile than the current tablet, the food effect does not need to be investigated and study
      period 4 will not be needed.

             reaction to the investigational medicinal product (IMP) ingredients as determined by
             the investigator, and/or known sensitivity to IMP or the excipients (e.g. lactose).
             Hay fever is allowed unless active.

          -  Positive serology for hepatitis B virus surface antigen or hepatitis C virus or
             history of hepatitis from any cause with the exception of hepatitis A that was
             resolved at least 3 months prior to first IMP administration.

          -  History of or a current immunosuppressive condition (e.g. human immunodeficiency virus
             infection)

          -  Having any illness, judged by the investigator as clinically significant, in the 3
             months prior to first IMP administration.

          -  Presence or sequelae of gastrointestinal, liver, kidney (creatinine clearance ≤80
             mL/min, using the Cockcroft-Gault formula: if calculated result is ≤80 mL/min, a
             24-hour urine collection can be done) or other conditions known to interfere with the
             absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of drugs.
