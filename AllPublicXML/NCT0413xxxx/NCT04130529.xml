  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is treatment of choice for insomnia. Many patients in
      psychiatric care have sleep problems including insomnia, but are rarely given the choice to
      participate in CBT to improve their sleep. Patients with Bipolar disorder is a patient group
      with high levels of sleep difficulties. Sleep problems in this patient group can be both more
      general such as insomnia, but can also be related to the Bipolar disorder. Other research
      groups have studied the use of behaviorally sleep treatments in patients with Bipolar
      disorder, but more studies are needed. In a previous pilot study, the investigators of the
      current study developed a CBT protocol that would target sleep problems in this population.
      The basis was CBT for insomnia (CBT-i), but with more emphasis on achieving sleep promoting
      behaviors specific to Bipolar patients, for instance techniques that would also alleviate
      sleep phase problems, (e.g. the systematic use of light and darkness), and techniques to
      target more general sleep related problems (e.g. difficulties waking up in the morning), that
      are also common in patients with Bipolar disorder. This treatment was well tolerated and gave
      moderate effects on insomnia severity in the pilot study. In a naturalistic randomized
      controlled trial, the investigators now evaluate the effects of this psychological treatment
      on sleep and Bipolar symptoms in patients at the departments of Affective disorders, Northern
      Stockholm Psychiatry and Southwest Psychiatry, Stockholm, Sweden.

    <description>Self-rating questionnaire regarding the use of sleep promoting behaviors. The questionnaire was constructed for the larger BSIP project and consists of two parts. The first part includes statements such as &quot;Last week I got out of bed within 15 minutes of waking up&quot; to be answered by number of days the last week this was true (i.e. from 0 to 7). The other part is to be answered on a 6-point Likert scale from &quot;Not at all true&quot; to &quot;Entirely true&quot;, with 7 statements like &quot;I get out of bed the same time every morning&quot;. No total score is obtained.</description>

    <description>The experimental group receives group-CBT-i adjusted for Bipolar disorder. This is a version of CBT for insomnia (CBT-i) developed during the pilot phase of this Project. Traditional CBT-i is adjusted for use in the population with Bipolar Disorder. This behavioral intervention adresses not only traditional aspects of insomnia, but also sleep phase problems and other aspects of sleep specifically relevant to the Bipolar population.
Treatment is given as 8 weekly group sessions.</description>
