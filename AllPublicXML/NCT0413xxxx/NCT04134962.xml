    <textblock>
      The automated TALAS measurement tool, working with the Cone Beam 3D scanner under load,
      provides a reproducible measurement of the Foot Ankle Offset (FAO). It is possible to
      determine an average value and the standard deviation of FAO in the relevant population. And
      to differentiate significantly the populations with a neutral alignment, varus or valgus.

    <textblock>
      The analysis of the alignment of the foot is fundamental in the management of pathologies of
      the foot and ankle. The advent of 3D imaging under load (Scanner Cone Beam), less radiant and
      more precise, requires the development and evaluation of new measurement tools.

    <description>The Cone Beam under load is used for the diagnosis and monitoring of the foot and ankle. It has a CE marking for this purpose.
The images obtained by the Cone Beam under load (Ped Cat) will be analysed using the TALAS mathematical algorithm tool to measure the FAO.
The internal software of the Cone Beam under load will also be used to obtain a &quot;radiographic&quot; image corresponding to a 2D projection on which the tibio-calcaneal angle can be measured.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

             seen in follow-up consultation for which a Cone Beam under load is prescribed

          -  Patient having been informed of this study and having given their consent

          -  Patient over 18 years old

          -  Unprotected adult

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient with a contraindication to the Cone Beam under load

          -  Patient refusing to participate in this study

          -  Non-plantigrade foot under load (impossibility of simultaneously resting M1, M5 and

          -  Patient who has already participated in the 3D HAM study (patients who would have
             participated in the study during the preoperative consultation for which another Cone
             Beam would be prescribed during the follow-up consultation. These patients would not
             be able to participate again in this study).
