  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim: This research was conducted as a single-blind randomized control group intervention
      trial to determine the effectiveness of simulation method performed using high-fidelity human
      patient simulator in nursing students' burn patient care planning.

      Materials and Methods: The research was carried out with randomly-selected 61 students
      including 31 in intervention and 30 in control groups who took the Surgical Diseases Nursing
      Course in the spring term of the 2017-2018 academic year. The research data were collected
      using &quot;Personal Information Form&quot;, &quot;Cognitive Level Assessment Test for Burn Patient Care&quot;,
      &quot;The Student Satisfaction and Self-Confidence in Learning Scale&quot;, &quot;Simulation Design Scale&quot;,
      &quot;Educational Practices Questionnaire&quot;, and &quot;Evaluation Form for Burn Patient Care Plan&quot;. In
      the application process of the research, knowledge tests were administered as a pretest,
      second test, and posttest, and first and second applications of burn patient care plans were
      performed with all students. In the research, the application of burn patient scenario was
      performed only with the intervention group. Descriptive statistics, Chi-Square, Mann-Whitney
      U Test, and Wilcoxon Sign Test were used to analyze the data.
