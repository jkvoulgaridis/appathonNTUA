      Considering the beneficial individual and environmental effects, investigators set out to
      replicate the recent study on the effects of taking cold showers on sickness absence, illness
      days and subjective well-being and to assess both the acceptability of taking cold showers as
      well as its effects on sickness absence and illness days as well as well-being, sleep
      quality, skin and hair appearance for a period of 3 months in a population of healthy and
      volunteering participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The beneficial potential of cold-water immersion has been recognized throughout human
      history, with early references dating back to 1600 before Christ. These beneficial effects of
      the external application of cold water are also seen in more recent and more systematic
      approaches. Notably, cold water immersion had significant and positive effects on metabolic
      and catabolic processes, neurotransmitters and hormones, immune parameters as well as on more
      global markers of health, such as sick leave and quality of life. Also, cold showers have
      been proposed to be of use in the treatment of depression and there are anecdotal and
      uncontrolled reports as well as news coverage on taking cold showers - usually in contrast to
      warm or hot water - showing positive effects for skin and hair. For example, cold water
      tightens and constricts the blood flow which gives the skin and hair a healthier glow and
      decreases transepidermal water loss contributing to better skin hydration, while hot showers
      can lead to dried out skin. Noteworthy, none of these studies reported negative events
      related to cold water treatment as well as no negative long-term effects.

      Furthermore, a recent study on 3018 healthy participants without any experience of cold
      showering and which were randomized to a (hot to-) cold shower for 30, 60, 90 seconds or
      normal (warm) showers for 30 days followed by 60 days of showering cold at their own
      discretion for the intervention groups - reported that 79% of participants taking cold
      showers completed the intervention protocol and that taking (hot to-) cold showers reduced
      sickness absence by 29% in comparison to participants taking normal hot showers (incident
      rate ratio: 0.71, P = 0.003). Importantly, no related serious adverse events were reported.

      Next to these beneficial effects on health and well-being, taking cold showers has a rather
      neglected, but none the less important effect as taking cold showers substantially reduces
      individual CO2 emission. On the basis of the CO2 emission of the average electricity mix used
      in Switzerland (kwH=169g CO2) and the average habit of taking warm showers (Switzerland: 8.7
      minutes 6 times per week, with 15 litres/minute of warm water of 35Â°C), taking warm water
      showers produces up to 248 kg of CO2 per person and year, which corresponds to a flight from
      Zurich to Paris and back. This CO2 emission per year significantly increases when the
      house-hold is run on natural gas (296 kg) or oil (390 kg). By ratifying the Paris Convention,
      Switzerland has committed itself to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2030 compared
      with 1990 levels. With the previously calculated example, 15% of per capita CO2 emissions
      could be saved to meet the 2030 target (25% if the house runs on oil; 19% on natural gas).
      Considering the urgent need to cut down CO2 emission, this neglected potential could be used
      to substantially reduce individual CO2 emission, besides achieving beneficial health and
      well-being effects.

      Considering the beneficial individual and environmental effects, investigators set out to
      replicate the recent study on the effects of taking cold showers on sickness absence, illness
      days and subjective well-being and to assess both the acceptability of taking cold showers as
      well as its effects on sickness absence and illness days as well as well-being, sleep
      quality, skin and hair appearance for a period of 3 months in a population of healthy and
      volunteering participants.

    <measure>World Health Organization (WHO) Five Well-Being Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at baseline and then monthly for 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The World Health Organization (WHO) Five Well-Being Index is a short questionnaire designed to measure well-being. The World Health Organization (WHO) Five Well-Being Index consists of five questions. The answers are given on a six-level scale (0 - 5, where 0 represents &quot;No time at all&quot; and 5 &quot;All the time&quot;). The raw value is obtained by adding the answers. The raw value ranges from 0 to 25, where 0 is the lowest quality of life and 25 is the highest quality of life. The percentage value of 0 -100 is obtained by multiplying by 4. The percentage value 0 denotes the worst state of health, 100 the best. The processing time is less than one minute. Example: In the last 4 weeks I was happy and in a good mood.</description>

    <measure>Questionnaire for positive aspects of well-being in adults</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at baseline and then monthly for 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Questionnaire for positive aspects of well-being in adults is a psychological self-evaluation procedure for the assessment of positive aspects of well-being in adults. The Questionnaire for positive aspects of well-being in adults consists of 16 questions, of which 4 questions each are assigned to one of the following four scales: Ability to work under pressure, vitality, enjoyment, inner peace. The answers are given on a 6-level scale (1 - 6, where 6 represents &quot;Does not apply at all&quot; and 1 &quot;Is absolutely true&quot;). The processing time is estimated at five to ten minutes by adding up the 16 items you get an overall result between 16 - 96, whereas a lower overall result shows a higher physical wellbeing. Example: There's hardly anything that can upset me.</description>

    <measure>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at baseline and then monthly for 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index is a self-report questionnaire that assesses sleep quality over a 1-month time interval. The measure consists of 19 individual items, creating 7 components that produce one global score, and takes 5-10 minutes to complete. The questionnaire offers seven component scores and one composite score. The component scores consist of subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction. Each item is weighted on a 0-3 interval scale. The global Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score is then calculated by totalling the seven component scores, providing an overall score ranging from 0 to 21, where lower scores denote a healthier sleep quality. Example: How tired are you during the day?</description>

    <measure>Showering behaviour concerning frequency</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at baseline and then weekly for 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>At baseline, habitual showering behaviour will be assessed online and participants will rate their habitual showering behaviour in terms of frequency, duration, equipment (i.e. kind of shower head) and temperature. Participants are also asked to measure and indicate the temperature of their showers with a thermometer, but this is not obligatory for study continuation. After randomization, participants are asked to complete weekly online assessments of the showering behaviour for the duration of the study, i.e. frequency, duration, equipment (i.e. kind of shower head) and temperature. The intervention group is asked to shower for 3 months at the coldest level only, i.e. with water at the coldest level. The temperature of cold water will be estimated on the basis of average temperatures for the specific geographical region (which are obtained from local waterworks) and the dates of participation</description>
