  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Use of erector spina plane (ESP) block for postoperative analgesia is continuously
      increasing. However, few studies have investigated intraoperative effects of ESP block. The
      investigators aim to study the effects of ESP block in terms of cost-effectiveness,
      consumption of inhalation agents and opioids in perioperative and postoperative period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Erector spina plane (ESP) block has analgesic efficiency and its popularity is growing
      steadily. ESP block forms a sensorial block by local anesthetic infiltration between the
      musculus erector spina and facia. ESP block given to participants undergoing laparoscopic
      cholecystectomy for postoperative opioid analgesia resulted in a decrease of postoperative
      pain scores in the first 24 h. Due to increases in health expenditure, cost control is
      becoming more and more important. Cost-effective studies are important in healthcare
      economics. Inhaled anesthetics used in anesthesia departments account for about 20% of total
      anesthetic agents. Local anesthetic agents decrease the minimum alveolar concentration (MAC)
      value of inhaled agents. And also in perioperative and post operative period, the anesthetic
      management often need to be supported with opioid drugs. The investigators think that ESP
      block has analgesic effects and decreases the consumption of inhalation agents. The
      investigators aim to investigate the cost-effectiveness of ESP block in anesthetic
      applications in laparoscopic procedures.
