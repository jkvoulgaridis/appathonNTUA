  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to research the effects of delivering full-dose neoadjuvant
      multi-agent chemotherapy (folfirinox) followed by stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT)
      in patients with resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in order to intensify
      local therapy and improve outcomes.

      Primary Objectives:

      1. To assess one-year local control rates in patients with operable PDAC who receive
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy and SBRT

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To assess the following disease control endpoints: pathological response, disease-free
           survival, overall survival, failure pattern (local vs. distant) and time to development
           of distant metastases

        2. To assess safety of the SBRT regimen

      Exploratory objectives

        1. To obtain exploratory data correlating tumor response grade with changes in circulating
           tumor DNA levels following chemotherapy, SBRT, and surgery in patients with PDAC

        2. To obtain exploratory data correlating circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) changes with
           disease control endpoints (overall survival, disease-free survival, failure pattern, and
           time to development of distant metastases)

        3. To obtain exploratory data on positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance
           imaging (MRI) findings and correlations with tumor response among patients treated on
           study.

    <description>Participants in this trial will receive neoadjuvant and adjuvant FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy for 6 cycles (1 cycle = 14 days) per routine guidelines.
After 6 cycles of neoadjuvant therapy are completed, patients will undergo imaging with pancreatic protocol CT and PET-MRI to assess disease status . Patients without evidence of disease progression at the end of 6 cycles of neoadjuvant treatment will proceed to SBRT followed by surgical resection.
Following surgery, patients will receive an additional 6 cycles of FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy.</description>
