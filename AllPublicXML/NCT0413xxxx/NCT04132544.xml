  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this project, the investigators are interested in a particular population, that of elderly
      subjects who used the UAS after a fall and who are not hospitalized or are hospitalized less
      than 24 hours. The scientific literature concerning this population is poor . However, this
      is a particularly vulnerable population. The DREES report notes that in 2005 in metropolitan
      France, 24% of people aged 65 to 75 said they had fallen in the last 12 months. Home falls
      among seniors may require emergency medical services (EMS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The first cause of accidental death in people over 65, the fall often has a pejorative impact
      on the physical, psychological and quality of life . It is also predictive of entry into an
      institution.

      In this project, the investigators propose to evaluate the patient at home with an IDEG
      (Gerontological Assessment Nurse) working in collaboration with the attending physician,
      whenever the fall triggers a call to the SAMU (without hospitalization or with
      hospitalization of less than 24 hours). In addition to the evaluation, the nurse will propose
      a personalized intervention plan (PIP) based on targeted and prioritized actions.

      The Main objective is to study the effect of a personalized intervention plan (PIP) proposed
      by an IDEG at home in the elderly who used the UAS for a fall (with on-site care or
      hospitalization inferior to 24h), on the delay institutionalization or death before
      institutionalization compared to standard care.

    <description>Hospitalizations will be collected for all patients included during the follow-up. We will compare more specifically the unplanned hospitalizations: the average number of unplanned hospitalizations will be compared between the two groups at 12 and 24 months of follow-up.
This data is collected during the unannounced semi-annual telephone call of the subjects' home groups.</description>

    <description>Katz's scale of functional independence for activities of daily living (Katz S, 1963), commonly known as Katz's ADL (Katz Activity of Living Living Scale), is the most appropriate tool for assessing functional abilities. basic patient. Clinicians generally use this tool to detect problems with performing 6 basic activities of daily living and to plan care accordingly. The score varies from 0 (completely dependent) to 6 (completely autonomous). A score of 4 indicates a moderate functional deficit and 2 a severe functional deficit.</description>

    <measure>Evolution of the quality-of-life score evaluated by SF-12</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will use the SF-12 Quality of Life Scale, which is an abbreviated version of the Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form General Health Survey, with only 12 of the 36 questions that can save a lot of time. It is a generic questionnaire that makes it possible to compare groups of subjects with different pathologies. It measures eight aspects of quality of life that reflect
World Health Organization WHO's definition of quality of life: general and mental health, physical and social functioning, physical and emotional health, pain and vitality.
Compared to the SF-36, the SF-12 has the advantage of being shorter, less time-consuming, thus easier for the evaluator and better tolerated by patients. Its results are correlated with those of the SF-36.
The SF-12 allows to obtain two scores (between 0 and 100, calculated thanks to an algorithm):
a score of quality of mental and social life
and a physical quality of life score.</description>

A mail containing the elements of interest is sent to the attending physician after each visit. The patient is also contacted by telephone by the IDEG at 2, 4, 9, 15 and 21 months of follow-up to maintain a link, identify possible difficulties and encourage him / her to apply the PIP recommendations.</description>
