  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Microneedling is a relatively new, minimally invasive technique originally developed for skin
      rejuvenation. Controlled micro-injury to the dermis via the application of several small
      needles connected to a motorized device stimulates the wound healing process, resulting in
      the formation of new tissue and blood vessels. The SkinPen by Bellus Medical is an
      FDA-cleared microneedling device proven to improve the appearance of acne scars This study
      evaluates the clinical performance of the SkinPen device for the treatment of signs of aging
      on the back of the hand.

      SkinPen microneedling treatment of dorsal hand skin This is a single-site, non-randomized,
      non-controlled study designed to follow at least twenty

      three (23) qualified and consenting subjects treated with 4 Skinpen microneedling treatments.
      The sample size determination of this study is based on the recommendations of the sponsor.
      These patients will be treated four times over the dorsum of the hand from the wrist to the
      knuckles each month for four months, followed by two follow-up visits at 1-month and 3-months
      post-treatment. The acute effects of microneedling will be determined by subjective and
      objective analysis using standard and close-up photography. Additionally, the effects of this
      treatment will be analyzed at 1-month and 3-month post-treatment through clinician and
      subject assessments.

      Subjects will be identified from Dr. Jeffrey Kenkel's clinical practice at the University of
      Texas Southwestern Medical Center. Subjects will be numbered sequentially in the order in
      which they qualify for entry into the study.
