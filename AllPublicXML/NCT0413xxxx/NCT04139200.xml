  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity
      around the world. Studies revealed that patients with COPD are less active than age-matched
      healthy controls and activity level decreases with disease severity. Higher levels of
      physical activity is related to important health-related outcomes, such as lower mortality
      rate and hospital admissions. Additionally, increasing physical activity is related with
      substantial health benefits. Patients with COPD have a higher risk of developing insulin
      resistance, hypertension, dyslipidemia, osteopenia, leading to chronic diseases such as
      coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes and osteoporosis, which have been related to physical
      inactivity in the healthy population. Moreover, physical inactivity has been related to the
      occurrence of comorbidities in patients with COPD. Therefore, improving physical activity
      levels is a recommended treatment in the disease management in all patients with COPD and is
      implemented in the recent GOLD guidelines for all patients with COPD, regardless of the
      disease severity.

      The research group investigated the effect of a 3-month semi-automatic tele-coaching
      intervention on physical activity levels in patients with COPD. The tele coaching
      intervention led to a significant improvement on physical activity in the intervention group.
      Although this trial showed positive results on physical activity, further research is needed,
      mainly to investigate the long-term (12 months) effectiveness of such interventions and the
      added value of a smartphone application on top of a simple step counter providing feedback.
      Additionally, since physical activity is related to the development of comorbidities, the
      investigators aim to explore the influence of improving physical activity levels on the
      occurrence of cardiovascular, metabolic and musculoskeletal comorbidities. Finally, this
      study will explore baseline characteristics (such as social support, self-efficacy, dynamic
      hyperinflation, etc.) that can predict success in this intervention.

      The aims of the present study are:

        1. primary objective: To investigate the changes in physical activity after a 12-month tele
           coaching intervention (including individualized goal setting, feedback, motivational
           contacts with coach and a step counter providing direct feedback), compared to a sham
           group receiving a light coaching intervention (feedback from step counter and static
           goal setting, without additional motivation or contact with the coach).

        2. secondary objectives: A. Investigate the effect of a 12-month tele coaching intervention
           on exercise capacity, muscle force, quality of life, physical activity from a patient's
           perspective, dyspnea-related fear and comorbidities.

      B. Confirming previous findings on short-term effects (or lack of effect) of the tele
      coaching intervention on physical activity, exercise capacity and quality of life, assessed
      at 6 months.

      C. Identifying possible baseline characteristics that are determinants of the change in
      physical activity after the 12-month tele coaching intervention.

      D. Investigating the association between the physical activity pattern and the onset of an
      exacerbation.

      E. To explore the relation between dynamic hyperinflation as measured during the six-minutes
      walk test, physical activity measured at baseline and change in physical activity as result
      of the intervention.

      Therefore, the study will include stable patients with COPD (post bronchodilator FEV1/FVC &lt;
      0.70) with no moderate or severe exacerbations in the past month, across all disease
      severities.

      The study will consists of a total 4 visits clinical visits:

        -  Visit 1 screening visit

        -  Visit 2: randomization visit, scheduled 1-2 weeks after visit 1

        -  Visit 3: short term follow-up visit, scheduled 6 months after visit 2

        -  Visit 4: long-term follow-up visit, scheduled 12 months after visit 2

      All patients included in the study will be randomized in either the intervention group or
      sham group:

        -  A multicomponent tele coaching intervention that consists of 1) education about the
           importance of physical activity and a one-to-one interview with the coach discussing the
           motivation and barriers to be active, 2) a step counter providing direct feedback, 3)
           application installed on a smartphone providing an adaptive goal and daily and weekly
           feedback and 4) contact with the coach if the patient is not compliant with the
           intervention, not increasing physical activity or when the patient reports a change in
           medication. The patient is asked to have a daily interaction with the smartphone
           application.

        -  A sham intervention that consist of 1) education about the importance of physical
           activity and a personal (fixed) goal expressed in terms of steps. The patient is asked
           to try to reach this goal, 2) a step counter providing direct feedback, 3) application
           installed on a smartphone only displaying a graph with the activity of the present week
           and the personal (fixed) goal, 4) contact with the coach if the patient reports a change
           in medication. The patient is asked to have at least a weekly interaction with the
           application.

    <description>A) Education about the importance of PA. During a one-to-one interview with the coach motivation, self-efficacy, barriers, favorite activities and strategies to become more active are discussed. B) Step counter providing direct feedback. C) A smartphone with a project-tailored application. The application provides automated coaching by displaying an activity goal (number of steps) and feedback on a daily basis. The feedback comes with a graphical presentation. Patients' targets are automatically revised weekly. The aim is to progressively increase the PA during the 12 weeks period and maintain afterwards. D) Telephone contacts triggered in the case of non-compliance with wearing the step counter, failure to transmit data, failure to progress or change in medication. Coaches are alerted by a note at the coaches' backend to take contact with the patient if needed.</description>
