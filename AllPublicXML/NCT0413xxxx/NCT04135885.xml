      Research purposes：Comparison of preoperative folic acid and placebo intervention on
      postoperative recovery of sputum in children undergoing general anesthesia for head and neck
      and maxillofacial surgery Test type：Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, prospective
      study Randomized grouping: Patients were randomized into an intervention group (fed for 7
      days before surgery) and a placebo group (7 days for placebo) Test subjects: recruitment and
      sample size calculation, inclusion criteria, exclusion criteria, shedding cases, trial
      suspension, rejection criteria, trial termination,Test contents Evaluation indicators: main
      observation indicators, secondary observation indicators Adverse events: definition of
      adverse events, recording of adverse events, treatment of adverse events, assessment of
      adverse events, serious adverse events, definition of serious adverse events, recording and
      reporting of serious adverse events

      According to literature review, the incidence of sputum sputum in children is about 38.8%
      (Reference 1), and the incidence of sputum sputum in the placebo group is 38%, assuming a
      class of error probability α = 0.05, test efficiency 1-β=0.8, considering folic acid
      supplementation for 7 days can reduce the incidence of sputum to 23%. A chi-square test is
      proposed to assess whether there is a difference in the incidence of sputum between groups.
      Calculated by PASS software, the sample size was 300. Considering the 5% drop rate, a total
      of 316 inpatients with head and neck and maxillofacial surgery were included, divided into 2
      groups, 158 cases in each group.

      The PAED score was scored every 10 minutes during the recovery of the child, at the time of
      extubation, and within 30 minutes after extubation (total score 0-20, score ≥10 is defined as
      the recovery period).

      8.2 secondary observation indicators:

        1. Changes in induction of anesthesia, intubation, and central rate (HR) and mean blood
           pressure (MBP);

        2. HR and MBP changes in the resuscitation chamber (T1), 5 min (T2) before extubation, T3
           at extubation, and 2 min (T4) after extubation;

        3. extubation time and wake-up time;

        4. Postoperative Ramsay sedation scores were performed every 10 minutes during recovery, at
           the time of extubation, and within 30 minutes after extubation;

        5. Postoperative pain CHEOPs scores were taken every 10 minutes during extubation and 30
           min after extubation (the total score was less than 6 points and no pain was observed,
           and ≥10 points were treated with corresponding analgesia);

        6. The use of anesthetic drugs (eg, pentazocine, propofol);

        7. Changes of serum IL-6, TNF-α and folic acid concentrations before and after surgery.

        8. Other adverse events during the recovery period (eg nausea and vomiting, bronchospasm,
           respiratory depression, etc.)
