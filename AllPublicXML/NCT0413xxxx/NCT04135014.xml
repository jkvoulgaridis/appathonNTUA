  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children tend to anxiety and even fear before survey. And this kind of anxiety will not
      result in the forced induction of anesthesia, but also may increase the incidence of
      postoperative agitation in children, even lead to postoperative behavior
      changes.Currently,Oral midazolam or intranasal dexmedetomidine alone is commonly used as a
      preoperative regimen, but the clinical effects of each single-use are not satisfactory. In
      the investigators' study，the researchers conducted the current study to investigate whether
      dexmedetomidine combined with midazolam can increase the rate of satisfactory anesthesia
      induction in pediatric patients and achieve better sedative effect.

      A trained member of the research team obtained a baseline The Modified Yale Preoperative
      Anxiety Scale(mYPAS) after obtaining consent. And corresponding study medication is
      administered about 30-40 minutes before the anesthesia induction.Vital signs were measured
      every 5 min after study medication administration.The sedation scores of the children were
      recorded with University of Michigan Sedation Scale (UMSS) every 10 minutes.The onset time of
      satisfactory sedation and parental separation anxiety scale was noted.Then recorded the
      degree of cooperation during inhalation anesthesia induction and recovery times.Moreover,
      recorded the pediatric anesthesia emergence delirium scale (PAED) during the recovery period.
