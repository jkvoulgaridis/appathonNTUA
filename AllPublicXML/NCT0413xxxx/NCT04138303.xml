    <description>The exercise protocol consists of a nine-week progressive intense-conditioning program involving six consecutive days (Monday-Saturday) of one-hour exercises and one-day rest weekly for a total of 54 days of exercise. Exercises are performed in person as a group with other participating subjects and lead by certified instructors. Exercises will involve a variety of activities ranging from running, cycling, whole-body functional movements, power movements, and open-chain weight lifting with barbells and resistance bands.</description>

    <description>Consists of weekly nutrition plans, counseling and monitoring by on-site registered dietitians and nutritionists for nine weeks. CR-LC consists of caloric and macronutrient restrictions. Caloric restrictions involves a 40% deficit from calculated total daily energy expenditure. Macronutrient restriction involves a high protein, low carbohydrate diet (35% protein, 25% carbohydrate and 40% fat).</description>
