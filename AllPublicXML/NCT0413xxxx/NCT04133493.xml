  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical evaluation is to collect patient outcome data on a commercially
      available 510K FDA-approved product that is derived from minimal processing of Atlantic cod
      fish skin: KerecisTM Omega3 Wound.

      In this trial, two groups of UT grade IA/1C diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs), full skin thickness
      or extending through the subcutaneous or fat layers but not into tendon, muscle, or bone will
      receive standard of care (SOC) treatment for their condition. Patients will be randomized to
      SOC treatment and a 510k FDA-approved collagen alginate dressing (Fibracol Plus) or SOC and
      KerecisTM Omega3 Wound. The primary endpoint is the percentage of index ulcers (the ulcers
      being treated in the study) healed at 12 weeks in which two groups that will be compared are
      SOC with Fibracol Plus or SOC with KerecisTM Omega3 Wound
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective, multi-center, parallel-group RCT designed to collect outcome data
      for the treatment of DFUs. The trial will be single blinded in regard to wound healing
      assessment (confirmation of wound healing will be overseen by an independent wound care
      adjudicator).

      There are two arms in the study, both of which will receive standard of care (SOC):
      offloading of the DFU (CAM boots (Royce walker with diabetic inlay or equivalent) or total
      contact casting [TCC] if compliance issues or the subject's foot is too large for a CAM),
      appropriate sharp or surgical debridement. Patients cannot be on systemic antibiotics prior
      to randomization, infection management during treatment phase can include systemic
      antibiotics only in conjunction with debridement.

      Arm 1 will receive, in addition, a fish skin graft (KerecisTM Omega3 Wound) secured with
      Steristrips, sutures or staples, covered with a nonadherent dressing (Adaptic, Systagenix,
      Yorkshire, UK or equivalent), the product bolstered down to the wound bed with a foam
      dressing (HydraFoam, DermaRite) and hydrogel as needed to retain adequate moisture balance
      and padded with stretch gauze and self adherent wrap as needed.

      Arm 2 will receive a wound care covering comprising collagen alginate Fibracol plus dressing
      followed by a padded dressing comprised of 4x4 gauze pads, stretch gauze and self adherent
      wrap The wound will be dressed by patients or their caregivers at home 3 times a week and by
      the site investigator 1 day a week.

      The study involves two phases: Screening and Treatment

          3. The index ulcer will be the largest ulcer if two or more eligible DFUs are present and
             will be the only one evaluated in the study. If other ulcerations are present on the
             same foot, they must be more than 2 cm distant from the index ulcer.

          4. Index ulcer (i.e. current episode of ulceration) has been present for greater than 4
             weeks prior to SV1 and less than 1 year, as of the date the subject consents for
             study.

          5. Index ulcer is a minimum of 1.0 cm2 and a maximum of 25 cm2 at SV1 and TV1.

          6. Adequate circulation to the affected foot as documented by a dorsal transcutaneous
             oxygen measurement (TCOM) or a skin perfusion pressure (SPP) measurement of ≥ 30 mmHg,
             or an ankle brachial index (ABI) between 0.7 and 1.1 within 3 months of SV1, using the
             affected study extremity. As an alternative, arterial Doppler ultrasound can be
             performed evaluating for biphasic dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial vessels at the
             level of the ankle, or a toe brachial index (TBI) of &gt; 0.6 is acceptable.

          7. The target ulcer has been offloaded for at least 14 days prior to randomization.

          8. Females of childbearing potential must be willing to use acceptable methods of
             contraception (birth control pills, barriers or abstinence) during the course of the
             study and undergo pregnancy tests.

          9. Subject understands and is willing to participate in the clinical study and can comply
             with weekly visits

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Index ulcer(s) deemed by the investigator to be caused by a medical condition other
             than diabetes.

          2. Index ulcer, in the opinion of the investigator, is suspicious for cancer and should
             undergo an ulcer biopsy to rule out a carcinoma of the ulcer.

          3. Index ulcer on the heel

          4. Subjects with a history of more than two weeks treatment with immunosuppressants
             (including systemic corticosteroids &gt;10mg daily dose), cytotoxic chemotherapy, or
             application of topical steroids to the ulcer surface within 1-month prior to first
             SV1, or who receive such medications during the screening period or who are
             anticipated to require such medications during the course of the study.

          5. Subjects on any investigational drug(s) or therapeutic device(s) within 30 days
             preceding SV1.

          6. Subjects who have received a biomedical or topical growth factor for their wound
             within the previous 30 days.

          7. History of radiation at the ulcer site (regardless of time since last radiation
             treatment).

             days prior to randomization. (In the event of an ambiguous diagnosis, the Principal
             Investigator will make the final decision).

         11. Subject is pregnant or breast-feeding.

         12. Presence of diabetes with poor metabolic control as documented with an HbA1c &gt;12.0
             within 90 days of randomization.

         13. Subjects with end stage renal disease as evidenced by a serum creatinine ≥ 3.0 mg/dL
             within 6 months of randomization.

         14. Index ulcer has reduced in area by 20% or more after 14 days of SOC from SV1 to the
             TV1/randomization visit.
