  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized phase 3 trial aiming to compare the efficacy of docetaxel and hormone
      therapy as second line treatment in patients with mCRPC progressing after therapy with
      abiraterone or enzalutamide.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive docetaxel or hormone therapy (abiraterone or
      enzalutamide based on previous treatment).

      Docetaxel (standard) will be administered for 10 cycles (maximum).

      Hormone therapy (experimental) will be administered until progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.
