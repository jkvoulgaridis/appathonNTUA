    <textblock>
      This study is multiple-center, open-label, Phase II clinical trial and uses Simon's Two-Stage
      Optimal design. Subjects with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) will be enrolled sequentially and
      receive up to 3 doses of HLX10 at 1 mg/kg for four weeks apart.

      First six subjects will be enrolled in the safety run-in period. If there are no serious
      adverse events noticed in these 6 subjects up to 6 weeks after the last infusion of HLX10,
      additional 11 subjects will be enrolled. These 17 subjects (6+11) will be evaluated for
      efficacy. In the second stage of trial, 27 additional subjects will be enrolled. Total 44
      subjects [stage I (n=17) + stage II (n= 27) = total (n=44)] will be accrued in this study.
