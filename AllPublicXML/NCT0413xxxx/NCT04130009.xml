      Tourniquet use during total knee arthroplasty (TKA) improves visibility and reduces
      intraoperative blood loss. However, tourniquet use may also have a negative impact on early
      recovery of muscle strength and lower extremity function after TKA.Seventy Patients are
      involved in this study and were divided into two groups; Group A (35) patients were treated
      with TKA with pneumatic thigh tourniquet. Group B (35) patients were treated with TKA without
      tourniquet. All patients were suffering from severe knee osteoarthritis and they failed to
      respond to conservative treatment so they are candidates for primary TKA. The two groups are
      matched related to age and gender. Selection of patients into two groups done randomly with
      regard of odd number for group A and even number for group B

      This study started on March 2016 and ends on October 2018. Seventy Patients are involved in
      this study and were divided into two groups; Group A (35) patients were treated with TKA with
      pneumatic thigh tourniquet. Group B (35) patients were treated with TKA without tourniquet.
      All patients were suffering from severe knee osteoarthritis and they failed to respond to
      conservative treatment so they are candidates for primary TKA. The two groups are matched
      related to age and gender. Selection of patients into two groups done randomly with regard of
      odd number for group A and even number for group B. All patients were followed for a period
      of two weeks until removal of skin sutures for the following parameters:

      Amount of blood transfusion done at and after surgery. Amount of blood drained
      postoperatively through suction drain. Occurrence of postoperative wound hematoma. VAS
      (Visual analogue score) for thigh pain at 1st day and (2) weeks postoperatively.

      Clinical DVT.
