      The purpose of this study is to characterize MM participants with symptomatic relapse and/or
      refractory (R/R) disease in Portugal.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non- interventional, retrospective epidemiological study of participants with MM.
      The study will characterize MM participants with symptomatic R/R disease.

      The study will enroll approximately 151 participants. The study will have a retrospective
      data collection referring to previous 3 years from participants' records and medical charts
      regarding diagnosis, disease activity, treatment patterns, and healthcare resources while
      quality of life (QoL) will be obtained from European Organization for Research and Treatment
      of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ)-C30 and EORTC QLQ-MY20 questionnaires.
      All participants will be enrolled in one observational group.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Portugal. The overall time to participate in
      this study is approximately 24 months.

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available for all interventional studies after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received (or program is completely terminated), an opportunity for the primary publication of the research and final report development has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>
