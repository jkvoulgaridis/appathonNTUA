  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic relapsing condition with significant psychosocial
      impact and morbidity, but that doesn't mean that patients will necessarily be adherent to
      recommended treatments. Patients, especially those on chronic medication therapy, inevitably
      miss doses. They use too little or too much therapy. They may take medications too soon or
      too far apart. While adherence to injection treatments tend to be better than adherence to
      topical or oral treatment, adherence to injections may still be poor.

      Traditional methods for measuring medical adherence—including questionnaires, surveys, and
      diaries— tend to be unreliable overestimate adherence. Chemical markers are problematic
      because of the tendency for patients to use their medication right before visits, so called
      &quot;white coat compliance.&quot; Our research team has pioneered the use of electronic monitoring
      devices which measure and record the date and time of medication events to assess adherence
      in dermatology. The study team have demonstrated the feasibility of using such monitors to
      measure adherence to adalimumab in patients with psoriasis. Although only a small study, it
      documented a broad range of how patients use adalimumab and found that adherence was poor in
      about half of the patients. While the impact of psoriasis on patients' lives is large,
      adherence is still poor. How adherent patients with hidradenitis are to weekly adalimumab
      treatment is not yet well characterized.

      This is a prospective single-center open-label randomized 6 month study. There will not be a
      washout period. Treatment will be for 26 weeks.

      Subjects will have baseline disease severity assessments. Subjects will be instructed to take
      adalimumab according to the labelled dosing regimen. Subjects will be randomized to either
      standard-of-care or to an electronic reporting intervention.

      The reporting intervention consists of reporting the experience with the treatment (whether
      the treatment was taken, the efficacy of the treatment, and any issues that have come up) at
      weekly intervals for 6 weeks, then every 4 weeks thereafter.

      Subjects will return for evaluation at 12 &amp; 26 weeks (or end of study). At each visit the
      subject will be scored for disease severity and adverse events. The assessor of these
      measures will be blinded to treatment group assignment. At the baseline and at the end of
      therapy visit (26 weeks), all subjects will complete a HS self-assessment questionnaire,
      treatment satisfaction questionnaire and physician trust survey. Pregnancy tests will be
      completed on females of childbearing potential at the baseline visit.
