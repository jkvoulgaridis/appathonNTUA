    <textblock>
      Hemodialysis patients face many problems related to disease and treatment, fatigue is stated
      as the most common of these problems. Therefore, The aim of this study is to examine the
      effect of hand massage and foot massage on fatigue in hemodialysis patients.

      In parallel with the recent technological advances in medicine, increasing the possibilities
      of diagnosis and treatment of diseases has increased the average life expectancy and the
      incidence of chronic diseases. Chronic renal failure (CRF), which is one of the increasing
      chronic diseases, has become an important public health problem due to its negative impact on
      quality of life both in the world and in our country, high morbidity, mortality and treatment
      costs. According to the Joint Report of the Turkish Ministry of Health and Turkish Nephrology
      Association; by the end of 2016, Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT) applied total 74,475
      patients (including pediatric patients), RRT is applied and while the most common form of
      treatment has been found to be hemodialysis treatment with 76.12%. Unless a successful renal
      transplantation is performed, hemodialysis treatment required to be performed until the end
      of life and provides a longer life, but it also causes biological, psychological, social and
      economical problems arising from treatment. Fatigue, which often related to problems with its
      biological dimension, reduces the quality of life by adversely negatively affecting
      individual's daily life activities.

    <description>In addition to verbal and written information, the first measurements were obtained by applying the Patient Presentation Form, Visual Similarity Scale for Fatigue to the patients who were taken to hand massage, foot massage and control groups before HD treatment. In 1990, Lee et al. developed the Visual Similarity Scale for Fatigue, consisting of 18 items, to determine fatigue. The items 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 of the scale included fatigue subcomponent and 6, 7, 8, 9,10 items belong to the energy subcomponent. The Visual Similarity Scale for Fatigue consists of 10 cm lines, the most positive expression at one end and the negative expression at the other end of the line. The high score of the fatigue subcomponent, the low score of the energy subcomponent, shows that the severity of fatigue is high.</description>

    <description>At the end of the second week of the hand massage and foot massage applications, the second measurements were obtained by reapplying the Visual Similarity Scale for Fatigue scale to all three groups.In 1990, Lee et al. developed the Visual Similarity Scale for Fatigue, consisting of 18 items, to determine fatigue. The items 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 of the scale included fatigue subcomponent and 6, 7, 8, 9,10 items belong to the energy subcomponent.
