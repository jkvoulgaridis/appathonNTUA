  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The cricothyroid membrane acts a route through which the upper airway can be accessed in
      order to provide oxygen and ventilation to patients. The need to provide oxygen and
      ventilation to patients is essential particularly under general anesthesia, where patients
      may lose the ability to breathe for themselves. Access through this membrane to provide
      oxygen and ventilation is critical in emergency situations where other traditional means to
      access the airway (e.g through endotracheal ventilation, supraglottic airway devices or face
      mask ventilation) have failed. It is known that due to the physiological changes of
      pregnancy, the upper airway of the body undergoes changes that can make accessing the airway
      through traditional means more difficult. Ultrasound is becoming increasingly popular due to
      its ability to identify the cricothyroid membrane, to improve success in accessing the airway
      through the cricothyroid membrane. Studies to date in non pregnant adults have shown that
      alterations in the head and neck position can alter the position and size of the cricothyroid
      membrane. No study to date however has looked at how changing the position of the head and
      neck effects the position and size of the cricothyroid membrane in pregnant patients. It is
      important to study these changes in the pregnant population, given the physiological changes
      of pregnancy that make accessing the airway through traditional methods more difficult in non
      pregnant patients. The investigators hypothesize that in pregnant patients in the third
      trimester, that changing the head from the neutral to maximally extended neck position will
      alter the position of the cricothyroid membrane in relation to anatomical skin markings
      between positions. The investigators also hypothesize that in pregnant patients in the third
      trimester that changing the head from the neutral to maximally extended neck position will
      increase the size of the cricothyroid membrane. The investigatorsalso aim to determine at
      what position in the neck a theoretical standardized incision will allow access to the
      cricothyroid membrane.

      This is an observational study.

      Participants:

        1. One of two anesthesiologists trained in cricothyroid membrane ultrasound scanning
           technique in pregnant population (study investigators)

        2. Subjects to be assessed: pregnant patients in their third trimester on the labor and
           delivery floor comfortable enough to take part in the study

      Two anesthesiologists will undergo ultrasound imaging training by an expert staff
      anesthesiologist whom is already trained in the procedure. As per previous published evidence
      on this, the investigator will need to correctly identify the location of cricothyroid
      membrane and its height in 15 volunteers. This will constitute the standardized training
      component of the study.

      Upon admission to the Labor and Delivery floor, women will be further explained the protocol
      and asked to sign the consent form. Then, they will have the cricothyroid membrane assessed,
      as per description above, and quantitative assessment will be performed. Firstly,
      quantitative assessment of the height of the cricothyroid membrane will be performed in the
      supine position (with left uterine displacement) with the neck in the neutral position. The
      central point of the cricothyroid membrane will be marked using a removable skin ink marker.
      The patient will then be asked to fully their neck. The change in distance of the midpoint of
      the cricothyroid membrane from the neutral head and neck position to fully extended
      positioned will be performed, as will the change in height of the cricothyroid membrane
      between the two positions.

      Quantitative assessment for change in central cricothyroid membrane distance will be done
      with measuring central points marked on the patients neck with skin marker ink. Quantitative
      assessment of change in cricoid thyroid membrane will be conducted using caliper measuring
      software build into the ultrasound machinery. Finally, the investigators will establish the
      starting distance above the sternal notch over which a theoretical 8cm incision in the neck
      which will overlie the cricothyroid membrane. This will be done by measuring the distance
      above the sternal notch with a surgical measuring ruler.
