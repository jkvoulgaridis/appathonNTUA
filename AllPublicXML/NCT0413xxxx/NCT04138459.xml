  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Norway, official guidelines and policies state that recovery oriented services in the
      field of mental health and substance abuse services is a desirable goal.

      This collaborative research project aims to provide in-depth knowledge of how recovery
      oriented practices and collaboration in the mental health and substance abuse services in the
      municipality of New Drammen develop over a three-year period.

      Using qualitative methods, the main aim of the study is to explore what recovery orientation
      of services in mental health and substance abuse presupposes and involves related to roles,
      collaboration and knowledge.

      To explore these issues, service users will be interviewed together with their primary mental
      health professional.

      The study will also apply observational fieldwork in order to observe recovery oriented
      practices between service users and professionals and between professionals.

      An advisory group consisting of people with background as service users, mental health
      clinicians and service leaders will contribute throughout the project.
