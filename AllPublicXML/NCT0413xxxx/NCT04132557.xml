  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to estimate the observed incidence of the health outcomes
      (suicide attempt or ideation, suicide ideation, suicide attempt, psychosis, and substance
      abuse) in a cohort of participants diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
      (ADHD) who are first-line new therapy with methylphenidate monotherapy, lisdexamfetamine
      monotherapy, atomoxetine monotherapy, amphetamine/dextroamphetamine combo therapy, and either
      methylphenidate/lisdexamfetamine/atomoxetine monotherapy or amphetamine/dextroamphetamine
      combo therapy during the 'on treatment' period from 7 days after the start of exposure
      through the end of exposure (treatment discontinuation for at least 60 days) and the 'intent
      to treat' period from 7 days after start of treatment to end of continuous observation; and
      to compare the hazards of outcomes (suicide attempt or ideation, suicide ideation, suicide
      attempt, psychosis, and substance abuse) in the target cohort (participants diagnosed with
      ADHD who are first-line monotherapy new users of methylphenidate) versus each comparator
      cohort (patients diagnosed with ADHD who are first-line newly exposed to lisdexamfetamine
      monotherapy, atomoxetine monotherapy, amphetamine/dextroamphetamine combo therapy) during the
      'on treatment' period from 7 days after the start of exposure through the end of exposure
      (treatment discontinuation for at least 60 days) and the 'intent to treat' period from 7 days
      after start of treatment to end of continuous observation.
