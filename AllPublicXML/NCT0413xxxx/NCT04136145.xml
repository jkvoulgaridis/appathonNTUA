  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized, parallel group, single dose study in healthy Chinese
      subjects. The purpose of this study is to characterize the pharmacokinetic profile and safety
      profile of 200 mg single dose of belimumab, administered either intravenously or
      subcutaneously via auto-injector. Each subject will be randomized in a 1:2 ratio to receive a
      single dose of either intravenous (IV) or subcutaneous (SC) administration of belimumab 200
      mg. The total study duration will be approximately 13 weeks.
