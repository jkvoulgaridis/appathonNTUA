      The aim of this study is to investigate the reliability and construct validity of the Turkish
      version of the Drooling Impact Scale in children with cerebral palsy

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Drooling is common among several neurologic disorders such as cerebral palsy, Parkinson's
      disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, which are the main diseases that physiatrist are one
      of the leading physicians involved in whose management 1. Drooling can be seen either as
      anterior drooling, unintentional leaving of saliva from mouth to outside of the body, or
      posterior drooling, invisible spill of saliva from mouth through pharyngeal isthmus and then
      to respiratory or digestive tract, inside the body 2. Anterior drooling causes psycho-social
      impairment, skin problems, infections, bad odor, dehydration, dentation problems and wet
      clothes and tools while posterior drooling may result in morbidity by posing a risk for
      aspiration pneumonia. Despite the frequency and significance of the condition, there is still
      a paucity of research and inadequate evidence about the various treatments and valid and
      reliable outcomes available. A major problem for research into interventions to reduce
      drooling is that there is no valid and reliable measurement tool of saliva control. There is
      no questionnaire in Turkish to evaluate the effects of drooling as well as drooling
      interventions.The aim of this study is to investigate the reliability and construct validity
      of the Turkish version of the Drooling Impact Scale in children with cerebral palsy.

    <measure>Drooling Frequency and Severity Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0</time_frame>
    <description>n this scale, parents or care givers were asked to rate the severity and frequency of drooling, classifying severity of drooling using a 5-level domain ranging from 1 (dry) to 5 (profuse drooling). The frequency of drooling was classified using a 4-level domain ranging from 1(no drooling) to 4 (constant drooling)</description>

CPCHILD consists of 36 items distributed over six sections representing the following domains: (1) Personal Care (eight items); (2) Positioning, Transfer, and Mobility (eight items); (3) Communication and Social Interaction (seven items); (4) Comfort, Emotions, and Behaviour (nine items); (5) Health (three items); and (6) Overall Quality Of Life (one item). For the sections which involve the performance of skills, the degree of difficulty of accomplishing each task or activity was rated on a 7-point ordinal scale anchored by 0 ('No problem at all') to 6 ('Impossible').</description>
