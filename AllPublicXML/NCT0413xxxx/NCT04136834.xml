  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human (FIH) Phase 1 dose escalation study to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, PK, PD, and preliminary activity of PT01 administered IV in subjects with
      advanced malignancies.`
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of a Dose Escalation Phase and a Dose Expansion Phase, both of which
      include a 28-day Screening Period, Baseline, a Treatment Period (comprised of 28-day cycles
      with weekly dosing on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22), and a Follow-up Period. Unique to the Dose
      Escalation Phase is the inclusion of Cycle 0 during which a single dose of PT01 will be
      administered before Cycle 1 for detailed exploration of the PK/PD relationship.

      All PT01 IV doses will be administered at the clinical site.
