      The purpose of this study is to test the reliability and validity of the Turkish Montreal
      Children's Hospital Feeding Scale. The internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and
      criterion validity of Turkish Montreal Children's Hospital Feeding Scale will be
      investigated. The internal consistency will be assessed using Cronbach's alpha. Intraclass
      correlation coefficient (ICC) value with 95 % confidence intervals will be calculated for
      test-retest reliability. The criterion validity of the scale will be determined by assessing
      the correlation between the Turkish Montreal Children's Hospital Feeding Scale and Behavioral
      Pediatrics Feeding Assessment Scale.

    <description>The Montreal Children's Hospital Feeding Scale is used to evaluate feeding disorders. It has 14 items which are scored on a 7 point Likert scale. Seven items are scored from the negative to positive direction, and the other seven from the positive to negative direction. The primary feeder marks each item according to frequency or difficulty level of a particular behaviour or the level of parental concern. The total feeding problem score is obtained by adding the scores for each item after reversing the scores of seven items from negative to positive.</description>

    <measure>Behavioral Pediatrics Feeding Assessment Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Behavioral Pediatrics Feeding Assessment Scale is a widely used parent-report measure of mealtime and feeding behavior. It has 35 items.Greater overall scores indicate higher levels of problematic mealtime and feeding behavior.</description>
