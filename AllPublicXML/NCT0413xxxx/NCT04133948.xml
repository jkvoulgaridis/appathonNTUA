      DONIMI is a phase 1b trial testing the combination of domatinostat + nivolumab or nivolumab
      monotherapy in IFN-gamma signature high patients and of domatinostat + nivolumab or
      domatinostat + nivolumab + ipilimumab in IFN-gamma signature low patients with de-novo or
      recurrent macroscopic stage III cutaneous or unknown primary melanoma.

      The trial will include 45 stage III cutaneous or unknown primary melanoma patients with
      RECIST 1.1 measurable de-novo or recurrent disease (short axis lymph node metastasis ≥1.5cm).

      NanoString IFN-gamma signature high patients will be randomized to be treated pre-surgically
      for 6 weeks with nivolumab (arm A; 10 patients) or domatinostat + nivolumab (arm B; 10
      patients).

      IFN-gamma signature low patients will be randomized to be treated pre-surgically for 6 weeks
      with domatinostat + nivolumab (arm C; 10 patients) or domatinostat + nivolumab + ipilimumab
      (arm D; 15 patients). Patients will be stratified according to center.

      Post-surgery (starting at week 12), the patients will start with adjuvant nivolumab or
      pembrolizumab for 52 weeks according to institute's standard. BRAF V600E/K mutation positive
      patients with no pathologic response after neoadjuvant therapy may also receive adjuvant BRAF
      + MEK inhibition if commercially available and according to the patient's and the treating
      physician's decision.

      Follow-up after the adjuvant therapy will be for 2 years, according to the institutes'
      standard.

      Toxicity and pathologic response rates will be descriptive. In case of 2/5 or 4/10 patients
      not undergoing their lymph node dissection at week 6 +/- 1 week due to treatment related
      toxicity, this arm will be declared unfeasible.
