    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to compare the Emsella Chair to sham and to determine
      whether electromagnetic technology is effective in the treatment of fecal incontinence.
      Currently there are no other studies utilizing the Emsella Chair for the treatment of fecal
      incontinence. Eligible subjects will receive 2 treatments per week for a total of 4 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fecal incontinence, no matter how frequent, may significantly affect a patient's quality of
      life. Current available treatment options include; establishing a bowel regimen that consists
      of supplements, over the counter medications (stool softeners, laxatives, anti-diarrheal,
      enemas), or utilizing other prescription drugs (Linzees, Lomotil). Other conservative
      treatments include biofeedback therapy with a physical therapist. More invasive procedures
      include the injection of bulking agents or sacral nerve stimulation implantation.

      The Emsella chair is currently approved as a treatment for stress urinary incontinence. The
      Emsella chair generates electromagnetic stimulation which is able to penetrate deep into the
      pelvic floor muscles inducing stimulation and providing rehabilitation for weak pelvic floor
      muscles. The Emsella Chair is a novel high-intensity focused electromagnetic (HIFEM)
      technology for the treatment of SUI, in addition to other pelvic floor related disorders.
      HIFEM technology induces deep pelvic floor muscle contractions designed to deliver the
      equivalent of 11,200 Kegel exercises over 28 minutes.

      Subjects meeting eligibility will be randomized (1:1) to receive treatment with the Emsella
      chair and dietary counseling or sham Emsella chair with dietary counseling. A total of 8
      treatments (2 treatments per week for 4 weeks) will be completed. For treatment delivery,
      participants will sit on the device and the chair height will be adjusted to ensure the
      subject's feet are on the floor. The sham Emsella treatment will provide some sensation
      without active HIFEM technology.

The study coordinator(s) will solely be responsible for opening the randomization envelopes and delivering the study treatments, according to the group assignment. Ultimately, they will be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of the randomization envelopes. After the participant is randomized, the study coordinator(s) will complete the Subject Enrollment and Randomization Log. The log will be stored in the regulatory binder.

    <description>Subjects will be asked to sit on the device and the height will be adjusted until the subject's feet are on the floor. The active treatments are individualized, since some subjects will be more sensitive than others. The Emsella Chair will be turned on and the setting gradually increased to the subject's sensory threshold; the maximum sensation the subject can tolerate. The setting will then be decreased slightly and stay unchanged for the remainder of the treatment time. The treatment threshold should be increased with every treatment until the subject reaches 100%. During the visit the subject will also receive dietary counseling.</description>
