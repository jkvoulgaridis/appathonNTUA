    <textblock>
      LCCC1852-ATL is a prospective pilot study designed to determine if chimeric antigen receptor
      T (CAR-T) cells result in immunomodulation which can be subsequently exploited by programmed
      cell death protein 1 (PD-1) antibodies to achieve clinical responses in subjects with
      relapsed/refractory (r/r) classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (cHL).

      In this study, investigators will enroll 10 subjects with relapsed/refractory cHL who have
      previously been treated with anti-PD-1 therapy, have received a CD30 CAR-T cell therapy and
      have evidence of progression. Subjects will be offered anti-PD-1 therapy (nivolumab or
      pembrolizumab, at the discretion of treating oncologist), as per standard of care in r/r HL.
      Peripheral blood samples will be collected from subjects after consent has been obtained at
      the time of progression following CD30 CAR-T cell therapy as well as at Day 21 and Day 42 of
      anti-PD-1 therapy. Investigators will also have access to peripheral blood samples prior to
      CD30 CAR-T cell therapy, acquired during a prior clinical study. Peripheral blood samples
      will be immunophenotyped by mass cytometry and T-cell receptor (TCR) sequencing will be
      pursued to establish expansion of clinically relevant T-cell clones.

      The primary objective of this study is to estimate the objective response rate (ORR) of
      anti-PD-1 therapy after progression on CD30 CAR-T cell therapy in r/r cHL. The secondary
      objectives will be to measure the change in T-cell receptor clonality during treatment with
      anti-PD-1 therapy after progression after CD30 CAR-T therapy, the change in peripheral blood
      immunophenotype during treatment with anti-PD-1 therapy after progression on CD30 CAR-T cell
      therapy and progression free survival (PFS) of anti-PD-1 therapy after progression on CD30
      CAR-T cell therapy.

      Preliminary data from subjects treated with anti-PD-1 therapy after progression following
      CD30 CAR-T cell therapy has suggested surprisingly robust clinical responses to anti-PD-1
      therapy. Therefore, this pilot study is an important advancement in our understanding of both
      immunomodulation after CD30 CAR-T cell therapy as well as clinical response to anti-PD-1
      therapy. This study will serve as a baseline for clinical response and immunomodulation for
      future clinical trials evaluating the combination of anti-PD-1 therapy and CD30 CAR-T cell
      therapy.

             that meets &lt;1% failure rate for protection from pregnancy in the product label. Female
             subjects of non-childbearing potential are those who are postmenopausal greater than 1
             year or who have had a bilateral tubal ligation or hysterectomy or bilateral
             oophorectomy. Female subjects must refrain from egg cell donation while on study
             treatment and for at least 150 days after the last dose of investigational product.

          -  Male subjects with female partners must have had a prior vasectomy or agree to use an
             adequate method of contraception (i.e., double barrier method: condom plus spermicidal
             agent) starting with the first dose of study therapy through 150 days after the last
             dose of study therapy. Male subjects should agree to refrain from sperm donation while
             receiving study treatment and for at least 150 days after the last dose of study
             treatment.

             the investigator or protocol designee.

          -  Subject is willing to consent to study-required blood draws.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has history of hypersensitivity reactions to anti-PD-1 therapy.

          -  Subject has any contraindication to anti-PD-1 therapy at time of enrollment or
             inability to be treated with anti-PD-1 therapy for any other reason.

          -  Subject has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past
             2 years (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or
             immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or
             physiologic corticosteroids replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary
             insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic replacement.

          -  Subject has evidence of interstitial lung disease or a history of (non-infectious)
             pneumonitis that required steroids or current pneumonitis. History of radiation

          -  Subject has received anti-CD30 CAR-T therapy within the previous 6 weeks.

          -  Subject is pregnant or breastfeeding (Note: breast milk cannot be stored for future
             use while the mother is being treated on the study. Subject must abstain from
             breastfeeding for 150 days after end of treatment).

             disease-free for at least five years.

          -  Subject is currently using systemic corticosteroids at doses ≥10 mg prednisone daily
             or its equivalent, or other immunosuppressive medications.

             treatment (i.e., 30 days prior to the first dose, during treatment, and for 30 days
             after study treatment discontinuation). Inactivated vaccines, such as the injectable
             influenza vaccine, are permitted.

          -  Subject has received radiation therapy less than 7 days prior to anti-PD-1 therapy
