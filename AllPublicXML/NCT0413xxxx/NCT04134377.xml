  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study team aims to provide a food snack that is high in protein (30 g) for two weeks each
      month (6 treatments per patient per month) for 6 consecutive months, post-dialysis treatment,
      to in-center hemodialysis patients of all vintages and with all levels and types of
      comorbidities. The study team will compare changes in serum albumin during the intervention
      (6 months) using the patients' own serum albumin results that are collected for three months
      prior to and three months after the intervention. Additionally, the study team will determine
      participants' dietary habits and appetite pre-, during and post-intervention.

    <description>This is a 9-item survey, &quot;Diet Intake Survey&quot;, that obtains information about participants' appetites and dietary behaviors. Pre-, during, and 3-months post-intervention will complete monthly surveys on participants' diet habits to assess the impact the food snack has on total protein to calories.</description>

    <description>The intervention is 6-months using a food snack with control being three months prior to and three months after-study invention whereby serum albumin levels will be collected monthly. If patients are participating in a supplement program, they will be maintained throughout all ten months of the study so long as the criteria for the supplement program (enrollment and discontinuation) is still being met.</description>
