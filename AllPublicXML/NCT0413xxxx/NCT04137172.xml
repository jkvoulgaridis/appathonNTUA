  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      entral hernias are a major cause of functional impairment, abdominal pain, and bowel
      obstruction. The overall incidence of primary ventral hernia is estimated to be between 4 and
      5 % in the literature, and ventral incisional hernia rates vary from 35 to 60 % within 5
      years after laparotomy . After laparoscopy, this rate is estimated to decline from 0.5 to 15
      % even after two decades, LVHR or open repair (OVHR) is still a matter of debate because of
      concerns about seroma formation, recurrence rate, and the intraperitoneal mesh position. .
      The laparoscopic technique for repairing ventral and incisional hernias is now well
      established. However, several issues related to LVHR, such as the high recurrence rate of
      hernias with large fascial defects and in extremely obese patients, are yet to be resolved.
      Additional problems include seroma formation. To solve these problems, laparoscopic fascial
      defect closure with IPOM reinforcement (IPOM-Plus) has been introduced in the past decade,
      and a few studies have reported satisfactory outcomes. Although detailed techniques for
      fascial defect closure and handling of the mesh have been published, standardized techniques
      are yet to be established.

    <description>Under general anesthesia, supine position, lateral visiport 12mm was inserted at the left anterior axillary line . Other two 5mm ports were inserted under vision. A 30-degree optics were used. Adhesiolysis was done . The contents of hernia were reduced . The borders of the defect were illuminated and outlined. The abdominal wall was marked from outside for measurement of defect size and for corners fixation of mesh with 5cm away from defect edge. Defect with axis from 9 to 12 cm is considered big defect.
Group I:
Proline (1) sutures were applied at the corners of the mesh introduced into the peritoneal cavity. Endoclose passed at the marked site from abdominal wall, sutures hanged and tied subcutaneously, completion of mesh fixation using secure strap .</description>

    <description>The PDS loop sutures were prepared by cutting the needles, keeping two detached ends and one blind end. A small curved supraumbilical incision was done. The endoclose passed through upper border of incision penetrating the abdominal wall above the defect, hanging the blind end of the PDS Loop to outside. It passed through the lower border of the wound crossing the defect. It hanged one detached end of the PDS Loop suture to outside, passed again through lower border of incision to catch the other detached end. The two ends were hanged not tied to avoid incision closure. The process is repeated by passing 1-2 cm lateral or medial to the previous sutures, then blind ends were divided. Lastly, all sutures are tied. Mesh was fixed as before.</description>
