  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Incorporating wire threaded custom tunnel attachments with clear aligner therapy is a novel
      approach developed to address the shortcomings of the currently available orthodontic
      systems. This hybrid system is anticipated to take advantage of the benefits and overcome
      many of the limitations of traditional fixed buccal/lingual appliances and clear aligner
      therapy. The concept utilizes light arch wires to be threaded through computer designed,
      chairside-fabricated composite tunnel attachments to achieve better control of
      three-dimensional tooth movements not achievable by clear aligners, such as Invisalign®
      (Align Technology, Santa Clara, CA) alone. The superelastic feature of the arch wires allows
      delivery of more continuous forces than aligners alone, potentially permitting shorter
      duration of recommended aligner wear during orthodontic treatment. A virtual set-up would be
      used to plan the desired position of the teeth, which in turn will be used to customize the
      size and position of composite tunnel attachments based on how two round arch wires will pass
      through tubes within the attachments. The attachments can be placed on either the buccal or
      lingual surfaces of teeth, depending on clinical preferences and esthetic demands. This is
      achievable using in-house aligners, which will also allow the fabrication of aligners in the
      office or at a conventional orthodontic lab at a fraction of the cost of traditional clear
      aligners.

      Specific aims:

        -  Test and formally describe a novel method that utilizes clear aligners paired with
           computer-designed, chairside-fabricated tunnel attachments to achieve tooth movements
           that are challenging for clear aligners.

        -  Conduct a randomized clinical trial to compare the ability of a traditional clear
           aligner system Invisalign® (Align Technology, Santa Clara, CA) and a clear aligner
           system incorporating wire threaded tunnel attachments in:

             -  achieving predicted outcomes; discrepancies in bucco-lingual and inciso-gingival
                positions between the virtual plan and end of treatment intraoral scan and will be
                measured in millimeters and angular discrepancies will be measured in degrees

             -  end of treatment ABO leveling and alignment objective grading scores

      Materials and Methods:

      A virtual set-up is completed by the clinician to plan the position, orientation, and
      dimension will be customized on the teeth to be moved.Generally, they are spherically shaped
      and their dimensions are approximately 2-3 mm. Vacuum-formed attachment template will be made
      to take the shape of a tube-holding spheres, in which tubes are embedded. The tubes are
      standard in size with an outside diameter of 0.032&quot;, and an inside diameter of 0.019&quot; and 2
      mm length The template will be loaded with composite after inserting the metal tubes are
      placed in their predetermined location on the tray. Double tubes will be used when torque
      control is needed. 0.016&quot; buccal or lingual round wires will be placed into the tunnel
      attachments along the attachments. Aligners will be delivered to patient to be worn for at
      least 8 hours a day and changed as determined by the Dental Monitoring application.

    <description>The virtual setups (predicted results) and actual results scans will be superimposed using a best-fit alignment method using Geomagic Control X (3D Systems, Rock Hill, South Carolina). Initial alignment will be done using 300 surface points, and fine adjustments will be made using additional 1500 points. This process will be repeated as necessary. Once satisfactory superimposition is performed, the x, y, z coordinates (mm) of dental landmarks on the setup and result arches will be exported and analyzed. Linear and angular measurements will be made to determine the accuracy of each system in achieving predicted vertical, in-out and torque treatment outcomes. The percentage of accurate tooth movement will be determined with the following equation: [(|predicted-achieved|/|predicted|) 100%]</description>
