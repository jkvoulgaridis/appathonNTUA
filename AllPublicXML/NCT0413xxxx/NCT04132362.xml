  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is growing evidence for the benefits of music for individuals living with dementia but
      there has been limited research looking specifically at personalised music. Methodologies
      have not yet been developed to generate and play personalised music playlists quickly and
      cost effectively. The research team proposes a feasibility study to develop effective
      methodologies for:

      i. efficient creation and delivery of personalised playlists for people with mild to moderate
      dementia in care homes; and

      ii. assessing their responses to this music.

      A long-list of personalised music (about 100 tracks) will be created by asking residents and
      their carers about the resident's musical tastes and background (particularly from their
      teenage years). A refined personalised playlist (of 10-20 tracks) will be created by playing
      excerpts from these tracks to the resident and gauging their responses including through
      direct feedback from the resident and their carer(s) plus observations of changes in facial
      expression, together with directly observed movements of hands, feet and/ or head, and
      changes in pulse rate (a monitor worn on the wrist to measure movement and pulse and the
      investigators will ask to film sessions). Care home staff and informal carers will use these
      playlists within the residents' care and the research team will use feedback from residents
      and carers to assess responses and explore whether factors such as the timing of listening or
      delivery methodology appear to affect the resident's well-being over time.

      The findings from this study will be used to develop automated approaches to playlist
      creation (e.g. an App) and to inform, subject to subsequent ethical approval, further
      feasibility studies to: test and refine methodologies for use with participants with more
      advanced dementia; and explore more systematically the benefits of personalised music and
      factors that affect this, ultimately to inform the design of a subsequent larger scale
      intervention study.

    <textblock>
      This research will adopt a mixed methods design for the study involving both quantitative and
      qualitative data collected and analysed simultaneously, then compared or related and
      interpreted.

      Up to 10 participating care homes will be selected by Quantum Care Home Group in line with
      the inclusion/exclusion criteria. A total of 60 participating residents living with dementia,
      60 informal carers and 20 care home staff will be selected from the participating care homes.

      This study will explore:

        1. The most effective and efficient methods for creating personalised playlists, including
           developing automated approaches, using technology (e.g. Apps and music recommendation
           algorithms).

        2. The most easy-to-implement delivery methods for delivering personalised music to
           residents in care homes.

        3. The most effective ways to assess responses to personalised music from people with
           dementia, including trialing automated analysis of changes in facial expression in video
           footage.

        4. Whether factors such as timing of listening affect the observed impacts of listening to
           personalised music or whether listening prior to difficult care events is beneficial
           (e.g. dressing, washing, toileting, sundowning, etc.).

      The demographics of the study group will be compared with the available demographics for care
      homes across the care home group, to help ensure the sample is broadly representative.

      A personalised playlist of about 100 songs will be created using responses to the music
      preferences questionnaire provided by the resident and their informal carer (or paid carer).
      These questionnaires will be provided by the research team to the potential participants,
      identified by care home staff, together with the information pack and consent forms.

      A music listening session will be arranged where the resident and their informal carer will
      be played 30 seconds excerpts of each of the tracks (in 15 minute blocks over a period of up
      to 1 hour). The resident will be asked to wear a monitor on their wrist, similar to a watch,
      in order to monitor movement and pulse rate. The session will be filmed to enable analysis of
      emotional responses to music using machine learning analysis of changes in facial expression,
      as well as directly observed movements of hands, feet and/ or head. Where necessary the music
      listening session can be split into multiple shorter sessions to accommodate resident or care
      home requirements. Responses to the 30 second excerpts will be used to generate a refined
      personalised playlist for each participant, anticipated to be between 10 and 20 tracks.

      The refined personalised playlists will be played to residents in music listening sessions
      throughout the duration of the study. How long music is played for and how frequently will,
      for the feasibility study, be determined by the resident, care home staff and/or informal
      carers. Different delivery methods for delivering personalised music will be tested including
      use of wireless headphones, smart speakers or other wireless speakers and their effectiveness
      and ease of use assessed through feedback from residents and focus groups and interviews with
      informal carers and care home staff. Duration and frequency of music listening sessions will,
      where possible, be logged through the listening history in the music app used and/or through
      data recorded by care home staff or informal carers.

      Personalised music listening should not require expensive equipment but will require
      headphones or a suitable blue-tooth speaker and a space in a care home where the resident can
      listen to their music. Initiating and terminating a listening session should be a simple
      matter for care home staff (taking only 1 or 2 minutes), potentially achieved by
      fitting/removing headphones and voice activation/cessation of the music plus a minute or two
      to complete the log. A short training session will be provided in each participating care
      home to train staff and informal carers on delivering personalised music listening and
      collecting observational data (e.g. on timing of listening and observed effects on mood and
      behaviour). Fidelity, acceptability and appropriateness of the interventions will be assessed
      by the research team through the observation of selected personalised music listening
      sessions.

      Approaches to assessing responses to the music that will be used include analysis of facial
      expression changes and movement in video footage, heart rate changes and qualitative
      information provided in reports from residents, care home staff and informal carers. Impacts
      on well-being of residents over time will be assessed using scores derived from inventories
      for behavioural and psychological symptom assessment as a proxy, e.g. The Neuropsychiatric
      Inventory-Questionnaire (NPI-Q), including for depression/apathy and anxiety/agitation. It is
      expected that these tools will be used between 1 and 3 further times for each resident
      participant at appropriate intervals during the period of the study.

      For this study the use of qualitative and quantitative assessment tools is for the purpose of
      developing and testing the appropriateness of personalised music listening and assessment
      methodologies rather than to draw conclusions about efficacy or otherwise of the intervention
      itself (which would be the subject of further studies subject to subsequent ethical
      approval). The quantitative data generated, therefore will only be used to supplement
      qualitative assessments to help infer/indicate factors for further investigation in
      subsequent feasibility studies and a longer-term larger scale intervention study i.e. to
      inform the design of those studies. Therefore, in this feasibility study, analysis of the
      quantitative measures is not intended to produce statistically significant data (the
      statistics involved will be mostly descriptive and, in some cases, inferential). Together
      with subsequent feasibility studies, it is intended to inform the design of the larger scale
      intervention study in which the sample size will be calculated to produce statistically
      significant results.

      The study will trial the use of facial expression change through automated analysis of video
      footage. The initial pilot showed a strong correlation between the scores, indicating that,
      after further calibration, absolute thresholds can be derived to classify a track as either
      high or low response. Deep-learning facial expression change analysis will be developed to
      determine the feasibility or otherwise of using automated analysis of facial expression
      change in video footage. This will involve:

        -  Acquiring videos at 30 frames per second while music is played, extracting 1 image per
           second and generating 3 features for each.

        -  Performing face detection using Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services Application
           Programming Interface (API) and extracting an emotion score from the facial expression
           in 8 categories: anger, contempt, disgust, fear, happiness, neutral, sadness, and
           surprise. The research team will then form a secondary score based on a linear
           combination of these expressions and assign it to each frame.

        -  The research team will then aggregate the values of all frames acquired while a track
           was played to form a total response score by assigning different weights to the frames
           and deriving first-order statistics from the resulting distribution. The researchers can
           then compare the scores to subjective observation.

      The views of care home staff and informal carers about the intervention will be sought
      throughout the study, via the means of focus group discussions and interviews. These focus
      group discussions and interviews will be conducted with care home staff and families in order
      to explore their views of how personalised playlists have an impact on residents including
      the effect of variables such as timing of listening or the impact on difficult care
      situations. Direct feedback will also be sought from participating residents themselves.

      Informed consent for participation will be obtained, including for participation by informal
      carers and care home staff, as well as residents. If anyone participating in the study, in
      any way indicates that they do not want to take part or in any way indicates that they are
      unhappy or distressed, then their participation will be paused (e.g. a different track played
      or a different question asked) and if the distress persists, the session will be stopped.

      Informal carers will provide qualitative assessments of any benefits or dis-benefits to them
      arising from the impact of personalised music listening on the behavioural and psychological
      symptoms of their relative/friend (e.g. improving relationship with carers and family). These
      assessments will be provided through participation in structured focus groups. Informal
      carers will participate in up to 3 focus groups, conducted by a member of the research team,
      experienced in qualitative research, once the refined personalised playlist is completed,
      between 2 and 4 months later and at the conclusion of their participation in the study.

      Care home staff will provide qualitative assessments of any benefits or dis-benefits to them
      arising from the impact of personalised music listening on the behavioural and psychological
      symptoms of the resident, for example:

        -  improving relationship with carers and family;

        -  improved quality or ease of care provision such as easing of distress caused by
           difficult care events.; and

        -  ease of incorporation of personalised music therapy into the usual working practices of
           the care homes.

      These assessments will be provided through participation in structured focus groups. Care
      home staff will participate in up to 3 focus groups, conducted by a member of the research
      team, experienced in qualitative research, once the refined personalised playlist is
      completed, 2-4 months afterwards and at the conclusion of their participation in the study.
      If the care home staff are unable to participate in a focus group, a semi-structured 1:1
      interview will be conducted instead.

      As individuals with advanced dementia (whom the research team hopes to include in a
      subsequent feasibility study) may lack the capacity to communicate their music preference or
      emotional responses to listening to music, this study will explore using the outcome measures
      as an objective way of gauging their preferences and responses by comparing responses
      measured through biomarkers and subjective assessments given by individuals living with less
      severe stages of dementia and their carers, family and/or friends.

      The eventual larger scale study will explore issues of cost effectiveness, in addition to
      clinical effectiveness.

    <description>The primary outcome sought is the ability to generate a personalised playlist for a person living with dementia requiring an aggregate time input from the researchers, relatives/friends and/or their paid carer(s) of under 2 hours. This time input will consist of the time required to complete the music preferences questionnaire and the total elapsed time of the music listening session. During that music listening session, excerpts of tracks from a long list of 100 songs generated form the questionnaire responses are played to the person living with dementia and those tracks that elicit the strongest positive responses will be included in their final personalised playlist. The time required for each of these tasks will be recorded in activity logs by the researchers, carers and/or relatives/friends of the person living with dementia.</description>

    <description>A range of different methods will be tested to deliver (play) personalised music playlists once they are generated. The acceptance (or otherwise) of these methods (e.g. use of headphones, smart speakers, etc) will be assessed through qualitative research by gathering feedback from participants (people living with dementia, their relatives/friends and their carers) including from activity logs completed by carers and/or relative/friends, focus groups with carers and relative/friends and interviews with participants.</description>

    <description>The effectiveness (or otherwise) of machine learning analyses of changes in facial expression (using Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services Application Programming Interface with video recordings of music listening sessions) to derive quantitative measures of emotional responses to music listening will be assessed through analysis of the extent of correlation of these machine learning derived measures with direct observations of responses by researchers. Such observations will be recorded manually during the music listening session at which excerpts of the long list of tracks is played and will include observations of changes in pulse rate (measured with an Empatica 4 device) and of responses such as singing, dancing, smiling and movement of hands, feet or head.</description>

    <description>Reductions (or otherwise) in Behavioural and Psychological Symptoms (anxiety/agitation, depression/apathy, etc) will be assessed using qualitative research methods to analyse feedback from participants (people living with dementia, their relatives/friends and their carers) including from activity logs completed by carers and/or relatives/friends, focus groups and/or interviews with carers, participants and their relatives/friends. These measures will be combined with quantitative ones including responses to the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire and biomarkers such as changes in facial expression, pulse rate. Analyses of these data will be used to indicate whether variables such as the timing of listening to personalised music (how frequently, what time of day and whether it is before, during or after a difficult care event) affect the extent to which participants' well-being improves (or otherwise), using assessment of Behavioural and Psychological Symptoms as a proxy.</description>
