      The quasi-experimental research method evaluated the effectiveness of health coaching among
      frequent attenders in primary healthcare. The experimental group received the health coaching
      and the control group received the usual care. The data were collected with pre- and posttest
      12-month follow-up via a questionnaire of FINRISKI2012, RAND-36 and ACDI and clinical health
      outcomes measured by health-coaching nurses. The data were analyzed by statistical methods.

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The health-related quality of life was measured using the validated Finnish version of the RAND 36-Item Health Survey 1.0 (RAND-36). The 36-item self-report instrument consists of eight separate scales of quality of life: (1) physical functioning (10 items), (2) physical role functioning (four items), (3) emotional role functioning (three items), (4) social role functioning (two items), (5) bodily pain (two items), (6) mental health (five items), (7) energy (four items) and (8) general health (five items). The scores were calculated in a two-step process using the instructions provided by Ware et al. (1994) in the user´s manual. First, all items were scored on a scale from 0 to 100. A higher score defines a better health or function. Second, items in the same scale were averaged together to create the eight scale scores. Scale scores represented the average for all items in the scale.</description>

    <description>Adherence was measured using the Adherence of People with Chronic Disease Instrument (ACDI) (Kyngäs, 1999), a 38-item self-report instrument that has been used to measure adherence to health regimens among people with chronic disease</description>

    <measure>Lifestyle factors</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary outcomes were lifestyle factors. The baseline and follow-up questionnaires gathered data on the frequent attenders' alcohol consumption, smoking behaviour, and physical activity. They were based on a customized variant of the national FINRISK 2012 questionnaire</description>

    <description>The experimental group (n = 52) consisted of frequent attenders who had chosen the health-coaching program. The intervention was based on the customized nurse-led health-coaching program. The program consisted of an individual health-coaching nurse, health-coaching sessions and a written action plan according to each participant´s individual needs.</description>

    <description>The control group consisted of 58 frequent attenders. They, along with the experimental group, received the usual care regarding their health problems from the physicians and nurses at the primary healthcare centres if they needed it. The usual care for frequent attenders included assessment for the need of treatment, physical examination, problem assessment, laboratory and X-ray tests, medical advice and patient support and education during their visits.</description>
