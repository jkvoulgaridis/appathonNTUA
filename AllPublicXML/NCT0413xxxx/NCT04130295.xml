  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spasticity is muscle spasms, bouncing (clonus) or stiffness that can negatively impact the
      quality of life of people with spinal cord injury (SCI). In people with spinal cord injury,
      spasticity can limit muscle control of the arms and hands and cause pain, discomfort, and
      frustration. Transcutaneous electrical stimulation has been shown to reduce spasticity after
      SCI. However, this type of stimulation's effects during prolonged, at-home use has not been
      well studied. Additionally, traditional stimulation techniques are often only available in
      the clinic. Therefore, this study aims to identify if wearable intensive nerve stimulation
      decreases spasticity in the legs of people with SCI, and if this intervention is usable and
      desirable to individuals with SCI.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Involuntary muscle activation, also referred to as spasticity is a common characteristic of
      spinal cord injuries. It can present as stiffness, clonus, and spasms that can impact a
      person's ability to perform daily tasks. Over half of individuals with spinal cord injuries
      that have spasticity report medication alone does not control the spasticity. Because of this
      clinical research is investigation different ways to manage spasticity.

      Stretching and vibration have demonstrated the ability to reduce spasticity but only for
      short periods of time requiring repeated use of the intervention. Additionally, vibration
      devices are not very practical to implement at home due to their high cost. Due to these
      factors, a solution that could be used multiple times a day and remains cost effective is
      needed.

      Transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TENS) has also demonstrated effectiveness in reducing
      spasticity after one session but shows greater benefit when it is able to be used for
      multiple sessions. A wearable intensive nerve stimulator (WINS) device has been shown to be
      safe for daily wear which makes it a feasible solution to address spasticity at home.
      Research has not yet looked at the efficacy of using the WINS device for spasticity and this
      study proposes to begin to fill that gap.
