  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determin whether Roxadustat is safe and effective in the
      treatment of anemia and meanwhile reduces the risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular
      events in patients who have just initiated dialysis.

    <textblock>
      There is a screening period of up to 2 weeks, a treatment period of a minimum of 52 weeks and
      a maximum of approximately up to 3 years after last patient is randomized. A total of up to
      400 patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either open-lable Roxadustat or
      Active Control (Epoetin alfa).
