        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Any person over 18 years of age.

          -  Participant is willing and able to give informed consent for participation in the
             investigation.

          -  EITHER: Participant has Type 2 Diabetes OR: Person is a healthy volunteer

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The participant may not enter the investigation if they have any contraindication to
             magnetic resonance imaging (incl. pregnancy, extensive tattoos, pacemaker, shrapnel
             injury, severe claustrophobia).

          -  Any other cause, including a significant disease or disorder which, in the opinion of
             the investigator, may either put the participant at risk because of participation in
             the investigation, or may influence the result of the investigation, or the
             participant's ability to participate in the investigation
