  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this First-in-Human pilot study is to evaluate the safety and performance of
      REGENERA breast implant in a selected cohort of patients with non- malignant breast lesions
      treated with excision or lumpectomy in whom the tissue removed is replaced by REGENERA.

    <textblock>
      This is a pre-market, single center, interventional, open label, non-comparative, pilot
      first-in-human study on adult female patients with localized non-malignant breast lesion.
      This study will include an enrollment period of 12 months and 6 months study duration per
      patient.

      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the safety profile of a new breast
      implant (REGENERA) in excision or lumpectomy of non-malignant breast lesions.

      The secondary objectives of this study are:

        -  To assess the safety of the implant procedure

        -  To assess the feasibility of the implant procedure

        -  To evaluate the performance of REGENERA breast implant:

             -  In replacing the removed tissue

             -  In potential interference with current diagnostic standard of care imaging
                procedures

             -  On patient's quality of life and satisfaction

             -  On investigator's satisfaction.

    <description>Assess breast appearance before and after surgery with photo and chest measurement. In particular, the following measures, in cm, will be evaluated: sternal notch to nipple (SN), nipple to inframammary fold (NF), nipple to sternum (NM), the areola diameter and the ptosis grade.</description>

    <description>Assess the potential interference with current, standard- of-care imaging techniques by evaluation of the following factors: (1) for ultrasound, the possible attenuation of the acoustic beam preventing the visualization of the tissue behind the implant; (2) for magnetic resonance imaging, possible creation, caused by the implant, of images mimicking a pre-invasive or invasive lesion.</description>

    <time_frame>at 1 month from the implantation of the device (Day 0), 6 months from Day 0 versus 2 weeks before Day 0</time_frame>
    <description>Measure changes in patient's Quality of Life (QoL) and satisfaction through Breast-Q™ questionnaire (pre- and post-operative Breast Conserving Therapy (BCT) module version 2.0) after surgery versus baseline (prior implantation surgery).
Breast-Q™ questionnaire includes 7 scales measuring (i) breast satisfaction, (ii) psychosocial well-being, (iii) physical breast well-being, (iv) sexual well-being, (v) patient experience satisfaction with the surgeon, (vi) patient experience satisfaction with the medical equip and (vii) patient experience satisfaction with the hospital staff. Each scale is evaluated by defined questions where the patient has to answer by a numeric scale. For example: &quot;1&quot;, &quot;non of the time&quot;; &quot;2&quot;, &quot;a little of the time&quot;; &quot;3&quot;, some of the time; &quot;4&quot;, &quot;most of the time&quot;; &quot;5&quot;, &quot;all of the time&quot;. Once the questions are answered, a conversion table is applied to convert the raw scale summed score into a score from 0 (worst) to 100 (best).</description>

    <measure>Patient pain measurement through a Visual Analogue Scale</measure>

    <description>Assess pain intensity with a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) at each study visit. The VAS measure will be made through a cross (X) that the patient has to put along a bar. The left margin of the bar corresponds to &quot;no pain&quot; (0 score) and the right margin to &quot;worst pain&quot; (10 score).</description>

    <measure>Measure of the Investigator's satisfaction on the implantation procedure, through a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and an ad-hoc questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>implantation satisfaction (VAS + ad-hoc questionnaire) at the implantation of the device (Day 0) and REGENERA performance (VAS) at 6 months from Day 0</time_frame>
    <description>Assess investigator's satisfaction on the implantation procedure, through a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and an ad-hoc questionnaire (developed by the Sponsor), and on the REGENERA performance, through a VAS scale.
The VAS measure will be made through a cross (X) that the patient has to put along a bar. The left margin of the bar corresponds to &quot;no pain&quot; (0 score) and the right margin to &quot;worst pain&quot; (10 score).
The ad-hoc questionnaire has a unique scale made of 5 levels (1 corresponds to &quot;strongly disagree&quot; and 5 corresponds to &quot;strongly agree&quot;) to be used for each question. As there are 12 questions, 12 is the minimum score and 60 is the maximum score as a sum of all answers.</description>
