    <textblock>
      Ninety patients are involved in this study, who underwent arthroscopic lateral patellar
      release for lateral patellar compression syndrome and they had patellofemoral degenerative
      lesion, which diagnoses by MRI preoperatively and proved by arthroscopic examination to be
      early stages of degenerative changes with no loss of articular surface. The patients were
      divided in to two groups (A and B). Group A (45 patients) were treated by local injection of
      Hyaluronic acid intraarticularly, and Group B (45 patients) were no injection intraarticular.

      This study was done by one orthopedic surgeon in two hospitals. Ninety patients are involved
      in this study, who underwent arthroscopic lateral patellar release for lateral patellar
      compression syndrome and they had patellofemoral degenerative lesion, which diagnoses by MRI
      preoperatively and proved by arthroscopic examination to be early stages of degenerative
      changes with no loss of articular surface. The patients were divided in to two matched groups
      (A and B) regarding the age and gender; Group A (45 patients) were treated by local injection
      of Hyaluronic acid intraarticularly, 2 weeks after arthroscopy and were followed by VAS of
      knee pain for one year at (3) months, (6) months and (12) months, and Group B (45 patients)
      were no injection intraarticular. The study started on June (2017) and ends on March (2020).
      injection of Hyaluronic acid was used and followed in the same way. All patients presented
      with anterior knee pain which failed to respond to conservative treatment for 6 weeks or
      recurrent of symptoms after stopping of conservative treatment which involved changes of life
      style and NSAID. MRI done for all patients before operation.
