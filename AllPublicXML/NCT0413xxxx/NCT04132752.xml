    <textblock>
      The present study examined the effect of motivation on home exercise program and children's
      functional scores. 33 OBPP children (Narakas Type 2) aged between 0-18 months were divided
      into two groups. Intervention group was motivated via phone. Both groups were informed about
      OBPP, performed home exercises and filled exercise diary. Intrinsic Motivation Scale was used
      for measuring motivation and Gilbert and Raimondi Scoring and Active Movement Scoring were
      used for evaluating functional improvements at first assessment, 6th week and 12th week. For
      final comparison, parents were divided into two more groups (highly motivated and motivated
      group) based on motivation scores.

      Home exercise program is widely used for treatment of OBPP children. The present study
      examined the effect of motivation on home exercise program and children's functional scores.
      33 OBPP children (Narakas Type 2) aged between 0-18 months were divided into two groups.
      Intervention group was motivated via phone. Both groups were informed about OBPP, performed
      home exercises and filled exercise diary. Intrinsic Motivation Scale was used for measuring
      motivation and Gilbert and Raimondi Scoring and Active Movement Scoring were used for
      evaluating functional improvements at first assessment, 6th week and 12th week. For final
      comparison, parents were divided into two more groups (highly motivated and motivated group)
      based on motivation scores.

    <intervention_model_description>33 children with obstetric brachial plexus palsy (OBPP) were randomized into control or intervention groups. Both groups parents were informed about OBPP, given home exercise and exercise diary. Intervention group was called via phone weekly in order to motivate and answer questions. Children's functional scores and parents motivation was measured.</intervention_model_description>
