  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gout presents as intermittent acute painful and debilitating gout flares. High serum uric
      acid levels lead to the deposition of urate crystals in and around the joints, most commonly
      the big toe (also called podagra) and other peripheral joints. An acute gout flare causes
      extreme pain and inflammation of the afflicted joints. It initially presents as a
      monoarticular condition but can affect several joints as the disease progresses. Gout flares
      typically take 7-10 days to resolve.

      Currently, the inflammation and pain associated with acute gout flares are treated
      anti-inflammatories, including non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), colchicine,
      corticosteroids, and adrenocorticotropic hormone. However these drugs are limited in
      efficacy, contraindicated for some patients and may take more than 24 hours to relieve gout
      symptoms (e.g. colchicine).

      DYV700 will be developed to reduce the pain associated with acute gout flares. DYV700 is
      applied topically and utilizes a proprietary drug delivery system to deliver it's active
      ingredients.
