  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with breast cancer and metastatic axillary lymphadenopathy routinely undergo
      neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. For these patients, biopsy clip markers are inserted into the
      biopsy proven metastatic lymph node pre-treatment, as they may reach complete clinical
      response post-therapy. Limited axillary surgery, as opposed to a full axillary dissection,
      may then be indicated. It is still necessary to surgically excise the biopsy proven
      metastatic lymph node to accurately assess the pathologic response to therapy, and
      subsequently tailor post-surgical therapies appropriately. As such, these lymph nodes require
      pre-operative localization which, at The Ottawa Hospital, currently requires radioactive seed
      insertion under sonographic guidance, typically performed within 5 days of surgery. The
      procedure is often challenging, as both normal appearing lymph nodes and 3 mm biopsy clip
      markers are difficult and in some cases impossible, to visualize on ultrasound. At the time
      of surgery, the excised lymph node is radiographed, to ensure the radioactive seed and biopsy
      clip marker are both successfully excised. Localization with Ink has the potential to replace
      both the biopsy clip markers and radioactive seeds as the surgeons are able to directly
      visualize the Ink intra-operatively and excise the Inked lymph node. A preliminary study out
      of Stanford on 28 patients who underwent localization of axillary lymph nodes with Ink
      injected 1-211 days pre-operatively, in the pre neo-adjuvant and post neo-adjuvant settings,
      showed that lymph nodes injected with Ink are visible intra-operatively months after surgery,
      suggesting that this is a feasible localization technique (1).

    <description>There are two proposed studies utilizing the Ink during differing timepoints.Both will identify patients with breast cancer, with a biopsied metastatic axillary lymph node(LN) with a tissue marker clip placed, as is current practice. In Study A, 0.5mL of Black Eye Ink will be placed in the metastatic LN after neoadjuvant therapy. In Study B, 0.5mL of Black Eye Ink will be placed before neoadjuvant therapy. In both studies, the LN containing the tissue marker clip will be the one to have the radioactive seed and Ink inserted. The seed will still be inserted, in the event the dye is not well-visualized. In both studies, the surgeon will attempt to find the LN by direct visualization and then confirm the appropriate LN has been removed by using the Gamma probe and intra-operative radiographs. If the seed is not within the tattooed node, the LN containing the seed will also be removed. All lymph nodes injected with Ink will be removed by the surgeon;no Ink-injected node remains in body.</description>
