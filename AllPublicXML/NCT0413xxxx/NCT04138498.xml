  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to compare the bioavailability of CTx-1301
      (dexmethylphenidate) to the registered listed drug, Focalin XR and to evaluate dose
      proportionality of CTx-1301. In addition, this study seeks to characterize the
      pharmacokinetics of dexmethylphenidate and evaluate the safety and tolerability of CTx-1301.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will comprise of a randomized, single-dose, four-sequence, four-period, in-clinic
      crossover study in approximately 36 adult ADHD subjects. All subjects considered eligible at
      Screening will proceed to tolerability test day, dosing 40 mg Focalin XR to evaluate safety
      and tolerability of the higher dose of d-MPH. If subject is able to safely tolerate the test
      dose, and meets all inclusion/exclusion criteria, they will be considered eligible for
      randomization into the study. All subjects will be randomized to receive four treatments
      throughout the course of the study; one CTx-1301 trimodal d-MPH tablet containing 6.25 mg
      d-MPH, one Focalin 5 mg XR capsule, one CTx-1301 50 mg tablet, and one 40 mg Focalin XR
      capsule. Administration of study drug will occur only on Assessment Days; no study drug will
      be administered during screening or unscheduled days (USVs).

      The lowest and highest doses of CTx-1301 (dexmethylphenidate, 6.25 and 50 mg) were selected
      to bridge to the lowest and highest doses of Focalin XR (dexmethylphenidate, 5 and 40 mg) in
      this comparative BA study.

                  investigations (including ECG results, vital signs and/or laboratory

               8. Subject plans to undergo elective procedures/surgery at any time during the
                  study.

              10. Subject of child-bearing potential is pregnant or planning to become pregnant
                  during the duration of the study or within 30 days of the end of the study.

              11. Subject is breast-feeding during the study or within 30 days of the study.

          2. Medications

             shown to alter the PK of d-MPH.

             b. Use of any prescription medication within 14 days prior to Day -3 (ADHD medications
             must be discontinued at least 96 hours prior to check-in at Day -4), and/or use of any
             OTC medications (such as antacids, vitamins, minerals, dietary/herbal preparations,

             therapy at acceptable levels if stable at least 30 days prior to Day -4, through the
             duration of the study, and for 30 days after the study ends.

                  but must be stopped at least 96 hrs prior to check in at Day -4). Note: At the
                  discretion of an Investigator, the tests may be repeated. If THC is positive at
                  screening or check-in, a cannabis intoxication evaluation will be done by an
                  investigator at check-in only; inclusion will be at the investigator's
                  discretion, due to the slow release of THC from adipose tissue.

             participation.

          6. Clinical Studies

               1. Participation in another investigational product study (inclusive of final
                  post-study examination) or receipt of an investigational drug within the 30 days
