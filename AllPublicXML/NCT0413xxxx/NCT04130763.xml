      This study is designed to improve the response rate of anti-PD-1 among patients with
      anti-PD-1 resistant/refractory digestive (including gullet, stomach and intestine) system
      cancers through the intervention on their gut microbiota. Specifically, we will find healthy
      people that have the intestine similar to patients with Gastrointestinal (GI) system cancer
      who has responded to anti-PD-1 therapy, extract the gut microbiota of these healthy people to
      product FMT capsule, and then perform re-anti-PD-1 immunotherapy combined with FMT for GI
      system cancer patients whose anti-PD-1 treatment failed.
