  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this project is to understand how consuming a prescribed diet of
      different infant foods (which may contain cereals,fruits, vegetables, meats, dairy) during
      the time of early complementary feeding (~5 to 12 months) in breastfed infants has on growth
      trajectories, neurodevelopment and sleep patterns in relation to gut microbiota, compared
      with a traditional diet that is usually provided in the home to infants.

      The three primary aims include:

      Aim 1: Identify the effects that the prescribed early complementary feeding specific study
      diet has on growth trajectories in breastfed infants.

      Aim 2: Identify whether the relationship between the prescribed early complementary feeding
      specific study diet and growth is mediated by gut microbiota.

      Aim 3: Characterize infant neurodevelopment and sleep patterns.
