  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the analgesic effects of Pectoralis nerve block and Erector spina plane
      block in patients having mastectomy and sentinel lymph node dissection. Each one-third of
      patients will have erector spine block and pectoralis nerve block 30 min before general
      anesthesia , while other one-third of patients will have only general anesthesia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has been proven that pectoralis nerve block (PECs) and erector spine plane block (ESP)
      both supply effective analgesia in the first 24 hours after mastectomy. But they do so by
      different mechanishms.

      This study is to survey that ESP and PECs may supply acute and chronic analgesia by reducing
      pain scores in the first 24 hours and 3 months after the surgery, also the comparison of the
      analgesic activity among themselves for acute and chronic pain will be searched.

      In this study patients are divided into three groups. Group A - Patients in group A will have
      COMBIPECs block (PECs2 -&gt; PECs1) in a separate section from the operating rooms (PNB practice
      room). In addition, patient controlled analgesia (PCA) will be used in the first 24 hours
      postoperatively.

      Group B - Patients in group B will have ESP block in a separate section from the operating
      rooms (PNB practice room). In addition, patient controlled analgesia (PCA) will be used in
      the first 24 hours postoperatively.

      Group C - Patients in group C will not be performed planar nerve block. Only general
      anesthesia (GA) will be performed in the operation room. In addition, patient controlled
      analgesia (PCA) will be used in the first 24 hours postoperatively.

    <measure>Post-operative acute pain</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Pain status will be evaluated based on VAS scores in two different positions: arm at rest and arm in abduction. Pain status will be evaluated at 1-3-6-12-24. hours after surgery. Each VAS is scores 0-10. (0=no pain ; 10=pain as bad as can be)</description>

    <measure>Post-operative chronic pain</measure>
    <time_frame>3. month after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Pain status will be evaluated in the third month after surgery based on VAS scores in two different positions: arm at rest and arm in abduction. Each VAS is scores 0-10. (0=no pain ; 10=pain as bad as can be)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Opioid consumption in the first 24 hours after surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Morphine consumption in the first 24 hours will be counted by IV PCA. Patients will be able to request opioids via PCA device when the vas score is above 4 when the arm is in the resting position.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Remifentanil consuption during the surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>During the surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Following induction of general anesthesia, anesthesia maintenance will be continued with sevoflurane to BIS 40-50 (bispectral index). When the BIS is between 40-50, remifentanil infusion rate will be changed considering ± 20% changes in blood pressure compared to baseline values.The total amount of remifentanil consumed will be recorded.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The patients will be evaluated according to the five-stage verbal descriptive PONV scale. If it is 3 points or more, ondansetron 4 mg IV will be administered. Wait for 8 hours for the next dose of ondansetron. (0 = None, 1 = Slight nausea, 2 = Moderate nausea, 3 = Once vomiting, 4 = vomiting more than one)</description>
