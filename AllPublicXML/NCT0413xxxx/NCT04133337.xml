  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to investigate the safety and efficacy of SHR-1210 in combination
      with the anti-vascular survival target drug apatinib in patients with resectable NSCLC, and
      to provide new treatment options for neoadjuvant therapy in patients with the period IB-IIIA
      NSCLC.
