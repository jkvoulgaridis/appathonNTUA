  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to compare the effectiveness of maintenance therapy initiation with
      the combination treatment Tiotropium and Olodaterol (Olo+Tio) compared with LABA/ICS
      combination in COPD as the time to the first COPD exacerbation.

      Secondary objectives are to compare patients treated with Tio+Olo and patients treated with
      LABA/ ICS combination.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. At least one prescription for Tio+Olo combined inhaler or a LABA/ICS combined inhaler
             between 1 January 2013 and 31 March 2019.

               1. The first dispensing of either Tio+Olo or LABA/ICS combined inhaler will be
                  defined as the index date.

               2. For the main analyses, only fixed dose combination (FDC) inhalers will be
                  included. Sensitivity analyses will also accept free combinations of LABA/ICS.

          2. At least one diagnosis of COPD at any time prior to the index date.

          3. At least one year of continuous medical and pharmacy health plan eligibility prior to
             the index date will be required to allow a baseline period for the covariates and
             identification of new use of the study drugs.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. To increase the likelihood of a true diagnosis of COPD, we will exclude:

               1. All patients less than 40 years of age on the index date, and

               2. All patients with a diagnosis of asthma in the year prior to the index date

          2. To limit the population to those without severe lung compromise outside of COPD, we
             will exclude individuals with lung cancer, interstitial lung disease, or lung
             transplant identified at any time prior to the index date

          3. To restrict the cohort to new users of Tio+Olo or LABA/ICS, we will exclude any
             individual with use of either Tio+Olo, LABA/ICS, or LABA/LAMA/ICS combination therapy
             in free or fixed form for at least one year prior to the index date.
