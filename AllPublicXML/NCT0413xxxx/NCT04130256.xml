  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with multiple sclerosis (MS) have variable adherence to MS medications, making the
      full efficacy of disease modifying therapies unrealized and the assessment of true treatment
      failures challenging. Whereas some patients forget to take medications due to active
      lifestyles, others may have cognitive impairments that prevent them from organizing and
      planning their regular dosing schedules. An electronic pill cap (&quot;Pillsy&quot;) has been developed
      to record pill taking, timing, and set reminders through a mobile app. Data on adherence can
      be captured and analyzed remotely for health care provider review.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will enroll 70 adult patients, 18 years old and above, with relapsing
      remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), at the Massachusetts General Hospital MS Clinics in a
      pilot study of Pillsy electronic pill bottles. People with RRMS who are taking (1)
      fingolimod, (2) dimethyl fumarate, (3) terifluonomide, (4) diroximel fumarate, or (5)
      siponimod will be eligible. Patients must possess any type of smartphone capable of
      downloading the Pillsy application to be eligible. Per the Pillsy manufacturer, the Pillsy
      application is available on iPhones connected to the Apple App Store and smartphones running
      the Android operating system that are connected to the Google Play Store. Participants will
      be asked to use the Pillsy bottle for 90 days each. Participants will be randomized 1:1 to
      two conditions: 1) active reminders and 2) passive adherence tracking. Patients in the active
      reminders group will receive daily alerts through the Pillsy bottle, the Pillsy app, and
      their phone to remind them to take their pill. Patients in the passive adherence tracking
      group will not receive reminders and will instead have usual adherence monitored by the
      electronic pill bottle.
