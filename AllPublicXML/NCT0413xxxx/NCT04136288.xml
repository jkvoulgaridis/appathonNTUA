  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers are evaluating the efficacy of low intensity shockwave therapy (LISWT) via
      MoreNova in the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ED is broadly defined as the inability to achieve or maintain an erection sufficient for
      sexual intercourse or activity. Current treatment for ED consists of oral medications,
      intracavernosal injections and surgically placed penile prosthetics. In the literature this
      has been described as a Stepwise Approach, offering therapy beginning with the least invasive
      treatment option.

      The goal of LISWT is to restore natural erections and / or improve responses to oral
      medications (first line therapy).

      LISWT for ED is under evaluation in the USA. The European Association of Urology Guidelines
      on ED were recently updated to include LISWT for men with mild to moderate ED. The
      energy/pulse used in this application is approximately 10% of the energy used for
      disintegrating kidney stones; no serious side effects have been reported. Shock wave therapy
      for diabetic ulcers has recently been approved by the FDA.
