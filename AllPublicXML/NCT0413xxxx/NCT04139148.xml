    <textblock>
      Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) combined with computerized cognitive addiction
      therapy(CCAT) for methamphetamine(MA) dependent patients in voluntary drug rehabilitation
      center. Electronic medical systems were applied for drug related knowledge education,
      self-evaluation and outpatient follow-up reminder after intervention in order to reduce
      relapse behaviors.

    <measure>Change from Baseline cue-induced craving at 2 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were instructed to watch methamphetamine-related videos by VR and rate their level of craving after smelling and recalling the last time they engaged in drug use. Craving was assessed by visual analog scales (VAS), with 0 mm being &quot;no craving&quot;and 100 mm representing &quot;most craving ever experienced for methamphetamine&quot;.</description>
