  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, single-arm, postmarket registry enrolling up to 300
      participants who are planning to undergo balloon dilation of the Eustachian tubes for
      treatment of chronic/persistent Eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD). Procedural information
      will be collect as well as efficacy and safety data through 6 months post procedure.

    <measure>Change in mean Eustachian Tube Dysfunction Questionnaire (ETDQ-7) score</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline to follow-up in the mean overall ETDQ-7 score. The ETDQ-7 is a validated 7-item patient-reported questionnaire reporting the presence and severity of symptoms associated with Eustachian tube dysfunction. Each item is scored from 1 (normal) to 7 (severe). The overall score is the mean score of the 7 items.</description>

    <description>Details of the balloon dilation procedure, including setting, anesthesia, technical success, concomitant procedures, procedure/device-related adverse events, and recovery time.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Minimal clinically important difference in ETDQ-7 score</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants achieving the minimal clinical important difference in overall ETDQ-7 score (reduction from baseline of 0.5 points or more). The ETDQ-7 is a validated 7-item patient-reported questionnaire reporting the presence and severity of symptoms associated with Eustachian tube dysfunction. Each item is scored from 1 (normal) to 7 (severe). The overall score is the mean score of the 7 items.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Revision Eustachian tube dilation</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants who require revision dilation on an ear that was treated in the initial procedure.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Surgical interventions</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants requiring surgical ear intervention (other than balloon dilation) on an ear that was treated in the initial procedure but has recurrent or continuing ETD symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Participant satisfaction: Proportion of participants indicating satisfaction and willing to recommend the procedure to friends or family</measure>

    <description>Percentage of participants indicating satisfaction and willing to recommend the procedure to friends or family.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in work productivity/activity impairment</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants complete the validated Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) at baseline and 6 month follow-up. The questionnaire consists of 6 questions that evaluate absenteeism, presenteeism, work productivity loss, and activity impairment over the previous week. Results are expressed as the percentage of impairment from 0 to 100, for which higher numbers indicate worse outcomes (ie, greater impairment and less productivity). Absenteeism is calculated by dividing the number of hours missed by the sum of the numbers of hours missed plus the number of hours worked. Presenteeism, is calculated by dividing the response to productivity at work question by 10, while activity impairment is calculated by dividing the response to the ability to carry out daily activities question by 10. Finally, the overall work impairment/productivity loss is calculated as the sum of absenteeism and the product of presenteeism and time at work.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in chronic rhinosinusitis symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete the validated 22-item SinoNasal Outcomes Test (SNOT-22) to evaluate change in chronic rhinosinusitis symptoms. Each of the 22 symptoms on the questionnaire are rated by the participant from 0 (no problem) to 5 (bad). A sum of the 22 item scores provides the overall score, which can range from 0 to 110.</description>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Improvement in ability to perform a Valsalva maneuver</measure>
