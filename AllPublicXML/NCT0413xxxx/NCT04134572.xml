  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      REM is a retrospective and prospective registry, finalized to care and research. It is
      articulated in main sections - strongly related and mutually dependent on each other -
      corresponding to different data domains: personal information, clinical data, genetic data,
      genealogical data, surgeries, etc..

      This approach has been individuated in order to corroborate and integrate data from different
      resources and aspects of the diseases and to correlate genetic background and phenotypic
      outcomes, in order to better investigate diseases pathophysiology.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The common way to collect patient information is frequently chaotic and inconvenient
      (sometimes even unsafe), particularly when dealing with rare diseases. The need to simplify
      the diagnostic process and to overcome the difficulties of data storage and analysis,
      suggested in 2013 to implement the Registry of Ollier Disease and Maffucci Syndrome (ROM).

      The ROM relies on an IT Platform named Genotype-phenotype Data Integration platform
      -GeDI.This solution, realized by a collaboration among Medical Genetic Department and a local
      software-house (NSI - Nier IT Solution), is a General Data Protection Regulation
      (GDPR)-compliant, multi-client, web-accessible system and it has been designed according to
      current medical informatics standards (Orphanet code, ICD-10, Human Genome Variants Society,
      Findability Accessibility Interoperability Reusability Principles). GeDI is continuously
      implemented to improve management of persons with Ollier Disease and Maffucci Syndrome and to
      help researchers in analysing collected information. ROM is articulated in main sections:

      Personal data: it comprises general information, birth details and residence data Patient
      data: including the patients internal code, the hospital code and other details on patients
      Diagnosis: the diagnosis, the status (affected, suspect, etc.), age at diagnosis,
      comorbidities, allergies, etc.

      Genogram: a tool to design family transmission of the disease, flanked by info on diseases
      status of all included relatives Clinical events: records 23 signs and symptoms of Ollier
      Disease and Maffucci Syndrome and 12 additional items to describe the disease Genetic
      Analysis and Alteration: including technique, sample information, duration of analysis, etc.
      In addition, this section comprises detailed information on detected pathological variants
      (gene, international reference, DNA change, Protein change, genomic position, etc.) Visits:
      it includes the typology of the visit (genetic, orthopaedic, rehabilitation, paediatric,
      etc.), the date of the visit, treatment, prescription, imaging, etc.

      Surgeries: this section contains information on the surgeries type, the age of the patients,
      the site/localization of the procedures, etc.

      Documents: this repository is allowed to store all type of documents (radiological reports,
      imaging, consents, clinical reports, etc.) Consents: this section comprises a complete
      overview of all collected consents, including the date of collection.

      Samples: it comprises the type of samples (DNA, tissue, whole peripheral blood, etc.)

    <description>To maintain an established registry in order to assess epidemiology and natural history (such as incidence, prevalence, etc.).
Collection of:
Physical examinations data:
Stature (cm)
Weight (kg)
Number and localization of sites affected by enchondromas
Presence/absence of angiomas
Localization and number of deformities
Localization and number of functional limitations
Surgical procedures disease-related:
Type of surgeries
Number of surgeries
Site of surgeries
Age at surgeries
Genetics background: studies of somatic variants
Family history: anamnestic family information
Number: count of enchondromas, deformities, etc. Localization: defined using bone affected, site (proximal, distal, etc.) and side (left, right, both)
Clinical, orthopaedic and functional features are updated at each follow up. Clinical reports, medical charts and imaging are the primary source of data.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Genotype-Phenotype Correlation among clinical features and eventual molecular background</measure>
    <time_frame>25 years</time_frame>
    <description>Despite the unclear genetic background of Ollier disease and Maffucci syndrome, the secondary outcome aims to correlate genotype and phenotype. This includes, but is not limited to clinical features and genetic background. This will be pursued using the information collected during visits and follow-ups and the genetic information resulting from molecular investigations.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Longitudinal study of disease evolution (including prospective and retrospective data)</measure>
    <time_frame>25 years</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome aims to investigate the evolution of Ollier Disease and Maffucci Syndrome during time.
Main clinical features evaluated:
Height (cm) age-related (compared to growth chart)
Number and localization of enchondromas
Number and localization of deformities
Number and localization of functional limitations
Site at malignant transformation (adult)
Age at malignant transformation (adult)
Number: count of enchondromas, deformities, etc. Localization: defined using bone affected, site (proximal, distal, etc.) and side (left, right, both)
Those data will be collected both retrospectively and prospectively for all patients via physical examination, clinical reports and imaging.
An evaluation of these parameters will be performed at each visit to keep trace on the progression of the clinical manifestations. Data will be collected to define annualized rate of new clinical manifestations related to age, using analyses such as Kaplan-Meyer and surviving rate.</description>
