    <textblock>
      For Group A, after screening, eligible subjects will be treated from day 1 and followed up
      for 24 months.

      For Group B, the study includes two phases as follows:

      Main study phase: It is randomized, evaluator-blinded and no-treatment controlled. After
      screening, all eligible subjects will be randomized either to the Treatment Group or the
      Control Group in a 2:1 ratio. All the subjects will be followed up for 12 months.

      Extension study phase: After the main study phase, the Treatment Group will be followed up
      for additional 12 months.

      Each subject assigned to Group A and Treatment Group will receive up to 4 injection sessions
      with 5(±1) weeks intervals.

      Subjects assigned to the Control Group will not receive treatment during the study.

          1. Known/previous allergy or hypersensitivity to any of the constituents of the product.

          2. Known/previous allergy or hypersensitivity to local anaesthetics, e.g. lidocaine or

          3. History of severe or multiple allergies, such as anaphylaxis.

          4. Previous tissue revitalization treatment with laser or light, mesotherapy,
             radiofrequency, ultrasound, cryotherapy, chemical peeling or dermabrasion in the area
             to be treated within 6 months before treatment.

          5. Previous surgery (including aesthetic facial surgical therapy or liposuction),
             piercing or tattoo in the area to be treated.

          6. Previous tissue augmentation therapy or contouring with any permanent
