      To evaluate the efficacy and safety of AKCEA-TTR-LRx after administration for 65 weeks to
      patients with hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloid polyneuropathy (hATTR-PN), as
      compared to the NEURO-TTR trial (NCT01737398). For more information, please visit

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label study in up to 140 participants, who will be randomized to
      receive subcutaneous (SC) injections of either AKCEA-TTR-LRx once every 4 weeks or inotersen
      once a week. Participants will also receive daily supplemental doses of the recommended daily
      allowance of vitamin A. Participants included in the inotersen reference arm will be crossed
      over to AKCEA-TTR-LRx at Week 37 after completing the Week 35 assessments.

    <measure>Change from baseline in mNIS+7 at Week 66</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 66</time_frame>
    <description>The mNIS+7 composite score is a measure of neurologic impairment that evaluates muscle weakness, sensation, reflexes, nerve conduction, and autonomic function. The mNIS+7 composite score has a range of -22.32 to 346.32, and a higher score indicates lower function.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in Neuropathy Symptom and Change (NSC) score at Weeks 35 and 66</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 35, Week 66</time_frame>
    <description>NSC score is a questionnaire composed of 38 questions that assess the presence and severity of these neuropathy symptoms (including weakness, loss of temperature and pain sensation, and manifestations associated with autonomic nervous system dysfunction).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in the Physical Component Summary (PCS) score of the 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36) at Week 65</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 65</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 is composed of 8 multi-item scales (35 items) assessing physical function (10 items), role limitations due to physical health problems (4 items), bodily pain (2 items), general health (5 items), vitality (4 items), social functioning (2 items), role limitations due to emotional problems (3 items) and emotional well-being (5 items). Each of the 8 scales is scored from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating better health. The 8 scales can be aggregated into a PCS score, which is also scaled from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating better health.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Polyneuropathy Disability (PND) score at Week 65</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 65</time_frame>
    <description>The PND is a 6-stage scoring system: Stage 0: no impairment; Stage 1: sensory disturbances but preserved walking capabilities; Stage 2: impaired walking capacity, but ability to walk without a stick or crutches; Stage 3A/B: walking with help of 1 or 2 sticks or crutches; Stage 4: confined to wheel chair or bedridden.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in modified body mass index (mBMI) at Week 65</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 65</time_frame>
    <description>mBMI is defined as body mass index in kilograms per square meter (kg/m^2) multiplied by serum albumin in grams per liter (g/L)</description>
