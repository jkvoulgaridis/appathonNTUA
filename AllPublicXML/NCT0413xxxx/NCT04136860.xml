  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are complex and rare cerebral vascular dysplasia. The main
      purpose of treatment is to avoid the neurological impairment caused by hemorrhagic stroke.
      The Spetzler-Martin (SM) grading system is widely used to estimate the risk of postoperative
      complication based on maximum AVM nidus diameter, pattern of venous drainage, and eloquence
      of location. Generally, grade I and II are amenable to surgical resection alone. Grade III is
      typically treated via a multimodal approach, including microsurgical resection, embolization,
      and radiosurgery (SRS). Grade IV and V are generally observed unless ruptured. However, some
      previous studies indicated that despite the high rate of poor outcomes for high-level
      unruptured AVMs, the mortality for high-level unruptured AVMs are likely lower than untreated
      patients. With the development of new embolic materials and new intervention strategies,
      patients with high-level AVMs may have more opportunities to underwent more aggressive
      interventions. The OHAVM study aims to clarify the clinical outcomes for patients with SM
      grade IV and V AVMs after different management strategies.

      Follow-up: In our neurosurgical center, follow-up was conducted for all patients at the first
      3-6 months and annually after discharge by clinical visit and telephone interview.

      Study overview: The population in the OHAVM study will be divided into two parts. Clinical
      and imaging data of high-level AVM patients from 2012/04 to 2019/09 were retrospectively
      collected. And the high-level AVM patients from 2019/09 to 2019/12 were prospectively
      collected. The intervention strategies in our institution for high-level AVMs are of four
      categories: microsurgical resection, embolization, embolization+radiosurgery, and
      single-stage hybrid surgery (embolization-resection). Each participants will be followed at
      least for 5 year since enrollment. Finally, we will clarify the clinical outcomes and
      prognostic predictors for patients with SM grade IV and V AVMs after different management
      strategies.

      Sample size: About 1000 patients will be enrolled in this study, and half of them were
      unruptured. The population distribution of different management strategies is expected as
      follows: conservative:100 cases, microsurgical resection: 300 cases, embolization:250 cases,
      embolization+radiosurgery: 250 cases, single-stage hybrid surgery: 100 cases.

      Study endpoints: The neurological function prognosis, occlusion rate and complications were
      evaluated at 2 weeks, 1 year, 3 years, 5 years after the treatment and the last follow-up,
      respectively.

    <description>Hybrid surgery is a new surgical strategy defined as single-stage combined microsurgical resection and embolization in which embolization is performed firstly on the deep feeding artery, aneurysm, AVF, and meningeal arteries involved in blood supply of the nidus, and then, the microsurgical resection was performed immediately. Intraoperative angiography was performed repeatedly before the skull was closed, confirming complete occlusion of the malformation.</description>
