      Neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer could make unresectable breast cancer be
      resectable and improve breast conservation rate. Patients with triple negative or Her2
      enriched subtype who achieved pCR after neoadjuvant chemotherapy would have better survival.
      But the overall pCR rate of breast cancer was about 20%. And patients with luminal like
      subtype were less reactive for neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Improving pCR rate maybe could
      achieve better survival. So, different methods have tried to select effective drug before
      chemotherapy.Drug sensitivity screening in vitro for different chemotherapy drugs was a
      promising method. This study will explore whether drug screening by culturing breast cancer
      cells in vitro from breast cancer tissue could consistent with neoadjuvant chemotherapy in
      patients.40 breast cancer patients were recruited.The results of drug sensitivity in vitro
      and pathological evaluation after neoadjuvant chemotherapy were compared whether they were
      consistent.

      patients.40 breast cancer patients who would receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy were
      recruited.Breast cancer tissues were obtained before chemotherapy. The breast cancer cells
      were cultured in unadhesive dishes. Chemotherapy drugs were put in dishes and drug
      sensitivity were evaluated. Patients received operation and pathological evaluationc after
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The results of drug sensitivity in vitro and pathological
      evaluation after neoadjuvant chemotherapy were compared whether they were consistent.
