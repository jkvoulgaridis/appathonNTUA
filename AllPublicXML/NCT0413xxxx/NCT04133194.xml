  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several oral mesalazine (5-ASA) formulations exist, but the regimes require several tablets
      per day. Such regimens are not ideal and can interfere with normal daily activities of
      patients. Non-adherence has been associated with an increase in the risk of relapse and worse
      disease course; leading to a decrease in quality of life, an increase in societal and
      personal costs, and worst case increases the risk of colorectal cancer. Recently, a new
      formula for 5-ASA has been approved by the Danish Medicine Agency, with a single tablet
      regime per day.

      Primary purpose:

      • To investigate whether a simplified treatment regimen for 5- ASA (1600 mg as one tablet per
      day [intervention]) improves adherence with preserved remission rates compared to
      conventional therapy.

      Secondary purposes:

        -  Compare levels of endoscopic, mucosal and histological inflammation in predicting risk
           of relapse between the intervention group and the conventional therapy group.

        -  Investigate whether a simplified treatment regimen improves the disease course compared
           to the conventional therapy.

        -  To assess the correlation between different endpoints and the disease courses, with the
           use of clinical, endoscopic, histological, self-reported and biochemical markers.

        -  Improve, correlate and assess patient-reported outcomes in a prospective manner.

        -  To establish a biobank of cases with quiescent/mild ulcerative colitis (UC) for
           identification of future biomarkers.
