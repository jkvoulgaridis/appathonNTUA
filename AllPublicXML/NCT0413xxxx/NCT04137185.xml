      This phase 1 and 2 study of rhTSH, To observe the safety and tolerability characteristics of
      different doses of rhTSH in patients after thyroidectomy, and to observe the dose-limiting
      toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) that may occur in the set dose group.The
      study is a Non-randomized, open, one-arm study.
