  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total hip arthroplasty refers to the replacement of the femoral head and acetabulum damaged
      by disease or trauma with an artificial hip joint, thereby restoring joint activity and
      original function. Acute kidney injury is a common complication after total hip arthroplasty.
      Previous studies have shown that the incidence of acute kidney injury after hip replacement
      is as high as 21.9%. Acute kidney injury has become a global safety issue, and the occurrence
      of acute kidney injury can lead to an increase in hospital stay, medical costs and increased
      risk of death.There is currently no global survey of the incidence of AKI, and only a number
      of studies have been conducted on specific patient groups (eg, inpatients, intensive care
      units [ICU] patients or children) due to differences in study design and definition of acute
      kidney injury.

      The incidence and prevalence of different studies vary widely, ranging from 0.32% to 44.30%.
      There are few studies on the risk factors associated with acute kidney injury after total hip
      arthroplasty, and early acute kidney injury is often overlooked due to the limitations of the
      current KDIGO-based diagnostic method. Therefore, it is particularly important for clinicians
      to understand the risk factors for postoperative acute kidney injury .
