  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      REM is a retrospective and prospective registry, finalized to care and research. It is
      articulated in main sections - strongly related and mutually dependent on each other -
      corresponding to different data domains: personal information, clinical data, genetic data,
      genealogical data, surgeries, etc..

      This approach has been individuated in order to corroborate and integrate data from different
      resources and aspects of the diseases and to correlate genetic background and phenotypic
      outcomes, in order to better investigate diseases pathophysiology.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The common way to collect patient information is frequently chaotic and inconvenient
      (sometimes even unsafe), particularly when dealing with rare diseases. The need to simplify
      the diagnostic process and to overcome the difficulties of data storage and analysis,
      suggested in 2013 to implement the Registry of Multiple Osteochondromas (REM).

      The REM relies on an IT Platform named Genotype-phenotype Data Integration platform
      -GeDI.This solution, realized by a collaboration among Medical Genetic Department and a local
      software-house (NSI - Nier IT Solution), is a General Data Protection Regulation
      (GDPR)-compliant, multi-client, web-accessible system and it has been designed according to
      current medical informatics standards (Orphanet code, ICD-10, Human Genome Variants Society,
      Findability Accessibility Interoperability Reusability Principles). GeDI is continuously
      implemented to improve management of persons with Multiple Osteochodromas and to help
      researchers in analysing collected information. REM is articulated in main sections:

        -  Personal data: it comprises general information, birth details and residence data

        -  Patient data: including the patients internal code, the hospital code and other details
           on patients

        -  Diagnosis: the diagnosis, the status (affected, suspect, etc.), age at diagnosis,
           comorbidities, allergies, etc.

        -  Genogram: a tool to design family transmission of the disease, flanked by info on
           diseases status of all included relatives

        -  Clinical events: records more than 20 signs and symptoms of Multiple Osteochondromas and
           12 additional items to describe the disease

        -  Genetic Analysis and Alteration: including technique, sample information, duration of
           analysis, etc. In addition, this section comprises detailed information on detected
           pathological variants (gene, international reference, DNA change, Protein change,
           genomic position, etc.)

        -  Visits: it includes the typology of the visit (genetic, orthopaedic, rehabilitation,
           paediatric, etc.), the date of the visit, treatment, prescription, imaging, etc.

        -  Surgeries: this section contains information on the surgeries type, the age of the
           patients, the site/localization of the procedures, etc.

        -  Documents: this repository is allowed to store all type of documents (radiological
           reports, imaging, consents, clinical reports, etc.)

        -  Consents: this section comprises a complete overview of all collected consents,
           including the date of collection.

        -  Samples: it comprises the type of samples (DNA, tissue, whole peripheral blood, etc.)

    <description>To maintain an established registry in order to assess epidemiology and natural history (such as incidence, prevalence, etc.) of Multiple Osteochondromas.
Collection of:
physical examinations data: assessment of severity of the disease (defined according to Mordenti et al classification)
orthopaedic and functional data: stature (cm), weight (kg), number and localization of sites affected by osteochondromas, site of malignant transformation, definition of deformities (localization and number), definition of limitations (localization and number)
surgical procedures: type, number and site of surgeries disease-related and age at surgeries
genetics background: target gene, type of mutation, type of variant detected, clinical significance
family history: inheritance in maternal or paternal line
Clinical, orthopaedic and functional features are updated at each follow up. Clinical reports, medical charts, genetic report and imaging are the primary source of data.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Genotype-Phenotype Correlation among clinical features and molecular background</measure>
    <time_frame>25 years</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary outcome comprises the correlation between genotype and phenotype. This includes, but is not limited to clinical features and genetic background. This will be pursued using the information collected during visits and follow-ups and the genetic information resulting from molecular investigations.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Longitudinal study of disease evolution (including prospective and retrospective data)</measure>
    <time_frame>25 years</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome aims to investigate the evolution of Multiple Osteochondromas during time. This will be evaluated within the families and among the families.
Main clinical features, such as height (cm), number and localization of osteochondromas, number and localization of deformities, number and localization of limitations will be collected both retrospectively and prospectively for paediatric population. An evaluation of these parameters will be performed at each visit to keep trace on the progression of the clinical manifestations.
In adult population, the disease evolution is centered on malignant transformation.</description>
