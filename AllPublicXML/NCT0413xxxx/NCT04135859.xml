  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will adapt a physical activity lifestyle intervention to emerging adult congenital
      heart disease (CHD) survivors with the primary goal of increasing physical activity levels.

      The study will be split into 2 phases. In Phase 1, participants will be asked to complete
      questionnaires, wear an accelerometer around the waist for 7 days, and undergo an exercise
      stress test. The accelerometer and exercise stress test will be used to determine whether
      participants are eligible to be randomized for the intervention study. In Phase 2,
      participants will be randomized to one of two conditions: 1) receiving a physical activity
      tracker (a Fitbit) or 2) receiving a Fitbit AND engaging in videoconferencing sessions with a
      physical activity coach. During Phase 2, participants will also be asked to complete 3
      assessments (weeks 9 and 22, and a 6-month follow-up). The week 9 assessment will consist of
      completing questionnaires and wearing an accelerometer for 7 days. Week 22 will be similar to
      week 9 with the addition of a final exercise stress test. The 6-month follow-up will mirror
      the week 9 assessment.

      Participants who are randomized to the videoconferencing condition will be asked to meet with
      a physical activity coach 8 times over the course of 20 weeks. Coaches will help participants
      to (1) change attitudes toward physical activity, (2) increase perception of others' approval
      of physical activity (e.g., family members, peers), and (3) increase participants' perceived
      control by troubleshooting barriers and increasing efficacy for physical activity. Coaches
      will use the Fitbit to facilitate self-monitoring and goal setting. Participants in the
      intervention arm will be asked to participate in a focus group at the conclusion of the study
      to share their experiences.
