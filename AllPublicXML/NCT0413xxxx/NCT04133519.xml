  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Abdominal Pain Intensity Responder</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 4-weeks post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint of this study is abdominal pain intensity. The Instrument is a 0-10 numeric rating scale (NRS, 0= no pain, 10= worst pain). The subject is asked to record their &quot;worst abdominal pain over the past 24-hours&quot;.
An Abdominal Pain Intensity Responder is defined as a subject who experiences a decrease in the worst abdominal pain in the past 24 hours score (measured daily on a 0-10 scale) and averaged over the 4-week post-treatment assessment period of at least 30 percent compared with baseline 4-week average</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Abdominal Pain Frequency</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 4-weeks post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Mean change in reported abdominal pain frequency</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Stool Consistency</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 4-weeks post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Mean change in reported stool consistency by Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS). The BSFS is a visual aid that allows patients to classify their bowel movements into seven groups ranging from diarrhea (watery stools) to constipation with separate hard lumpy stools. The mid range bowel movements 3,4 and 5 define normal stools. The effect of treatment on the proportion of normal bowel movements will be assessed.</description>

    <measure>Stool Frequency</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 4-weeks post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Mean change in reported stool frequency</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health-related Quality of Life using the IBS Quality of Life (QOL) Instrument</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 4-weeks post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The IBS QOL is a 34 item IBS-specific, validated instrument. The 34 items are summed for a total score and then transformed to 0-100 scale with higher scores indicating better IBS specific quality of life. IBS QOL scores will be compared pre and post treatment and the mean difference compared by treatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Work Productivity and Absenteeism by the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 4-weeks post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Productivity and absenteeism will be evaluated using tne WPAI (General Health). Outcomes are expressed as impairment percentages with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity (worse outcomes). WPAI scores will be compared pre and post treatment and the mean difference compared by treatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anxiety and Depression measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 4-weeks post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The PHQ-4 is a four question assessment of anxiety and depression. The first two questions assess anxiety and the second two depression, allowing for individual assessment and and an overall score. Each question is scored 0-3 with a maximal score of 12 indicating severe impairment. PHQ-4 scores scores will be compared pre and post treatment and the mean difference compared by treatment.</description>

             duration of the study

          -  Male or female, aged 18-70

          -  Confirmation of the IBS and IBS subtype diagnosis by a study site physician using Rome
             IV diagnostic criteria

          -  Possess an iOS or Android smartphone or iOS tablet (iPad) released in 2015 or later

          -  Agreement to input information about their abdominal pain and bowel movements on a

             the conclusion of the study, and to have the data used for research purposes.

          -  Agreement to maintain stable dosage of IBS medications during the course of treatment
             and not to add new IBS medication or stop current IBS medications unless directed to
             do so by the participants treating physician. Changes in treatment will be captured
             using a concomitant medication assessment.

          -  Average &quot;Worst Daily Pain Severity&quot; of &gt;3 on a 11-point numeric rating scale (NRS)
             over the full 28-day symptom tracking period

             participant's IBS symptoms (e.g., celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease - Crohn's

             or bowel resection)

          -  Medication use, other illnesses or conditions that can explain their gastrointestinal
             symptoms e.g.,regular narcotic use or dependency, OTC stimulant laxative dependence
             (i.e, progressively larger doses of Senna or Bisacodyl containing compounds are needed
             to produce a bowel movement), history of radiation to the abdomen.

          -  Inability to commit to completing all treatment sessions

          -  Have an unstable extraintestinal condition whose immediate or foreseeable treatment
             needs would realistically interfere with study demands, e.g., ability to participate
             in online treatment sessions or follow daily diary.

             dissociative disorders, or gross cognitive impairment)

          -  Subjects that report a current gastrointestinal infection or an infection within the 4
             weeks prior to the evaluation that would otherwise obscure IBS symptoms. In cases of
             gastrointestinal infection baseline evaluation will be delayed a minimum of 4 weeks
             until after complete recovery.

          -  Current or recent use of a gut-targeted antibiotic such as Neomycin or Rifaximin
             during the 12 weeks prior to baseline assessment. In the case of treatment with
             rifaximin or neomycin, eligibility will be suspended for 12 weeks from the initial
             date of use.
