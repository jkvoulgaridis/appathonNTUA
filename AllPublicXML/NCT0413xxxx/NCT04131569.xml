  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antimicrobial resistance is a major threat worldwide and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase
      producing Enterobacteriales (ESBL-E) are a leading cause because of their wide dissemination.
      Gut microbiota seems to be correlated with multi-drug resistant organism carriage. This study
      thus aims to analyse the correlation between gut microbiota, ESBL-E fecal carriage and
      subsequent infection.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The rising antimicrobial resistance has led to more than 33,000 deaths in Europe in 2015.
      Among them, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E) are the
      most frequent in Europe and have disseminated both in the community and in healthcare
      settings. Some studies have suggested that microbiota could be different between multi-drug
      resistant organisms, with different relative abundances of some bacteria. One study focused
      on ESBL-E fecal carriers, but in the community, with Bacteroides uniformis being more
      abundant in ESBL-E non-carriers than carriers. As identification of species discriminating
      between ESBL-E fecal carriers and non-carriers could pave the way for the design of ESBL-E
      carriage eliminating probiotics, we aim to analyse the correlation between gut microbiota and
      ESBL-E fecal carriage.

      Moreover, mechanisms in the link between ESBL-E fecal carriage and subsequent ESBL-E
      infection remain, so far, poorly understood and this study aims to provide a first insight in
      the involvement of gut microbiota in the link between colonization and infection.
