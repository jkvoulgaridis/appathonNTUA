  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Smoking is a significant cause of damage to health and quality of life specifically for
      Veterans with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Smoking cessation interventions for this
      population are lacking. The primary aim of this project is to explore smoking cessation
      treatment preferences among Veteran smokers living with HIV. The study team will refine the
      design and content of a smoking cessation treatment for Veteran smokers living with HIV. The
      intervention uses mobile health and telehealth technology to personalize smoking cessation
      counseling and medications and provide relapse prevention text messaging.

      Although smoking is a significant cause of damage to health and quality of life specifically
      for Veterans with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), smoking cessation interventions for
      this population are lacking. The primary aim of this project is to qualitatively explore
      smoking cessation treatment preferences among Veteran smokers living with HIV. The study team
      will refine the design and content of an intervention that uses mobile health and telehealth
      technology to a)individually personalize smoking cessation counseling and pharmacotherapy,
      and b) provide relapse prevention messaging support. It is a personalized, tailored,
      multi-component intervention for smoking cessation specifically designed for Veteran smokers
      living with HIV.

      This project is highly significant given that: 1) smoking is prevalent among and particularly
      harmful for HIV-positive Veterans; 2) there is a dearth of research on smoking cessation for
      Veterans with HIV; 3) current approaches to smoking cessation in this population are not
      effective; 4) as the largest US provider of HIV health services, VHA is an ideal setting; and
      5) the proposed intervention follows the VA Blueprint for Excellence, which prioritizes
      mobile health and treatment personalization to increase reach/efficacy.
