  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-arm, randomized, double-blinded, multicenter phase III clinical study to
      evaluate the efficacy of HLX10 combined with chemotherapy versus placebo combined with
      chemotherapy for neoadjuvant/adjuvant treatment of gastric cancer.

      Subjects will be randomized to the following two arms at 1: 1 ratio:

        -  Arm A (HLX10 arm): HLX10 combined with chemotherapy will be adopted in the neoadjuvant
           treatment phase, and HLX10 monotherapy will be administered in the adjuvant treatment
           phase;

        -  Arm B (control arm): Placebo combined with chemotherapy will be given in the neoadjuvant
           treatment phase, and chemotherapy alone will be administered during the adjuvant
           treatment phase.

      Chemotherapy regimen SOX (oxaliplatin + tegafor gimeracil oteracil potassium (S-1)) will be
      used in the neoadjuvant treatment phase in Arm A and B, and in the adjuvant treatment phase
      in Arm B.

      After randomization, subjects will receive a total of 3 cycles of neoadjuvant treatment with
      the mentioned treatment regimen.Surgery will be performed within 3-6 weeks after the last
      cycle of neoadjuvant treatment.All subjects who have completed the surgery will be unblinded
      after surgery, and adjuvant treatment will be started 3 to 12 weeks after surgery. Subjects
      randomized to Arm A (HLX10 arm) will continue to receive HLX10 monotherapy for up to 17
      cycles (12 months).Subjects in Arm B after surgery (control arm) will continue to use
      chemotherapy alone (oxaliplatin + S-1) for 5 cycles.
