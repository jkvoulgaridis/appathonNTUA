      This is an open label, single-site, first-in-human, Phase Ia study to assess safety and
      immunogenicity of the Plasmodium falciparum malaria vaccine candidate Pfs25-IMX313 in
      Matrix-M1 adjuvant in healthy adults living in the UK

      Volunteers will receive 3 doses of vaccine over 2 months and will be followed up for
      approximately 8 months.

      This Phase 1a clinical trial is designed primarily to assess the safety and tolerability of
      the Pfs25-IMX313/Matrix-M transmission blocking vaccine in healthy adult volunteers. An
      important secondary objective is to to assess the immune response to the vaccine.

      8 volunteers will receive 3 doses of 10µg Pfs25-IMX313 in 50 µg Matrix-M1 on days 0, 28 and
      56. Blood samples will be taken for safety testing and to collect information about the
      immune response. Any symptoms that occur after vaccination will also be recorded.

      Healthy volunteers aged 18-45 will be recruited in England at the Centre for Clinical
      Vaccinology and Tropical Medicine, Churchill Hospital, Oxford.

    <description>The following parameters will be assessed:
Frequency, duration and severity of solicited local reactogenicity signs and symptoms for 7 days following each vaccination
Frequency, duration and severity of solicited systemic reactogenicity signs and symptoms for 7 days following the vaccination
Frequency, duration and severity of unsolicited adverse events for 28 days following the vaccination
Change from baseline for safety haematological and biochemical laboratory measures, which will presented according to local grading scales, for 28 days following vaccination

    <description>Pfs25-specific immunogenicity will be assessed by immunological assays, with comparison before and after vaccination. The main outcome measures will be humoral and B cell responses to the Pfs25 protein - total IgG, isotypes and avidity; T cell responses to Pfs25 by ex vivo ELISpot and flow cytometry assays.</description>
