  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      IL-2 is a pleiotropic cytokine which can regulate or stimulate the differentiation and
      function of CD4+, CD8+ and NK cells. An opened-labelled trial and a retrospective study have
      indicated the incidence of infection is lower in the treatment of low-dose IL-2 combined with
      corticosteroid and immunosuppressor. We are going to conduct a multi-center prospective
      observational study to verify the above results.

      We are going to conduct a multi-center prospective observational study, and plan to enroll
      500 SLE patients. Low-dose IL-2 is defined as 100IU IL-2 injected subcutaneously every other
      day for two weeks, followed by two-week break as one treatment cycle, and at least three
      weeks.There will be 250 patients in low-dose IL-2 group which treat with IL-2 combined with
      steroid and immunosuppressor. Non-IL-2 group is only treat with steroid and immunosuppressor.
      These patients are followed by every one month until get infected, otherwise, patients will
      be followed for two years. We focus on the type, positive microorganisms, grade and treatment
      of infection. Then, we will compare the differences of above parameters between these two
      groups.

    <description>IL-2 is a medicine which can use in autoimmune disease, infection or cancer with different dose. Low-dose IL-2 preferentially used in autoimmune disease, such as SLE. Our enrolled SLE patients will divided into two groups depend on whether use IL-2 or not, combined with corticosteroid and immunosuppressor.</description>

        Depending on the incidence of infection in our retrospective study, Low-dose IL-2 group was
        14.1%, non-IL-2 group was 25.2%. α was 0.05, β was 0.2, After the calculation of sample
        size, with the addition of about 20% patients for loss of follow-up, we plan to enroll 500
        patients, and 250 patients in every groups equally.
