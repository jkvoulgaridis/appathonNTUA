  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will examine whether a health promotion campaign using community organizing and
      joint advocacy by a coalition of tenants, health providers, social service agencies and
      advocates can lead to improvements in building conditions and health in social housing.

      This community based participatory research project will bring together patients of the St.
      Michael's Hospital Academic Family Health Team (FHT) who are tenants of Toronto Community
      Housing Corporation (TCHC) with health providers, legal service staff at the Health Justice
      Program, social service agencies and advocacy organizations to advocate to improve building
      conditions in three TCHC buildings. The researchers will evaluate the acceptability and
      feasibility of this health promotion campaign as well as changes in the state of housing and
      self rated physical and mental health of tenants.

    <description>All tenants in three TCHC buildings will be invited to participate in a survey on their building conditions at baseline, 6 months and 12 months. Once baseline data collection is complete, there will be a community organizing campaign involving tenants to advocate for improved building conditions.</description>

    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Community Organizing</intervention_name>
    <description>The intervention will be community organizing and will consist of engaging tenants, health providers, legal service staff, social service agencies and advocacy organizations (e.g. ACORN). Each building team will identify initial priorities and then invite all building members to discuss and to finalize, as well as a plan for change. Building teams will engage in advocacy to TCHC and its representatives, and other city departments as appropriate. Engaging in advocacy will consist of a wide range of activities but essentially means presenting evidence (e.g. personal experiences, data) to policymakers and decision makers to affect change.</description>
