  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autologous fat grafting, also known as lipofilling, is a surgical technique consisting in the
      processing and transfer of adipose tissue from one area in our organism (hips, thighs) to
      region which in need of reconstructive and aesthetic correction. The technique is frequently
      used after radical or conservative mammary surgery, aiming to achieve better aesthetic
      results, reduce pain induced by both surgery and radiotherapy. The scientific community was
      widely involved in the debate regarding the use of mesenchymal/stem cells in a patient with
      high risk of tumor progression due to their elevated proliferative profile. This study aims
      to retrospectively evaluate the oncological safety in the use of lipofilling in patients who
      underwent oncological and reconstructive treatment in our Institute.
