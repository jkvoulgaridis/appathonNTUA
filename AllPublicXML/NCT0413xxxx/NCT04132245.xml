    <textblock>
      Many obesity related risk factors are strikingly apparent in minority populations.
      Mexican-American children have the highest rates of overweight. The goals of this study are
      to: 1) test the acceptability of a 14-week family-based intervention with 3-5 year old
      children and their parents; 2) Estimate the effectiveness of a 14-week family-based
      intervention designed to show smaller changes, on average, in BMI appropriate for growth; 3)
      estimate the effectiveness of a 14-week family-based intervention designed to produce changes
      in television viewing, physical activity, fat, fiber, and fruit and vegetable intake in 3-5
      year old Latino children and their parents at post-intervention and Year 1 follow-up.
