  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A recent Institute of Medicine monograph brought attention to high rates of diagnostic error
      and called for better educational efforts to improve diagnostic accuracy.1 Educational
      methods, however, are rarely tested and some educational efforts may be ineffective and
      wasteful.2 In this study, we plan to examine whether explicit instruction on diagnostic
      methods will have an effect on diagnostic accuracy of 2nd-year medical students and internal
      medicine residents.

    <textblock>
      Research has shown that expert diagnosticians use a two-step process to confirm a diagnosis:
      hypothesis generation to generate diagnostic possibilities, followed by hypothesis
      verification to confirm the most likely diagnostic possibility.3-5 The first step appears to
      be non-analytical, related to pattern recognition. The second step could be calculated using
      analytical reasoning, however, physicians rarely make an overt calculation of conditional
      probabilities. Instead, experienced clinicians typically use an implicit habit or heuristic
      called &quot;anchoring and adjusting&quot; to incorporate diagnostic testing information into their
      thinking.6,7 Cognitive psychologists have postulated that anchoring and adjusting provides a
      way that probability estimates can be updated based on additional new evidence. Most of the
      discussion in the literature focuses on how this heuristic can lead to biased thinking
      because of base-rate neglect or anchoring.6 Very little discussion is on how this heuristic
      could be improved to yield more accurate probability estimates and whether proper use of the
      heuristic could be taught.

      The degree to which a diagnostic test should lead to an adjustment of a probability estimate
      depends on the operating characteristics of a test, that is, the sensitivity and specificity.
      Likelihood ratios, once understood, are easier to incorporate into one's thinking, and thus
      could be used to calibrate the anchoring and adjusting heuristic.7

      In this randomized trial, we tested whether explicit conceptual instruction on Bayesian
      reasoning and likelihood ratios would improve Bayesian updating, compared with a second
      intervention where we provided multiple (27) examples of clinical problem solving. The third
      arm provided minimal teaching about diagnosis, but no explicit teaching or examples.

    <measure>Accuracy of participants probability revisions were compared to posttest probability revisions that were calculated using Bayes Rule. An effect size was calculated to measure how close students matched the calculated revision.</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-test was taken within 72 hours of instructional phase completion.</time_frame>
    <description>To perform the effect size analysis, two transformations were performed. First, the difference between the subjective estimate and the Bayesian calculation of post-test probability was squared to remove negative differences and permit combining of the effects of positive and negative test results. Second, a correction based on the intrinsic error of a probability estimate was applied by dividing each squared difference by p(1-p). In this manner, we transformed each raw difference to a squared effect size (difference / error of difference). Finally, the square root was computed, to transform the data back to an effect size. The resulting effect size was then used for statistical analysis. For this primary analysis, a mixed model ANOVA was used.</description>

    <description>Students will receive a brief instruction conceptually discussing sensitivity and specificity (e.g. &quot;a sensitive test will be positive at even low levels of disease. However, this can lead to a number of false positive errors, when the test is positive even when there is no disease. As a result, it is most useful for ruling out a diagnosis&quot;). They will then work through a total of 30 cases, 10 for each condition, in blocked sequence. For each brief written case they will be asked for a probability of diagnosis after the clinical information is presented. The test result will then be given and they will be asked for a post-test probability. Their estimate will be compared to the computed value based on published estimates of sensitivity and specificity and feedback provided.</description>
