  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Purpose of this study is to assess the relative bioavailability, dose proportionality,
      the impact of food on the rate and extent of absorption, palatability of the selected
      pediatric formulation of maribavir and the safety and tolerability of two candidate pediatric
      formulations and the adult tablet formulation of maribavir in healthy participants.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in two parts (Part 1 and Part 2). Part 1 consists of three
      treatment periods in six sequences and part 2 consists of four treatment periods in four
      sequences. In Part 1 two pediatric candidate powder formulations will be compared with
      maribavir 200mg tablet under fasted conditions in regards to their bioavailability and
      palatability. In Part 2 dose proportionality and impact of food (a high-fat meal) on the rate
      and extent of absorption of the selected pediatric formulation will be assessed. The
      pediatric formulation which will be evaluated in Part 2 will be chosen based on the results
      of planned analysis of Part 1 PK and palatability data from two candidate pediatric
      formulations and the doses to be evaluated in Part 2 may be adjusted based on relative
      bioavailability of the selected pediatric formulation (powder for oral suspension) to the
      Phase 3 tablet formulation observed in Part 1.
    </textblock>
  </detailed_description>
  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    The study was stopped because based on the planned interim analysis of the data of Part 1,
    palatability of both pediatric formulations was not acceptable.
