  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, patients who underwent lumbar spine surgery in our hospital were included. A
      prospective study was conducted to investigate the effects of early mobilisation on
      postoperative complications, functual outcomes and patient satisfaction after robotic
      assisted lumbar spinal surgery.

    <description>Low back pain and leg pain is an important sign and a frequent patient complaint. The VAS pain scoring standard (scores from 0 to 10) was as following: 0 means painless; 1-3 means mild pain that the patient could endure; 4-6 means patient was in pain that could be endured and be able to sleep; and 7-10 means patient had intense pain and was unable to tolerate the pain.</description>

    <measure>Japanese Orthopedic Association</measure>
    <time_frame>preoperative</time_frame>
    <description>The Japanese Orthopedic Association score was used to evaluate the neurological function of patients with lumbar degeneration and treatment effectiveness. The highest possible total score from categories for a normal person is 29 points. Therefore, treatment improvement rate = [(post-treatment score - pre-treatment score) / (29 - pre-treatment score)] × 100%, and ≥75% means excellent; 50%-74% means good; 25%-49% means fair; 0-24% means poor.</description>

    <measure>Oswestry Disability Index</measure>
    <time_frame>preoperative</time_frame>
    <description>The Oswestry Disability Index is one of the principal condition-speciﬁc outcome measures used in the management of spinal disorders. Rounding the percentage to a whole number is suggested for convenience. So the final score may be summarized as: [total score / (5 × number of questions answered)] × 100%. It is suggested rounding the percentage to a whole number for convenience. We defined that 0-20% means mild; 21%-40% means moderate; 41%-60% means severe; 61%-80% means very severe；80%-100% means patients very exaggerated symptoms.</description>
