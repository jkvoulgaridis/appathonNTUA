    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effectiveness and safety of ulipristal acetae (UPA) in women with
      symptomatic uterine fibroids. Those who fulfilled inclusion/exclusion criteria will be
      treated UPA at daily dose of 5mg.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is increasing evidence approving role of medical therapy in treatment of symptomatic
      uterine fibroid, in the context of women's desire to preserve fertility or not to undergo
      operation.

      Among these hormonal therapies, ulipristal acetate (UPA) is an orally administered selective
      progesterone receptor modulator commonly prescribed for treatment of uterine fibroid. This
      agent acts on causing apoptosis of the muscle cells inside the tumor and reducing the tumor
      matrix in case of uterine fibroid.

      UPA at daily dose of 5 mg has been shown to decrease menstrual blood loss and reduce tumor
      size after 13 consecutive weeks of treatment.

    <time_frame>from first dose to the end of 3 consecutive months of treatment course</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of subjects achieve amenorrhea at the end of treatment. Amenorrhea is defined of 35 consecutive non-bleeding days, in which spotting is accepted.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>time from treatment to amenorrhea</measure>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>uterine fibroid size change</measure>
    <time_frame>from first dose to the end of 3 consecutive months of treatment course</time_frame>
    <description>the total volume of the 3 largest uterine fibroids will be measured. Uterine fibroid size change will be calculated by percentage of the figure at the end of treatment in comparison to at baseline.</description>

    <measure>pelvic pain control</measure>
    <time_frame>from first dose to the end of 3 consecutive months of treatment course</time_frame>
    <description>Pelvic pain assessed by visual analogue score (VAS). The minimum score is 0, which means no pain at all. The maximum score is 10, which means unbearable pain. Higher scores mean worse outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>from first dose to the end of 3 consecutive months of treatment course, and the end of 3 months follow-up without treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants have adverse events. Adverse events are defined as any undesirable experience occurring to a subject during a clinical trial, whether or not considered related to the intervention</description>

    <measure>Uterine fibroid symptom and health - related quality of life score change</measure>
    <time_frame>from first dose to the end of 3 consecutive months of treatment course</time_frame>
    <description>Uterine Fibroid symptom and health - related quality of life questionnaire (UFS-QOL) consists of 37 questions to assess symptoms of uterine fibroid and their impacts on women's quality of life. Each answer is scored from 1 to 5, in which 1 equals not at all and 5 equals all of the time. The minimum score is 0 and the maximum score is 185. Higher scores mean worse outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Abnormal endometrial features and thickness</measure>
    <time_frame>from first dose to the end of 3 consecutive months of treatment course</time_frame>
    <description>Endometrial thickness is assessed via transvaginal ultrasound every month after initiation of treatment. Endometrial biopsy is performed at baseline and at the end of treatment.</description>

    <measure>abnormal liver function test findings</measure>
    <time_frame>from first dose to the end of 3 consecutive months of treatment course</time_frame>
    <description>Liver enzym (AST, ALT) is assessed every month after initiation of treatment. A two-fold or more increase in level of liver enzym is abnormal.</description>
