  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this research is evaluate if HBMT reduces HAB in Soldiers, reduces
      intra-team conflict, improves trust, and improves unit cohesion. A secondary purpose of this
      research is to test Soldier acceptability and perception of the training. Volunteers will be
      randomized to a training or placebo version of a computer task designed to reduce HAB and
      interpersonal conflict. Soldiers will then complete surveys at multiple time intervals
      before, during, and following deployment. If successful, this research would demonstrate the
      ability of a computer based training to improve unit cohesion and Soldier attitudes during
      pre-deployment training and deployment itself.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of a double blind randomized controlled trial of HBMT (versus placebo)
      with subsequent pre-, during, and post-deployment surveys to assess the effectiveness of HBMT
      to influence relevant unit- and Soldier-level outcomes. Soldiers will be Command directed to
      participate. As such, all data will be used for briefing to unit leadership, however,
      participants will be asked to consent whether they allow their data to be used for research
      purposes. Subordinate units within the BN will be randomly assigned to complete either an
      active training or placebo version of the task. The individual briefing the Soldiers during
      training sessions will not know which version of the training the Soldiers are completing on
      the computer. Up to 40 Soldiers will complete HBMT at a time on individual study computers.
      Brief surveys will follow each training. There will also be a survey shortly before
      deployment, during deployment and shortly after deployment. See Appendix Q for tentative
      study timeline. For details on procedure see Section 9.8. Surveys completed during same day
      as HBMT training sessions will be completed on experimenter provided laptops, whereas surveys
      completed independent of an HBMT training session will be completed in pencil and paper
      format. See section 219.8 for details. The current protocol provides details for the first
      time point (initial HBMT training session). Additional amendments will be used to provide
      details and obtain approval for subsequent time points as these are coordinated with the
      unit. However, general information for follow-on time points is provided in this version of
      the protocol.

    <description>A computer-based training to reduce hostile bias and interpersonal conflict as a mechanism to improve trust and cohesion within an operational military unit across the deployment cycle. The computer training is based on the Go/No-Go task (Fillmore et al., 2006) and Lexical Decision Task (Lepore &amp; Brown, 2002). The training reduces HAB by affecting two cognitive mechanisms: prime seeking non-hostile concepts when presented with ambiguous cues and conditioning inhibition in response to hostile cues. Thus, the training induces a non-hostile attribution bias while simultaneously training the inhibition of hostile attribution bias and aggressive behavior in response to ambiguous cues.</description>

    <description>Volunteers in the placebo condition will be told to complete the fragments with the first word that comes to mind. This placebo still exposes volunteers to the training stimuli and computer task, but does not train inhibition or selectively prime non-hostility, which are the hypothesized mechanisms of the training.</description>
