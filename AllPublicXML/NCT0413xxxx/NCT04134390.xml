  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aged fragile patients are not usually included in clinical trials and efficacy and
      tolerability of the different available treatments in this population are unknown.

      Conversely, ageing has been associated with a decrease in the efficacy of immune checkpoint
      inhibitors due to a decline in the effectiveness of the immune system (immunosenescence). In
      the Checkmate 025 trial comparing nivolumab with everolimus, the Hazard Ratio (HR) in
      patients older than 75 years old favoured everolimus, 1.23 (0.66-2.31). Thus, TKis might be a
      better treatment option for this population. However, the absence of data and concerns about
      possible secondary effects associated, can preclude clinicians to treat aged fragile patients
      with cabozantinib. A pilot phase II trial would help to have data on safety and efficacy of
      cabozantinib in this aged fragile population.

      In METEOR trial around 60% of patients reduced the dose of cabozantinib because of toxicity
      and tolerance problems. It is suspected that the efficacy of cabozantinib in the population
      to be included in this trial (aged and fragile) will be similar to that observed in CABOSUN
      trial (disease control rate around 75%). However, there is no information available in this
      group of patients. On the other hand, in the &gt;75 years old subgroup within the METEOR trial,
      37% discontinued due to adverse events, 85% needed dose reductions and median average daily
      dose was 33,6 mg. For this reason, the cabozantinib initial dose chosen for patients to be
      included in this study is 40 mg/day.
