  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hormonal changes after SG and OAGB involve alterations in the levels of many enteric
      hormones, among these hormones are ghrelin and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). Ghrelin is an
      orexigenic hormone that stimulates food intake and has a documented role in the development
      of obesity. While ghrelin levels decrease significantly after SG as the fundus, which is the
      main source of that hormone, is completely removed, they tend to increase after OAGB GLP-1
      plays an important role in glucose homeostasis via affecting food intake and satiety. It
      enhances insulin secretion, stimulates the proliferation and growth of pancreatic beta cells,
      inhibits food and water intake, and promotes satiety. Some studies reported that both OAGB
      and SG are followed by increased GLP-1 levels. We conducted this randomized study to compare
      SG and OAGB with regards to weight loss, comorbidity resolution, changes in ghrelin and GLP-1
      hormones, and complications.
