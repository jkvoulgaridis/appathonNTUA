  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aggressive behaviour among adolescents is a social problem that can be reduced by social
      problem-solving interventions. However, these interventions usually include more than one
      technique, and the specific techniques that are effective in reducing and preventing
      aggression remain to be identified. Therefore, the main aim of this study is to test whether
      the instruction and practice of problem-solving on their own are effective in changing
      aggressive behaviour among adolescents.

      As the intervention in this trial is aimed at the general population, it will be delivered
      online. The rapid growth in the use of the Internet among young people provides an
      opportunity to deliver interventions universally in a cheap and efficient way.

      Problem-solving skills are fundamental to effective behaviour change. Therefore,
      problem-solving skills will be measured to assess whether they mediate the effect of the
      intervention on aggressive behaviour.

      Finally, young people with callous-unemotional traits are less likely to change their
      problematic behaviour such as aggression after an intervention. Therefore,
      Callous-Unemotional traits will be measured to assess if they act as a moderator of
      effectiveness.

      It is expected that participants randomised to the intervention improve their problem-solving
      skills and consequentially, reduce their aggressive behaviours. In addition, participants
      with lower callous-unemotional traits are expected to have a greater change.

    <description>The steps of problem-solving are explained to the participants. Then, they are presented two conflictive situations and they are asked to apply the problem-solving steps to find a solution. Once they finish, they are asked to apply the steps in a conflictive situation they have experience in the last month. In the end, they are reminded of the steps and encouraged to practice them in their daily conflicts.</description>
