  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change over time in social support measured using the Duke Social Support Index (DSSI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6-week follow-up (immediately post-intervention), 12-week follow up (12 weeks post-intervention), 12-month follow-up (12-months post-intervention).</time_frame>
    <description>A 10-item self-report questionnaire used to measure an individual's satisfaction with social support using a Likert scale (3-point scale, where anchor labels are specified for each item). This scale consists of two subscales: 4-item social interaction (objective support) scale and 6-item satisfaction with social support (subjective support) subscale. Total scores are calculated by summing responses to items across all items; total scores range 10-30.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change over time in perceived social isolation measured using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Social Isolation Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6-week follow-up (immediately post-intervention), 12-week follow up (12 weeks post-intervention), 12-month follow-up (12-months post-intervention).</time_frame>
    <description>An 8-item self-report questionnaire used to measure perceived social isolation using a Likert scale (5-point scale: 'never' = 1 to 'always' = 5). Total raw scores range from 8-40; raw scores are converted to T-scores using an appendix (T-scores are standardized scores that have a mean of 50 and SD of 10). Higher T-score values represent greater perceived social isolation.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change over time in depression symptomatology measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6-week follow-up (immediately post-intervention), 12-week follow up (12 weeks post-intervention), 12-month follow-up (12-months post-intervention).</time_frame>
    <description>A 9-item self-report questionnaire used to measure symptoms of depression. Items are rated using a Likert scale (4-point scale: 'not at all' = 0 to 'nearly every day' = 3). Total scores are calculated by summing responses to items 1-9; total scores range 0-27.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change over time in functional disability measured using the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS 2.0)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6-week follow-up (immediately post-intervention), 12-week follow up (12 weeks post-intervention), 12-month follow-up (12-months post-intervention).</time_frame>
    <description>A 12-item self-report questionnaire used to assess functioning in six domains of life:
Domain 1: Cognition - understanding and communicating Domain 2: Mobility - moving and getting around Domain 3: Self-care - attending to one's hygiene, dressing, eating and staying alone Domain 4: Getting along - interacting with other people Domain 5: Life activities - domestic responsibilities, leisure, work and school Domain 6: Participation - joining in community activities, participating in society.
Items are rated using a Likert scale (5-point scale: 'none' = 0 to 'Extreme/cannot do' = 4). Total scores are calculated by summing responses to items 1-12; total scores range 0-48.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Acceptance of the Tele-BA intervention using a modified version of the Treatment Evaluation Inventory (TEI)</measure>
    <time_frame>6-weeks follow-up (immediately post-intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>An 11-item self-report questionnaire used to measure intervention acceptability. For this project, reference to &quot;Treatment&quot; will be substituted with &quot;Tele-BA.&quot; Items are rated using a 7-point Likert scale. Response values range 1-7 with different verbal anchors for each item. Total scores are calculated by summing responses to items 1-11; total scores range 11-77. The TEI consists of an 8-item General Acceptability subscale and a 3-item Negative Aspects (e.g., discomfort) subscale.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change over time in social activities participation using the Social Engagement/Activities Questionnaire (SEAQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6-week follow-up (immediately post-intervention), 12-week follow up (12 weeks post-intervention), 12-month follow-up (12-months post-intervention).</time_frame>
    <description>A 10-item self-report questionnaire used to measure homebound older adults' participation in a range of social-group activities, interpersonal interaction activities with family and friends, and solitary activities while taking account of their physical and functional health limitations and social circumstances under which they live. Items are rated using a Likert scale (6-point scale: 'not at all' = 0 to 'every day' = 5). Total scores are calculated by summing responses to items 1-10; total scores range 0-50.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change over time in coping strategies using the Brief COPE</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6-week follow-up (immediately post-intervention), 12-week follow up (12 weeks post-intervention), 12-month follow-up (12-months post-intervention).</time_frame>
    <description>A 16-item self-report questionnaire used to measure use of coping strategies for difficult situations. Items are rated using a Likert scale (4-point scale: 'not at all' = 0 to 'a lot' = 3). Total scores are calculated by summing responses to items 1-16; total scores range 0-48.</description>
