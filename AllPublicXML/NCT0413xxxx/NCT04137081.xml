    <description>Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) questionnaire will be used to assess anxiety. The GAD-7 uses a 4-point Likert scale where 0 is &quot;Not at all&quot; to 3 &quot;Nearly every day&quot;. Scores can range from 0 to 21 and higher scores indicate increasing severity of anxiety.</description>

    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Two, single-item questions from the emotional exhaustion and cynicism domains of the Maslach Burnout Inventory will be used to assess burnout. Both questions are on a 7-point Likert scale where 0 is &quot;never&quot; and 7 is &quot;every day&quot;. Scores can range from 0 to 7 for each domain and higher scores indicate increasing levels of burnout.</description>

    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Program engagement will be assessed based on the number of modules completed. The program has 30 modules therefore scores scan range from 0 to 30 modules.</description>

    <description>The Unwinding Anxiety program is delivered via a smartphone-based platform, which includes a progression through 30+ daily modules of brief didactic and experience-based mindfulness training (videos and animations), app-triggered check-ins to encourage engagement, and user-initiated guided mindfulness exercises to help disrupt worry cycles in the moment.</description>

    <description>Unwinding Anxiety is an app-based mindfulness training program which includes a progression through 30+ daily modules. Each module's training is delivered via short video tutorials and animations (~10 min/day). Each training builds on the previous one; modules are 'locked' so that they can only be viewed at a pace of 1/day (previous modules can be reviewed at any time). A built-in self-assessment is taken after every seven modules to ensure key concepts are learned before moving on with automated suggestions on which modules to repeat based on self-assessment results. User-initiated guided practices range from short exercises (30 seconds) to manage anxiety the moment it arises to formal guided meditations (up to 15 minutes), and can be accessed at any time.</description>
