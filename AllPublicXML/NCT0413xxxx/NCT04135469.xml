  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study to understand what percentage of families in the pediatric clinic at
      Boston Medical Center (BMC) currently file taxes and use free tax preparation and would
      accept and use referral to a free tax preparation service. The investigators specifically
      want to understand which of two methods of connecting to free tax preparation (referral
      versus navigated connection) is more effective. Also studied will be the feasibility of using
      surveys on financial wellness and other health indicators to track participants' health.

      These pilot findings will be used to design a larger study that aims to assess whether
      integrating free tax preparation services into a pediatric clinic can increase tax filing
      rates and, as a result, the amount of money families receive in tax refunds. Additionally,
      the investigators hope to understand whether receiving this service impacts parental stress
      as well as how parents and babies are using the healthcare system.
