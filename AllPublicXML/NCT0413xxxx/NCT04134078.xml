  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sudden cardiac arrest (CA) is a leading cause of death worldwide. CA claims the lives of an
      estimated 300,000 Americans each year. Despite advances in cardiopulmonary resuscitation
      (CPR) methods, only approximately 10% of adults with CA survive to hospital discharge, and up
      to 60% of survivors have moderate to severe cognitive deficits 3 months after resuscitation.
      Most of the immediate and post-CA mortality and morbidity are caused by global ischemic brain
      injury. The goal of this grant application is to test the hypothesis that resuscitation from
      cardiac arrest can be improved by improving cerebral oxygenation through inhalation of nitric
      oxide. This strategy will also improve the chances of return of spontaneous circulation
      (ROSC), improve short-term survival and neurologic outcome.
