  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is treatment of choice for insomnia. Many patients in
      psychiatric care have sleep problems including insomnia, but are rarely given the choice to
      participate in CBT to improve their sleep. Patients with Anxiety disorders and Affective
      disorders display high levels of sleep difficulties. Sleep problems are often general, such
      as insomnia and sleep phase problems. In a previous pilot study, the investigators of the
      current study developed a CBT protocol that would target sleep problems in this population.
      The basis was CBT for insomnia (CBT-i), but also including techniques that would alleviate
      sleep phase problems, (e.g. the systematic use of light and darkness), and techniques to
      target more general sleep related problems (e.g. difficulties waking up in the morning), that
      are also common in psychiatric patients. This treatment was well tolerated and gave moderate
      effects on insomnia severity in the pilot study. In a naturalistic randomized controlled
      trial, the investigators now evaluate the effects of this psychological treatment on sleep
      and anxiety and affective symptoms in patients at the program for Anxiety and Affective
      disorders, Southwest Psychiatry, Stockholm County Council, Sweden.

    <time_frame>Changes from base-line to 8 weeks, 5 months and 14 months</time_frame>
    <description>Self-rating questionnaire regarding the use of sleep promoting behaviors. The questionnaire was constructed for the larger BSIP project and consists of two parts. The first part includes statements such as &quot;Last week I got out of bed within 15 minutes of waking up&quot; to be answered by number of days the last week this was true (i.e. from 0 to 7). The second part is to be answered on a 6-point Likert scale from &quot;Not at all true&quot; to &quot;Entirely true&quot;, with 7 statements like &quot;I get out of bed the same time every morning&quot;. No total score is obtained.</description>
