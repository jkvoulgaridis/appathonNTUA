    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants who have a body weight within 55-95 kilograms (kg) and body mass index
             (BMI) within the range 18.0-27.0 kilogram/meter square (kg/m2) (inclusive)

          -  Participant has given written informed consent before any study-related activities are
             carried out - Participants with ethnic origin: Mexicans (example: Caucasians,
             Indigenous peoples and Mestizos) - No smoking

          -  Participants with good physical and mental health status, determined on the basis of
             the medical history and a physical examination

          -  All values for biochemistry and hematology tests of blood and urine within the normal
             range or showing no clinically relevant deviation as judged by the Investigator

          -  Other protocol defined inclusion criteria could apply

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants with any surgical or medical condition, including findings in the medical
             history or in the pre-study assessments, or any other significant disease, that in the
             opinion of the investigator, constitutes a risk or a contraindication for the
             participation of the participant in the study or that could interfere with the study
             objectives, conduct or evaluation

          -  Participants with history of surgery of the gastrointestinal tract which could
             influence the gastrointestinal absorption and/or motility according to the
             Investigator's opinion

          -  Participants with allergy: ascertained or presumptive hypersensitivity to the active
             drug substance and/or formulations' ingredients; history of anaphylaxis to drugs or
             allergic reactions in general, which the Investigator considers may affect the outcome
             of the trial

          -  A subpopulation of participants with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma, which
             may include chronic rhinosinusitis complicated by nasal polyps; severe, potentially
             fatal bronchospasm; and/or intolerance to aspirin and other nonsteroidal
             anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Because cross-reactivity between aspirin and other
             NSAIDs has been report in such aspirin-sensitive patients, Cataflam is contraindicated
             in patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity

          -  Receipt of any prescription or non-prescription medication within 2 weeks before the
             first study drug administration, including multivitamins and herbal products (example:
             St John's Wort), including acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), and hormonal contraceptives in
             females

          -  Participants with renal failure or renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance &lt; 80
             milliliter per minute [mL/min]) as assessed by using the estimated measure with the
             Cockcroft-Gault formula

          -  Other protocol defined exclusion criteria could apply
