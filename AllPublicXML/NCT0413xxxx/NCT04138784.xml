  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Knee osteoarthritis is a common condition characterized by pain and functional disability in
      older people. Prevalence increases with age and is more frequent in older women. The aim of
      this study was to assess the effects of an 8-weeks individualized comprehensive
      rehabilitation program with elastic bands on pain and functional disability in chronic knee
      osteoarthritis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main symptoms of knee osteoarthritis are pain and functional disability. These symptoms
      are caused by a progressive loss and deterioration of articular cartilage with reactive new
      bone formation at the joint's surface and margins involving articular cartilage, soft
      tissues, and bone damage. Many treatment programs have been developed, including medication
      with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, physical modalities, and therapeutic exercises. It
      is hypothesized that an individualized comprehensive rehabilitation program uring 8 weeks
      would benefit women with knee osteoarthritis.

    <measure>Changes in Perceived Health Status</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in Perceived Health Status is going to be assessed by the EuroQol-5D.It contains two sections, a descriptive section and a valuation section. The descriptive section is a health status classification instrument with the following five dimensions: mobility; self-care; usual activities; pain/discomfort; and anxiety/depression. In the second section, respondents are asked to value their overall health status on a visual analogue scale ranging from 0 (defined as the worst imaginable health state) to 100 (defined as the best imaginable health state)</description>
