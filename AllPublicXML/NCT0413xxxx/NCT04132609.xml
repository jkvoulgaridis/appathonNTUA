  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed research will provide foundational research to develop this low-burden
      behavioral intervention that can potentially improve outcomes of OUD. The Specific Aims of
      the proposal include conducting a pilot randomized controlled trial with post-intervention
      and 3 month follow up to evaluate feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness
      of CBM task for opioid and pain cues (Aim 1), examine naturalistic assessment of opioid
      craving and pain intensity/interference (Aim 2), and conduct qualitative analysis of Veterans
      experiences of adjunctive treatment in MAT clinic and perceptions of CBM as an intervention
      (Aim 3). Male and female Veterans meeting DSM5 criteria for OUD (N=60) currently on MAT will
      be randomly assigned to 4 weeks of CBM for opioid and pain cues or control (standard
      attentional bias). CBM/control tasks will be administered during weekly MAT clinic
      appointments and opioid craving and pain intensity/interference will be randomly assessed
      during the day using a mobile device. Post-intervention, Veterans will be invited to
      participate in a digitally recorded semi-structured interview for qualitative assessment of
      CBM and treatment adjunctive to MAT. MAT outcomes (urine toxicology screens, MAT
      appointments) will also be measured at 3-month follow up. The current study will elucidate
      dynamic relationships between attention to opioid and pain cues and whether modifying
      attention can reduce risk factors associated with treatment failure. If successful, with its
      low patient and provider burden, CBM could be readily incorporated in research and clinical
      practice as an adjunctive treatment for OUD.

      Participants will complete the standard attentional bias task (control) or CBM up to 3x/week
      during MAT clinic visits for 4 weeks.

      Attentional bias: Attentional bias will be assessed during MAT clinic visits using the visual
      probe task, which is considered the gold standard to evaluate vigilance to salient cues. In
      the standard attentional bias task, a drug or pain-related word is presented next to a
      neutral word for 500ms. Subsequently, a probe (i.e., a &quot;q&quot; or &quot;p&quot;) replaces the drug/pain
      word or the neutral word at an equal rate. The participant's task is to indicate the location
      of the probe as quickly as possible by pressing &quot;q&quot; or &quot;p&quot;. Attentional bias is calculated
      from the difference in reaction times (i.e., neutral cue minus drug/pain cue) to indicate the
      location of the probe, with higher values indicating greater attentional bias. For all tasks,
      opioid and pain words will be presented in separate blocks in counterbalanced order. Neutral
      words paired with opioid or pain words will be matched for length and frequency of use in the
      English language. Opioid (e.g., syringe, needle, high, blues) and pain sensory (e.g., stuff,
      throbbing, shooting, burning) and affective (e.g., miserable, tiring, unbearable, exhausting)
      words will be taken from prior research demonstrating attentional bias in OUD and chronic
      pain patients.

      CBM treatment: In CBM, the task presentation and timing is the same as attentional bias,
      except the probe always replaces the neutral word. It ensures that: 1) the duration of CBM
      and control training should not differ; 2) CBM and control participants receive equal
      practice on the motoric aspects of the task; and 3) CBM and control participants are exposed
      to the same word cues. Based on previous data, duration of CBM and control trainings will be
      about 10 minutes.
