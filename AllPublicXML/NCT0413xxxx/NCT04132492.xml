  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With aging population, a high prevalence of obesity, systemic arterial hypertension and
      diabetes mellitus, we are facing an increased incidence of elderly patients with chronic
      kidney disease (CKD) initiating renal replacement therapy. The correct diagnosis of CKD, the
      prognosis of the elderly patient with CKD, mainly comparing initiate dialysis vs. remain in
      conservative treatment, the nutritional prognostic markers (sarcopenia), cardiovascular,
      mineral and bone metabolism, geriatric syndromes and sleep disorders are still debatable.
      Elderly patients are usually excluded from clinical trials and the scientific evidence is
      either scarce or based on retrospective data. Thus, the present study is a prospective cohort
      to evaluate the long-term evolution of patients ≥ 70 years with stage 4 or 5 CKD. The main
      outcomes are mortality and dialysis. These endpoints will be correlated with: geriatric
      syndromes, markers of mineral and bone metabolism (calcium, phosphorus, Klotho,
      parathormone,fibroblast growth factor 23, fibroblast growth factor 21, 25(OH) vitamin D and
      1,25 vitamin D), cognitive decline, clinical demographic and biochemical data, bone
      densitometry and echocardiography, and sleep data. Patients will be follow-up at the
      nephrology outpatient clinic of the Hospital das Clinicas, Universidade de Sao Paulo. The
      sample size was calculated to be 500 subjects. The summary methodology will include: broad
      geriatric assessment, cognition test, fragility, Charlson comorbidity scores, biochemical
      measurements of urea, creatinine, alkaline phosphatase, parathyroid hormone, calcium,
      phosphorus, vitamin D, vitamin B12, folic acid, thyroid hormones, hepatitis virus, serum
      albumin, albumin/creatinine ratio, protein/creatinine ratio, 24-h urinary protein, skull
      tomography, bone densitometry, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, actigraphy,
      polysomnography, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Pitssburgh questionnaire and segmental electric
      bioimpedance
