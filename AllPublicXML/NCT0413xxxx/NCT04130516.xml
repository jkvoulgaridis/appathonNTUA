    <textblock>
      LNS-101 is a multi-center study to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and
      preliminary anti-tumor activity of LNS8801 in patients with advanced cancer. This Phase 1,
      first-in-human, open-label, multi-center study is designed to determine the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD)/recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D). LNS8801 will be administered until disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 1, first-in-human, open-label, multi-center study follows a 3+3 ascending dose
      escalation design to determine the MTD/RP2D and to characterize the safety, tolerability, PK,
      and anti-tumor effects of LNS8801. LNS8801 will be administered for three consecutive days
      per week (Day 1 to Day 3 of each week) for each 21 day cycle until disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity occurs.

      Cohorts will enroll at least three patients in accordance with a traditional 3+3 design, and
      the study will determine the MTD/RP2D. With permission from the Safety Review Committee
      (SRC), two cohorts may be expanded to include 8 to 10 patients to further explore PK and
      pharmacodynamics.

      Safety assessments will be performed on all patients at screening, throughout their
      participation in the study, and for 30 days following the last dose of study drug. Throughout
      the study, imaging of tumors for evidence of tumor response and/or progression will be
      performed; biopsies will be performed on accessible lesions.

      Up to 50 patients will be accrued for this study. LNS8801 capsules will be administered
      orally. There are up to five study sites in the United States.
