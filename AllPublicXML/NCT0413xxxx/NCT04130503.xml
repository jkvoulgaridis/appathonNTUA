  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a randomized controlled trial among 180 patients with acute ischemic
      stroke and mod/severe OSA diagnosed by ambulatory PSG comparing PAP treatment with usual care
      concerning the primary outcome of functional recovery.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study has 3 main aims and an additional exploratory aim.

      Specific aim 1: Test whether PAP treatment for OSA in ischemic stroke improves stroke
      severity, post-stroke symptoms, post-stroke functional recovery (primary outcome), and
      quality of life.

      Specific aim 2: Determine whether acute vs. subacute initiation of PAP in ischemic stroke
      results in greater improvement in post-stroke outcomes (stroke severity, symptoms, stroke
      recovery, quality of life).

      Specific Aim 3: Conduct in-depth qualitative interviews with 25-30 stroke patients, family
      members, and acute care providers to elicit their experience with PAP use, including factors
      that influence adherence.

      Exploratory aim: Evaluate whether polysomnographic measures have prognostic utility in
      understanding the variability in stroke recovery.

    <measure>Modified Rankin Scale (mRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>6-level scale used to assess severity of patient disability. The Modified Rankin Scale is a widely used measure of functional status and is sensitive to the full range of impairment from mild to severe. This objective examination scale with be video recorded by field staff and subsequently scored by the study neurologist blinded to randomization arm. The inter-rater reliability with the mRS is moderate and improves with structured interviews (kappa 0.56 versus 0.78); strong test-re-test reliability (kappa=0.81 to 0.95).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Stroke severity will be measured using the NIHSS. The NIHSS is a 15-item objective neurological examination scale. This scale has been used extensively to evaluate stroke severity and is a strong predictor of post-stroke outcomes. Patients with excellent outcomes (NIHSS score of less than or equal to 5) can be identified with sensitivity of 0.72 and specificity of 0.89. Inter- rater reliability was excellent, with an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.82. This exam will be video recorded by field staff and subsequently scored by the study neurologist blinded to randomization arm.</description>

    <measure>Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The ESS asks: How likely are you to doze off or fall asleep in the following situations? The 8-item questionnaire uses a 3-point Likert scale where 0 equals never doze, and 3 equals high chance of dozing. The ESS is widely used in studies of sleep apnea and is considered a standard measure of daytime sleepiness. Cronbach's alpha (.79) is strong.</description>

    <measure>Medical Outcomes Survey-SF 36 (MOS-SF36)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This is a standardized tool for assessing general health status, physical and social functioning, and fatigue. Its subscale, Vitality, has demonstrable sensitivity to changes in PAP therapy. Internal consistency reliability was 0.83 to 0.93 for the eight scales.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PHQ-9 will provide a psychometrically valid measure of depression, a common concern in post-stroke and OSA patients, and an attribute which has been reported to improve with PAP therapy. The diagnostic validity of the 9-item PHQ-9 was established in studies involving 8 primary care and 7 obstetrical clinics. PHQ-9 scores greater than 10 had a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 88% for Major Depressive Disorder. Reliability and validity of the tool have indicated it has sound psychometric properties. Internal consistency of the PHQ-9 has been shown to be high. A study involving two different patient populations produced Cronbach alphas of .86 and .89.</description>

    <measure>Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The MoCA was designed as a rapid screening instrument for cognitive dysfunction. It assesses different cognitive domains such as attention and concentration, executive functions, memory, language, visual-constructional skills, conceptual thinking, calculations, and orientation. Time to administer the MoCA is approximately 10 minutes. The total possible score is 30 points; a score of 26 or above is considered normal. Nasreddine et al. (2005) examined the internal consistency Cronbachs alpha (alpha = 0.83) on the standardized items. Nasreddine et al. (2005) examined the test-retest reliability (r = 0.92). The mean change in MoCA scores from the first to second evaluation was 0.9 points.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Stroke Specific Quality of Life (SS-QOL)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The SS-QOL is a patient-centered outcome measure intended to provide an assessment of health-related quality of life specific to patients with stroke. Scale domains and items were derived from a series of interviews with post- stroke patients. It takes approximately 10-15 minutes to complete the SS-QOL scale. Higher scores indicate better functioning. The SS-QOL yields both domain scores and an overall SS- QOL summary score. The domain scores are unweighted averages of the associated items while the summary score is an unweighted average of all twelve domain scores. The reliability coefficients analyzed by the Rasch model were 0.91 for the items and 0.87 for the patients. The separation index was 3.19 for the items and 2.58 for the patients. The findings indicate that the items separated the patients into three levels of participation: low, medium, and high. All items showed adequate reliability (ICC greater than or equal to 0.60).</description>

    <measure>The Calgary Sleep Apnea Quality of Life Index (SAQLI)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The SAQLI is designed to assess responsiveness to OSA treatment and will be administered to obtain a measure of OSA-disease specific quality of life. This instrument correlates with global quality of life measures, has high test-retest reliability (r=0.92), and a large responsiveness index (1.9) and effect size (1.1) to PAP therapy.</description>

    <measure>Formative Adherence Evaluation</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>For patients with sleep apnea, qualitative, in-depth interviews with approximately n=25 patients and their bedpartners (dyads) purposefully sampled based on demographics, adherence, and treatment arm. Interviews of the dyads will occur at approximately 3 months into the study when PAP adherence patterns have been established.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Berg Balance Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>3 and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Berg Balance Scale is used to objectively determine a patient's ability (or inability) to safely balance during a series of predetermined tasks. It is a 14-item list with each item consisting of a five-point ordinal scale ranging from 0 to 4, with 0 indicating the lowest level of function and 4 the highest level of function and takes approximately 20 minutes to complete. It does not include the assessment of gait. The intended population for this scale is the elderly population with impairment of balance, patients with acute stroke (Berg et al 1995, Usuda et al 1998). Studies of various elderly populations (N = 31-101, 60-90 + years of age) have shown high intrarater and inter-rater reliability (ICC =.98,14,15 ratio of variability among subjects to total = .96-1.0,16 rs =.8817). Test-retest reliability in 22 people with hemiparesis is also high (ICC [2,1] =.98).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Falls</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Falls are identified and recorded as a part of the routine adverse event collection and reporting protocol. In addition to identification of a fall event, reasons for the fall, and location of the fall, follow-up care will be identified through interview questions and chart review. Individuals who sustained at least one fall were considered a -faller- for these analyses. The fall event information will be categorized for these analyses to describe both the circumstances and the consequences of falls.</description>

    <measure>Polysomnographic measures of sleep apnea severity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Digital polysomnography allows for the deconstruction of respiratory events into component parts. Pertinent to the exploratory aim, more detailed polysomnographic indices will also be generated corresponding to the various pathophysiologic domains of sleep apnea (hypoxia, hemodynamic disturbances, sympathetic activation, sleep architecture disruption).</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Actigraphic measures of physical activity and circadian rhythmicity</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Wrist Actigraphy will be performed using the Actiwatch Spectrum (Philips Healthcare, Netherlands) and will be set at 15-second epochs. Actigraphy represents a useful tool for motor objectively and directly measuring activity monitoring among stroke patients. Motor activity will be actigraphically measured for 1 week and recorded at 4 different sessions (S1-S4); baseline (S1), 1-month (S2) and again after 3 (S3) and 6 (S4) months. For statistical analysis, a total activity score (TAS) will be calculated. The TAS is defined as the summation of all the activity scores in all the epochs within the period of start and end of recording. This overall parameter allows a good estimation of patient ability to move and the amount of diurnal activity. The TAS will be evaluated for the impaired side (TASi) and the non-impaired side (TASni) separately. The motoricity Index (MI) will be used to score the performance of the upper extremity.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Having an acute ischemic stroke with brain imaging within 48 hours of symptoms onset;

          -  Being within 5 days of neurologic symptoms onset;

          -  Moderate (15 =&lt; overall AHI &lt; 30) /severe (overall AHI &gt;= 30) OSA, thus with an
             obstructive apnea-hypopnea index AHI &gt;= 15.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Past use of prescribed PAP for OSA;

          -  Suspected sleep disorder other than OSA (e.g., narcolepsy) (because such patients
             should be referred for a formal PSG in a sleep laboratory);

          -  Life expectancy is less than 6 months (e.g., hospice patients);

          -  Patients who require mechanical ventilation (because such patients could not
             participate in the intervention protocol);

          -  Non-English language patients (because the intervention strategy involves forming a
             relationship between the patient and research staff);

          -  Central sleep apnea with &gt; 50% of respiratory events classified as central apnea;

          -  Resting oxygen saturation &lt; 90%.

          -  Inability to provide their own informed consent. To enhance the generalizability of
             our study, all stroke severity will be included. However, we will exclude patients who
             cannot provide their own consent. This is because patients will need to participate
             actively in the protocol with a behavioral intervention. An assessment of the
             patient's competence to provide consent will be made based on published
             recommendations.
