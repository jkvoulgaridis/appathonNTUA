    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find the safest dose and identify any bad side effects of
      EGFR-BATs (bispecific antibody-armed activated T cells) for people with advanced pancreatic
      cancer who have already received first-line standard chemotherapy.

    <description>Phase I:
First 3 participants, twice weekly infusions of 10^10 EGFR BATs infusions
If there is toxicity in 0 or 1 of 3 participants, 3 additional participants will be added to the dose level of up to 10^10.
If &gt;/= 2 of 6 participants experience DLTs, then the dose will be reduced to 7.5 x 10^9 per infusion
If only 0 or 1 participants has toxicity in the first 6, then the study will proceed to enroll in the expansion cohort
Expansion cohort:
- 8 infusions of 7.5 x 10^9 or 10^10 EGFR BATs in 22 evaluable participants (including the 6 participants treated at the maximum tolerated dose in Phase I)</description>
