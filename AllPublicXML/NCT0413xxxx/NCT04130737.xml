             is performed only if unable to reliably assess ABI. TBI must be &lt;0.70; or (ii) Normal

             native femoropopliteal artery (&quot;target lesions&quot;) that can be crossed with a guidewire
             and fully dilated.

          9. Single or multiple target lesions must be covered by a single stent. In the case of
             tandem target lesions, the gap between lesions must be ≤ 2.5 cm.

             visual estimate.

         12. Single or multiple target lesions measure ≥ 80 mm to ≤ 180 mm in overall length, with
             ≥ 60% diameter stenosis by operator's visual estimate.

         20. Patient has other medical, social or psychological problems that, in the opinion of
             the investigator, preclude them from receiving this treatment, and the procedures and

         21. Patient has significant disease or obstruction (≥ 50%) of the inflow tract that has
             not been successfully treated at the time of the index procedure (success measured as
             ≤ 30% residual stenosis, without complication).
