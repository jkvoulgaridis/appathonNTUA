  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to show that giving high dose, intravenous vitamin C in addition to standard
      care to burned critically ill patients will be associated with less organ dysfunction,
      improved survival and a quicker rate of recovery. In this study, all patients will receive
      standard care and of the patients will also receive high dose intravenous vitamin C, while
      the other half of patients will receive placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In certain disease states, such as those associated with severe burns and other critical
      illnesses, the relationship between nutrient deficiencies, altered immune status, and
      acquired infection has been recognized for many years. More than in any other injury, the
      inflammation and catabolism associated with severe burns can exacerbate nutrient
      deficiencies, thereby predisposing patients to impaired immune function and increased risk of
      developing infectious complications, organ dysfunction, and death. We aim to conduct a
      large-scale, multi-center randomized trial to evaluate the effect of high-dose (200mg/kg/day
      x 96 hours) intravenous vitamin C in addition to standard of care (SOC) on 28-days composite
      outcome of Persistent Organ Dysfunction (POD) and all-cause mortality compared to add-on
      placebo and SOC. Patients will be allocated to 2 groups, active or control: patients in the
      active group will receive intravenous vitamin C at 200mg/kg in divided doses, every 6 hrs for
      96 hrs. Patients in the control group will receive a similar amount of placebo (either D5W or
      saline) delivered in the same manner as the vitamin C. This study will be the first large
      international multi-centre trial examining the effects of high dose intravenous vitamin C in
      burn patients. It represents a unique collaboration of burn units worldwide that is
      coordinated by the Clinical Evaluation Research Unit, based in Kingston Ontario Canada, a
      coordinating center that has demonstrated the ability to run multi-center trials and
      translate findings into practice.

    <intervention_model_description>Patients will be allocated to receive intravenous vitamin C at 200mg/kg in divided doses, every 6 hrs for 96 hrs. We justify this proposed dosing strategy as the proposed dose of vitamin C has been shown to be safe and effective in patients with sepsis and lung injury whereas prior dosing strategies used in the burns literature (66 mg/kg/24 hours) have safety issues and are not long enough in duration. Control group: patients will receive a similar amount of placebo (either D5W or saline) delivered in the same manner as the vitamin C.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Allocation will be random and concealed and will be blinded to everyone except the pharmacist at each site. The vitamin C will be sourced locally and prepared in a blinded manner by local research pharmacies that will be responsible for preparing study samples and delivering them to the ICU in a blinded fashion. The randomization system, which has proven reliable in several prior RCTs, has a robust audit trail, and will maintain concealment and blinding.</masking_description>

    <description>We will conduct a double-blind, randomized controlled pilot trial of 90 patients with severe burns randomly allocated to receive intravenous vitamin C (200 mg/kg/day for 96 hours) or placebo (45 per group). If feasibility is demonstrated in the pilot, a larger phase III component will be conducted and aimed at lowering morbidity and mortality and reducing health care costs in an otherwise very devastating and disabling injury worldwide.</description>
