  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and V938
      shedding in participants with advanced/metastatic or recurrent malignancies who receive V938
      in Combination with Pembrolizumab (MK-3475). The primary objective is to determine the safety
      and tolerability and to establish a preliminary recommended Phase 2 dose (PRP2D) of V938
      administered in combination with pembrolizumab.
