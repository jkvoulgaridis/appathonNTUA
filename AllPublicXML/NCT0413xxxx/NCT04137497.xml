  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between behaviorally assessed
      consciousness levels and responsiveness to nociception in patients with disorders of
      consciousness (DOC)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with a clinical consensus of DOC were enrolled. The Coma Recovery Scale-Revised
      (CRS-R) was used to assess the DOC patients' consciousness levels and the Nociception Coma
      Scale-Revised (NCS-R) was used to evaluate their pain response over one week. Furthermore,
      the relationship between behaviorally assessed consciousness levels and pain response was
      analyzed.

    <description>The Nociception Coma Scale-Revised was used to evaluate the pain response of all patients in random order at least once. A score greater than or equal to 3 points indicated that the patient was responsive to pain stimulation, while a score greater than or equal to 4 points suggested that the patient might have pain perception related to consciousness.</description>

During the evaluation of the patient's consciousness level, the NCS-R was used to evaluate the pain response of all patients in random order at least once, and the best behavioral response (i.e., the highest score) of each subscale was recorded during resting, noxious, and physiotherapy conditions, respectively, according to the NCS-R guidelines.</description>

        All enrolled DOC patients were evaluated at least five times over one week by two trained
        professionals using the Chinese version of the CRS-R. The highest score was selected as the
        final bedside behavioral diagnosis of the patient's consciousness level. During the
        evaluation of the patient's consciousness level, the NCS-R was used to evaluate the pain
        response of all patients in random order at least once, and the best behavioral response
        (i.e., the highest score) of each subscale was recorded during resting, noxious, and
        physiotherapy conditions, respectively, according to the NCS-R guidelines. The patient's
        specific behavioral performance was also recorded.
