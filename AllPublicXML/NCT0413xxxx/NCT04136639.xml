  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prevention of dental caries has taken a great importance in the last decade. The use of
      herbal and natural products became mandatory to avoid the side effects of commercially
      available medications. Aim of the study; the aim was to investigate the anti-cariogenic
      effect of miswak and grape seed extract (GSE).

    <textblock>
      Patients used Miswak sticks, grape seed extract mouth wash and fluoride mouthwash twice daily
      for three month. Saliva samples were collected at base line and after one month and three
      month. Assessment of bacterial count and saliva buffering capacity were performed at base
      line and after one and three month.

    <description>the patients used the treatments twice daily for three months. unstimulated saliva samples were collected from the patients at baseline,after one month and after three months.

    <description>the patients used the treatments twice daily for three months. unstimulated saliva samples were collected from the patients at baseline, after one month and after three months. each time, saliva buffering capacity was measured using Hand Held pH meter and 0.1 mol/l hydrochloric acid that was titrated to the tested saliva.</description>
