  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective is to compare the effectiveness of two readaptation programs post anterior
      cruciate ligament surgery. Laval University Rouge et or program is to be compared with the
      intervention guide from the CHU. Amateur athletes are recruited 3 months post ACL surgery.
      The level of confidence, symptoms, functional recovery level and muscle strength are assessed
      and compared between the two groups at 3, 4, 5, 6 and 9-month post surgery.

      It is experimental research with pre-post repeated measure with a control group. The subjects
      are randomised either in the intervention group (Gr PRORO-UL) or the control group (Gr
      CHU-CP). The assessor is blinded to the randomisation. Both groups receive their program at
      the first assessment at three months post-ACL-surgery. They are strongly encouraged to
      continue their follow-up in physiotherapy to ensure the program is suitable to their
      individual progression. The participants are assessed again at 4, 5, 6 and 9 months post
      surgery to measure their progression. A weekly journal sent by e-mail is to be filled to
      ensure the subjects train according to their program attribution. It is a randomised control
      trial with a blinded assessor.

Every cycle contains 3 training sessions by week with a minimum of 24 hours between sessions. The training volume is modulated for every cycle and every week. Each training sessions is made of 6 warm-up exercises followed by 6 training exercises. The exercises are a mix of strengthening, endurance, plyometric, neuromuscular control and dynamic stability. The exercises change every month with a progressively increasing difficulty towards the end to mimic return to sport demands.</description>
