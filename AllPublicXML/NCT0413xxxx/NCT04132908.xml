  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It consists in the intake, during a period of 10 weeks, of a nutraceutical (natural extract
      of Sclerocarya birrea). It is a clinical trial, during which certain parameters of the
      glucidic metabolism will be measured analytically. Other secondary variables such as lipid
      profile, inflammatory markers, blood pressure, endothelial function and body composition will
      also be determined.
