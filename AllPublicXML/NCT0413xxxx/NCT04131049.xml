  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare the impact of carbohydrate counting (CC) method which is
      standard insulin dose calculation algorithm and food insulin index (FII) method which is a
      new algorithm on postprandial glucose following a high fat and a high protein meal in
      adolescent with type 1 diabetes. A randomized, single-blind and crossover trial included 14
      adolescents aged 14-18 years with type 1 diabetes. All participants were sent to their homes
      for 4 consecutive days with a different glycemic index breakfast. The insulin doses of the
      meals were calculated according to CC and FII methods. Test breakfasts with different GIs and
      insulin requirements calculated with different algorithms are as follows: High GI calculated
      by CC (CHGI), low GI calculated by CC (CLGI), high GI calculated by FII (FHGI) and low GI
      calculated by FII (FLGI).
