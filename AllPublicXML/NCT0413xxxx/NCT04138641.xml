  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cangrelor is a fast and directly acting platelet aggregation inhibitor. It is potentially
      indicated for several types of patients who are undergoing PCI. A nationwide cangrelor
      registry has up until now not been performed and with the introduction of cangrelor in the
      Netherlands its efficacy and safety will be determined.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age ≥18 years

          -  One of the following criteria:

          -  Patients naïve for P2Y12 inhibition undergoing PCI

          -  Patients with suboptimal P2Y12 inhibition undergoing PCI (patients who vomited after
             P2Y12 loading, out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients with restoration of
             spontaneous circulation (ROSC), patients loaded with P2Y12 inhibitors though platelet
             inhibition still insufficient (&lt;2 hours after oral loading dose)

          -  (N)STEMI patients loaded with P2Y12 inhibitors with large thrombus burden (thrombus
             grade 4 or 5) on initial coronary angiography (CAG) and undergoing primary PCI with
             expected insufficient P2Y12 inhibition

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients on current/chronic treatment with P2Y12 inhibitors

          -  Patients (pre) treated with a GPI

          -  Patients with recent major bleeding complications or contraindication to dual
             antiplatelet therapy:

          -  hypersensitivity or allergy to and known contra-indication for aspirin, clopidogrel,
             ticagrelor or cangrelor

          -  history of major clinical bleeding or known coagulopathy

          -  active bleeding

          -  history of intracerebral mass, aneurysm, arteriovenous malformation, or hemorrhagic
             stroke

          -  known severe liver dysfunction

          -  Patients that received any organ transplant or are on a waiting list for any organ
             transplant

          -  Patients undergoing dialysis

          -  Pregnant or lactating female
