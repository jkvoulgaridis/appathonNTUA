  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is the most common respiratory cause of mortality and
      morbidity in very preterm infants, but it also could be seen in late preterm and term
      infants. Some genetic mechanisms were involved in the pathogenesis of RDS in late preterm and
      term infants.

      ATP-binding cassette transporter A3 (ABCA3) is essential for the production of pulmonary
      surfactant, whose mutation is the most common monogenetic cause of RDS in newborns. It also
      takes a vital role on unexplained RDS (URDS) in late preterm and term infants. Some previous
      studies showed that URDS with homozygous or compound heterozygous ABCA3 mutations had high
      mortality, while different mutation types could lead to different outcomes. However, most of
      the study focused on URDS with ABCA3 gene mutations, and there is no evidence that URDS
      without confirmed gene mutations have relatively better or worse outcomes. Furthermore, all
      the population in previous study are non-Asian races, which indicated that all the study
      conclusion is not applicable in Asia.

      Based on the next-generation sequencing technology, exome sequencing has been widely used in
      the clinic. In our neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), a clinic exome sequencing was usually
      performed in infants with fatal URDS. The present study was designed to compare the URDS with
      ABCA3 gene mutations with those without confirmed gene mutations and to establish the
      relationship between various ABCA3 gene mutations and variant RDS severity and outcomes.
