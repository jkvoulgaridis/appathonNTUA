  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Generalization refers to skill transfer under various working spaces following motor
      practice. The extent of generalization effect links causal to in-depth recognition of error
      properties during motor practice. Idiom says &quot;imperfect practice makes perfect&quot;. It could be
      beneficial for the elderly to gain superior capacity of balance transfer skill under the
      short-term productive failure learning environments. In contrast to traditional visual
      feedback that uses error avoidance training to optimize target balance task, the present
      3-year proposal is to propose three potential neuro-cognitive strategies to improve motor
      skill transfer following stabilometer training. The strategies are expected to enhance
      opportunities of error experience and motor exploration via modified visual feedback,
      underlying facilitations of attentional resource and error-related neural networks. In the
      first year, the neuro-cognitive strategy for balance practice is progressive augmentation of
      visual error size to improve balance skill transfer. In the second year, the neuro-cognitive
      strategy for balance practice is visual feedback with virtual uncertainness of motor goal. In
      the third year, the neuro-cognitive strategy for balance practice is stroboscopic vision. EEG
      and central of pressure will be processed with non-linear approaches. Graph theory will
      characterize EEG functional connectivity and brain network efficiency regarding to brain
      mechanisms for practice-related leaning transfer. Trajectories of central of pressure will be
      analyzed with stabilogram diffusion analysis to reveal behavior mechanisms for
      practice-related variations in feedback and feedforward process for error corrections.
