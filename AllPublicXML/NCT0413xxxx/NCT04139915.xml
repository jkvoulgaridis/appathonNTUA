      RTB-101-205 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, parallel-group,
      Phase 3 study to determine if RTB101, a selective TORC1 inhibitor, prevents illness
      associated with respiratory tract infections (defined as clinically symptomatic respiratory
      illness) in adults ≥65 years of age. This trial is being conducted in follow up to two Phase
      2 trials in older adults in which RTB101 10 mg administered once daily for up to 16 weeks
      during winter cold and flu season was observed to reduce the incidence of respiratory illness
      associated with respiratory tract infections.
