  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Research Question of the present study is the following: in a group of patients affected
      by GERD, 1-month treatment with PPI (omeprazole) and Marial® will significantly decrease the
      use of Gaviscon® as rescue medicine in comparison with patients treated with omeprazole
      alone.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, comparative, multicenter study with two parallel group of subjects.
      The clinical investigation will be performed in six clinical sites.

      The study population will include subjects affected by GERD with diagnosis of Grade A
      esophagitis on Los Angeles Classification System grades reflux esophagitis, confirmed by
      gastroscopy (done within 1 month prior baseline).

      Marial® is a class IIa medical device (Directive 93/42/EEC), already marketed in several EU
      countries. This compound has been produced combining hyaluronic acid, hydrolyzed keratin
      mucoproteins, glycoproteins such as fibronectin, meso glycans and integrins, and viscous
      agents. It evidenced to actively regenerate the damaged tissue by repairing and regenerative
      properties on mucous membranes and by muco-adhesive and film-forming characteristics that
      allow to prolong the contact time with the mucous membranes and consequently to improve the
      effectiveness.
