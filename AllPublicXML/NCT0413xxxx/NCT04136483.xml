    <textblock>
      The study is a clinical pilot study that examine the preliminary effect of
      cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) in adolescents with comorbid psychiatric
      disorders. Participants (n=25) are recruited from three psychiatric clinics (n=19) and one
      pediatric pain clinic (n=6). After diagnostic assessment, participants that fulfil inclusion
      criteria are offered the CBT-I intervention. Pre-post and 3-months follow-up assessments
      include subjective measures of insomnia symptom severity, sleep parameters (collected through
      sleep-wake diaries), symptoms of depression and anxiety and daytime functioning.

    <measure>Change from Baseline Insomnia Severity Index- adolescent version (ISI-a)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Insomnia Severity Index, ISI -adolescent version18 was used before, after at three months follow-up to measure insomnia symptom severity. ISI-a is an adaptation to adolescents of the Insomnia Severity Index32,36. ISI-a is a seven-item measure that yields a quantitative index of sleep impairment and treatment outcome. Total scores range from 0 to 28, with higher scores indicating greater perceived insomnia severity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sleep Onset Latency (SOL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective sleep onset latency was measured using a sleep-wake diary (SWD) before, after and at three-months follow-up. Participants filled in the SWD during seven consecutive days/nights at all time points.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Wake after sleep onset (WASO)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective wake after sleep onset was measured using a sleep-wake diary (SWD) before, after and at three-months follow-up. Participants filled in the SWD during seven consecutive days/nights at all time points.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Total Sleep Time (TST)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective total sleep time was measured using a sleep-wake diary (SWD) before, after and at three-months follow-up. Participants filled in the SWD during seven consecutive days/nights at all time points.</description>

    <measure>Sleep Efficiency (SE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective sleep efficiency was measured using a sleep-wake diary (SWD) before, after and at three-months follow-up. Participants filled in the SWD during seven consecutive days/nights at all time points.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Spences' Children Anxiety Scale (SCAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Spences Children's Anxiety Scale - SCAS 37 was used before, after and at three months follow-up to measure level of anxiety symptoms. SCAS is a child self-report measure of anxiety related psychopathology, measuring five domains of anxiety: generalized anxiety, panic anxiety, separation anxiety, social anxiety and obsessive-compulsive anxiety.Scores range from 0 to 114 and higher scores indicate more severe symptoms of anxiety.</description>

    <measure>Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale for Children (CES-DC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale for Children (CES-DC)38 was used before, after and at three months follow-up to measure depressive symptoms. CES-DC is a 20-item self-report depression inventory.Scores range from 0 to 60, with higher scores indicating more severe depressive symptomatology.</description>

    <description>The theoretical framework is cognitive-behavioral therapy that includes sleep education, sleep hygiene, sleep restriction, stimulus control, cognitive interventions and relaxation. The intervention has been adapted to adolescents by reducing the amount of psychoeducational information and the interventions related to changing cognitions. It involves six weekly face-to-face individual sessions with a therapist, supported by a participant workbook that contains information, work- sheets, and at-home tasks. Clinical psychologists or graduate clinical psychologists in training delivered the intervention sessions under supervision by the first author. Parents/care-givers were given information about the components, but did not take active part of the intervention.</description>
