      This phase I trial studies the best dose of hydroxychloroquine when given together with
      binimetinib in treating patients with KRAS gene mutated pancreatic cancer that has spread to
      other places in the body (metastatic). Binimetinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Hydroxychloroquine may prevent
      autophagy, a normal process in which a cell destroys proteins and other substances which may
      lead to cell death. Autophagy may prevent normal cells from developing into tumor cells, but
      it may also protect tumor cells by destroying anticancer drugs or substances taken up by
      them. Giving hydroxychloroquine together with binimetinib may work better in treating
      patients with pancreatic cancer compared to binimetinib alone.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) when combined with a
      fixed dose of binimetinib.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the response rate among a pilot cohort of pancreatic cancer patients.

      II. To determine the safety and toxicity profile of the combination of binimetinib and HCQ.

      III. To determine the ability of the combination to halt tumor growth as measured by
      progression free survival.

      IV. To assess the overall survival of patients treated on this regimen.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the efficacy of treatment to somatic gene mutation profile as acquired by
      standard of care testing.

      II. To assess pre- and post- treatment tissue to determine if markers of autophagy correlate
      with response to treatment.

      III. To assess the effect of this binimetinib/HCQ treatment on changes in muscle and fat mass
      as analyzed by computed tomography (CT) scan (as standard of care treatment).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of hydroxychloroquine.

      Patients receive binimetinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) and hydroxychloroquine PO BID on
      days 1-14. Cycles repeat every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 30 days.

          -  Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator. Evidence for
             such abnormalities/conditions will be documented in the patient's medical record.

          -  Has a history of thromboembolic or cerebrovascular events =&lt; 12 weeks prior to the

             deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary emboli. Note: Patients with either deep vein
             thrombosis or pulmonary emboli that does not result in hemodynamic instability are
             allowed to enroll as long as they are on a stable dose of anticoagulants for at least
             4 weeks. Also note: Patients with thromboembolic events related to indwelling

          -  Partial or complete bowel obstruction.

          -  Impaired gastrointestinal function that may significantly alter the absorption of
             binimetinib (e.g., ulcerative diseases, uncontrolled vomiting, malabsorption syndrome,
             small bowel resection with decreased intestinal absorption) or baseline diarrhea &gt;=

             the latter if part of a pain regimen). Prior loperamide use for diarrhea is permitted
             at enrollment but should be changed to diphenoxylate / atropine before initiation of
             treatment.

          -  Has a history of psoriatic arthritis requiring systemic treatment.

          -  Has a history of porphyria.
