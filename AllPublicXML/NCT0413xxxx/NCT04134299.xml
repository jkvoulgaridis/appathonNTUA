  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study to understand the safety and tolerability of AXA4010, a novel
      composition of amino acids in adult and adolescent subjects with sickle cell disease over 12
      weeks. The study also assesses the effects of this amino acid composition on the structure
      and function of the vascular system. Physiological effects on structure and function will be
      assessed by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to assess blood flow in the brain and kidneys
      and the 6-Minute walk with pulse oximetry. Changes in blood biomarkers of inflammation will
      also be assessed.

    <description>The study will initiate with approximately eight (8) adult subjects (≥18 y/o) with SCD (Cohort 1). Each subject will receive AXA4010 twice a day (BID) for 12 weeks. Safety and tolerability will be monitored, and study procedures will be performed. Analysis of safety, tolerability and laboratory assessments at week 12 would be performed. Based on the 12-week observations from at least three subjects in Cohort 1, subsequent Cohorts 2 and 3 in Part II may be initiated.</description>

             following parameters:

               -  Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) ≥ 2x above upper limits of normal (ULN) of the age-
                  and gender-appropriate ranges

               -  Indirect bilirubin &gt; 2x of the age- and gender-appropriate ULN

               -  Absolute reticulocyte counts &gt; 2x of the age- and gender-appropriate ULN

          -  Able to ambulate (without assistance or walkers etc.) in a 6- minute walk test

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Ten (10) or more Vascular-Occlusive Crisis (VOC)s that required hospital or emergency
             room (ER) visits within the past 12 months

          -  Any clinically significant changes abnormalities on the screening 12-lead ECG

          -  Subjects on chronic transfusion regimens, or who received a transfusion within the
             last 2 months prior to screening

          -  Experienced VOC or any other sickle crises (eg acute chest syndrome, splenic
             sequestration, dactylitis, stroke) within the last 2 months prior to Screening

          -  Current or history of significant alcohol consumption

          -  Other poorly controlled medical conditions as judged by the Investigator

          -  Any contraindications to an MRI scan for Cohort 2 only

          -  Any other condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, renders the subject at
