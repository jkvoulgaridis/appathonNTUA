      1. Study purpose: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of micro-energy ultrasound therapy in
           the treatment of female stress urinary incontinence

        2. Study design: This is a randomized, double-blind, controlled, multi-center clinical
           trial

        3. Study subjects: Females with mild to moderate stress urinary incontinence

        4. Number of subjects: 60

        5. Study center: The Second Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University

        6. Treatment methods:

      Test group: After installing the disposable treatment head coat, the pelvic floor muscles,
      ligaments, etc. were treated with an ultrasonic therapeutic apparatus; after the treatment,
      the disposable treatment head coat was removed. Patients were treated twice a week for 6
      weeks.

      Control group: The placebo was treated with an ultrasound therapy device and used in the same
