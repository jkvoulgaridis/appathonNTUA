      To assess in women with triple-negative breast cancer receiving neo-adjuvant chemotherapy the
      effects of an intense physical exercise program (intervention group) on physical capacity,
      compared with a control group not meeting the minimum exercise recommendations of the World
      Health Organization (WHO).

      Justification and aims Breast cancer is the fourth most common type of cancer worldwide and
      the first among women in Spain. It is also the type of cancer with the highest mortality.
      Several studies have assessed the effects of exercise performed in the neo-adjuvant period,
      but there is heterogeneity among them.

      Principal aim:

      To assess in women with triple-negative breast cancer receiving neo-adjuvant chemotherapy the
      effects of an intense physical exercise program (intervention group) on physical capacity,
      compared with a control group not meeting the minimum exercise recommendations of the World
      Health Organization (WHO).

      Secondary aims:

      To compare the following outcomes in both groups: body composition, and quality of life and
      depression/anxiety.

    <description>The QLQ-C30 is a multidimensional cancer HRQoL questionnaire that contains 30 items assessing six functional and nine symptom scales. Results from this questionnaire are transformed into scores ranging from 0 to 100 according to European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) scoring, with higher scores in the functioning scales indicating a better functional status and global HRQoL, and higher scores on the symptoms' scales indicating more symptoms.</description>
