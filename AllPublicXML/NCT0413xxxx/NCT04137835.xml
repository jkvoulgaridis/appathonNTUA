  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is very important to understand joint and body kinematics and muscles activity in clinical
      settings, which is relevant to identify issues related to the spine, the upper and lower
      limbs due to injury.

      In this study, the investigators will use an innovative platform, Showmotion to establish
      baseline of shoulder, hip, knee and spine kinematics and muscles activity from 60 healthy
      volunteers.

      Upper and lower body functional evaluation is challenging and relevant to identify the issues
      related to injury. Current technique still stays at visual observation.

      Showmotion™ (NCS Lab, Carpi, Italy) is an innovative platform that provides a comprehensive
      analysis to monitor motion patterns of the whole body using WISE sensors, proprietary
      wireless inertial and magnetic units (MIMU) developed by NCS Lab (Italy).

      Using the data acquired from MIMU and validated protocols for upper and lower limbs,
      Showmotion is able to measure, objectify and store three dimensional kinematic variables
      highlighting underlying information and allowing an in-depth analysis of the movement in real
      time.

      Compared to the classic motion analysis performed with cameras in special research
      laboratories, the Showmotion™ technology allows the user to analyze the movements of the
      subjects in any place, quickly, and without the need to a long process of data analysis.

    <description>Performing an analysis requires the positioning of sensors on the patient's skin in predetermined positions, according to the related protocols. Each sensor positioned on patient's skin provides both raw data (accelerometer, magnetometer, gyroscope) and the orientation matrix, representing the orientation of the local System of Reference (SoR) with respect to a fixed SoR. A proprietary sensor-fusion algorithm allows provides an accurate estimate of the orientation, as assessed by stereo-photogrammetric system-based testing.
Data from each sensor are sampled at 50 Hz and transferred wirelessly to a laptop with a proprietary software that processes the data according to the biomechanical model chosen for the analysis.</description>
