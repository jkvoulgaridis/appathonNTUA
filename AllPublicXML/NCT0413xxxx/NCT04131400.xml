      Purpose: To establish of the national Inherited Retinal Dystrophy Registry (IRDR) in Iran.

      Methods: This study is a community-based participatory research that is approved by the
      Ministry of Health and Medical Education of Iran in 2016. To provide the minimum data set
      (MDS), several focus group meetings will be held with participation of the faculty members of
      the Ophthalmic Research Center affiliated to Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences
      (SBMU). Final MDS will be presented to the software engineering team to develop a web-based
      software. In the pilot phase, software will be set up in two referral centers including
      Labbafinejad Medical Center (Tehran) and Alzahra Eye Hospital (Zahedan) to discover the
      possible drawbacks. Final diagnosis will be made based on both clinical manifestations as
      well as genetic findings.The steering committee meetings are planned to be held each year
      with the presence of delegates of all centers.

    <description>known patients with a diagnosis of inherited retinal dystrophy (IRD) will be recruited to identify the type of IRD diagnosis. The comprehensive ophthalmic examinations and retinal imaging will be performed. Additionally, blood sample of all participants and their family members will be kept in our bio- bank for genetic testing.</description>

        An initial registration will be performed only for subjects who has a diagnosis of IRD
        based on clinical and retinal imaging by an expert retina specialist, but definite
        diagnosis will be confirmed by genetic testing.
