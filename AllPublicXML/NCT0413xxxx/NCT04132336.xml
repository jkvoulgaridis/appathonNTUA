  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The researchers in this study want to find out the optimal dose of Caffeine in the
      combination tablet of Naproxen Sodium and Caffeine that works in patients experiencing
      moderate to severe pain after having wisdom teeth removed. In the US, Naproxen has been
      marketed since 1976, and Naproxen Sodium has been approved for over-the-counter (OTC) use
      since 1994 for the temporary relief of minor aches and pains. Caffeine, which is generally
      consumed as coffee, tea or cocoa, has been shown to enhance the effectiveness of various pain
      relievers, and therefore is accepted as an additive to painkillers like aspirin and
      acetaminophen. Patients participating in this study will undergo a surgery to remove 3 or 4
      wisdom teeth. If the pain severity after the surgery meets the study requirement, patients
      will receive oral tablet(s) of Naproxen Sodium and Caffeine, or Naproxen Sodium, or Caffeine,
      or placebo (drug with no active ingredient). Patients can also receive additional pain
      medication when needed. Researchers will also learn if the patients have any medical problems
      during the study.
