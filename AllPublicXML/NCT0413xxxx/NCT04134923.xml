  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate adult children of parents with and without
      Alzheimer's disease which represent an ideal population for investigating the biological
      changes that precede the clinical onset of AD. The investigators will be imaging the brain to
      detect the presence of amyloid deposits (plaques in the brain). Amyloid is a protein that may
      be related to dementia of Alzheimer's disease (DAT).

      This study will use a radioactive tracer called [11C]-Pittsburgh Compound B (11C]PIB), which
      is a tracer that binds to beta amyloid protein in the brain. This compound is considered
      investigational, which means that it has not been approved by the United States Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA).

    <description>the annual rate of CDR progression will accelerate due to the aging of the ACS cohort., and estimate that among ~375 ACS participants who either remain CDR 0 currently and will continue to be clinically assessed or will be the new future enrollees, a total of 45 individuals will progress to CDR&gt;0 by the end of next funding cycle.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive a single intravenous bolus injection of 6.0 - 20.0 mCi (222-740 MBq) of the investigational radiotracer [11C] PIB. Participants will then undergo a [11C] PIB PET/CT scan conducted in the Center for Clinical Imaging Research (CCIR) facility.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female, any race;

          -  Age â‰¥ 18 years;

          -  Active participants currently enrolled in the Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research
             Center (ADRC) at Washington University.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Hypersensitivity to [11C] PIB or any of its excipients;

          -  Contraindications to PET, CT or MRI (e.g. electronic medical devices, inability to lie
             still for extended periods) that make it unsafe for the individual to participate;

          -  Severe claustrophobia;

          -  Women who are pregnant or breast-feeding will be excluded from PIB PET participation;

          -  Has any condition that, in the opinion of the Sponsor-Investigator or designee could
             increase risk to the subject, limit the subject's ability to tolerate the research
             procedures, or interfere with collection of the data;

          -  Currently participating in any clinical trial which involves an active study
             medication or placebo within the past 30 days before scanning and up to 2-weeks past
             the imaging visit.

          -  Current or recent (within 12 months prior to screening) participation in research
             studies involving radioactive agents such that the total research-related radiation
             dose to the participant in any given year would exceed the limits set forth in the
             U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 21 Section 361.1.
