  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the efficacy and safety of 12-week goal-directed therapy in the treatment of
      refractory inflammatory patients, and to initially explore treatment options. Patients with
      potential risk factors for recurrence after surgery for Crohn's disease and a serum 25(OH)D
      concentration &lt;75 nmol/L were prescribed oral liquid vitamin D supplementation over 12 weeks
      using a specific protocol with dose adjusted 4-weekly to aim for a target level of 100-125
      nmol/L.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The patients received oral liquid cholecalciferol supplementation (OsteVit DTM, Key
      Pharmaceuticals, Macquarie Park, NSW, Australia), supplied in 50 mL bottles (5000 units in 1
      mL). A target 25(OH)D of 100-125 nmol/L was planned and the dose titrated 4-weekly.

      Patients were evaluated at week 0 (screening visit), then 2- weekly until week 12, and at a
      follow-up visit at week 16. Key study endpoints were change in total 25(OH)D and attainment
      of level of 100e125 nmol/L. Intestinal inflammation was assessed via clinical disease
      activity (CDAI), faecal calprotectin (Calprotectin ELISA, Buhlmann, Basel, Switzerland), and
      circulating inflammatory markers (platelet count, serum albumin and C- reactive protein).
      Safety was assessed by direct questioning and 24- h urinary calcium excretion . Compliance
      was checked by dosing diaries completed by patients and measuring remaining cholecalciferol
      in bottles of the study drug.

      Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS v20 (IBM Corporation, 2011) and GraphPad Prism
      v5.04 (Graphpad software, 2010). Dependent and independent samples t-tests, analysis of
      variance (ANOVA) and KruskaleWallis tests were used where appropriate. Associations with rise
      in 25(OH)D were examined by bivariate correlations. A p-value of 0.05 was considered
      statistically significant.
