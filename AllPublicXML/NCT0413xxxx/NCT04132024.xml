    <textblock>
      This study is a longitudinal clinical trial designed to characterize sleep patterns in
      individuals with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) as well as to assess the feasibility of
      sleep intervention (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I)) in individuals with
      both insomnia and Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD).

    <description>CBT-I has a specific protocol with behavioral targets that differ significantly from standard CBT. This approach focuses on implementing sleep restriction and stimulus control interventions which are fully deployed during the first session. We will deliver 5 CBT-I sessions over the course of 8 weeks. Key recommendations include: 1) reduce time in bed; 2) get up at the same time every day; 3) do not go to bed unless sleepy; 4) do not stay in bed awake for more than 15 minutes; and 5) avoid napping. Participants are also taught relaxation strategies and cognitive therapy addresses arousal and catastrophizing.</description>
