  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In an effort to engage more HIV-infected PWUD into care, and ensure treatment adherence and
      efficacy, simplification of older, multi-tablet regimens is required. Newer, more potent
      molecules can also overcome resistant that has persisted with previous regimens, while
      simultaneously providing a high barrier to resistance. The co-formulation of B/F/TAF is a
      viable switch-option for patients who have experienced lower adherence with previous regimens
      due to high pill burden, or for those requiring a more potent regimen due to emergent
      resistances. The formal evaluation of B/F/TAF in this context will allow us to optimize care
      for HIV-infected PWUD.
