      Purpose: The aim of this study was to compare the effects of two different home exercise
      methods on exercise compliance, neck pain and neck disability in individuals with neck pain.

      Material and metods: The study, carried out between February 2018 and May 2018 at Istanbul
      Arel University Vocational School, was performed with 60 people aged 25-60 years who were
      suffering from neck pain in academic and administrative staff. The cases were randomly
      divided into two groups. In Group 1, the case was given home exercise method (B.M.E.Y) with
      printed materials whereas Group 2 was given exercise with home exercise method (V.H.E.Y) with
      video phone reminder. Pain intensity was evaluated before and after exercise with 'Visual
      Analog Scale' (VAS), whereas the level of neck disability was evaluated before and after
      exercise with 'Neck Pain and Disability Score' (NPDS). The obtained results were analyzed
      using appropriate statistical methods.

      Both groups were prescribed the same type of exercise, duration of exercise and number of
      repetitions. group 1 completed the exercise program and marked the exercise attendance
      schedule. At the end of the program, these charts were collected from the subjects and the
      continuity was evaluated. The group marked the exercises completed with 2 phone app. In the
      program used, exercise continuity of the cases was evaluated as days.

      Exercises were given at least 3 times a week for 10 weeks and 1 set per day for a total of 6
      weeks. individuals; normal joint movement exercises; neck flexion, lateral flexion, rotation,
      extension and retraction movements, isometric exercises; neck flexion, extension, lateral
      flexion and rotation movements and stretching exercises; neck lateral flexion, neck rotation
      and flexion movements were given.
