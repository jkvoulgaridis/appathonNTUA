      Secondary data analysis will be performed as our approach to complete the study. A nationally
      representative dataset (BRFSS, 2017) will be used to answer our research questions. Our
      rationale is that there is insufficient research assessing the relationship between pulmonary
      status and e-cigarette use and that some factors, such as behavioral variables or
      psychosocial variables, might influence this relationship. Our expectation is that this study
      will deepen the understanding of the relationship between pulmonary status and e-cigarette
      use among U.S. adults. This study will cast light on different factors that influence the
      relationship between pulmonary status and e-cigarette use. Also, the following secondary
      outcomes will be tested: Severity of COPD symptoms (COPD group) moderate the relationship
      between pulmonary status (COPD status) and e-cigarette use, and Severity of asthma symptoms
      (asthma group) moderate the relationship between pulmonary status (asthma status) and
      e-cigarette use.

    <measure>Poor mental health mediate the relationship between pulmonary status (pulmonary vs. non-pulmonary) and e-cigarette use.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>This question assesses mental health, including stress, depression, and emotional problems, by asking participants the number of days out of the last 30 days that their mental health was not good (continuous variables).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Smoking mediate the relationship between pulmonary status (pulmonary vs. non-pulmonary) and e-cigarette use.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Smoking: This scale assesses the frequency of smoking cigarettes: 1 = every day, 2 = some days, 3 = not at all.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>E-cigarette use (Dependent Variable)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>This survey item asks participants if they ever used an e-cigarette or other electronic &quot;vaping&quot; product, even just one time, in their entire life (Yes/No).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Alcohol use moderate the relationship between pulmonary status (pulmonary vs. healthy) and e-cigarette use</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>This question assesses the number of days in the last 30 days that participants have drunk alcohol (continuous variables).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>(healthy days (health-related quality of life) mediate the relationship between pulmonary status (pulmonary vs. non-pulmonary) and e-cigarette use.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>In reference to healthy days, these questions assess health-related quality of life, which is going to be assessed by asking questions concerning the number of days out of the last 30 days that the participants were physically or mentally ill (continuous variables).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Marijuana use moderate the relationship between pulmonary status (pulmonary vs. healthy) and e-cigarette use.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>This question assesses the number of days in the last 30 days that participants have used marijuana or hashish (continuous variables).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Severity of COPD symptoms (COPD group) moderate the relationship between pulmonary status (COPD, asthma) and e-cigarette use</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Three questions are posed to assess the severity of COPD symptoms. The responses of these questions are combined to form a composite score. The first question will assess coughing, the second question will assess phlegm production, and the third question will assess shortness of breath. Answers for each of the three questions will be in a yes/no format and will be represented on a scale of 1â€’3, where 1 is less severe and 3 is more severe.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>asthma symptoms (asthmatic group) moderate the relationship between pulmonary status (COPD, asthma) and e-cigarette use.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Several questions determine the severity of asthma symptoms. The first question will assess the asthma symptoms by asking the participants the number of days they were unable to work or carry out their usual activities because of their asthma symptoms (continuous variables). The second question will assess coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness and phlegm production by asking participants the number of days out of the last 30 that they have any of the previous symptoms (continuous variables). The final question will symptoms of asthma make it difficult for the participants to stay asleep (continuous variables).</description>
