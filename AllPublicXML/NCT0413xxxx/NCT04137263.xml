    <textblock>
      Melasma is a hyperpigmentation disorder that presents as irregularly shaped macules on the
      face of women. The etiology is unknown however there is strong evidence that genetics,
      hormones, sun exposure can trigger and worsen the disease. Increased dermal vascularity and
      expression of angiogenic factors also seem to play a role. Melasma is a chronic and relapsing
      condition, that is difficult to treat, and can have a negative impact on quality of life.

      Numerous treatments exist for melasma including topical lightening agents, chemical peels,
      and a variety of laser and light based options. Long-term management is difficult as topical
      agents can often cause irritation, burning, peeling and inflammatory hyperpigmentation. Light
      based therapies can also lead to relapse or worsening of the disease.

      Melasma, in combination with photodamage from cumulative sun exposure and aging, can lead to
      a complex picture when making a skin care plan for a cosmetic patient. The custom D.O.S.E
      professional service can be utilized to make a personalized serum to improve skin
      discoloration and the visible signs of aging. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the
      efficacy of D.O.S.E formulations in the treatment of melasma and visible signs of aging.
