  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized crossover study that will examine how sedentary behavior (decreased
      physical activity) over time and returning to normal physical activity affects cardiovascular
      health (i.e. heart rate and blood pressure) and sleep quality/duration.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      1. To test the hypothesis that two weeks of sedentary behavior will progressively impair
      vascular endothelial function 2: To test the hypothesis that increasing sedentary behavior
      will decrease total sleep duration and sleep efficiency.

      3: To test the hypothesis that two-weeks of sedentary behavior will progressively increase
      24-h blood pressure and reduce nocturnal blood pressure dipping.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants will become more inactive and also maintain their activity (in randomized order)
      and also come in for 3-hour uninterrupted sitting visits. Cardiovascular, activity, and sleep
      measures will be taken throughout.

    <measure>Activity Perception</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Activity perception will be measured before each prolonged sitting trial using an Activity Perception questionnaire (Perception of Current Activity Questionnaire). The questionnaire has 7 questions with answers ranging from 1 to 5. The range of scores is from 7 to 35, with 7 suggesting a strong negative perception of current activity, and 35 suggesting a strong positive perception of current activity.</description>

    <description>Participants will visit the research laboratory for baseline measurements at visit 1 after wearing a pedometer for one week and maintaining their normal level of physical activity. After the baseline visit, participants will reduce their step count by more than half for two weeks, and then maintain baseline activity level for two weeks. The fifth week will be maintaining baseline activity level. Participants will visit the laboratory once every week during these 5 weeks.</description>
