  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The first line therapy for an initial episode of CDI (Clostridium difficile infection) is
      10-14 days of oral vancomycin which is now recommended over metronidazole in the 2018
      guidelines from the Association of Medical Microbiologists and Infectious Diseases of Canada
      (AMMI). Although response rates for the treatment of a first episode of CDI now approach 90%,
      approximately 25% of patients who have a complete response will develop recurrence (rCDI)
      within 8 weeks. Doctors' ability to predict recurrence is evolving, but remains very limited.

      The investigators hypothesize that by extending initial vancomycin therapy with a 2-week
      tapering regimen this will reduce the risk of rCDI. Starting at the end of the initial 14
      days of therapy, participants will be randomized to receive an additional 14-days of placebo
      or vancomycin taper (125 mg orally twice daily x 7 days followed by 125 mg orally once daily
      x 7 days). This taper was chosen as it represents two steps of a commonly used 4-week
      vancomycin taper.

      The investigators' proposal to evaluate the extension of initial treatment from 14 to 28 days
      with a tapering dose of vancomycin represents a practical clinical trial that capitalizes on
      oral vancomycin's safety profile, worldwide availability, and relatively low cost.

      STUDY POPULATION

      This is a multi-centre study involving institutions in British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec.
      The study population will be drawn from patients cared for as inpatients or outpatients at
      the participating hospitals. Such patients will have a test positive for Clostridium
      difficile and will be receiving treatment. The trial will involve only adult patients 18
      years of age and older.

      Criteria for Recruitment

      The microbiology laboratory will notify the study team about a positive CDI test via
      telephone, email, or fax. The nature of recruitment will then depend on the inpatient status
      of the patient at the time of the test.

      Inpatients:

      Pre-existing approval for approaching patients for this study will be obtained from the
      relevant department heads. The study team will speak with a member of the inpatient treating
      team (resident physician or faculty physician as appropriate) to determine if the patient is
      appropriate for recruitment. If this seems to be the case, the patient's file will be rapidly
      screened to determine eligibility and if the patient is eligible they will be approached for
      consent.

      Outpatients:

      The physician who ordered the C. difficile test will be contracted to determine if the
      patient is appropriate for recruitment. At the invitation of this physician, the
      investigators will then contact the patient via telephone to evaluate suitability for
      inclusion and arrange an intake visit.

      RANDOMIZATION

      For patients who have enrolled in the study, randomization will occur centrally at McGill via
      an existing internet application (such as https://cloudtrials.mchi.mcgill.ca/) and will be
      performed by permuted block with randomized block sizes. This randomization will be
      stratified for first episode or first recurrence at study entry to ensure these factors are
      properly balanced.

      TRIAL SCHEDULE

        -  Day 1: Patient diagnosed with C. difficile -&gt; Determine eligibility and obtain
           permission for approach

        -  Day 7-10 (Patient's C. difficile has improved and meets eligibility): Consent obtained;
           randomization; distribution of study drug for day 14 start -&gt; Collection of
           demographics, storage of stool.

        -  Day 14-28 -&gt; Receipt of study therapy

        -  Day 28: In person visit

        -  Day 56: In person visit -&gt; Primary outcome determined, quality of life questionnaire

        -  Day 90: Study ends for the patient -&gt; Secondary outcomes can be determined

        -  weekly until Day 56: Brief questionnaire -&gt; By email/text/phone

        -  biweekly after Day 56: Brief questionnaire -&gt; By email/text/phone

        -  Ad hoc: If patient has symptoms of recurrence of C. difficile -&gt; Review by ID physician
           in clinic if possible, otherwise usual doctors or emergency room

      Patients will be able to come be assessed for potential relapse by infectious diseases
      physicians at each site (who may or may not be a part of the study) or could see their usual
      doctors.

      SAMPLE SIZE AND STATISTICAL METHODS

      The estimated number of CDI cases available has been based on fiscal year 2016 data: total of
      1770 per year.

      The risk of recurrence is estimated at 25%. The investigators aim to demonstrate that an
      initial tapering regimen is associated with an absolute decrease in the risk of relapse of at
      least 10% (number needed to treat of 10) which would be similar to than the effect seen
      within 40 days in the fidaxomicin trial. This estimate accounts for our longer period of
      follow up and will allow some flexibility in the actual recurrence rate found in our control
      arm. With 80% power and a type 1 error of 5%, this would require 276 patients to complete
      follow up in each arm (total 552).

A double blind and placebo will be used because the knowledge of being on active drug might influence patient reporting on gastrointestinal symptoms or physician interpretation of such symptoms leading to asymmetrical workup of CDI recurrence and hence bias in the results.
To avoid other sources of bias post-randomization, patients, research personnel, investigators, endpoint adjudicators, and study analysis will all remain blinded to the intervention status until completion of the analysis and reporting of results. Analysis will be performed by intention to treat.</masking_description>

    <time_frame>Within 56 days of initial diagnosis</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be contacted via text message, email, or phone call weekly until day 56 to determine if they have had a recurrence. After day 56 this will be bi-weekly until day 90.
Recurrence will be assessed by clinical record review (chart, laboratory, pharmacy records) and direct patient interview. Blinded case summaries will be reviewed in duplicate with disagreement resolved by consensus.
CDI recurrence will be defined by three or more diarrheal stools/24-hour period coupled with a positive PCR for toxin gene or and/or detection of toxin by EIA or CCA and administration of treatment. However, to avoid missing severe recurrences: for cases of ileus, toxic megacolon, or pseudomembranous colitis on colonoscopy the test result will be used in the absence of three or more stools.</description>

    <description>If a patient misses their day 28 or day 56 in-person follow up, we will initially review their hospital file to see if they have died. If this does not show death, we will contact the patient (or their proxy) by telephone to determine why they missed the follow up and reschedule it as required. If we cannot reach the patient or their proxy, and the patient has not been replying to the email/text/phone surveys we will search the obituaries.
After day 56 we will use the survey responses as proof of life. If there is no response to the day 90 survey by day 95, we will first check the hospital file to see if they have died. Then, if vital status is not clear, we will search the obituaries. Then if vital status is still not clear, we will attempt to reach the patient by telephone. If we cannot reach the patient, we will record that patient as lost to follow up but include a sensitivity analysis including these patients as having died.</description>

    <description>Economic analysis will be carried out from the perspective of the McGill University Health Centre (MUHC) following established guidelines and will be generalized to the rest of Canada.
We will estimate the average cost per patient of using the interventions under study routinely in patients with C. difficile diarrhea. We will also gather information on the cost of health services use (hospitalizations and other interventions such as colectomy) following this intervention to determine the budget impact compared with routine practice. If the intervention proves efficacious, we will carry out a cost-benefit or cost-effectiveness analysis to determine the incremental cost per case of C. difficile diarrhea avoided. The base case will be the placebo group, to which the treatment will be compared. Further, we will carry out a cost utility analysis to report the incremental cost per unit increase in quality of life as measured by the Cdiff32 score.</description>
