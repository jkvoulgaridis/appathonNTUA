  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The new called &quot;Generation Z&quot; is starting to reach college age. They have adopted technology
      and create a deep dependence on it, becoming more drawn to the virtual world. M-learning has
      experienced a huge expansion in recent years in both, medical context and medical and
      health's sciences education. Ultrasound is an important diagnosis technique in physiotherapy,
      especially in sports pathology. m-Learning environments could be a useful tool for improve
      the comprehension of ultrasound concepts and the acquisition of professional competencies.
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and the use of an interactive platform
      accessible through mobile devices (ECOFISIO) using ultrasound imaging for the development of
      professional competencies in the evaluation and diagnosis of sports pathologies.

      Participants were 110 undergraduate students enrolled in two groups of this randomized
      controlled multicentre study: a control group (traditional learning) and experimental group
      (ECOFISIO mobile application). All participants were assessed both theoretically and by means
      of the Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) exams.

    <description>An OSCE is a type of examination often used in health sciences. It is designed to test clinical skill performance and competence in a range of skills. The OSCE content and scoring procedures are standardized. It consists of five stations with five specific components of musculoskeletal ultrasound. Each test station is designed to focus on an area of clinical competence, namely: patient positioning, ultrasound probe positioning, ultrasound probe orientation (angle), ultrasound probe management and image adjustment. A standardized scoring tool is used to record what you do or don't do well, with a Likert scale with a range of 0 to 4 to rate the specific efficiency of each component. All OSCE candidates experience the same problem and are asked to perform the same task, within the same deadline. OSCEs are now widely used in undergraduate, graduate and undergraduate assessments. Overall reliability for this tool, Cronbach's alpha, is 0.89.</description>
