  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our purpose is to determine the incidence of trigger points in patients who remain in a fixed
      position for a long time during lumbar disc herniation surgery.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The 110 participants between 30-70 years are chosen from patients who had lumbar disc
      herniation surgery. The trigger points are determined by manually palpating quadratus
      lumborum, iliocostalis lumborum, gluteus Maximus, gluteus minimus, gluteus medius, ve
      piriformis muscles before and after surgery. Data will be recorded on the patient assessment
      file and transferred to the computer and analyzed. Data analysis will be performed with
      SPSS.20.

    <measure>Manual Palpation</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline (preoperative state) to postoperative first and third day</time_frame>
    <description>The patients are positioned in a sitting and prone lying posture.Trigger points are discrete, local, hypersensitive spots located in a taut band of muscles. Palpation of the trigger point will cause elicitation pain over the affected area and radiation of pain toward a zone of reference and a local twitch response.</description>

    <measure>Visual Analog Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline (preoperative state) to postoperative first and third day</time_frame>
    <description>Pain will be assessed with Visual Analog Scale (VAS).The VAS is usually a horizontal line, 10 cm in length, anchored by word descriptors at each end with &quot;No Pain&quot; (score of zero) on the left side up to &quot;pain as bad as it could be&quot; or the &quot;worst imaginable pain&quot; (Score of 100 [100-mm scale]) on the right side.The patient was asked to mark the line point that represented his or her current pain.</description>
