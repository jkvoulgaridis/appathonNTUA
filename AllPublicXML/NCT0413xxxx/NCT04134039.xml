  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This investigation is designed to evaluate the performance rate of a polyurethane (PU) condom
      versus a standard natural rubber latex (NRL) condom.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this clinical investigation, a new PU male condom (test condom) will be evaluated against
      a marketed NRL male condom (reference condom). This clinical investigation will also evaluate
      the in-use tolerance of the test and reference condoms.

    <measure>Compared clinical failure rate of condom use between the test condom group and the reference condom group</measure>
    <time_frame>within 2 hours following each coital act for each condom use</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical failure rate is calculated as the number of condoms with at least 1 acute clinical failure event divided by the number of condoms used during intercourse, reported as a percentage. Clinical failure events, defined in ISO 29943-1:2017, will be reported by subjects.</description>

    <measure>Performance (clinical slippage rate) of the Polyurethane (PU) condom</measure>
    <time_frame>within 2 hours following each coital act for each condom use</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical slippage rate is calculated as the number of condoms with at least 1 clinical slippage event divided by the number of condoms used during intercourse, reported as a percentage. Clinical slippage events, defined in ISO 29943-1:2017, will be reported by subjects.
A clinical slippage is defined as a condom slipping off completely during intercourse or during withdrawal from the vagina. Slippage that occur because the user failed to hold onto the condom at the base of the penis during withdrawal and/ or because the user delayed withdrawal after sex are to be record as &quot;non-clinical slippage&quot;, these events are considered user failures.</description>

             relationship - current relationship â‰¥ 3 months.

          3. All couples must be sexually active and agree to have penile-vaginal intercourse with
             a frequency sufficient to meet protocol requirements (a minimum of 5 coital acts over
             4 weeks).

          4. The female partner should use one other established highly effective form of
             non-barrier contraception, unless post-menopausal.

          5. Couples must agree not to use drugs or non-investigational devices that can affect
             sexual performance.

        Main Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Either partner is or becomes aware of an allergy or sensitivity to the ingredients of
             the test products, including the test or reference condoms.

          2. Either partner has a pre-existing skin condition (severe eczema/ psoriasis) or
             systemic allergic reactions or as confirmed by the subject and physical examination.

          3. Either partner that needs to use condoms for a specific sexually transmitted infection
             (STI) protection e.g. discordance for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) or herpes.

          4. Subjects that have previous or planned genital surgery, that in the opinion of the
             Investigator would consider the subject unsuitable to participate in the clinical
             investigation e.g. laser for abnormal smear.

          5. Male partners that have known erectile or ejaculatory dysfunction.

          6. A female partner that has been diagnosed with or treated for vaginal complaints
             (including vaginal dryness) in the previous 3 months which, in the opinion of the
             investigator, deems the partner unsuitable for the investigation.

          7. Any subject who has clinical symptoms or signs of a sexually transmitted diseases
             (STD) or HIV/ AIDS or has a previous history of high-risk behaviour as judged by the
             investigator.

          8. Female partner using medication which in the investigator's opinion would affect
             vaginal mucosal secretion, such as Chlorpheniramine at any time in the 14 days (or 5
             half-lives of the drug, whichever is longer) before first condom use.

          9. A male partner with abnormal penile anatomy that would, in the opinion of the
             investigator, affect the ability to keep the condom in place during intercourse.

         10. Either partner intends to continue to use antihistamines, anti-inflammatory drugs or
             pain killers for the duration of the investigation.
