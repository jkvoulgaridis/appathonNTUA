  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative pain management and opioid consumption following outpatient orthopaedic surgery
      may be influenced by a number of variables including knowledge of safe opioid use. A
      prospective randomized study is designed to understand the effect of preoperative opioid
      counseling on postoperative opioid consumption and the typical opioid consumption patterns
      following common outpatient orthopaedic surgeries. The hypothesis was that patients who
      received preoperative opioid counseling will consume less postoperative opioid medication and
      experience greater satisfaction with pain management.

    <description>preoperative counseling consists of education with a brief multi-media presentation in the preoperative area on the day of surgery using a handheld tablet. The message of the preoperative counseling consisted of: 1) Background on the opioid epidemic including basic facts and consequences, 2) Description of risk factors for opioid abuse and how to consume opioids safely, 3) Information on the specific opioid the patient was prescribed and the anticipated amount and duration of use postoperatively, 4) Encouraging the use of non-opioid therapy prior to taking the prescribed opioids or quickly transitioning to non-opioid medications postoperatively, and 5) Contact information and instructions to call if the patient experienced any adverse events and/or if additional pain medication is needed.</description>
