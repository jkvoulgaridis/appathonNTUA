    <textblock>
      Catheter-related bladder discomfort (CRBD) secondary to an indwelling urinary catheter is
      very distressing. It is not unusual that patients who have been catheterized under anesthesia
      complain of an urge to void in the postoperative period because of catheter-related bladder
      irritation. Bladder catheterization induces bladder irritation whose symptoms (urge to void
      and discomfort in the suprapubic region) are similar to the symptoms of an overactive bladder
      (urinary frequency and urgency with or without urge incontinence), caused by involuntary
      contractions of the bladder mediated by muscarinic receptors. The discomforts are quickly
      getting worse in patients undergoing transurethral surgery by a surgical instrument as well
      as a sizable urinary catheter placement. Recently, antimuscarinic drugs for treat overactive
      bladder, such as tolterodine and oxybutynin, have been tried for prevention of CRBD with
      variable success. However, they may cause side effect including palpitation, dry mouth,
      drowsiness, dizziness or headache. Lidocaine, a local anesthetic, showed of analgesic,
      sedative and anti-inflammatory effect. Therefore, the investigators prepared a 0.05%
      lidocaine in normal saline as a bladder irrigation solution after surgery to reduce
      Catheter-related bladder discomfort.

      Objectives:

      The aim of this study were:

        1. to evaluate the efficacy to prevent CRBD with Bladder irrigation with 0.05% Lidocaine
           normal saline solution

        2. to observe the change of vital sign with Bladder irrigation with 0.05% Lidocaine normal
           saline solution

        3. to see the side effect of with Bladder irrigation with 0.05% Lidocaine normal saline
           solution
