  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Using gene therapy to express active telomerase (hTERT) in human cells has the potential to
      treat many neurodegenerative diseases related to aging, including Alzheimer's disease (AD).

      This study will entail treating subjects with hTERT delivered via transduction using AAV. The
      goal is to extend the telomeres to prevent, delay, or even reverse the development of the
      pathology of AD. It is expected to have a direct consequence on cognitive function and
      quality of life in patients with neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients diagnosed with AD who meet with the inclusion - exclusion criteria, will be treated
      with a single dose of LGT delivered intravenously (IV) and intrathecally (IT).

      Baseline will be performed within 8 weeks of beginning the treatment regimen. The treatment
      regimen will begin with IV delivery of AAV-hTERT, defined as &quot;Day 0.&quot; Safety and efficacy
      analyses will be conducted at Weeks 1, 4, 13, 26, 39, and 52 post-treatment.

      Study objectives

      Primary: Safety and Tolerability

      1. Investigate the safety and tolerability of AAV-hTERT by IV and IT administration.

      Secondary: Provisional Efficacy

        1. Investigate LGT's ability to deliver hTERT to human cells and lengthen telomeres.

        2. Investigate the effects of lengthening telomeres on AD.

        3. Investigate other benefits provided by lengthening telomeres.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Subjects must meet the following inclusion criteria at the screening visit.

          1. Age of 45 years or older.

          2. Clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease or early signs of dementia.

          3. Subjects, or their authorized representatives, must be adequately informed and
             understand the nature and risks of the study and must be able to provide a signature
             and date in the Informed Consent Form (ICF).

          4. Women must undergo a negative serum pregnancy test at the screening assessment.

          5. Subjects, or their representatives, must be able to communicate effectively with the
             study staff.

          6. Subjects, or their authorized representatives, must certify that they are able and
             willing to follow all protocol requirements and study restrictions.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Subjects are not eligible for the study if they meet any of the following criteria at the
        screening visit, unless otherwise specified.

          1. Subjects who have a history of allergy, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to any
             medications, components, or excipients of the investigational product, which cannot be
             resolved by the staff conducting the study.

          2. Female subjects who are pregnant, expected to become pregnant, or lactating/nursing.

          3. Subjects who are sexually active and who are unwilling or unable to use a method of
             effective contraception (e.g., hormonal and/or barrier) during their participation in
             the study.

          4. Subjects who are intolerant of, or do not wish to receive, IV or IT injections.

          6. Subjects who cannot tolerate venipuncture and/or venous access.

          7. Subjects who have donated or had a significant loss of whole blood (480 ml or more)
             within 30 days, or donated plasma or platelets within 14 days prior to screening.

             screening assessment, or plan to participate in another clinical trial, while in this
             study if in the opinion of the principal investigator, may place the subject at risk
             due to participation in the study, or may influence the results of the study or the
             subject's ability to complete the study. If more than 30 days have passed since
