      To determine the safety and tolerability of RBX7455 given for at least 2 weeks prior to
      surgery. To evaluate intratumoral immunomodulatory effects, including TILs, CD4, and CD8 T
      cells, in operable breast cancer patients.

      Microbiota and host form a complex super-organism with symbiotic relationships, which confer
      several benefits to the host. However, disruptions and alterations of the microbiome through
      environmental changes may disturb this symbiotic relationship and promote disease,
      particularly cancer(1). Growing literature indicates the key role of gut microbiome and
      carcinogenesis. Perturbations of gut microbiome through changes in diet and use of
      antibiotics have been shown to sufficiently promote cancer in mouse models(2,3). The
      mechanisms, which microbiotas promote carcinogenesis, were through the increase in
      pro-inflammatory stimuli via Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which is a cornerstone of innate
      immunity, as well as the release of genotoxins, virulence factors, and carcinogenic
      metabolites. Furthermore, multiple studies also demonstrated that gut microbiota can alter
      the efficacy of anticancer therapy via immunological modulation in several preclinical
      models. These immunomodulatory effects include induction of TH1 response(4), increase in
      intratumoral cytotoxic T lymphocytes/regulatory T (Treg) cells ratio(5), increase in
      long-term memory CD4+ T helper cells, increase tumor-infiltrating interferon γ (IFNγ)
      producing γδT cells. Nevertheless, the effects of changing gut microbiome using probiotics in
      human breast cancers are largely unknown. In this particular study, we propose to evaluate
      the immunological effects of a novel oral Microbiome Restoration Therapy™ (MRT), RBX7455, in
      patients with stage I-III breast cancer prior to undergoing definitive surgery.
