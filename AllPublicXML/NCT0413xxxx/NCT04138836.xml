  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study to determine the effect of multiple-dose BBT-877 on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of
      midazolam, the safety and tolerability of a single dose of BBT-877 administered alone and
      with multiple doses of itraconazole, and the effect of multiple-dose esomeprazole on the
      single-dose pharmacokinetics of BBT-877, in healthy adult subjects.

             months prior to the first dose and throughout the study.

          3. BMI ≥ 18.5 and ≤ 32.0 kg/m2 and weight ≥ 50 kg at screening.

          4. Medically healthy with no clinically significant medical history, physical
             examination, laboratory profiles, vital signs, as deemed by the PI or designee.

          5. No clinically significant history or presence of ECG findings as judged by the PI or
             qualified designee at screening and first check-in.

          6. For a female, must be of non-childbearing potential.

          7. A non-vasectomized, male subject must agree to use a condom with spermicide or abstain

             drug.

          8. If male, must agree to not donate sperm from the first dose until 90 days after the
             last dose of study drug(s).

          9. Must have the ability to understand and sign a written informed consent form (ICF),

             in the study.

          4. History or presence of alcoholism or drug abuse within the past 2 years prior to the
             first dose or regular alcohol consumption within 6 months prior to the first dose.

          5. History or presence of hypersensitivity or idiosyncratic reaction to the study drug(s)
             or related compounds.

          8. Liver function tests (serum ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase) and serum bilirubin (total
             and direct) &gt; upper limit of normal at screening or first check-in.

          9. Baseline hemoglobin, hematocrit, RBC &lt; lower limit of normal at screening and Day -1
             of Period 1.

         10. Female subjects who are of childbearing potential.
