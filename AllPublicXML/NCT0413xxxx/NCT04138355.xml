  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      No study has investigated the effect of extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) on hand
      function and hypertrophic scar characteristics. To investigate ESWT effects on burned hands,
      the investigators compare the results of ESWT combined with manual therapy group to the
      results of matched conventional(CON) rehabilitation combined with manual therapy group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hands are the most frequent injury sites caused by burn, and appropriate rehabilitation is
      essential to ensure that good functional recovery is achieved. In burn patients, the wound
      healing process may lead to a fibrotic hypertrophic scar, which is raised, red, inflexible
      and responsible functional and cosmetic impairments.

      This randomized, controlled trial involved 40 patients with burns and dominant right-hand
      function impairment. Patients were randomized into a ESWT or a CON group. Each intervention
      was applied to the affected hand for 4 weeks once per week. Hand function was evaluated using
      the Jebsen-Taylor hand function test (JTT), grasp and pinch power test, and Michigan Hand
      Outcomes Questionnaire (MHQ). These assessments were evaluated pre-intervention and 4 weeks
      post-intervention.

    <intervention_model_description>The patients' burn scars had re-epithelialized after aseptic care or skin graft. We included patients aged ≥18 years with a deep partial-thickness (second-degree) burn or a full thickness (third-degree) burn to their hands, with joint contracture(hand and wrist), having been transferred to the rehabilitation department after acute burn treatment, and less than 6 months since the onset of the burn injury. Selected patients had a history of hand surgery resulting in painful, retracting scarring on hands.</intervention_model_description>
