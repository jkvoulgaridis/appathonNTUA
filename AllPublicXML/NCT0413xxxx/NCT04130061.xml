  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the application of hAM at the time of cardiac surgery to decrease
      inflammation and the subsequent substrate to reduce incidence of post-operative atrial
      fibrillation. Patients will randomized 1:1 to receive either hAM application or standard of
      care.

    <measure>Safety assessment of the use of human amniotic membrane during cardiac surgery by incidence of adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The AM applied epicardially will be assessed for signs of hyperacute rejection i.e. membrane changing color; cardiac tamponade or constriction assessed by echocardiogram and transmission of infectious diseases. The incidence of adverse events (AEs) will be reported as percentages, with two-sided 95% confidence intervals. Statistical comparisons of AEs between the AM treatment and the control group will be made using a chi-square, or Fisher's exact test, as appropriate (based on the minimum expected cell frequencies).</description>

    <measure>Comparison of the incidence of Post Op Atrial Fibrillation between patients who receive hAM and controls</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The incidence of Post Op Atrial Fibrillation will be compared between the treatment and control group using mobile telemetry. This comparison will be analyzed using chi-square or Fisher's exact test as appropriate.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparison of inflammatory response (systemic and pericardial) between patients who received hAM and controls</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The proinflammatory response to cardiopulmonary bypass circuit as measured by numerous systemic and pericardial inflammatory markers i.e. C-reactive protein (CRP), TNF-Î±, Interleukin (IL)-6 and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), have been linked to induction of atrial fibrillation. We will collect pericardial (from chest tubes) and systemic fluid markers at pre-specified intervals. We will assess the percentage change in the levels of the biomarkers as compared to their pre-operative baseline, as there will be expected variability in the level of these biomarkers at baseline.</description>
