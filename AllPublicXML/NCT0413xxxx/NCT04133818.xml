    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of a one-day-and-a-half no intensive

      subacute or chronic LBP for whom first-line treatments had failed but for whom an intensive
      multidisciplinary rehabilitation program was not indicated.

      Retrospectively, data of patients between 18 and 60 years who had benefited in the PMR unit
      of Cochin' hospital of a one-day-and-a-half no intensive multidisciplinary education and
      exercise therapy program are collected.

      This no intensive multidisciplinary education and exercise therapy program is proposed by the
      PMR unit of Cochin' hospital to all patients with a subacute or chronic low back pain for
      whom first-line treatments had failed but for whom an intensive multidisciplinary
      rehabilitation program is not indicated.

      It is done in group of 4 to 6 people, performed by medical doctors with experience in the
      management of patients with low back pain, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, and
      psychologist.

      Data regarding feasibility of this program were recorded with autoquestionnaires that
      patients had to fill in during the program and 3 months after.
