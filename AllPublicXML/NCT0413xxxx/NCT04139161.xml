  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to determine the effect of a cycling training program which modulates
      frontal and sagittal plane knee joint loading with graded increases of Q-Factor and cycling
      workrate in persons with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The knee joint is one of the most common joints affected by osteoarthritis, and knee
      osteoarthritis is primarily observed in the medial compartment. This is in part attributable
      to the increased load experienced by the medial compartment during level walking. Patients
      with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis exhibit altered gait mechanics; namely a reduced loading
      response knee extension moment and an increased internal knee abduction moment. As a
      surrogate measure for medial compartment joint loading, loading response knee abduction
      moment in level walking has been shown to increase with the severity of knee osteoarthritis.

      Recent gait modification research has shown that increased step-width decreases peak Knee
      abduction moment for persons with knee osteoarthritis. The inter-pedal width of a bicycle or
      cycle ergometer, known as Q-Factor, is analogous in cycling to step-width in gait. In
      contrast to gait, increased Q-Factor has been shown to increase the knee abduction moment
      during stationary cycling. Modulating sagittal and frontal plane loading of the knee in a
      graded manner during cycling may promote healthy adaptation to muscle weakness and pain. This
      adaptation may be manifest through restoration of altered knee joint biomechanics (knee
      extension moment, knee abduction moment), which, in turn, may also provide benefit to gait
      mechanics.

    <description>Participants will progress through three increasing Q-Factors for each cycling workrate; Q-Factor 1 (Q1, 192mm), Q2 (234mm), Q3 (276mm). After completing bouts of all three Q-Factors for a given workrate, workrate will be increased by 20 Watts and bouts at each Q-Factor will be repeated.</description>

  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Procedure</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Q-Factor Intervention</intervention_name>
    <description>The intervention period will consist of 12 training sessions across four consecutive weeks, with three training sessions held per week. If pain is not increased or reduced and Rating of Perceived Exertion is â‰¤12, the participant will progress to the next bout. If pain is increased from the pre-bout pain score, participants will repeat the bout, at the same workrate and Q-Factor settings. Following this fashion, participants will progress through three increasing Q-Factors for each given workrate; Q-Factor 1 (Q1, 192mm), Q2 (234mm), Q3 (276mm). After completing bouts of all three Q-Factors for a given workrate, workrate will be increased by 20 Watts and bouts at each Q-Factor will be repeated. For each training session, participants will complete bouts of cycling until 1) the maximum number of bouts (4 bouts) has been accomplished, 2) self-reported Rating of Perceived Exertion &gt;12, indicating a transition to moderate physical activity, or 3) self-reported pain &gt;5.</description>
