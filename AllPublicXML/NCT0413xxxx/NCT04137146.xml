  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive disease, characterized by dopaminergic neurons
      degeneration in the substantia nigra. Postural and gait disorders usually occur in advanced
      PD patients. However, existing drugs and deep brain stimulation (DBS) therapy are not
      effective enough for these axial symptoms or cannot maintain long-term efficacy, which
      seriously reduce patients' quality of life. Sacral nerve stimulation(SNS) is a treatment for
      urinary symptoms in PD. It has been reported that SNS can also improve PD gait disturbance,
      but the level of evidence currently is low. We assume that SNS may have a similar mechanism
      to spinal cord stimulation and may be an effective treatment for PD gait disorder. However,
      there are few studies on the mechanism of SNS treatment. Therefore, we will conduct a large
      sample, prospective case-control study to provide a higher level of clinical evidence for
      sacral nerve stimulation in the treatment of gait disturbance in PD. Our primary objective is
      to evaluate the efficacy of SNS for gait disorder in PD. PD patients who have received DBS
      surgery but still have severe gait problems will be included. This study will contribute to
      evaluate the efficacy of SNS for gait disorder in PD, provide level II evidence for expanding
      the indications of SNS, varicocelectomy., and improve patients' quality of life.
