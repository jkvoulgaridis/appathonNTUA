    <description>The BASFI consist of a set of 10 questions designed to determine the degree of functional limitation in subjects with AS. The BASFI score was derived based on the average of questions 1 through 10. The first 8 questions considered activities related to functional anatomy and the final 2 questions assessed the subject's ability to cope with everyday life over the last week. A 10 cm visual analog scale (VAS) was used to answer the questions and the mean of the ten scales gave the BASFI score a value between 0 (easy) and 10 (impossible).</description>

The total BASMI score ranges from 0 to 10 reflecting mild to moderate disease activity and functional ability in the spinal column. The higher the BASMI score the more severe the patient's limitation of movement due to their ankylosing spondylitis</description>

             treatment. Contraceptive methods include but are not limited to: hormonal
             contraception, physical contraception, or abstinence.

        Note: During screening, women who have entered menopause for less than 12 continuous months
