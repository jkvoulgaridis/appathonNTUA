    <textblock>
      This is a 3-arm single center study of 35 patients. These cohorts will include 15 breast
      patients scheduled to undergo a biopsy, and 15 thyroid patients scheduled to undergo fine
      needle aspiration, biopsy, or thyroidectomy that consent to undergo an acoustic angiography
      in conjunction with b-mode ultrasound prior to their scheduled biopsy. Prior to imaging
      clinical patients, the third arm will include 5 healthy volunteers that will be imaged to
      optimize imaging parameters.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Increasing the sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic imaging in patients at high risk for
      breast or thyroid cancer could provide substantial clinical benefit by improving diagnosis,
      preventing over-treatment, and reducing healthcare costs. Acoustic angiography is a new type
      of contrast enhanced ultrasound imaging which is specifically sensitive to microvascular
      structure and density. It evaluates tumor micro-vasculature and may provide a powerful
      prognostic tool for the diagnosis of breast cancer, and eventually for treatment evaluation.

    <description>Acoustic angiography imaging involves a research ultrasound scanner as well as conventional b-mode ultrasound to guide the location of the imaging. The conventional ultrasound will be conducted just prior to the acoustic angiography for localization. Imaging will be performed within the package insert guidelines for ultrasound system mechanical index (a measurement of output power) when imaging perflutren contrast agent (less than 0.8).
Acoustic angiography imaging will be performed by trained medical personnel using mild compression to eliminate motion. Total imaging time is estimated to be less than 15 minutes.</description>
