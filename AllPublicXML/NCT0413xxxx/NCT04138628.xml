  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immunotherapy (checkpoint inhibitors) is approved as first and second line treatment to
      patients with metastatic bladder cancer. However, response rates are low and no biomarkers
      have yet shown strong predictive value for patient selection. Moreover, the term 'metastatic'
      is based on metastases visible on conventional CT scans and, thus, require a certain size of
      tumour load. Clinical trials are currently being conducted that investigate the use of
      adjuvant immunotherapy for this group of patients (treatment to all), which will result in
      massive over-treatment and huge costs to the healthcare system.

      This project has the primary objective to identify new indications for initiating
      immunotherapy in patients with metastatic bladder cancer. Sensitive molecular techniques for
      detection of tumor DNA in the blood will be used to identify patients with early signs of
      metastatic disease. In addition, comprehensive biomarker analysis will be performed to
      identify predictors of treatment response.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study aim at investigate the response rate and oncological outcome of systemic
      immunotherapy (PDL-1 inhibitor; atezolizumab) administered early at the time of biochemical
      relapse (circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) positive) in patients who have undergone radical
      cystectomy because of muscle invasive bladder cancer.

      Biomarkers that predict response to systemic immunotherapy will be identified by
      comprehensive multi-omics analysis of primary tumors and metastatic lesions. Furthermore, we
      will determine if ctDNA levels during therapy can be used as a biomarker for early indication
      of therapy response.

      The hypotheses is that 1) early initiation of immunotherapy in high-risk (ctDNA positive)
      patients will result in better response rates and improved survival compared to later
      treatment following conventional imaging diagnosis of metastasis, and 2) biomarkers for
      predicting response can be identified and used for tailoring treatment regimens in the future
      to patients at high risk and at high likelihood of response.

    <description>CR in the current study is defined as ctDNA negative status combined with regular imaging (CT) after treatment. Thus, any metastasis visible on CT at the time of treatment initiation should undergo complete response. In Study Subjects without visible metastasis on CT at the time of treatment, initiation should result in unchanged status on CT.
Data will be compared to available historical data on response to PD-1 / PD-L1 targeted agents.</description>
