  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The sponsor wants to investigate in this study how well the test medicine is taken up by the
      body when given orally (by mouth) as a tablet and solution, and as a solution for infusion
      (into a vein). The oral solution and solution for infusion will be radiolabelled.
      'Radiolabelled' means that the test medicine has a radioactive component which helps us to
      track where the test medicine is in the body, what it is broken down into, and how it leaves
      the body.

      The sponsor will also look at the safety and tolerability of the test medicine.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male between 30-64 years of age (extremes included), on the date of signing the
             Informed Consent Form (ICF).

          -  A body mass index (BMI) between 18.0-32.0 kg/m2, inclusive.

             history, physical examination, vital signs, 12-lead ECG, and fasting clinical
             laboratory safety tests. Clinical laboratory safety test results must be within the
             reference ranges or considered not clinically significant in the opinion of the
             investigator.

          -  Having a regular daily defecation pattern (i.e. 1 to 3 times per day).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known hypersensitivity to IMP ingredients or history of a significant allergic
             reaction to IMP ingredients as determined by the investigator, and/or known
             sensitivity to IMP or the excipients (e.g. lactose). Hayfever is allowed unless
             active.

          -  History of or a current immunosuppressive condition (e.g. human immunodeficiency virus
             [HIV] infection).

          -  Having any illness, judged by the investigator as clinically significant, in the 3
             months prior to first investigational medicinal product (IMP) administration.

          -  Participation in a study with 14C-radiolabeled drug in the last 12 months prior to
             first IMP administration.

          -  Radiation exposure, including that from the present study, excluding background
             radiation but including diagnostic X-rays and other medical exposures, exceeding 5 mSv
             in the last 12 months or 10 millisievert (mSv) in the last 5 years. No occupationally
             exposed worker, as defined in the Ionising Radiation Regulations 1999, can participate
             in the study.
