      To evaluate the diagnosis of laryngeal lesions using the Probe-based Confocal Laser
      Endomicroscopy in vivo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we will conduct in-vivo confocal laser endoscopic imaging studies of laryngeal
      and precancerous lesions to explore the value of pCLE in the diagnosis of laryngeal cancers.

    <description>pCLE images of malignant lesions were associated with crowded unorganized tissue architecture (a dark-gray background without identification of mucosal structures), irregular cells like cell clusters, amplified fluorescein leakage, and irregular vessels changes after intravenous injecting 10% fluorescein.</description>

    <intervention_name>Confocal Laser Endomicroscopy</intervention_name>
    <description>Confocal laser microendoscopy (CLE) as a new non-invasive imaging technique can be used for &quot;optical biopsy&quot;, which can perform real-time microscopic information of tissue in vivo at cellular level with resolutions up to 1μm and magnifications up to 1000 times. CLE is now being increasingly used with very promising results in gastroenterology, especially in the diagnostic investigation of Barret's esophagus, stomach cancer, colorectal cancer and various lesions of the biliary tract. With an intravenous injection of fluorescein, probe-based CLE (pCLE: GastroFlex probe with the Cellvizio laser system, Mauna Technologies, Paris, France) allows us to view the interstitial spaces, cells, and small capillaries in a window of 240 μm and to a depth of 60 μm.</description>
