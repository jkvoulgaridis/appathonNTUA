  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase Ia - Explore safety and establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended dose
      levels for phase Ib expansion phase of BI 905711 based on the frequency of patients
      experiencing dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) during the MTD evaluation period. The MTD
      evaluation period is defined as the first two treatment cycles (from first dose
      administration until the day preceding the third dose administration or end of REP in case of
      discontinuation before start of Cycle 3).

      Phase Ia - Explore pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, and efficacy to guide the determination
      of a potentially effective dose range for phase Ib in the absence of MTD.

      Phase Ib - Evaluate efficacy and safety of BI 905711 at a potentially effective dose range
      and determine the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D)

               -  Cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder carcinoma

          -  Patient who has failed all available conventional therapies known to confer clinical
             benefit for their disease based on local approved standards. For patients with
             colorectal cancer, prior treatment with regorafenib or TAS-102 is optional.

          -  Phase Ia (dose escalation) only: Patient with either measurable or
             non-measurable/non-evaluable disease.

          -  Phase Ia (expanded cohort) and Phase Ib (expansion phase) only: At least one target
             lesion that can be accurately measured per RECIST v.1.1

          -  Availability and willingness to undergo tumor biopsy before treatment to provide tumor
             tissue. Pre-treatment fresh tumor biopsy collections for biomarker analyses are
             considered optional in phase Ia and mandatory in phase Ib. However, fresh tumor
             biopsies will NOT be considered if significant risk procedures are required including
             (but not limited to) biopsies of the pancreas, or endoscopic procedures extending
             beyond the esophagus, stomach or bowel. Only non-significant risk procedures per the
             investigator's judgment will be used to obtain any biopsies specified in this study.
             In case a fresh tumor biopsy cannot be obtained due to before mentioned reasons an
             archived tumor tissue specimen needs to be submitted.

                  calculated by CKD-EPI formula or Japanese version of CKD-EPI formula for Japanese
                  patients).

             father a child must be ready and able to use highly effective methods of birth control
             per ICH M3 (R2) that result in a low failure rate of less than 1% per year when used
             consistently and correctly.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Treatment with a systemic anti-cancer therapy or investigational drug within 14 days

             requirements or which are considered relevant for the evaluation of the efficacy or
             safety of the trial drug, such as neurologic, psychiatric, infectious disease or
             active ulcers (gastro-intestinal (GI) tract, skin) or laboratory abnormality that may
             increase the risk associated with trial participation or trial drug administration,
             and in the judgment of the Investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for
             entry into the trial.

          -  Known pathological condition of GI tract, liver and pancreas, excluding the disease
             under study, that may interfere with assessment of drug safety or may increase the
             risk of toxicity:

               -  inflammatory bowel disease

               -  chronic pancreatitis

               -  other serious GI pathological conditions by judgment of the investigator e.g.
                  autoimmune disease with GI involvement, unexplained active diarrhea CTCAE grade
                  ≥2 according to CTCAE v5.0.

          -  Known history of human immunodeficiency virus infection.

          -  Any of the following laboratory evidence of hepatitis virus infection. Test results

          -  Chronic alcohol or drug abuse or any condition that, in the investigator's opinion,
             makes the patient an unreliable trial participant or unlikely to comply with the
             protocol requirements or not expected to complete the trial as scheduled.

          -  Women who are pregnant, nursing, or who plan to become pregnant while in the trial;
             female patients who do not agree to the interruption of breast feeding from the start
             of study treatment to within 30 days after the last study treatment.

          -  Presence of uncontrolled or symptomatic brain or subdural metastases. Inclusion of
             patients with brain metastases who have completed local therapy and are considered
             stable by the investigator, or with newly identified asymptomatic brain metastases at
             screening will be allowed. Use of corticosteroids is allowed if the dose was stable
             for at least 1 week before the baseline MRI.

          -  Patients who are under judicial protection and patients who are legally
             institutionalized

          -  Major surgery (major according to the investigator's assessment) performed within 3
             weeks prior to treatment start or planned within 3 months after screening, e.g. hip
             replacement.

          -  Any of the following cardiac criteria:

               -  Resting corrected QT interval (QTc) &gt;470 msec

               -  Any clinically important abnormalities (as assessed by the Investigator) in
                  rhythm, conduction, or morphology of resting ECGs, e.g., complete left bundle
                  branch block, third degree heart block

               -  Patients with an ejection fraction (EF) &lt;50% or the lower limit of normal of the
                  institutional standard will be excluded. Only in cases where the Investigator (or
                  the treating physician or both) suspects cardiac disease with negative effect on
                  the EF, will the EF be measured during screening using an appropriate method
                  according to local standards to confirm eligibility (e.g., echocardiogram,
                  multi-gated acquisition scan). A historic measurement of EF no older than 6
                  months prior to first administration of study drug can be accepted provided that
                  there is clinical evidence that the EF value has not worsened since this
                  measurement in the opinion of the Investigator or of the treating physician or
                  both.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to the trial medication and/or its components i.e. polysorbate
             20, sodium citrate, lysine hydrochloride, sucrose, citric acid.
