  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical Activity (PA) is recognized as the most effective method to prevent falls in the
      elderly. Yet despite there being a consensus now that Physical Activity (PA) is effective in
      practice, there remain many obstacles to participation and attendance resulting in Physical
      Activity (PA) approaches designed to prevent falls actually only benefiting a limited number
      of elderly subjects. Social marketing has already shown its utility in the construction of
      prevention programs.
