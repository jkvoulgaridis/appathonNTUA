  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study hypothesises that the variability in relief of air hunger with inhaled furosemide
      that is reported in previous studies can be explained by the breathing pattern adopted during
      the inhalation and the droplet size in the aerosol, both of which would influence the site of
      deposition of the aerosol in the lungs

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies suggest that inhaling furosemide as a mist reduces air hunger in healthy
      volunteers in whom air hunger is induced experimentally in the lab. However, how much
      reduction varies among individuals. It is not known if the way the mist is breathed
      (slow/deep or fast/shallow) or the size of the droplets in the mist (large or small) can
      explain the variation in relief. Both of these factors can influence the site of deposition
      of the aerosol in the lungs

      In this study the relief of air hunger (induced by hypercapnia and constrained ventilation)
      will be compared when furosemide is inhaled quickly or slowly, and when the mist has large or
      small droplets. 20 healthy volunteers will be recruited. After a practice session, the 'air
      hunger' test will be performed before and after 4ml of a 10mg/ml solution of furosemide
      (40mg). This will be repeated on 4 separate test days using a different method of inhaling
      the furosemide on each day.

    <intervention_model_description>Furosemide will be inhaled on 4 separate days each with a different pattern of breathing/droplet size combination. The four combinations will be: (i) slow/deep breathing with small droplet size, (ii) slow/deep breathing with large droplet size, (iii) fast/shallow breathing with large droplet size and (iv) fast/shallow breathing with small droplet size.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Visual analogue scale for air hunger</measure>
    <time_frame>Final minute of a 5 minute steady state period per breathing test</time_frame>
    <description>The visual analogue scale (VAS) is from 0 (no air hunger) to 100 (extreme air hunger -tolerable limit). The VAS ratings are taken every 15 seconds during each experimentally induced air hunger test. Each breathing test (hypercapnia with constrained ventilation) is performed before and after each mist inhalation. The final minute of a 5 minute steady state period of hypercapnia and constrained ventilation is analysed during each breathing test (8 breathing tests in total)</description>
