  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies have revealed an association between history of suicide attempt and
      inflammatory markers in both the cerebrospinal fluid and the plasma. Post mortem studies have
      shown an increase in microglial activation in the brain tissue of suicide victims. However
      the relationship between peripheral and central inflammation in suicide is probably mediated
      by complex biological processes that are yet elucidated. An increase of blood S100B levels
      (biomarker of neurovascular damage; PMID 14530574) has been reported in adolescents with
      suicidal ideation vs. controls and independently of psychiatric disorder. The investigators
      hypothesize that peripheral inflammation may alter BBB which normally acts as a filter to
      ensure proper neuronal functioning in suicidal vs. non suicidal patients.

      105 participants will be recruited :

        -  35 depressed patients having attempted suicide for the first time within a week

        -  35 depressed patients without history of suicide attempt (affective controls)

        -  35 healhy controls with no lifetime psychiatric history.

      Only one visit is planned. A clinical assessment (2 hours) will be performed to characterise
      pschopathology and suicidal characteristics. Blood and salivary samples will be obtained in
      order to measure inflammatory markers.
