  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-part study to be conducted at single study center, (additional center(s) may be
      selected if needed) to assess the safety, tolerability, PK and PD parameters for a new SDD
      formulation of CC-11050 in healthy subjects. The effects of a high-fat meal and omeprazole
      will also be assessed. Blood samples will be collected at prespecified times for PK, clinical
      laboratory safety assessments, PD (Part 1 only), and/or exploratory analyses. Safety will be
      monitored throughout the study from the time the ICF is signed through study completion.

    <description>An AE is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may appear or worsen in a subject during the course of a study. It may be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening concomitant illness, an injury, or any concomitant impairment of the subject's health, including laboratory test values (as specified by the criteria in Section 10.3), regardless of etiology. Any worsening (ie, any clinically significant adverse change in the frequency or intensity of a preexisting condition) should be considered an AE.</description>

          5. Female subject

               1. Must have a negative pregnancy test

               2. If postmenopausal: must have follicular stimulating hormone (FSH) test result &gt;40

          6. Contraception Requirements:

             Must comply with the following acceptable forms of contraception. All females of
             childbearing potential (FCBP) must use one of the approved contraceptive2 options
             described below while taking CC-11050 and for at least 28 days after administration of
             the CC-11050 dose. At the time of study entry, and at any time during the study when a
             FCFP's contraceptive measures or ability to become pregnant changes, the Investigator
             will educate the subject regarding contraception options and the correct and
             consistent use of effective contraceptive methods in order to successfully prevent
             pregnancy. A FCBP who engage in activity in which conception is possible must use one
             of the approved contraceptive options described below: Option 1: One highly effective
             method (eg, hormonal contraception [oral, injection, implant, transdermal patch,
             vaginal ring]; intrauterine device; tubal ligation; or partner's vasectomy) and 1
             additional form (latex condom or any nonlatex condom not made of natural [animal]
             membrane [eg, polyurethane], diaphragm, sponge).

             OR Option 2: Male or female condom (latex condom or non-latex condom NOT made out of
             natural [animal] membrane [for example, polyurethane) PLUS one additional barrier

             documented) or agree to use a barrier method of birth control (condoms not made out of
             natural [animal] membrane [latex condoms are recommended]) during sexual contact with
             a pregnant female or female of FCBP while participating in the study, during dose
             interruptions, and for at least 28 days after the dose of IP, even if he has undergone
             a successful vasectomy.

          8. Subject has clinical laboratory safety test results that are within normal limits
             (WNL) or acceptable to the Investigator.

          9. Subject is afebrile (febrile is defined as ≥ 38°C or ≥100.4°F), with supine systolic
             blood pressure ≥ 90 and ≤ 150 mm Hg, supine diastolic blood pressure ≥ 50 and ≤ 90 mm
             Hg, and pulse rate ≥ 40 and ≤ 100 beats per minute at screening

         10. Subject is in good health as determined by past medical history, PE, vital signs,
             12-lead ECG, and clinical laboratory safety tests. Clinical laboratory safety tests
             (ie, hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis) and 12-lead ECGs must be WNL or clinically
             acceptable as judged by the Investigator.

         11. Subject has a normal or clinically acceptable 12-lead ECG at screening. In addition:

               -  If male, the subject has a QTcF value ≤ 450 msec at screening

               -  If female, the subject has a QTcF value ≤ 470 msec at screening

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The presence of any of the following will exclude a subject from enrollment:

          1. Subject has any significant medical condition, laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric
             illness that would prevent the subject from participating in the study.

          2. Subject has any condition including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, which
             places the subject at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study.

             Diagnostic and Statistical Manual) within 2 years before dose administration, or
             positive drug screening test reflecting consumption of illicit drugs unless positive
             drug screen is due to prescription drug use that is approved by the Investigator and
             the Medical Monitor.

         10. Subject has a history of alcohol abuse (as defined by the current version of the
             Diagnostic and Statistical Manual) within 1 year before dose administration, or a

             • Chronic or resolved Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C are acceptable only if sequelae are
             limited to hepatic involvement and its consequent comorbidities. (ie, vasculitis,
             clinically significant globulinemia, etc. are unacceptable).

         13. Subject has received a live vaccination (excluding seasonal flu vaccination) within 30
             days of dosing.

             dose administration, unless Sponsor agreement is obtained.

         16. History of significant multiple and/or severe allergies (e.g., food, drug, latex
