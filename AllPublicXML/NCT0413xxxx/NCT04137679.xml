  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Definitive chemoradiotherapy(CRT) has been regarded as a standard of care for patients with
      unresectable locally advanced esophageal cancer. Patients who are sensitive to CRT can
      achieve significantly down staging. Whether this part of patients could benefit from further
      surgical treatment remains unknown. Herein, a single center prospective randomized phase II
      clinical trial will be carried out to compare efficacy and safety of definitive CRT versus
      neo-CRT plus radical resection in patients who achieved down staging after neo-CRT for stage
      T4NxM0 esophageal Cancer.

      1. Compare progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of definitive
           radiochemotherapy versus(VS) neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy plus radical resection for
           esophageal cancer patients who down stage from inoperable to operable after neoadjuvant
           treatment;

        2. Compare the toxic and side effects of definitive radiochemotherapy versus neoadjuvant
           radiochemotherapy plus radical resection for esophageal cancer patients who achieved
           clinical complete remission after neoadjuvant treatment;

        3. Assess impact of definitive radiochemotherapy versus neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy plus
           radical resection on quality of life of patients.
