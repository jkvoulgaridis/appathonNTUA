  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the study drug HBM4003, and to
      determine the maximum tolerated dose and/or recommended Phase 2 study dose of HBM4003.
      Participants will receive 3 escalating doses of HBM4003, with the possibility of a fourth,
      higher dose level following review by a Safety Committee. The study will also look at the
      anti-tumor activity of HBM4003.
