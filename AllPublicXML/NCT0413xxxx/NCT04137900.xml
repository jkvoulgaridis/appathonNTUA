    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of TAB004 in subjects with
      selected advanced solid malignancies, including lymphoma, and to evaluate the recommended
      Phase 2 dose.

      The secondary objectives are to: 1) describe the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of TAB004, 2)
      evaluate antitumor activity of TAB004; and 3) determine the immunogenicity of TAB004.

      The exploratory objectives are to: 1) evaluate pharmacodynamic effects of TAB004 on its
      target receptor BTLA, as well as effects on the immune system; 2) evaluate biomarkers that
      may correlate with activity of TAB004; 3) evaluate the utility of BTLA ligand,
      herpesvirus-entry mediator (HVEM), and additional exploratory biomarkers that could aid in
      selection of appropriate subjects for TAB004 therapy.

      OVERVIEW: This is a Phase 1, multi-center, open-label, dose-escalation study of TAB004, a
      recombinant humanized IgG4Îº monoclonal antibody specific to BTLA. It is estimated that up to
      144 subjects with selected advanced solid malignancies (i.e.; non-small cell lung cancer
      [NSCLC], melanoma, or other tumors), including lymphoma will be enrolled in the study.

      Subjects must have a histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced unresectable or
      metastatic solid tumor, including lymphoma.

      The study has 2 parts; Part A dose-escalation and Part B cohort expansion. In Part A, up to
      24 subjects will be enrolled who must have received, or be ineligible for, or intolerant of,
      all available approved or standard therapies know to confer clinical benefit including
      immunotherapy, or for whom no standard therapy exists.

      In Part B, subjects must have received at least one line of therapy for advanced or
      metastatic disease, but are not required to have received all standard therapies known to
      confer clinical benefit.

      Part A is the dose-escalation portion of the study. Four dose levels are planned and include:
      0.3, 1, 3 and 10 mg/kg. Part A will be the traditional 3 + 3 design with 3 to 6 subjects per
      dose level (cohort) and will receive their assigned dose every 21 days in the absence of a
      dose limiting toxicity (DLT) that would prevent further dosing.

      Part B will consist of up to 30 subjects in each advanced solid tumor indication (up to 120
      subjects) that may include but not be limited to lymphoma, melanoma, NSCLC, or other tumors
      with agreement of the Sponsor.

      Tumor response will be evaluated using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
      (RECIST v1.1), the immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (irRECIST), or
      the New Response Evaluation Criteria in Lymphoma (RECIL) 2017.

      In the absence of confirmed disease progression and intolerable toxicities, subjects will be
      allowed to continue TAB004 administration every 21 days for up to 2 years.

      DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION TAB004 doses are 0.3, 1, 3, and 10 mg.kg. TAB004 will be
      administered as a 60-minute i.v. infusion for the first dose and may be decreased at the
      investigators discretion to 30 minutes in subsequent infusions.

      SAFETY EVALUATIONS Assessment of safety will be determined by vital sign measurements,
      clinical laboratory tests, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status
      evaluations, diagnostic imaging, physical examinations, electrocardiograms, and the incidence
      and severity of adverse events.

      Safety will also include evaluations of immune safety and immunogenicity. Blockade of BTLA
      pathway by monoclonal antibodies has been demonstrated in several syngeneic mouse models to
      enhance specific T cell responses and inhibit tumor growth. In studies of BTLA deficient
      mice, diseases such as asthma, autoimmune involvement of the central nervous system, and
      systemic lupus erythematosus were exacerbated. Particular attention will be given to symptoms
      related to those diseases as well as the occurrence of adverse events that may follow
      enhanced T-cell activation such as pneumonitis, colitis, nephritis, severe skin reactions,
      endocrinopathies, or other immune-related adverse events (irAEs).

      An irAE is a clinically significant adverse event of any organ that is associated with drug
      exposure, of unknown etiology, and is consistent with an immune-mediated mechanism.

      EFFICACY EVALUATIONS will include best overall response, objective response rate, duration of
      response or duration of stable disease, progression free survival and overall response.

      PHARMACOKINETIC EVALUATIONS Pharmacokinetic parameters include AUC0-inf, AUC0-last, AUC0-21d,
      Cmax, Cmin trough, Tmax, t1/2, CL, and Vss.

      STATISTICAL METHODS The sample size for this study is not determined from power analysis. In
      Part A, it is based on the 3+3 design for dose escalation and safety evaluation requirements.

      All PK/Pharmacodynamic, immunogenicity, and safety data will be summarized and presented by
      cohort as well as overall for the study, using descriptive statistics (number of subjects,
      mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum) for continuous variables and using
      frequencies and percentages for discrete variables.

      ORR and the associated 2-sided 95% exact confidence limits will be calculated. The proportion
      of subjects who have experienced best response as CR, PR, SD, or progressive disease (PD)
      will be provided.
