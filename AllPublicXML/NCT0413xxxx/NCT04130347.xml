    <textblock>
      Retrospective study that aims to examine the presence of acute kidney injury (AKI) during
      major abdominal surgery, non- cardiac surgery. Using clinical and biochemical data in order
      to establish AKI frequency and risk factors.

      Ethical approval was submitted and approved by the regional ethical committee, Etisk
      prövningsnämnd Uppsala, # 2017/418.

      Patients were selected from the time span of april 2016 to september 2017. The investigators
      identified 499 patients that had undergone any of the selected procedures. The procedures
      were, pancreatic resection, HIPEC surgery in colorectal setting, gynecological debulking in
      metastasized ovarian cancer, and liver resection.

      The risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) by the KDIGO definition during the postoperative period
      will be estimated in the group as a whole, and for each type of surgery separately. In
      addition the data will be stratified by sex to investigate systematic gender disparities or
      physiological differences. Length of stay, thirty day and sixty day mortality will secondary
      endpoints.
