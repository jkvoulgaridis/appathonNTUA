      This trial studies patient and physician perspectives on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
      Using questionnaires and interviews, this trial may help researchers understand physicians'
      knowledge about the diagnosis, prognosis, treatment and management of non-alcoholic fatty
      liver disease, as well as gain an in-depth understanding of Hispanic patients' perceptions
      about the disease and investigate how cultural factors may play a role in its diagnosis,
      treatment and management.
