  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, controlled, single blinded study was planned. 20 patients with Acromegaly
      (Acromegaly Group) and 20 healthy subjects (Control Group) were planned to include in the
      study. Connecticut Chemosensory Clinical Research Center (CCCRC) test was applied to evaluate
      olfactory functions. Olfactory bulb(OB) volumes were measured with a 1.5 T General Electric
      Signa Excite MRI scanner.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acromegaly patients were assessed at the Endocrinology Department for their clinical
      symptoms, and the nasal examination and olfactory evaluation were done at the Department of
      Otorhinolaryngology. OB volume was evaluated by a single blinded radiologist. Control group
      patients that had similar demographical characteristics with the Acromegaly Group were
      recruited in the study.

      The CCCRC test is composed of n-butanol odor threshold test and odor identification test.
      Olfactory tests were scored out of 7 (0: worst, 7: best olfaction) and mean score was
      calculated as the total CCCRC test score. OB measurements were done individually on the right
      and left olfactory bulbs and the mean OB volume was calculated in cubic millimeters.
