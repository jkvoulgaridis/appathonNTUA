      OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of pilates exercise by training the muscles responsible
      for core stabilization in patients with chronic non-specific low back pain (CNLPB);
      considering pain, functional level, depression, quality of life, and muscle thickness
      measured by Ultrasound Imaging and to compare it with home based exercise.

      MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective, randomized-single blinded study included 60 female
      patients with CNLBP aged 18-60 years. Patients were randomized into 2 groups. The first group
      (n=30) performed pilates 3 days/week for 8 weeks. Sessions lasted about one hour and
      supervised by a pilates trainer. The second group (n=30) was given home exercise program 3
      times/week for 8 weeks, each session lasting one hour. The evaluations were made both at the
      beginning and end of the treatment. Evaluation parameters included VAS (visual analogue
      scale), Oswestry Disability Index, Qubec Disability Scale, Short Form-36 (SF-36), Beck
      Depression Questionnaire, sit and reach test, Modified Schöber test, sit up test. Multifidus
      and abdominal muscle thickness were measured by Ultrasonographic Imaging.

    <description>Patients were randomized into pilates (group 1) or home exercise group (group 2) 3 times/week for 8 weeks. The evaluations were made at the beginning and end of the treatment. Outcome parameters were VAS, Oswestry Disability Index, Qubec Disability Scale, Short Form-36, Beck Depression Questionnaire, sit and reach, Modified Schöber and sit up tests. Multifidus and abdominal muscle thickness were measured by ultrasound image</description>

    <description>The exercise program included the pelvic tilt in the supine position, hamstring stretch, hip flexors and lumbar extensor stretch, bridge, strengthening the abdominal muscles, cat/camel exercises in the crawl position, leaning on the forearms in the prone position, strengthening the back extensors, and crossed-arms/legs lift exercises. Patients were asked to perform three sets of exercises (10 repetitions) for three times a week for 8 weeks. Exercise training was provided by a physiotherapist. Patients were also provided an illustrated exercise brochure along with an exercise diary to record the number of days on which exercise was performed. They were followed up by phone calls every 2 weeks</description>

    <description>Patients with low back pain were randomized into pilates (group 1) or home exercise group (group 2) 3 times/week for 8 weeks. Pilates mat exercise program comprised three sessions a week for 8 weeks (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday), with each session being scheduled for 1 h (5-min warm-up, 50-min exercise, and 5-min cooling) and each set comprising 10 repetitions. The home exercise program included the pelvic tilt in the supine position, hamstring stretch, hip flexors and lumbar extensor stretch, bridge, strengthening the abdominal muscles, cat/camel exercises in the crawl position, leaning on the forearms in the prone position, strengthening the back extensors, and crossed-arms/legs lift exercises.</description>
