  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Westlake Nutrition and Brain Study (WEBRAIN) is a sub-study of the Guangzhou Nutrition and
      Health Study, a prospective cohort among participants living in Guangzhou city. The aim of
      the WEBRAIN is to investigate the relationship between diet, gut microbiome and brain health
      in the elderly individuals via deep phenotyping the participants including continuous blood
      glucose monitoring for standard test meal, objective physical activity measurement and brain
      magnetic resonance imaging.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The gut-brain axis has been considered a possible cause of neurodegenerative diseases via
      various mechanisms, and diet/nutrition has been linked to both gut and brain health. However,
      majority of related evidence derived from animal models or human study of small scale.

      In the WEBRAIN, we aim to investigate the relationship between diet, gut microbiome and brain
      structure and function in a large human cohort study via deep phenotyping the participants:
      1) objective measurement of physical activity using accelerometers over 2 weeks; 2)
      continuous blood glucose monitoring over 2 weeks, with two standard test meal during the 2
      weeks, and traditional diet assessment with FFQ and 24h recalls; 3) measurement of cognitive
      function and brain images with the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-Revised (ACE-R) and
      brain MRI; and 4) measurement of gut microbiome using metagenome and 16S rRNA sequencing
      techniques.
