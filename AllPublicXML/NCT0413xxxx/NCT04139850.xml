  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to the World Health Organization about 1,400,000 deaths reported annually, are
      related to chronic liver disease. Chronic liver disease is very prevalent in South Korea,
      placing a large economic burden nationwide. Subsequently, an effective and systematized
      approach to managing chronic hepatitis is imperative in Korea.

      The natural history of chronic liver disease differs greatly according to race and ethnicity.
      However, there is scarcity of epidemic data on chronic hepatitis based on Korean patients.
      Therefore, the investigators plan to establish a prospective multicenter cohort for chronic
      hepatitis B based on Korean patients that may be utilized for various future clinical studies
      on chronic hepatitis B in Korea, and thereby serve as a basis for the establishment and
      distribution of clinical guidelines for Korean patients with chronic hepatitis B, as part of
      a nationwide project supported by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), Korea.

      The investigators plan to collect more than 2,000 cases per year with 6 months of regular
      follow-up interval as have been advised by the CDC during 10 years of the study period (from
      Sep. 2015) from 5 tertiary hospitals located in Korea. The investigators plan to register
      available cases from those who are available to agree to give written informed consent and
      provide their blood samples to participate in this study prospectively, according to the
      inclusion and exclusion criteria.

    <description>This study aims for the establishment of chronic hepatitis B cohort and has no other primary end point other than the registration of the patient. (For Time-to-Event outcome measures, the development of events including HCC, ascitic decompensation, variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, transplantation, and death will be followed up to 10 years after enrollment. Time to the development of each kind of event will be calculated from the date of enrollment and the respective date of event development.) Safety issue: No</description>

If there are need of this intervention, another multicenter IRB approval will be taken.</description>
