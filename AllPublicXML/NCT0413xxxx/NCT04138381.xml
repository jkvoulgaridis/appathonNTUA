    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, open label phase I/II clinical trial studying the combination of oral
      imatinib 400 mg, once daily, and oral selinexor given once weekly. The study will consist of
      an initial escalation phase evaluating increasing doses of selinexor in combination with
      fixed doses of imatinib administered in repeated 28-day cycles in advanced/metastatic,
      TKI-refractory GIST patients, followed by an expansion phase testing for safety and
      preliminary evidence of antitumor activity.

      Clinical Study Objectives:

      Primary clinical study objective

      1.- To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase II doses (RP2D) of
      selinexor in combination with imatinib among unresectable and/or metastatic GIST patients
      with prior failure to at least imatinib for advanced/metastatic disease. Secondary clinical
      study objectives

        1. - To evaluate the clinical benefit rate (CBR: CR+PR+ SD ≥ 16 wks).

        2. - To evaluate progression free survival (PFS).

        3. - To evaluate overall survival (OS).

        4. - To evaluate the objective response rate (ORR).

        5. - To evaluate the safety profile according to CTCAE 4.03.

        6. - To compare PFS on selinexor and imatinib with PFS on last prior anti-cancer therapy.

      Translational Study Objective:1.- To explore the relationship between GIST genotype and CBR
      with selinexor and imatinib.

      Pharmacokinetics Study Objective: 1.- To measure the plasma concentration of imatinib and
      selinexor at limited timepoints specificed in schedule of assessment.

    <description>Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined as the highest dose level with ≤1 out of 6 patients experiencing a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) during the first 28 days of treatment. Dose escalation cohort (Phase 1b) seeks to determine the frequency and characteristics of DLTs of the selinexor plus imatinib combination at each dose level during the first cycle of therapy. Phase Ib will be carried out in standard 3+3 format, based on the toxicities found during the first cycle of therapy.</description>
