  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this trial, the investigators will begin to explore the possibility that, as in mice,
      JAK1/2 inhibition with hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) may mitigate
      graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) while retaining engraftment and Graft-versus-Leukemia (GVL).
      Both preclinical and clinical data suggest that inhibition of IFNy and IL-6, directly and
      using downstream JAK Inhibitors, may be an effective strategy to decrease toxicities and
      improve disease control for patients undergoing Allogeneic HSCT. Baricitinib, as a JAK1/2
      inhibitor, has shown superiority to other JAK inhibitors in preclinical GVHD models. The
      purpose of this pilot study is to determine the safety of baricitinib with HSCT measured by
      the effect on engraftment and grade III-IV acute graft-versus-host-disease (aGVHD).

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients must meet the following criteria within 30 days prior to Day 0 unless otherwise
        noted.

          -  Diagnosis of a hematological malignancy listed below:

               -  Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) in complete morphological remission (MRD
                  negative, based on IWG Criteria).

               -  Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) in complete morphological remission (MRD
                  negative, based on IWG Criteria).

               -  Myelodysplastic syndrome with less than 5% blasts in bone marrow.

          -  Available HLA-identical donor who meets the following criteria:

               -  At least 18 years of age.

               -  HLA-identical donor/recipient match by high-resolution typing per institutional
                  standards.

               -  Donor selection will be in compliance with institutional standards

               -  Safety Lead-In Phase: For the first three patients at each dose level, the donor
                  must consent to a second product collection should it prove necessary.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 2

          -  Adequate organ function as defined below:
