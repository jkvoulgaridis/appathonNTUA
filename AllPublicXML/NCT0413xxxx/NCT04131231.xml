  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-label , multicenter randomized controlled trial, with 248 cases
      in 50 centers planned for a period of 2 years. The aim of the study is to evaluate the safety
      and effectiveness of microparticles packaging chemotherapeutic drugs (MPCD) therapy on the
      treatment of malignant pleural effusion (MPE) in patients with advanced lung cancer or breast
      cancer.

      After obtaining informed consent, patients who meet the eligibility criteria will be randomly
      assigned 1:1 to treatment either with MPCD or recombinant human interleukin-2(rhIL-2) for
      injection. Randomization is stratified by tumor type and previous treatment. Patients in the
      MPCD group are first treated with microparticles packaging methotrexate (MPs-MTX) via
      intrapleural infusion four times on day5,6,7,8 and then undergo chemotherapy 1 cycle from
      day12. Patients in the control group are first treated with rhIL-2 via intrapleural infusion
      three times on day5,8,11 and then undergo chemotherapy 1 cycle from day12. After 4 weeks from
      the beginning of the treatment (day1 of treatment), the efficacy is assessed according to the
      WHO (1997) Response Evaluation Criteria In MPE and the evaluation methods mainly include
      physical examination, ultrasound and computed tomography (CT). The patients will be monitored
      by telephone every three months.
