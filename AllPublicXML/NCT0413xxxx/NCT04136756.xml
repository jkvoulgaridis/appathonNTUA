  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients will receive intravenous NKTR-255 in 21-day treatment cycles. During the Part 1 dose
      escalation portion of the trial, NKTR-255 will be given as monotherapy. After determination
      of the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of NKTR-255, NKTR-255 will be evaluated in 3 expansion
      Cohorts in Part 2. Cohort A will enroll Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) patients that have
      relapsed after CAR-T therapy. Cohort B will enroll patients with relapsed/refractory Multiple
      Myeloma (MM). Cohort C will enroll patients with relapsed/refractory indolent Non-Hodgkin
      Lymphoma (iNHL).

      This is a Phase 1 study to evaluate safety and tolerability of NKTR-255 alone and in
      combination with daratumumab or rituximab.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NKTR-255 is a cytokine that is designed to regulate T and natural killer cell activation,
      proliferation and promote their anti-tumor effects.

      This is a Phase 1, open-label, multi-center, dose escalation, dose expansion, safety
      follow-up, and survival follow-up of NKTR-255 as a single agent and NKTR-255 in combination
      with daratumumab or ritixumab. Study treatment is defined as any investigational treatment(s)
      or marketed product(s), intended to be administered to a study patient according to the study
      enrollment.

      Part 1 will enroll relapsed/refractory MM and NHL patients. In Part 2, Cohort A will enroll
      NHL patients who have progressed on a chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) product,
      Cohort B will enroll MM patients who previously received daratumumab and other anti-CD38
      therapies to receive NKTR-255 alone and/or in combination with daratumumab, and Cohort C will
      enroll iNHL patients who previously received rituximab and other therapies to receive
      NKTR-255 alone and/or in combination with rituximab.
