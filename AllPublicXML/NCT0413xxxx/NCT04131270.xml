  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study would investigate the effects of forming action plans on a reduction of sedentary
      behaviors. Participants will be randomly assigned to either active control group (education
      on sedentary behaviors and physical activity) or the intervention group (forming action plans
      referring to replacing sedentary activities with physical activity. The effects of the
      intervention will be evaluated at the 2-month follow-up and at the 8-month follow-up.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The effects of three sessions (3 education sessions versus 3 education sessions+ forming
      plans to replace sedentary behavior with physical activity) will be investigated among
      participants from three age groups: adolescents (12-17 years old), adults (18-60 years old),
      and older adults (&gt;60 years old). Compared to education only, forming plans about how to
      replace time spent on sedentary activities with physical activity is expected to result in a
      significantly larger change (a reduction) of sedentary time at the follow-up. Accelerometers
      will be used to evaluate short-term and mid-term changes in total sedentary time and the
      relative proportion of time spent on sedentary behavior vs light-intensity and
      moderate-to-vigorous- intensity physical activity.

      Additionally, the study will observe changes in if the cognitions included in the Health
      Action Process Approach model (HAPA), such risk perception, self-efficacy, outcome
      expectancies, intention, action control, as well as changes in behavioral habit, presence of
      sedentary behavior cues in physical environment, and physical activity behavior. The
      observations will be conducted three times, at the baseline (before the intervention), the
      2-month follow up, and at the 8-month follow-up.

    <description>3 education sessions + 1 planning session (integrated into the 3rd education session); delivered face-to-face over 3 weeks (after the baseline measurement), individually.
Planning: The planning materials and forms have sections: (a) instructions of what should be included in a good plan (the when, where, and how components), (b) formulating action and coping plans. Action plans (referring to when, when, and how the individual will act) as well as coping plans (referring to how to overcome potential difficulties) will be formed. After forming the plans individually, experimenters will discuss the plans with the participants.</description>
