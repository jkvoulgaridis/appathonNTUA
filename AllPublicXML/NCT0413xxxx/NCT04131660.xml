  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compares a volume targeted pressure support non-invasive ventilation with an
      automatic PEP regulation (AVAPS-AE mode) to a pressure support non-invasive ventilation (S/T
      mode) in patients with acute hypercapnic respiratory failure with acidosis. This study
      focuses on patients at risk of obstructive apneas or obesity-hypoventilation syndrom (BMI≥30
      kg/m²). Half of participants (33 patients) will receive non invasive ventilation with
      AVAPS-AE mode, the other half will receive non-invasive ventilation with S/T mode.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      So far, in respiratory intensive care units, the usual treatment of patients with acute
      hypercapnic respiratory failure with acidosis is non-invasive ventilation set with a pressure
      support mode (S/T or VS/AI mode depending on the ventilator manufacturer).

      AVAPS-AE mode is a volume targeted pressure support mode with an automatic PEP. With the
      forced oscillations method, the ventilator is able to detect the obstruction and the
      resistances of upper airways.

      It allows the ventilator to change its pressure settings to keep the targeted volume and
      avoid apneas and hypoventilation.

      That is why in patients with a BMI &gt; 30 kg/m², at risk of obesity hypoventilation syndrom or
      obstructive apneas, this ventilation mode may be interesting.

      AVAPS-AE has been evaluated in the home ventilation showing it is as efficient as S/T mode in
      controlling PaCO2.

      However it has never been compared to S/T mode in acute respiratory failure care.

AVAPS-AE mode arm : the pratician sets NIV with a positive expiratory pressure set between 4 and 14 cmH2O, an inspiratory support between 14 and 24 cmH2O and a target tidal volume between 8 and 10 mL/kg of an ideal weight (Size (m) * Size (m) * 23).</intervention_model_description>

    <description>NIV will be setup in AVAPS-AE mode, with a Trilogy ventilation device (Respironics, Murrysville, PA). The range of positive expiratory pressure will be set between 4 and 14 cmH2O. The range of inspiratory pressure support will be set between 14 and 24 cmH2. The target tidal volume will be set to achieve 8 to 10 mL/kg of ideal body weight (Size (m) * Size (m) * 23).</description>
