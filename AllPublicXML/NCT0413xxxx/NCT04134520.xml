    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Study is to identify and test different data collection methods to
      determine which approaches improve the ProLung Testing procedure. Once this Study is
      complete, the Sponsor plans to evaluate these improvements in future follow up Validation
      studies that will assess device accuracy using the new measurement collection methods.

    <measure>Establish the ProLung Test measurement collection protocol for future studies.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The study will evaluate several data collection methodologies including the China CFDA Study method which utilizes diaphoretic electrodes as the reference electrode at measurement point locations and other methods using brass reference electrode at point locations. In addition, the benefits of obtaining multiple repeat measurements will be evaluated.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assess the safety and tolerability of the ProLung Test procedures</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events will be recorded and following the ProLung Test, subjects will be asked to complete a brief questionnaire regarding their experience and perception of the procedure. The questions are:
Did the test cause any discomfort? If so, please describe.
Did the time required for measurement seem too long? If so, what amount of time seems reasonable?
Would you undergo measurement again? If so, please describe
Do you have any suggestions for improving the measurement procedure? If so, please describe.</description>
