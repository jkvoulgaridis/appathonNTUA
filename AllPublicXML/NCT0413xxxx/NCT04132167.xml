  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical exercise can prevent falls, certain types of exercise may be more effective.
      Perturbation-based balance training is a novel intervention involving repeated postural
      perturbations aiming to improve control of rapid balance reactions. The purpose of this study
      was to estimate the effect of perturbation- based balance training on falls and balance in
      daily life.Thirty patients with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) will assess with regard to dynamic
      balance, walking and falling. Patients randomly will allocate to a personalized (PRG) or
      traditional (TRG) rehabilitation group.
