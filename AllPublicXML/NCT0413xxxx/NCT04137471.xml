  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Bypassing a reductionist view of existing diagnostic categories, ontological addiction theory
      (OAT) is a new psychological model of human functioning and mental illness. Ontological
      addiction is a maladaptive condition that stems from an erroneous belief in an inherently
      existing Self or &quot;I&quot;, which is deemed to be the root of all suffering. Five experts from four
      different countries have created the Ontological Addiction Scale (OAS) to measure the
      condition and its impact on people's lives. The purpose of this study is to test this scale,
      evaluating levels of ontological addiction in individuals suffering from emotional or mood
      disorder, and assess its psychometric properties.

      Methods:

      This trial will be conducted in compliance with the COSMIN Guidelines. The investigators will
      collect data from 400 individuals, aged 18 to 70, suffering from emotional or mood disorder,
      referred to the Therapeutic Center for Mood and Emotional Disorders for an
      8-week-mindfulness-based-intervention. Patients will complete the OAS at three time points:
      one month before the beginning of the therapy, within one week prior to the beginning of
      therapy, and one year after the end of the therapy. This scale will be completed in
      conjunction with other practice assessments relating to the psychotherapeutic program. The
      psychometric properties of the OAS will be assessed.

      Discussion:

      The Investigators aim to validate a scale assessing a psychological dimension as the root of
      all mental disorders. The present study may contribute to overcoming limitations of
      categorical understanding of mental disorders, thus moving toward a more encompassing
      dimensional comprehension. The scale is responsive to current thinking in modern psychiatry,
      and it is envisaged that its validation will deeply impact research and care perspectives
