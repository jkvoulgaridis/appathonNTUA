  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People who have a severe mental illness can have poorer physical health and higher mortality
      rates than the general population. Their medications combined with low levels of physical
      activity and increased sedentary behaviour can general population and may help people with
      severe mental illness to be more active.

      A previous feasibility study has been conducted in the UK in a large city with positive
      findings. The current study will be conducted in rural settings in Northern Ireland and
      Republic of Ireland. The intervention will last 13 weeks. People with Severe Mental Illness
      will be randomly assigned into one of two groups. Both groups will get information on the
      benefits of physical activity. In addition, one group will be shown how to use a step counter
      to measure their steps, be invited to a weekly group walk, and meet their coach every 2 weeks
      contribute to this. Walking is a good way to increase physical activity in the to see how
      they are getting on and to support them.

      The research team are interested in finding out how willing clinicians are to recruit people
      into the study, how willing people are to take part, do people then stick with the programme,
      and if not the reasons for people dropping out. Qualitative findings will explore whether
      participants feel they benefited from and enjoyed the programme. Findings will be used to
      investigate the feasibility to conduct a larger trial like this in the future.
