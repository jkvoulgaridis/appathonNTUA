  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Electrical spinal stimulation combined with activity-based rehabilitation (ABR) can improve
      motor and autonomic function in individuals suffering from varying degrees of paralysis.
      Spinal stimulation studies have included invasive implanted devices and non-invasive
      transcutaneous systems using different combinations of stimulation current, waveform,
      amplitude, duration and spinal levels targeted. Invasive and non-invasive systems have been
      demonstrated to permit individuals with chronic spinal cord injury (SCI), previously
      considered to have complete injuries on the International Standards for the Neurological
      Classification of Spinal Cord Injuries (ISNCSCI) scale (Classification A), to regain some
      degree of voluntary and autonomic function during periods of stimulation. The aim of this
      study is to evaluate the effects of a novel non-invasive transcutaneous electrical spinal
      cord stimulation system (tSCS) combined with activity-based rehabilitation in patients who
      have paralysis of their legs and/or arms. We will examine participants for any changes in
      sensory, motor or autonomic function. We will use a transcutaneous spinal cord stimulator
      that has been designed to deliver safe and tolerable bursts of high frequency pulsed current
      that minimise the capacitance efforts of the skin surface and maximise conductance of a
      second waveform using low frequency current to target neural structures. We aim to
      investigate this form of neuromodulation with a small group of individuals with chronic
      spinal cord injury. Our goal is to observe and describe any short term or lasting changes in
      function that can safely and comfortably be derived from this combination of spinal
      stimulation and activity-based rehabilitation. If this therapy can cause lasting improvements
      in sensory, motor, respiratory or autonomic function, then this may lead to a greater degree
      of functional independence for these individuals.
