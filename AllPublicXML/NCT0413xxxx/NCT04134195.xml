  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, attention has been drawn to non-invasive brain stimulation techniques, such as
      transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), in order to enhance cognitive functions by
      modifying brain plasticity and use it in different healthy and diseased populations. In the
      current research, investigator aim to examine the short-term effects of multiple tDCS
      protocols in healthy adults population on visual attention and identify the neural
      underpinnings of tDCS-induced behavioral aftereffects using a combined tDCS/ MRI
      network-based approach.

      Investigator will investigate the shor-term effects of active tDCS as compared to a placebo
      stimulation on visual attention in the healthy seniors. A cross-over, randomized,
      placebo-controlled design will be used. Single tDCS sessions will be performed in 4 sessions
      over distinct brain areas with ongoing visual attention training. During the stimulation,
      investigator will use the visual matching task. MRI protocol consisting of T1 and resting
      state fMRI sequences will be acquired before and after every stimulation session in order to
      search for active vs. placebo tDCS-induced changes in brain activation and resting state
      functional connectivity and to identify neural correlates of behavioral changes.
