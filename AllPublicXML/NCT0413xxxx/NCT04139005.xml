  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is no single definition of well-being, but consensus exists that positive functioning
      beyond the absence of detrimental mental health symptoms is central. Building on related
      &quot;eudaimonic&quot; frameworks of psychological flourishing that identify qualities like
      environmental mastery, positive relations with others, and personal growth, this study
      targets brain-based skills that underlie the active cultivation of such qualities (e.g.,
      regulating attention, empathic care, mental flexibility), and thus offers straightforward
      hypotheses about mechanisms of change.

      The Healthy Minds Program (HMP) is designed to promote and protect psychological well-being
      through sustainable skills training. The program is grounded in constituents of psychological
      well-being identified in empirical literature. HMP provides core content, with instruction
      administered through a curriculum of high-quality guided practices. HMP is based on research
      on eudaimonic well-being (e.g., environmental mastery, purpose) and brain-based skills that
      underlie these qualities (e.g., regulation of attention, mental flexibility). HMP practices
      address 4 constituents of well-being: awareness, connection, insight, and purpose. This pilot
      focuses on awareness, connection, and insight.
