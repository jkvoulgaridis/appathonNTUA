      This study will test the effects of an intervention to reduce substance use and related harms
      among people leaving rural jails. This study will compare people in a re-entry health linkage
      intervention with people who will get overdose education in jail. Everyone will take part in
      follow-up surveys after release. Participants will be assigned to one of the two groups by
      chance based on when they are released from jail and when their county is randomly chosen to
      start the project.By doing this study, the investigators hope to learn if providing linkage
      to health services along with HIV, hepatitis C, and overdose education to people leaving
      rural jails will reduce substance use and related harms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overarching objective of this study is to determine the effectiveness of an
      evidence-based community response project using a stepped-wedge community randomized trial.
      Specifically, the investigators will test the effect of an intervention to reduce substance
      use and related harms among people re-entering the community from rural jails. This study
      will compare people in a re-entry health navigation intervention with a comparison group of
      people who will get overdose education in jail. Everyone will take part in follow-up surveys
      for up to 6 months after release. The intervention is a health navigation intervention
      designed to reduce SUD and increase engagement in the SUD care cascade; reduce vulnerability
      to HIV, STIs, and HCV and increase engagement in the HIV, STI, and HCV care cascades; and
      reduce vulnerability to overdose deaths among adults who use drugs and are leaving local
      jails. The intervention is based on enhancements to START, a CDC-recognized, evidence-based,
      individual-level intervention designed to reduce HIV/STI/HCV risk.

      START core components: (1) Hold pre- and post-release program sessions with clients
      transitioning back to the community from a correctional setting; (2) Use a client-focused
      incremental risk reduction approach; (3) Use assessment &amp; documentation tools to provide
      structure; (4) Hire program staff that are familiar with HIV/STIs/HCV prevention and with the
      specific needs of people being released; (5) Staff /client relationships must be maintained
      post-release; (6) Conduct enrollment and schedule two pre-release program sessions within 60
      days of a client's release that: a. give HIV/STI/HCV information; b. review client's
      HIV/STI/HCV risk; c. identify transitional needs; d. develop a personalized risk reduction
      and transitional plan; e. make facilitated referrals; (7) Schedule four post-release sessions
      to review and update the risk reduction/transitional plan(s) and provide facilitated
      referrals; (8) Provide condoms at each post-release session; (9) Actively maintain contact
      with clients.

      The investigators will modify START a priori as follows: 1) Though originally designed for
      young men, START has been successfully applied to women leaving correctional settings. The
      investigators will implement START with all genders; 2) START's post-release sessions
      primarily occurred in homes and community venues, such as restaurants. Staff who will deliver
      START will be stationed primarily within the local department of health (DOH); 3) To enhance
      START's impact on drug use and HIV/HCV-related harms (e.g., IDU frequency),the investigators
      will integrate the NIDA Standard HIV intervention into START, including rapid HIV and HCV
      antibody testing and counseling. The NIDA Standard has been demonstrated to reduce drug use
      frequency, high-risk injection practices, and sexual risk; 4) START was not designed to
      reduce overdoses. The investigators will integrate an interactive training with animated
      scenarios and narration on preventing, recognizing, and responding effectively to an opioid
      OD. Participants in the intervention group will receive naloxone (not all participants will
      get naloxone),either upon release or at their first post-release session. Interventionists
      will encompass OD in risk reduction motivational interviewing.

      CARE2HOPE covers the following counties: Rowan, Bath, Morgan, Menifee, Elliott, Lee, Owsley,
      Wolfe, Perry, Letcher, Leslie, Knott. Research staff will recruit participants at jails
      serving the 12 CARE2HOPE counties; these jails are either located in CARE2HOPE counties or
      counties have contracts with them to incarcerate their residents. The intervention sessions
      and data collection will be delivered by research staff called &quot;Re-entry Health Navigators&quot;
      or &quot;REHNs&quot;. Participants are assigned to one of the two groups by chance based on when they
      are released from jail and when their county is randomly chosen to start the project. In
      August 2019, the investigators randomized each of the 12 study counties to a start date. Four
      counties will be randomized to start the intervention each year. In each wave, four counties
      will be randomized to start 6 months of enrollment into a control condition, followed by 6
      months of enrollment into the intervention condition, with follow-up data collection on both
      extending 6 months beyond enrollment. The investigators anticipate an average enrollment of
      25 participants per county per quarter, with a total final sample size for the trial of 1200
      (n=600 intervention, n=600 control). After a county has met its target enrollment in both
      conditions, the intervention and comparison activities will no longer be offered in that
      county.

    <description>In the re-entry health linkage intervention, research staff will: 1) meet with participants in jail before they are released to ask them questions about drug use and related behaviors, access to needed health and social services, and personal goals; they will provide overdose education and help develop a plan for reducing risks and accessing services after release from jail; 2) meet with participants within one week of their release to conduct urine or saliva drug testing, offer HIV and hepatitis C testing and counseling, naloxon, and harm reduction supplies, and to connect participants with needed services; 3) follow up with participants once a month for three months to help participants overcome challenges; and 4) six months after release from jail, contact participants to conduct saliva or urine drug testing. Participants will complete surveys at pre-release, and at 1 week, 3 months and 6 months weeks post-release.</description>

    <description>The investigators will initiate the comparison group in each county six months before the intervention begins. Research staff will conduct a pre-release overdose intervention with the comparison cohort. The comparison group participants will complete an interactive training with animated scenarios and narration on preventing, recognizing, and responding effectively to an opioid OD, accompanied by information about Kentucky's Good Samaritan Law and Naloxone Access Law. Research staff will answer questions after the video. Individuals will receive a Community Resource Guide at this visit. As in the intervention group, comparison group participants will complete surveys at pre-release, and at 1 week, 3 months and 6 months weeks post-release. Surveys will be identical to those delivered to the intervention cohort</description>

    <ipd_description>Data from the University of Kentucky are required to be submitted to the University of Washington as part of the NIH-funded Rural Opioid Initiative (ROI) data harmonization project. The University of Washington Data Harmonization Coordinating Center will be harmonizing data across 8 ROI studies in order to create new, harmonized datasets to be used for analyses across the consortium. The University of Washington and other ROI grantees will perform data analyses on these data for peer-reviewed publication. The harmonized datasets will be provided to other ROI grantees as required for analysis and will be considered under the umbrella of mandated DCC activities. No third parties outside of the ROI will be given access to this harmonized data. Harmonized datasets will be built to specific project concept proposals, and all project proposals must be reviewed and approved by the ROI consortium's Publications Working Group before distribution of the customized dataset.</ipd_description>
