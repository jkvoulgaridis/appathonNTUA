  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes is a chronic disease that has reached global epidemic proportions due to the
      growing number of patients in all countries; It has become the disease that causes more
      chronic and acute complications to patients, unfortunately, when the diagnosis of type 2
      diabetes is made patients are identified at very advanced stages of the disease.

      For all the above, the best strategies will be those that are aimed at early stages of the
      disease, and the investigators are convinced that the use the combination of drugs with
      additive pathophysiological effect plus cardiovascular protection in early stages, will have
      better results, lasting and with greater results impact on the natural history of the disease
      that throws measures that may have an applicability in clinical practice, in order to
      contribute to the control of this pathology. Therefore, the combination of medications with
      different mechanisms of action, in low doses, could be a useful strategy not only to prevent
      type 2 diabetes, but also to prevent macro and microvascular complications early. The goal of
      this clinical trial is to evaluate the effect of low doses of linagliptin + metformin vs
      metformin alone on physiopathological parameters, such as glucose metabolism, insulin
      resistance, insulin secretion and pancreatic beta cell function in patients with impaired
      fasting glucose plus impaired glucose tolerance, during 12 months.

      The main goal of this clinical trial is to compare the effect of two different treatments
      during 12 months:

        1. Lifestyle modification program + metformin 1700mg every 24 hours.

        2. Lifestyle modification program + linagliptin (2.5mg) and metformin (1700mg) every 24
           hours.

      on the following parameters, after 12 months of treatment:

        1. Glucose metabolism, evaluated by the oral glucose tolerance

        2. Insulin resistance, evaluated by the oral glucose tolerance in 100% of the patients

        3. Insulin secretion, evaluated by the oral glucose tolerance in 100% of the patients

        4. Pancreatic beta cell function, evaluated by the oral glucose tolerance in 100% of the
           patients

        5. Cardiovascular function, evaluated by ejection fraction measurement, diastolic and
           systolic preloads measured by standard echocardiography.

      All the patients will have a basal evaluation with an oral glucose tolerance test, lipid
      profile, body composition. After the basal evaluation, if the patients result with
      prediabetes (FASTING IMPAIRED GLUCOSE/IMPAIRED GLUCOSE TOLERANCE) and have at least 2 risk
      factors, they will be invited to the intervention phase where they will be randomized to one
      of the two treatment groups.

      Patients will have a follow-up visit every month to review the adherence to the lifestyle
      modification program and to the medication. After 6 months, patients will repeat the same
      evaluation performed as the basal evaluation.
