  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adenomyosis is a disease where ectopic endometrial glands affect the muscular wall of the
      uterus. Women that suffer from dysmenorrhea or infertility caused by adenomyosis need to
      confirm or rule out adenomyosis, and therefore tools for non-histologic confirmation of
      adenomyosis are indubitably required. Transvaginal ultrasound has been shown to be useful in
      diagnosing adenomyosis, but the interpretation of findings requires significant expertise in
      ultrasound and experience with diagnosing adenomyosis. This is because adenomyosis shows a
      very heterogeneous appearance in ultrasound. There are many different diagnostic signs that
      have to be considered and weighed.

      In a previous study, the investigators have developed a diagnostic algorithm that helps
      clinicians diagnose adenomyosis with transvaginal ultrasound and a clinical examination. It
      showed good diagnostic accuracy and seemed to be very robust with regards to artifacts and
      experience of the examiner. It is now necessary to validate this prediction model in a new,
      prospective study so it can be used in clinical practice.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Premenopausal (defined by having had menstruation the last six month)

          -  If amenorrhea with levonorgestrel intrauterine device, the woman should be &lt; 45 years
             old

          -  Hysterectomy planned due to a benign condition

          -  Hysterectomy does not require morcellation it is allowed to divide the uterus into 2-3
             pieces, given that the orientation of the specimen is still possible for the
             pathologist)

          -  Written consent is given

          -  Can communicate in Norwegian or English at the Norwegian study sites, and Finnish,
             Swedish or English at the Finnish study site.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Gynecological cancer present at the time of inclusion

          -  Use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist or antagonist within the last 3 months
             prior to the ultrasound evaluation

          -  Prior endometrial ablation or resection

          -  Postmenopausal status or no menstrual bleeding for the last 6 months, or amenorrhea
             with levonorgestrel-intrauterine device and age &gt;45 years.
