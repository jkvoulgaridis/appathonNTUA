  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The number of smartphone users in Taiwan continues to increase exponentially. Smartphone
      addiction tends to not only disrupt the ability of social communication but cause physical
      and psychological problems as well. This study examined the relationship among skin
      conductance, electroencephalography, heart rate variability (HRV), social interaction anxiety
      and smartphone addiction among Line apps users, and we also tried to identify associated
      factors for further interventions.

    <measure>The Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) was developed by Zung (1971) for measuring levels of anxiety. It has been conducted in a number of cross-cultural studies, and translated into different languages with nearly 20 versions. The SAS test is a self-administered questionnaire with 20 items. The total scores of the SAS range from 20 to 80, with higher scores indicating a higher level of anxiety.</description>

    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Chinese version of Smartphone Addiction Inventory (SPAI) was used to examine participant's PSU, and it was designed and developed on the basis of the Chen Internet Addiction Scale (CIAS) with a four-factor structure: compulsive behavior, functional impairment, withdrawal and tolerance [24]. The total scores of SPAI range from 26 to 104, and the higher scores indicate higher levels of smartphone addition.</description>

    <description>Two experimental steps: baseline skin conductance measurements (step 1, three minutes) and measurements of SC after social media stimulation with Line messages or calls (step 2, three minutes). With a 5-minute rest period after these two steps completed, then each participant fill out questionnaires for assessing anxiety and problematic smartphone use.</description>
