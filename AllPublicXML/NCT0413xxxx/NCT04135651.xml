  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, left paratracheal pressure was introduced as an alternative method to prevent
      pulmonary aspiration instead of cricoid pressure. Criocoid pressure is known to worsen
      glottic visibility when using Pentax.However, the effects of left paratracheal pressure on
      glottic view when using Pentax are not studied yet. In this study, the subjects are divided
      into two groups (group I: left paratracheal pressure applied before intubation, group II:
      conventional cricoid pressure applied before intubation). Investigators will assess the
      glottic view during intubation using Pentax.
