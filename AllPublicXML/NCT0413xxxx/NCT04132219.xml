  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this protocol is to conduct a 2-arm, single-blinded randomized controlled
      clinical trial (RCT) in which 56 dyads (defined as consisting of an overweight or obese
      cancer survivor of an obesity-related cancer and an overweight or obese &quot;buddy&quot; of his or her
      choosing) would be assigned either to a 6-month, diet- and exercise-based weight loss
      intervention delivered via an interactive website with tailored text messages, or to a
      6-month wait-listed control group. The overall goals of the eHealth intervention are to
      reduce obesity and select circulating biomarkers (tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNFα],
      insulin, and insulin-like growth factor-1 [IGF-1]), as well as improve diet quality, physical
      activity, health-related quality of life (QoL), physical functioning and performance as
      compared to the control over the 6-month study period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The specific aims of this protocol are to: 1) determine whether dyads (comprised of an
      overweight / obese cancer survivor and an overweight / obese buddy of his or her choosing)
      lose significantly more weight (kg) at 6-months when assigned to the eHealth intervention
      compared to a wait-listed control; 2) explore between-arm differences in score changes
      between baseline and 6-month follow-up for other key outcomes including measures of adiposity
      (e.g., waist circumference [WC] and body mass index [BMI]), blood pressure, diet quality,
      physical activity, health-related Quality of Life (QoL), physical functioning and
      performance; 3) Assess the impact of the intervention on select biomarkers associated with
      cancer risk and progression, e.g., tumor TNFα, insulin and IGF-1; and, 4) identify predictor
      variables associated with program efficacy, e.g., social support, self-efficacy, risk for
      depression, and dyad partner (spouse, relative, friend/neighbor).

      Cancer survivors and their selected &quot;buddies&quot; who are interested in participating will be
      directed to a website that describes this study in detail. If interested, they will be asked
      to complete an online screener requiring information on race/ethnicity, gender, state of
      residence and eligibility criteria. Once interested participants are assessed for
      eligibility, consented and enrolled, they will be asked to complete online questionnaires
      that assess physical activity, dietary intake, health-related quality of life, risk for
      depression, self-efficacy, social support and barriers to diet resources. Finally,
      anthropometric measures, blood pressure, physical performance and circulating biomarkers will
      be collected in participants' homes by visiting study staff (whom the project manager will
      deploy after checking for a mutually convenient time for the 2-person dyad.

They will be directed to specific pages in the Web-based program and asked to select strategies from a list that they will practice during the upcoming week. Graphic displays of their progress will be provided along with SCT-based feedback. They will be directed to the website to record their behavioral goals for the upcoming week. Tips also will be provided for effective communication to enhance couple efficacy. All usage will be tracked to assess adherence.</description>
