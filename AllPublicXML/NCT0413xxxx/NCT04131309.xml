  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase 2 study in subjects with newly diagnosed stage 3B
      light chain (AL) amyloidosis.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current study aims to investigate daratumumab as a monotherapy in patients with stage 3B
      AL amyloidosis who have not received prior therapy. Approximately 40 subjects will receive
      primary therapy with daratumumab. Subject participation will include a Screening Phase, a
      Treatment Phase, a Post-Treatment Observation Phase, and a Long-term Follow-up Phase.

      A safety run-in will be conducted in 6 subjects treated with daratumumab for at least 1 cycle
      to establish safety of daratumumab in patients with stage 3B AL amyloidosis. Dosing of these
      6 subjects will be staggered so that no subject will receive their first dose sooner than 48
      hours after the previously enrolled subject. Safety evaluation will be performed by a Data
      Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) after at least 1 cycle is completed for all 6 subjects. If no
      safety signal is observed, the enrollment of the rest of the patients will begin.

      Subjects will receive daratumumab IV at a dose of 16 mg/kg. All treatment cycles are 4 weeks
      (28 days) in length. Subjects will receive daratumumab until disease progression [according
      to the Major Organ Deterioration Progression-Free Survival (MOD-PFS) criteria], unacceptable
      toxicity, or start of subsequent therapy, for a maximum of 2 years in total.

      Subjects who will not achieve either a hematologic VGPR or better, OR a hematologic PR with a
      major organ response by Cycle 4 Day 1 may receive at Investigator's discretion, in addition
      to daratumumab, bortezomib (1.3 mg/m2 weekly for a maximum of 6 cycles) and low dose
      dexamethasone (total maximum weekly dose of 20mg).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  KEY INCLUSION CRITERIA

               1. Men or women 18 years of age or older.

               2. Diagnosis of amyloidosis, AL type, based on:

                    1. Histopathological diagnosis of amyloidosis based on detection by
                       immunohistochemistry and polarizing light microscopy of green bi-refringent
                       material in Congo Red stained tissue specimens (excluding bone marrow) or
                       characteristic electron microscopy appearance

                       Considerations for specific populations where other types of amyloidosis may
                       be encountered:

                       â€¢ For male subjects over 70 years of age who have cardiac involvement only,
                       and subjects of African descent (black subjects), mass spectrometry,
                       immunoelectron microscopy, or other immunohistochemistry-based typing of AL
                       amyloid in a tissue biopsy or a negative bone scintigraphy with Tc99m-PYP or
                       -DPD is recommended to rule out other types of amyloidosis such as age
                       related amyloidosis and/or hereditary amyloidosis (ATTR mutation) AND

                    2. Measurable disease of amyloid light chain amyloidosis as defined by at least
                       ONE of the following:

                            serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation performed at local
                            lab),

                         -  serum free light chain (FLC) â‰¥2.0 mg/dL (20 mg/L) with an abnormal
                            kappa:lambda ratio or the difference between involved and uninvolved
                            free light chains (dFLC) â‰¥2mg/dL (20 mg/L). Serum free light chains
                            (FLCs) will be measured using the Freelite assay at a central
                            laboratory

                         -  Note: Measurable disease by Urine Bence-Jones Proteinuria is not
                            sufficient for study enrolment.

                       AND

                    3. Cardiac involvement by AL amyloidosis according to consensus guidelines

                       Gilbert Syndrome, in which case direct bilirubin â‰¤ 2 Ã— ULN

                    7. Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) â‰¥20 mL/min; Please note that the
                       eGFR is measured using the CKD-EPI equation

               7. Women of childbearing potential must commit to either abstain continuously from
                  heterosexual sexual intercourse (if this is the preferred and usual lifestyle of
                  the subject) or to use 2 methods of reliable birth control simultaneously. This
                  includes one highly effective form of contraception (tubal ligation, intrauterine
                  device, hormonal [birth control pills, injections, hormonal patches, vaginal
                  rings or implants] or partner's vasectomy) and one additional effective
                  contraceptive method (male latex or synthetic condom, diaphragm, or cervical
                  cap). Contraception must begin prior to dosing and continue for 1 year after
                  discontinuation of cyclophosphamide or 3 months after discontinuation of
                  daratumumab, whichever is longer. Reliable contraception is indicated even where
                  there has been a history of infertility, unless due to hysterectomy or bilateral
                  oophorectomy.

               8. During the study and for 3 months after receiving the last dose of daratumumab,
                  female subjects must agree not to donate eggs (ova, oocytes) for the purposes of
                  assisted reproduction.

               9. A man who is sexually active with a woman of childbearing potential and has not
                  had a vasectomy must agree to use a barrier method of birth control, e.g. either
                  condom with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository or partner with occlusive
                  cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal
                  foam/gel/film/cream/suppository during and up to 3 months after discontinuation
                  of daratumumab. All men must not donate sperm during the study and for 3 months
                  after discontinuation of daratumumab.

              10. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine
                  pregnancy test within 14 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1. For requirements during the
                  Treatment Phase, please see the Time and Events Schedule.

              11. Each subject must sign an informed consent form (ICF) indicating that he or she
                  understands the purpose of the procedures required for the study and are willing
                  to participate in the study. Subjects must be willing and able to adhere to the
                  prohibitions and restrictions specified in this protocol, as referenced in the
                  ICF.

                  serologic findings suggestive of HBV vaccination (antiHBs positivity as the only
                  serologic marker) AND a known history of prior HBV vaccination, do not need to be
                  tested for HBV DNA by PCR.
