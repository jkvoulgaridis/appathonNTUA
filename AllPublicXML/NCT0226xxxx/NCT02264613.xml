      This study evaluates the anti-tumor effects of ALRN-6924 in patients with advanced solid
      tumors or lymphomas with WT TP53.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Open label, multi center, Phase 1 (dose escalation) and Phase 2a (dose expansion) study
      design to evaluate safety, tolerability, PK, PD and anti-tumor effects of ALRN-6924, alone or
      in combination with palbociclib, in patients with advanced solid tumors or lymphomas with
      wild-type (WT) TP53. ALRN-6924 is a stabilized cell-permeating peptide designed to disrupt
      the interaction between the p53 tumor suppressor protein and its predominant endogenous
      inhibitors, murine double minute 2 (MDM2) and murine double minute X (MDMX).

      The Phase 1 portion of the study will enroll adults with histologically or cytologically
      confirmed malignancies that are metastatic or unresectable and for which standard
      treatment(s) are not available or are no longer effective. The Phase 2a portion of the study
      consists of separate cohorts that will enroll distinct groups of patients with specific solid
      tumors and/or lymphomas to further investigate the clinical safety profile and potential
      efficacy of ALRN-6924 alone or in a combination regimen.

      Treatment will continue until unacceptable toxicity, patient or physician decision to
      discontinue therapy or disease progression that is either symptomatic, rapidly progressive,
      requires urgent intervention or is associated with a decline in performance status.

      Patients with PTCL have been selected as a group to be further studied in Phase 2a.

      Patients with MDM2-amplified or MDM2/CDK4-co-amplified solid tumors have been selected as
      another group to be further studied in Phase 2a.
