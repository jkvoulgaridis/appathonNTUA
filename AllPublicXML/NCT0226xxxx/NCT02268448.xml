      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of oral clonidine in subjects
      with symptomatic atopic dermatitis and to assess the safety and efficacy of oral naltrexone
      in subjects with symptomatic atopic dermatitis.

      This study will serve as a pilot study to determine the efficacy and safety of two novel oral
      agents (clonidine, naltrexone) in the treatment of chronic, non-experimentally induced itch
      in atopic dermatitis. In this study, eight subjects with symptomatic atopic dermatitis will
      be recruited and treated with either oral clonidine (four subjects) or oral naltrexone (four
      subjects) . Disease burden will be evaluated before and after 4 weeks of treatment through
      reporting of subjective symptomatology via surveys/questionnaire, neurometer study, and
      clinical assessment.
