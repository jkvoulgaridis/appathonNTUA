      This study will advance computer tailoring by adapting machine learning collective
      intelligence algorithms that have been used outside healthcare by companies like Amazon and
      Google to enhance the personal relevance of the health communication.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Smoking is still the number one preventable cause of cancer death. New approaches are needed
      to engage smokers in the 21st century in smoking cessation. I propose to develop S4S (Smokers
      for Smoker), a next-generation patient-centered computer tailored health communication (CTHC)
      system. Unlike current rule-based CTHCs, S4S will replace rules with complex machine learning
      algorithms, and use the collective experiences of thousands of smokers engaged in a
      web-assisted tobacco intervention to enhance personally-relevant tailoring for new smokers
      entering the system. The investigators will adapt collective intelligence algorithms that
      have been used outside healthcare by companies like Amazon and Google to enhance CTHC. Using
      knowledge from scientific experts, current CTHC collect baseline patient &quot;profiles&quot; and then
      use expert-written, rule-based systems to tailor messages to patient subsets. Such
      theory-based &quot;market segmentation has been effective in helping patients reach lifestyle
      goals. However, there is a natural limit in the ability of a rule-based system to truly
      personalize content, and adapt personalization over time. Current CTHC have reached this
      limit, and the investigators propose to go beyond. The investigators first aim is to develop
      the Web 2.0 &quot;S4S&quot; recommender system. The investigators second aim is to evaluate S4S within
      the context of a NCI funded web-assisted tobacco intervention (Decide2Quit.org).
