    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of TG01 and Granulocyte macrophage
      colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) when given in addition to gemcitabine (chemotherapy) and

        -  Understand any possible side effects of the additional use of TG01/GM-CSF with
           gemcitabine

        -  Investigate whether TG01/GM-CSF when given with gemcitabine can produce an immune
           response

        -  Investigate if the treatment can delay or reduce recurrence of the disease

    <description>TG01 and GM-CSF will be administered on days 1, 8, 15, 22 and 36. TG01 alone will also be given on days 36 and 50 for DTH assessment. Gemcitabine will start at least 3 weeks after TG01/GM-CSF and will be given on days 1, 8 and 15 of a four-weeks cycle up to 6 cycles in total.
Once chemotherapy is completed, GM-CSF and TG01 injections will resume and will be given every 4 weeks from the end of the chemotherapy period up to week 52 (plus once at week 5 post-chemotherapy) and then every 12 weeks from week 52 to week 104. TG01 alone will be given 8 weeks after the end of chemotherapy for DTH assessment.
TG01 will be given at a dose of 0.70 mg/injection and GM-CSF will be given at a dose of 30 micrograms both as intradermal injections.
Gemcitabine will be given at a dose of 1000 mg/m2 iv over 30 minutes</description>
