  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of live music in SICU might affect the perception of noise, which may reduce staff's
      stress level and further decrease the possibility of clinical errors, reduce patient's
      anxiety and perception of pain as well as increase compliance from patient and family. Live
      music might also enhance the quality of stay and promote a holistic healing process for the
      patient.

      In this study, the research team is looking at the effect of the live music provided by a
      trained music therapist, created through incorporating the noises in the SICU - such as the
      beeping of the machines as part of the elements in the music, to organize the sound
      environment as well as introducing familiar songs, chosen according to the cultures and ages
      of the patients, caregivers and staff, to increase a sense of familiarity and comfort.
      Through the intervention, the research team hope to ameliorate the effects of a noxious sound
      environment, which may reduce the stress level of the staff and increase their acuity level
      while decrease patients and caregivers' anxiety level and improve their mood state and the
      quality of hospitalization
