  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research team has developed an automatic blood pressure monitor (Sphygmo) to be used for
      the monitoring and diagnosis of pre-eclampsia in pregnant women, particularly in low-resource
      settings where current monitoring is limited.

      90 adult volunteers will be enrolled by researchers at Rice University. The participant will
      be seated in a comfortable chair with arm at heart level. Arm circumference will be measured
      and a blood pressure cuff will be placed on the arm. The cuff will be inflated and blood
      pressure measurements will be taken by a commercially available device and by the Sphygmo
      device. Blood pressure measurements from both devices will be recorded. The participant's
      blood pressure will be measured up to 9 times with a waiting period of 45-60 seconds between
      each measurement.

      The results of this study will be used to optimize the blood pressure detection algorithm and
      thus further develop the device.

    <description>The British Hypertension society defines a specific criteria for the accuracy of a sphygmomanometer. Devices are graded according to the cumulative percentage of readings that have an absolute difference between the more favorable observer's mercury sphygmomanometer readings and the test device of &lt; 5 mmHg, &lt; 10 mmHg, and &lt; 15 mmHg. A letter grade of &quot;A&quot; requires that over 60%, 85%, and 95% were achieved in the &lt; 5 mmHg, &lt; 10 mmHg, and &lt;15 mmHg categories, respectively. A letter grade of &quot;B&quot; requires that over 50%, 75%, and 90% were achieved in the &lt; 5 mmHg, &lt; 10 mmHg, and &lt;15 mmHg categories, respectively.
