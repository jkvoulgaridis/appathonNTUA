      Treating with measures that may improve metabolic functioning of neurons in an integrated

      Most organ failure results in modest drops in function until over 50% of function is lost. At
      a certain point, even modest drops in physiologic activity result in dramatic drops in
      clinical function. Though less homogeneous than in other organs, clinical experience and the
      literature suggests a similar process occurs in the brain. The hypothesis is that by using an
      integrated protocol to, essentially, &quot;tune up&quot; neuronal function, a 5-10 % improvement in
      metabolic functioning may translate to significant improvement in clinical functioning. This
      tune-up will include &quot;MIND&quot;:

      M- Metabolism-- optimizing hormonal function I- Infections-- looking for and eliminating N-
      Nutritional and herbal support D- Drugs- Weaning subjects off unneeded medications
