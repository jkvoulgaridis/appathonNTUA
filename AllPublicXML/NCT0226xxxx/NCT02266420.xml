  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-randomized and multicenter study designed to compare biological
      features between pN0 triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) with size ≤ 10 mm (pT1a/b) versus
      pT1c T2 ≤ 30 mm.

      All consecutive patients will be recruited by each investigator after completion of surgery.
      No modification of standard management according to each investigator center will be done.
      All patients will then be followed each year during 5 years in order to collect the following
      events: local and loco regional recurrence, metastatasis, second cancer, death or not and the
      cause.

      At initial visit, a 10 mL blood sample will be collected (= study intervention) and
      immediately processed for serum storage; all serum samples will be stored at -80°C and may be
      used for the purpose of further scientific research.

      A representative formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor block of all 200 samples will be
      addressed at the Institut Claudius Regaud for central collection which will consist of one
      haematoxylin-eosin stained slide for central histological review, up to 15 unstained slides
      for DNA extraction (after microdissection), and construction of a tissue micro-array (TMA).

      Extracted DNA from 100 samples (50 in each group) will then be transferred to Institut Paoli
      Calmettes, Marseille; extracted DNA will be subjected to array-CGH analysis in order to
      detect gene copy number alterations such as gains/amplifications/deletions, and to next
      generation sequencing (NGS; MiSeq, Illumina) using a panel of ~400 genes for mutation
      detection.
