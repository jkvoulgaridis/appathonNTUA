      <recruitment_details>The study was conducted at five sites in United States, Canada, and the Netherlands between 04 Feb 2015 and 23 Jul 2018. A total of 12 participants were screened in the study. Out of 12 participants, 9 participants received the study treatment.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>This study consisted of 2 screening periods: 1st for main study and 2nd for open label extension (OLE) period. Participants on stable background medical lipid-modifying therapy for at least 4 weeks prior to screening, or who didn't undergo lipid apheresis within 4 weeks prior to screening visit, were directly entered into a 2-week screening period.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Participants received single dose of REGN1500 subcutaneous (SC) injection of 250 milligrams (mg) at Week 0 (Day 1), followed by single dose of REGN1500 intravenous (IV) injection of 15 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) at Week 2 (Day 15) and then followed by 4 doses of REGN1500 SC injection of 450 mg once weekly starting from Week 12 (Day 85). Only the first 2 enrolled participants received 4 weekly REGN1500 450 mg SC doses at weeks 12, 13, 14, and 15 per the protocol. This dose regimen was removed under protocol amendment 4. Participants were followed for a period of 24 weeks (through Week 26 [Day 183]) after the last dose of study drug in the main study period.</description>

        <description>Percent change was reported in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) from baseline (week 0) up to week 26. LDL-C was measured using conventional units mg/dL. The efficacy analysis set included all participants in the SAF who had baseline and at least 1 post-baseline measure of the lipid panel in the main study period.</description>

            <description>Participants received single dose of REGN1500 subcutaneous (SC) injection of 250 milligrams (mg) at Week 0 (Day 1), followed by single dose of REGN1500 intravenous (IV) injection of 15 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) at Week 2 (Day 15) and then followed by 4 doses of REGN1500 SC injection of 450 mg once weekly starting from Week 12 (Day 85). Only the first 2 enrolled participants received 4 weekly REGN1500 450 mg SC doses at weeks 12, 13, 14, and 15 per the protocol. This dose regimen was removed under protocol amendment 4. Participants were followed for a period of 24 weeks (through Week 26 [Day 183]) after the last dose of study drug in the main study period.</description>

          <description>Percent change was reported in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) from baseline (week 0) up to week 26. LDL-C was measured using conventional units mg/dL. The efficacy analysis set included all participants in the SAF who had baseline and at least 1 post-baseline measure of the lipid panel in the main study period.</description>
          <population>&quot;n&quot; = Number of participants who were evaluable for this endpoint at a given time point.</population>

        <description>Absolute change was reported for Apo B, Non-HDL-C, Total-C, and Lp(a) from baseline (week 0) up to Week 26.

            <description>Participants received single dose of REGN1500 subcutaneous (SC) injection of 250 milligrams (mg) at Week 0 (Day 1), followed by single dose of REGN1500 intravenous (IV) injection of 15 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) at Week 2 (Day 15) and then followed by 4 doses of REGN1500 SC injection of 450 mg once weekly starting from Week 12 (Day 85). Only the first 2 enrolled participants received 4 weekly REGN1500 450 mg SC doses at weeks 12, 13, 14, and 15 per the protocol. This dose regimen was removed under protocol amendment 4. Participants were followed for a period of 24 weeks (through Week 26 [Day 183]) after the last dose of study drug in the main study period.</description>

        <description>Percent change was reported for Apo B, Non-HDL-C, Total-C, and Lp(a) from baseline (week 0) up to week 26. Apo B, Non-HDL-C, Total-C, and Lp(a) were measured using conventional units mg/dL. The efficacy analysis set included all participants in the SAF who had baseline and at least 1 post-baseline measure of the lipid panel in the main study period.</description>

            <description>Participants received single dose of REGN1500 subcutaneous (SC) injection of 250 milligrams (mg) at Week 0 (Day 1), followed by single dose of REGN1500 intravenous (IV) injection of 15 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) at Week 2 (Day 15) and then followed by 4 doses of REGN1500 SC injection of 450 mg once weekly starting from Week 12 (Day 85). Only the first 2 enrolled participants received 4 weekly REGN1500 450 mg SC doses at weeks 12, 13, 14, and 15 per the protocol. This dose regimen was removed under protocol amendment 4. Participants were followed for a period of 24 weeks (through Week 26 [Day 183]) after the last dose of study drug in the main study period.</description>

        <description>Percent change was reported in HDL-C, TG, and Apo A-1 from baseline (week 0) up to week 26. HDL-C, TG, and Apo A-1 were measured using conventional units mg/dL. The efficacy analysis set included all participants in the SAF who had baseline and at least 1 post-baseline measure of the lipid panel in the main study period.</description>

            <description>Participants received single dose of REGN1500 subcutaneous (SC) injection of 250 milligrams (mg) at Week 0 (Day 1), followed by single dose of REGN1500 intravenous (IV) injection of 15 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) at Week 2 (Day 15) and then followed by 4 doses of REGN1500 SC injection of 450 mg once weekly starting from Week 12 (Day 85). Only the first 2 enrolled participants received 4 weekly REGN1500 450 mg SC doses at weeks 12, 13, 14, and 15 per the protocol. This dose regimen was removed under protocol amendment 4. Participants were followed for a period of 24 weeks (through Week 26 [Day 183]) after the last dose of study drug in the main study period.</description>

        <description>Percent change was reported in HDL-C, TG and Apo A-1 from baseline (week 26) up to week 214. HDL-C, TG and Apo A-1 were measured using conventional units mg/dL. The efficacy analysis set included all participants in the SAF who had baseline and at least one post-baseline measure of the lipid panel in the main study period.

      <desc>During the main study period, the safety analysis set (SAF) was defined as all enrolled participants who received at least 1 dose or part of a dose.
