  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a modular, phase I/ phase 1 b, open-label, multicentre study of ceralasertib
      administered orally in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens and/or novel
      anti-cancer agents, to patients with advanced malignancies. The study design allows an
      investigation of optimal combination dose of ceralasertib with other anti-cancer treatments,
      with intensive safety monitoring to ensure the safety of the patients. The initial
      combination to be investigated is ceralasertib with carboplatin. The second combination to be
      investigated is ceralasertib with Olaparib. The third combination to be investigated is
      ceralasertib with durvalumab.

    <textblock>
      This is a modular, phase I, two part, open-label, multicentre study of ceralasertib,
      administered orally, in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens and/or novel
      anti-cancer agents, to patients with advanced/metastatic solid malignancies. The study design
      allows an escalation of the dose of ceralasertib in combination with the standard dose and
      schedule of either cytotoxic chemotherapies and/or novel anti-cancer agents, with intensive
      safety monitoring to ensure the safety of the patients. There are two parts to each
      combination module of this study; part A, dose escalation and an optional part B, cohort
      expansions in particular patient groups. The initial combination module will be with
      Carboplatin (module 1). The second combination will be with Olaparib (module 2). The third
      combination will be with durvalumab (module 3). The option to start further combination
      modules will be the decision of the Safety Review Committee (SRC), based on emerging
      preclinical data and, safety and tolerability information from the initial combination.
      Combinations of ceralasertib with novel anti-cancer agents may also be explored. Once a
      minimally biologically active dose of ceralasertib, for that combination module, has been
      identified from part A of that module, the SRC may decide to commence part B if deemed to be
      necessary. This may include cohort expansions of specific patient groups to explore
      preliminary anti-tumour activity or the effect of food or particular drug combinations on
      drug pharmacokinetics.
