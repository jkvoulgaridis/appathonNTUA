  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of the anti-Ebola vaccine vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) ZEBOV (Zaire
      ebolavirus) also known as V920 and BPSC-1001. The purpose of this study is to test how safe
      the vaccine is in humans and how well it makes the human immune system cause an immune- or
      defense-response to Ebola virus. This vaccine will be studied at different doses.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to assess whether this vaccine is safe, and if it causes the
      body to create an infection-fighting response. Between 1994 and the present, there have been
      many Ebola virus outbreaks caused by 4 different strains of the virus, affecting mostly
      people living in central Africa and the health care providers trying to treat them. Ebola
      viruses are members of the filoviridae virus family, which also includes the dangerous
      Marburg virus. Ebola virus causes severe and often deadly infection called a viral
      hemorrhagic fever, characterized by organ failure, bleeding, and death.

      To date, the virus is found primarily in Central and West Africa. It is not clear where these
      viruses come from, but it is thought that bats are the most likely source of the human
      outbreaks that occur. Once an outbreak occurs, the virus is spread from person to person
      through direct contact with infected blood or body fluids with an infected individual.

      Given the recent increase in Ebola virus infections occurring in Africa, there is interest in
      making an effective vaccine to protect against the infection. V920/BPSC-1001 is an
      experimental Ebola vaccine candidate demonstrating protection against Ebola virus in animal
      experiments.

      This is a Phase 1 study to evaluate a novel vaccine to Ebola using a live VSV replacing the
      gene encoding the G envelope glycoprotein with the gene encoding the envelope glycoprotein
      from the Zaire strain of Ebola (VSVΔG-ZEBOV also known as V920 and BPSC-1001). This phase 1
      protocol provides a first-in-human study to evaluate the safety and toxicity of
      V920/BPSC-1001 in healthy adult participants. Participants will be randomized to receive
      V920/BPSC-1001 or Placebo by intramuscular injection. Three dose levels will be assessed with
      follow-up visits through 180 days after the injection.

    <description>The Geometric Mean Titers (GMT) of ZEBOV-specific Immunoglobulin G antibodies were measured by unqualified ZEBOV immunoglobulin (IgG) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). For titers expressed in ELISA Units/mL, the lower level of quantitation (LLOQ) was 58.84. ZEBOV IgG titers at baseline (Day 0) and analysis Days 7, 14, 28, 56, 84, and 180 were summarized by V920 vaccine dose level and placebo as the mean of log10 titers, transformed into GMT. The geometric standard deviation (GSD) for the GMT at each visit was obtained by exponentiating the standard deviation for the mean of log (base 10) transformed titers.</description>

    <description>The Geometric Mean Titers (GMT) of ZEBOV-specific neutralizing antibodies were measured by pseudovirion neutralization assays (PsVNA). Titers were reported for PsVNA50 values which were derived from the reciprocal of the dilution that resulted in a 50% decrease in luciferase activity. The LLOQ for the PsVNA was 20. If the PsVNA was reported ≤20, the numeric portion of the titer was divided by 2 for statistical purposes, which could result in a reported GMT &lt;20.0. PsVNA50 titers at baseline (Day 0) and analysis Days 7, 14, 28, 56, and 180 were summarized by V920 vaccine dose level and placebo as the mean of log10 titers, transformed into GMT. The geometric standard deviation (GSD) for the GMT at each visit was obtained by exponentiating the standard deviation for the mean of log (base 10) transformed titers.</description>

    <measure>Mean Copy Number of Vector RNA (Vector Viremia)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 14 days postvaccination</time_frame>
    <description>Although the protocol specified a secondary endpoint that included the mean copy number of vector RNA (vector viremia), the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test used for the study reported a qualitative rather than a quantitative outcome, so the proportion of participants with viremia is reported instead of the mean copy number of vector RNA. Qualitative results are therefore reported in Outcome Measures 12 and 13.</description>

        <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with study vaccine. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an AE that starts or worsens on or after the date and time of the study vaccination. Local reactogenicity signs and symptoms include pain, erythema (redness), and induration (swelling). The number of participants that experienced at least one solicited local TEAE was assessed. Solicited TEAEs occurred from the time of each injection through 14 days following the procedure, facilitated with the use of a memory aid to record participant observations.</description>

A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an AE that starts or worsens on or after the date and time of the study vaccination. Local reactogenicity signs and symptoms include pain, erythema (redness), and induration (swelling). The number of participants that experienced at least one solicited local TEAE was assessed. Solicited TEAEs occurred from the time of each injection through 14 days following the procedure, facilitated with the use of a memory aid to record participant observations.</description>

        <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with study vaccine. A TEAE is defined as an AE that starts or worsens on or after the date and time of the study vaccination. Local reactogenicity signs and symptoms include pain, erythema (redness), and induration (swelling). AEs were assessed for severity by the investigator according to a toxicity grading scale based on the FDA's Guidance for Industry &quot;Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials&quot;: Grade 1=Mild; Grade 2=Moderate; Grade 3=Severe; Grade 4=Potentially life-threatening. The number of participants that experienced at least one solicited local TEAE was summarized by grade.

        <description>The Geometric Mean Titers (GMT) of ZEBOV-specific Immunoglobulin G antibodies were measured by unqualified ZEBOV immunoglobulin (IgG) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). For titers expressed in ELISA Units/mL, the lower level of quantitation (LLOQ) was 58.84. ZEBOV IgG titers at baseline (Day 0) and analysis Days 7, 14, 28, 56, 84, and 180 were summarized by V920 vaccine dose level and placebo as the mean of log10 titers, transformed into GMT. The geometric standard deviation (GSD) for the GMT at each visit was obtained by exponentiating the standard deviation for the mean of log (base 10) transformed titers.</description>

          <title>Geometric Mean Titers of ZEBOV Envelope Glycoprotein-specific Binding Antibodies</title>
          <description>The Geometric Mean Titers (GMT) of ZEBOV-specific Immunoglobulin G antibodies were measured by unqualified ZEBOV immunoglobulin (IgG) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). For titers expressed in ELISA Units/mL, the lower level of quantitation (LLOQ) was 58.84. ZEBOV IgG titers at baseline (Day 0) and analysis Days 7, 14, 28, 56, 84, and 180 were summarized by V920 vaccine dose level and placebo as the mean of log10 titers, transformed into GMT. The geometric standard deviation (GSD) for the GMT at each visit was obtained by exponentiating the standard deviation for the mean of log (base 10) transformed titers.</description>
          <population>All randomized participants who were vaccinated and had an evaluable Day 28 immunogenicity result following vaccination and who did not have any protocol deviations that influenced interpretation of immunogenicity endpoints for the specified measurement and timeframe.</population>

Titers were reported for PsVNA50 values which were derived from the reciprocal of the dilution that resulted in a 50% decrease in luciferase activity. The LLOQ for the PsVNA was 20. If the PsVNA was reported ≤20, the numeric portion of the titer was divided by 2 for statistical purposes, which could result in a reported GMT &lt;20.0. PsVNA50 titers at baseline (Day 0) and analysis Days 7, 14, 28, 56, and 180 were summarized by V920 vaccine dose level and placebo as the mean of log10 titers, transformed into GMT. The geometric standard deviation (GSD) for the GMT at each visit was obtained by exponentiating the standard deviation for the mean of log (base 10) transformed titers.</description>
