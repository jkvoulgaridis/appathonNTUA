TFC globally assesses occupation, finances, domestic chores, activities of daily living, and level of care, with scores on each item ranging from 0 to either 2 or 3 (e.g., Occupation: 0 = unable, 1 = marginal work only, 2 = reduced capacity for usual job, 3 = normal). The five items are summed to yield a TFC total score, which ranges from 0 (normal function) to 13 (severe dysfunction). Higher scores indicated better functioning.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 171</time_frame>
    <description>Components of UHDRS assess motor function,cognition,behaviour,functional abilities,independence scale, total functional capacities. Cognitive assessment component:verbal fluency(VF) score (memory,attention)(requiring participant to generate as many words as possible beginning with a specific letter[F,A,S]in 60 seconds [sec]. Score[no range]:total number of correct words for 3 letters), symbol digit modalities test(SDMT) score(psychomotor speed,attention)(participant is required to pair digits to assigned symbols using a reference key. Score[0 {worst}-120 {best}]:total number of correct written responses in 90 sec), &amp; Stroop interference(SI) score (selective attention,executive function)(includes 3 conditions:naming colour blocks[blue, red or green]; reading colour words printed in black ink; naming ink colour of incongruous colour words. For each condition score(no range)is number of correct responses produced in 45 sec). In these tests, higher scores reflect better cognitive ability.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in UHDRS Motor Assessment: Total Maximal Chorea (TMC) Score at Week 171</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 171</time_frame>
    <description>UHDRS is a research tool developed by HD Study Group to provide a uniform assessment of the clinical features and course of HD. Components of the full UHDRS assess motor function, cognition, behaviour, functional abilities, independence scale and total functional capacities. Motor function assessment includes total motor score (TMS) and TMC score. TMC score is determined from Item 12 (maximal chorea) of UHDRS TMS and quantifies chorea based on assessments of the face, bucco-oral-lingual area, trunk, and the 4 extremities. TMC score is a sum of chorea scores in the 7 body regions, ranging from 0 (absent chorea) to 28 (marked/prolonged chorea). Lower TMC scores indicated less chorea.</description>

Data was measured and available for total safety population. Data was not available by individual cohorts (rollover cohort and switch cohort) from Week 8 to Week 171, as was done for change from baseline. Therefore, in order to present results data for this outcome measure, the total, combined safety population treatment arm was used.</description>

    <description>UHDRS is a research tool developed by HD Study Group to provide a uniform assessment of the clinical features and course of HD. Components of the full UHDRS assess motor function, cognition, behaviour, functional abilities, independence scale and total functional capacities. Motor function assessment includes TMS and TMC score. The UHDRS TMS assesses all the motor features of HD and includes maximal chorea, maximal dystonia, ocular pursuit, saccade initiation and velocity, dysarthria, tongue protrusion, finger tapping, hand pronation and supination, luria, rigidity, bradykinesia, gait, tandem walking, and retropulsion pull test. Each of these was rated on a scale of 0 (normal motor function) to 4 (severely impaired motor function). TMS score is a sum of individual scores ranging from 0 (normal motor function) to 124 (severely impaired motor function). Lower TMS scores indicate better motor function.</description>

    <description>Participants who completed study SD-809-C-15 (NCT01795859, including 1-week washout period and Week 13 evaluation), will receive 6 milligrams (mg) SD-809 ER tablet once daily as a starting dose in this study. Dose titration will be continued through Week 8 to optimize dose. Dose of SD-809 ER can be adjusted weekly in increments of 6 milligrams per day (mg/day) (6 or 12 mg/day after a total daily dose of 48 mg is reached) based on chorea control and adverse events. Daily doses of SD-809 ER 12 mg and higher will be administered twice daily. Maximum total daily dose of SD-809 ER will be 72 mg/day (36 mg twice daily), unless participant is receiving a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor(such as, paroxetine, buproprion, fluoxetine), in which case maximum total daily dose will be 42 mg (21 mg twice daily). Long-term treatment with SD-809 ER at a stable dose (further dose adjustments are permitted, if clinically indicated) will be continued until SD-809 ER become commercially available in United States.</description>

    <description>Participants who were receiving an approved dosing regimen of tetrabenazine for at least 8 weeks prior to screening, will be converted overnight from their existing tetrabenazine regimen to SD-809 ER regimen to achieve targeted steady-state area under the curve (AUC) of total (alpha+beta)- Dihydrotetrabenazine (HTBZ) metabolites that is predicted to be comparable to that of participant's prior tetrabenazine regimen. Participants will remain on initial dose of SD-809 ER through Week 1. Dose adjustment will be continued through Week 4 to optimize the dose. Dose of SD-809 ER can be adjusted weekly (upward or downward) in increments of 6 mg per day (6 mg/day or 12 mg/day after a total daily dose of 48 mg is reached), based on chorea control and treatment regimen tolerability. Long-term treatment with SD-809 ER at a stable dose (although further dose adjustments are permitted, if clinically indicated) will be continued until SD-809 ER become commercially available in United States.</description>

          <title>Rollover Cohort: SD-809 ER</title>
          <description>Participants who completed study SD-809-C-15 (either placebo or SD-809 group [NCT01795859], including 1-week washout period and Week 13 evaluation), received 6 milligrams(mg) SD-809 ER tablet once daily as starting dose in this study. Dose titration was continued through Week 8 to optimize dose. SD-809 ER dose could be adjusted weekly in increments of 6 milligrams per day(mg/day) (6 or 12 mg/day after total daily dose of 48 mg reached) based on chorea control and adverse events. Daily doses of SD-809 ER 12 mg and higher were administered twice daily. Maximum total daily dose of SD-809 ER was 72 mg/day(36 mg twice daily), unless participant was receiving a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor(e.g., paroxetine,buproprion, fluoxetine), in which case maximum total daily dose was 42 mg (21 mg twice daily). Long-term treatment with SD-809 ER at stable dose (although further dose adjustments were permitted, if clinically indicated) continued until SD-809 ER became commercially available in United States.</description>

          <title>Switch Cohort: SD-809 ER</title>
          <description>Participants who were receiving Food and Drug Administration (FDA) - approved dosing regimen of tetrabenazine for at least 8 weeks prior to screening, were converted overnight from their existing tetrabenazine regimen to SD-809 ER regimen to achieve targeted steady-state area under the curve(AUC) of total (alpha+beta)-Dihydrotetrabenazine(HTBZ) metabolites that was predicted to be comparable to that of participant’s prior tetrabenazine regimen. Participants remained on initial dose of SD-809 ER through Week 1. Dose adjustment was continued through Week 4 to optimize the dose. SD-809 ER dose could be adjusted weekly (upward or downward) in increments of 6 mg per day (6 mg/day or 12 mg/day after total daily dose of 48 mg reached), based on chorea control and treatment regimen tolerability. Long-term treatment with SD-809 ER at stable dose (although further dose adjustments were permitted, if clinically indicated) continued until SD-809 ER became commercially available in United States.</description>

        <description>An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. Severe AE=inability to carry out usual activities. Drug-related TEAEs: TEAEs with possible, probable, definite, or missing relationship to study drug. Serious AEs: death, a life-threatening AE, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or an important medical event that jeopardized participant and required medical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed in this definition. TEAEs: events that 1) began after treatment with study drug in current study and that were not present at baseline or 2) if present at baseline, had worsened in severity. Any TEAEs included both serious and non-serious TEAEs. A summary of other non-serious AEs and all serious AEs, regardless of causality is located in Reported AE section.</description>

            <description>Participants who completed study SD-809-C-15 (either placebo group or SD-809 group, including 1-week washout period and Week 13 evaluation), received 6 mg SD-809 ER tablet once daily as a starting dose in this study. Dose titration was continued through Week 8 to optimize the dose. Dose of SD-809 ER could be adjusted weekly in increments of 6 mg/day (6 or 12 mg/day after a total daily dose of 48 mg was reached) based on chorea control and adverse events. Daily doses of SD-809 ER 12 mg and higher were administered twice daily. Maximum total daily dose of SD-809 ER was 72 mg/day (36 mg twice daily), unless the participant was receiving a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., paroxetine, buproprion, and fluoxetine), in which case the maximum total daily dose was 42 mg (21 mg twice daily). Long-term treatment with SD-809 ER at a stable dose (although further dose adjustments were permitted, if clinically indicated) continued until SD-809 ER became commercially available in United States.</description>

Participants remained on initial dose of SD-809 ER through Week 1. Dose adjustment was continued through Week 4 to optimize the dose. Dose of SD-809 ER could be adjusted weekly (upward or downward) in increments of 6 mg per day (6 mg/day or 12 mg/day after a total daily dose of 48 mg was reached), based on chorea control and treatment regimen tolerability.

        <title>Number of Participants With TEAEs, Serious TEAEs, Severe TEAEs, Drug-Related TEAEs, and TEAEs Leading to Withdrawal During Long Term Stable Dose Treatment</title>
        <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. Severe AEs=inability to carry out usual activities. Drug-related TEAEs: TEAEs with a possible, probable, definite, or missing relationship to study drug. Serious AEs: death, a life-threatening AE, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or an important medical event that jeopardized the participant and required medical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed in this definition. TEAEs: events that 1) began after treatment with study drug in current study and that were not present at baseline or 2) if present at baseline, had worsened in severity. Any TEAEs included both serious and non-serious TEAEs. A summary of other non-serious AEs and all serious AEs, regardless of causality is located in Reported AE section.</description>

            <title>Rollover Cohort: SD-809 ER</title>
            <description>Participants who completed study SD-809-C-15 (either placebo group or SD-809 group, including 1-week washout period and Week 13 evaluation), received 6 mg SD-809 ER tablet once daily as a starting dose in this study. Dose titration was continued through Week 8 to optimize the dose. Dose of SD-809 ER could be adjusted weekly in increments of 6 mg/day (6 or 12 mg/day after a total daily dose of 48 mg was reached) based on chorea control and adverse events. Daily doses of SD-809 ER 12 mg and higher were administered twice daily. Maximum total daily dose of SD-809 ER was 72 mg/day (36 mg twice daily), unless the participant was receiving a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., paroxetine, buproprion, and fluoxetine), in which case the maximum total daily dose was 42 mg (21 mg twice daily). Long-term treatment with SD-809 ER at a stable dose (although further dose adjustments were permitted, if clinically indicated) continued until SD-809 ER became commercially available in United States.</description>

            <title>Switch Cohort: SD-809 ER</title>
            <description>Participants who were receiving FDA-approved dosing regimen of tetrabenazine for at least 8 weeks prior to screening, were converted overnight from their existing tetrabenazine regimen to SD-809 ER regimen to achieve targeted steady-state AUC of total (alpha+beta)-HTBZ metabolites that was predicted to be comparable to that of participant’s prior tetrabenazine regimen. Participants remained on initial dose of SD-809 ER through Week 1. Dose adjustment was continued through Week 4 to optimize the dose. Dose of SD-809 ER could be adjusted weekly (upward or downward) in increments of 6 mg per day (6 mg/day or 12 mg/day after a total daily dose of 48 mg was reached), based on chorea control and treatment regimen tolerability. Long-term treatment with SD-809 ER at a stable dose (although further dose adjustments were permitted, if clinically indicated) continued until SD-809 ER became commercially available in United States.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Clinical Laboratory Hematology Parameter (Erythrocytes Mean Corpuscular Volume) at Week 158</title>
        <description>Clinical laboratory hematology parameters included basophils, eosinophils, leukocytes, lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, platelets, erythrocytes mean corpuscular volume, erythrocytes, hematocrit, and hemoglobin. Change from baseline in erythrocytes mean corpuscular volume at baseline and Week 158 is reported in this outcome measure. Observed value at baseline and observed value at Week 158 were used to calculate the change from baseline value at Week 158.</description>

            <description>Participants who completed study SD-809-C-15 (either placebo group or SD-809 group, including 1-week washout period and Week 13 evaluation), received 6 mg SD-809 ER tablet once daily as a starting dose in this study. Dose titration was continued through Week 8 to optimize the dose. Dose of SD-809 ER could be adjusted weekly in increments of 6 mg/day (6 or 12 mg/day after a total daily dose of 48 mg was reached) based on chorea control and adverse events. Daily doses of SD-809 ER 12 mg and higher were administered twice daily. Maximum total daily dose of SD-809 ER was 72 mg/day (36 mg twice daily), unless the participant was receiving a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., paroxetine, buproprion, and fluoxetine), in which case the maximum total daily dose was 42 mg (21 mg twice daily). Long-term treatment with SD-809 ER at a stable dose (although further dose adjustments were permitted, if clinically indicated) continued until SD-809 ER became commercially available in United States.</description>

            <description>Participants who were receiving FDA-approved dosing regimen of tetrabenazine for at least 8 weeks prior to screening, were converted overnight from their existing tetrabenazine regimen to SD-809 ER regimen to achieve targeted steady-state AUC of total (alpha+beta)-HTBZ metabolites that was predicted to be comparable to that of participant’s prior tetrabenazine regimen. Participants remained on initial dose of SD-809 ER through Week 1. Dose adjustment was continued through Week 4 to optimize the dose. Dose of SD-809 ER could be adjusted weekly (upward or downward) in increments of 6 mg per day (6 mg/day or 12 mg/day after a total daily dose of 48 mg was reached), based on chorea control and treatment regimen tolerability. Long-term treatment with SD-809 ER at a stable dose (although further dose adjustments were permitted, if clinically indicated) continued until SD-809 ER became commercially available in United States.</description>

        <description>Clinical laboratory hematology parameters included basophils, eosinophils, leukocytes, lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, platelets, erythrocytes mean corpuscular volume, erythrocytes, hematocrit, and hemoglobin. Hematocrit levels were calculated as the ratio of the volume of red cells to the volume of whole blood. Change from baseline in hematocrit at baseline and Week 158 is reported in this outcome measure. Observed value at baseline and observed value at Week 158 were used to calculate the change from baseline value at Week 158.</description>

            <description>Participants who completed study SD-809-C-15 (either placebo group or SD-809 group, including 1-week washout period and Week 13 evaluation), received 6 mg SD-809 ER tablet once daily as a starting dose in this study. Dose titration was continued through Week 8 to optimize the dose. Dose of SD-809 ER could be adjusted weekly in increments of 6 mg/day (6 or 12 mg/day after a total daily dose of 48 mg was reached) based on chorea control and adverse events. Daily doses of SD-809 ER 12 mg and higher were administered twice daily. Maximum total daily dose of SD-809 ER was 72 mg/day (36 mg twice daily), unless the participant was receiving a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., paroxetine, buproprion, and fluoxetine), in which case the maximum total daily dose was 42 mg (21 mg twice daily). Long-term treatment with SD-809 ER at a stable dose (although further dose adjustments were permitted, if clinically indicated) continued until SD-809 ER became commercially available in United States.</description>

Participants remained on initial dose of SD-809 ER through Week 1. Dose adjustment was continued through Week 4 to optimize the dose. Dose of SD-809 ER could be adjusted weekly (upward or downward) in increments of 6 mg per day (6 mg/day or 12 mg/day after a total daily dose of 48 mg was reached), based on chorea control and treatment regimen tolerability.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Clinical Laboratory Serum Chemistry Parameters (Aspartate Aminotransferase and Lactate Dehydrogenase) at Week 158</title>
        <description>Clinical laboratory serum chemistry parameters included alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, bicarbonate, blood urea nitrogen, calcium, chloride, cholesterol, glucose, magnesium, phosphate, potassium, sodium, triglycerides, protein, albumin, creatinine clearance, bilirubin, creatinine, direct bilirubin, and urate. Change from baseline in aspartate aminotransferase and lactate dehydrogenase at baseline and Week 158 is reported in this outcome measure. Observed value at baseline and observed value at Week 158 were used to calculate the change from baseline value at Week 158.</description>

            <description>Participants who completed study SD-809-C-15 (either placebo group or SD-809 group, including 1-week washout period and Week 13 evaluation), received 6 mg SD-809 ER tablet once daily as a starting dose in this study. Dose titration was continued through Week 8 to optimize the dose. Dose of SD-809 ER could be adjusted weekly in increments of 6 mg/day (6 or 12 mg/day after a total daily dose of 48 mg was reached) based on chorea control and adverse events. Daily doses of SD-809 ER 12 mg and higher were administered twice daily. Maximum total daily dose of SD-809 ER was 72 mg/day (36 mg twice daily), unless the participant was receiving a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., paroxetine, buproprion, and fluoxetine), in which case the maximum total daily dose was 42 mg (21 mg twice daily). Long-term treatment with SD-809 ER at a stable dose (although further dose adjustments were permitted, if clinically indicated) continued until SD-809 ER became commercially available in United States.</description>

Participants remained on initial dose of SD-809 ER through Week 1. Dose adjustment was continued through Week 4 to optimize the dose. Dose of SD-809 ER could be adjusted weekly (upward or downward) in increments of 6 mg per day (6 mg/day or 12 mg/day after a total daily dose of 48 mg was reached), based on chorea control and treatment regimen tolerability. Long-term treatment with SD-809 ER at a stable dose (although further dose adjustments were permitted, if clinically indicated) continued until SD-809 ER became commercially available in United States.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Clinical Laboratory Serum Chemistry Parameters (Protein and Albumin) at Week 158</title>
        <description>Clinical laboratory serum chemistry parameters included alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, bicarbonate, blood urea nitrogen, calcium, chloride, cholesterol, glucose, magnesium, phosphate, potassium, sodium, triglycerides, protein, albumin, creatinine clearance, bilirubin, creatinine, direct bilirubin, and urate. Change from baseline in protein and albumin at baseline and Week 158 is reported in this outcome measure. Observed value at baseline and observed value at Week 158 were used to calculate the change from baseline value at Week 158.</description>

            <description>Participants who completed study SD-809-C-15 (either placebo group or SD-809 group, including 1-week washout period and Week 13 evaluation), received 6 mg SD-809 ER tablet once daily as a starting dose in this study. Dose titration was continued through Week 8 to optimize the dose. Dose of SD-809 ER could be adjusted weekly in increments of 6 mg/day (6 or 12 mg/day after a total daily dose of 48 mg was reached) based on chorea control and adverse events. Daily doses of SD-809 ER 12 mg and higher were administered twice daily. Maximum total daily dose of SD-809 ER was 72 mg/day (36 mg twice daily), unless the participant was receiving a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., paroxetine, buproprion, and fluoxetine), in which case the maximum total daily dose was 42 mg (21 mg twice daily). Long-term treatment with SD-809 ER at a stable dose (although further dose adjustments were permitted, if clinically indicated) continued until SD-809 ER became commercially available in United States.</description>

            <description>Participants who were receiving FDA-approved dosing regimen of tetrabenazine for at least 8 weeks prior to screening, were converted overnight from their existing tetrabenazine regimen to SD-809 ER regimen to achieve targeted steady-state AUC of total (alpha+beta)-HTBZ metabolites that was predicted to be comparable to that of participant’s prior tetrabenazine regimen. Participants remained on initial dose of SD-809 ER through Week 1. Dose adjustment was continued through Week 4 to optimize the dose. Dose of SD-809 ER could be adjusted weekly (upward or downward) in increments of 6 mg per day (6 mg/day or 12 mg/day after a total daily dose of 48 mg was reached), based on chorea control and treatment regimen tolerability. Long-term treatment with SD-809 ER at a stable dose (although further dose adjustments were permitted, if clinically indicated) continued until SD-809 ER became commercially available in United States.</description>

Change from baseline in bilirubin, creatinine, direct bilirubin, and urate at baseline and Week 158 is reported in this outcome measure.

            <description>Participants who completed study SD-809-C-15 (either placebo group or SD-809 group, including 1-week washout period and Week 13 evaluation), received 6 mg SD-809 ER tablet once daily as a starting dose in this study. Dose titration was continued through Week 8 to optimize the dose. Dose of SD-809 ER could be adjusted weekly in increments of 6 mg/day (6 or 12 mg/day after a total daily dose of 48 mg was reached) based on chorea control and adverse events. Daily doses of SD-809 ER 12 mg and higher were administered twice daily. Maximum total daily dose of SD-809 ER was 72 mg/day (36 mg twice daily), unless the participant was receiving a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., paroxetine, buproprion, and fluoxetine), in which case the maximum total daily dose was 42 mg (21 mg twice daily). Long-term treatment with SD-809 ER at a stable dose (although further dose adjustments were permitted, if clinically indicated) continued until SD-809 ER became commercially available in United States.</description>

Participants remained on initial dose of SD-809 ER through Week 1. Dose adjustment was continued through Week 4 to optimize the dose. Dose of SD-809 ER could be adjusted weekly (upward or downward) in increments of 6 mg per day (6 mg/day or 12 mg/day after a total daily dose of 48 mg was reached), based on chorea control and treatment regimen tolerability.

            <description>Participants who completed study SD-809-C-15 (either placebo group or SD-809 group, including 1-week washout period and Week 13 evaluation), received 6 mg SD-809 ER tablet once daily as a starting dose in this study. Dose titration was continued through Week 8 to optimize the dose. Dose of SD-809 ER could be adjusted weekly in increments of 6 mg/day (6 or 12 mg/day after a total daily dose of 48 mg was reached) based on chorea control and adverse events. Daily doses of SD-809 ER 12 mg and higher were administered twice daily. Maximum total daily dose of SD-809 ER was 72 mg/day (36 mg twice daily), unless the participant was receiving a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., paroxetine, buproprion, and fluoxetine), in which case the maximum total daily dose was 42 mg (21 mg twice daily). Long-term treatment with SD-809 ER at a stable dose (although further dose adjustments were permitted, if clinically indicated) continued until SD-809 ER became commercially available in United States.</description>

Participants remained on initial dose of SD-809 ER through Week 1. Dose adjustment was continued through Week 4 to optimize the dose. Dose of SD-809 ER could be adjusted weekly (upward or downward) in increments of 6 mg per day (6 mg/day or 12 mg/day after a total daily dose of 48 mg was reached), based on chorea control and treatment regimen tolerability.

            <description>Participants who completed study SD-809-C-15 (either placebo group or SD-809 group, including 1-week washout period and Week 13 evaluation), received 6 mg SD-809 ER tablet once daily as a starting dose in this study. Dose titration was continued through Week 8 to optimize the dose. Dose of SD-809 ER could be adjusted weekly in increments of 6 mg/day (6 or 12 mg/day after a total daily dose of 48 mg was reached) based on chorea control and adverse events. Daily doses of SD-809 ER 12 mg and higher were administered twice daily. Maximum total daily dose of SD-809 ER was 72 mg/day (36 mg twice daily), unless the participant was receiving a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., paroxetine, buproprion, and fluoxetine), in which case the maximum total daily dose was 42 mg (21 mg twice daily). Long-term treatment with SD-809 ER at a stable dose (although further dose adjustments were permitted, if clinically indicated) continued until SD-809 ER became commercially available in United States.</description>

            <description>Participants who were receiving FDA-approved dosing regimen of tetrabenazine for at least 8 weeks prior to screening, were converted overnight from their existing tetrabenazine regimen to SD-809 ER regimen to achieve targeted steady-state AUC of total (alpha+beta)-HTBZ metabolites that was predicted to be comparable to that of participant’s prior tetrabenazine regimen. Participants remained on initial dose of SD-809 ER through Week 1. Dose adjustment was continued through Week 4 to optimize the dose. Dose of SD-809 ER could be adjusted weekly (upward or downward) in increments of 6 mg per day (6 mg/day or 12 mg/day after a total daily dose of 48 mg was reached), based on chorea control and treatment regimen tolerability. Long-term treatment with SD-809 ER at a stable dose (although further dose adjustments were permitted, if clinically indicated) continued until SD-809 ER became commercially available in United States.</description>

Dose of SD-809 ER could be adjusted weekly in increments of 6 mg/day (6 or 12 mg/day after a total daily dose of 48 mg was reached) based on chorea control and adverse events. Daily doses of SD-809 ER 12 mg and higher were administered twice daily. Maximum total daily dose of SD-809 ER was 72 mg/day (36 mg twice daily), unless the participant was receiving a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., paroxetine, buproprion, and fluoxetine), in which case the maximum total daily dose was 42 mg (21 mg twice daily).

        <description>The UPDRS is a comprehensive instrument used to assess the signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease and includes patient and clinician-based assessments of motor, cognitive, and behavioral symptoms. The UPDRS-Dysarthria question pertaining to speech/dysarthria was used to monitor study participants for parkinsonism. Participants rated their responses on a scale ranging from 0 to 4, where 0 = normal; 1 = mildly affected, no difficulty being understood; 2 = moderately affected, sometimes asked to repeat statements; 3 = severely affected, frequently asked to repeat statements; 4 = unintelligible most of the time. Higher scores indicated greater impairment.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS) Summary Score at Week 171</title>
        <description>BARS is a rating scale for evaluation of drug-induced akathisia. It includes a summary score (objective assessment of akathisia and subjective measures [self-awareness and distress]) and a global clinical assessment. Objective akathisia rated on a scale of 0-3 (0=normal, occasional fidgety movements of limbs; 1=characteristic restless movements for less than half the time observed; 2= characteristic restless movements for at least half the time observed; 3=constant characteristic restless movements). Subjective measures included awareness of restlessness (rated on a scale of 0 [absence of inner restlessness] to 3 [awareness of intense compulsion to move]) and distress related to restlessness (rated on a scale of 0 [no distress] to 3 [severe distress]). Objective akathisia and subjective measures summed to yield summary score ranging from 0 (no akathisia and restlessness) to 9 (severe akathisia and restlessness), where higher scores indicated more akathisia and restlessness.</description>

            <description>Participants who were receiving FDA-approved dosing regimen of tetrabenazine for at least 8 weeks prior to screening, were converted overnight from their existing tetrabenazine regimen to SD-809 ER regimen to achieve targeted steady-state AUC of total (alpha+beta)-HTBZ metabolites that was predicted to be comparable to that of participant’s prior tetrabenazine regimen. Participants remained on initial dose of SD-809 ER through Week 1. Dose adjustment was continued through Week 4 to optimize the dose. Dose of SD-809 ER could be adjusted weekly (upward or downward) in increments of 6 mg per day (6 mg/day or 12 mg/day after a total daily dose of 48 mg was reached), based on chorea control and treatment regimen tolerability. Long-term treatment with SD-809 ER at a stable dose (although further dose adjustments were permitted, if clinically indicated) continued until SD-809 ER became commercially available in United States.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS) Summary Score at Week 171</title>
          <description>BARS is a rating scale for evaluation of drug-induced akathisia. It includes a summary score (objective assessment of akathisia and subjective measures [self-awareness and distress]) and a global clinical assessment. Objective akathisia rated on a scale of 0-3 (0=normal, occasional fidgety movements of limbs; 1=characteristic restless movements for less than half the time observed; 2= characteristic restless movements for at least half the time observed; 3=constant characteristic restless movements). Subjective measures included awareness of restlessness (rated on a scale of 0 [absence of inner restlessness] to 3 [awareness of intense compulsion to move]) and distress related to restlessness (rated on a scale of 0 [no distress] to 3 [severe distress]). Objective akathisia and subjective measures summed to yield summary score ranging from 0 (no akathisia and restlessness) to 9 (severe akathisia and restlessness), where higher scores indicated more akathisia and restlessness.</description>

            <description>Participants who were receiving FDA-approved dosing regimen of tetrabenazine for at least 8 weeks prior to screening, were converted overnight from their existing tetrabenazine regimen to SD-809 ER regimen to achieve targeted steady-state AUC of total (alpha+beta)-HTBZ metabolites that was predicted to be comparable to that of participant’s prior tetrabenazine regimen. Participants remained on initial dose of SD-809 ER through Week 1. Dose adjustment was continued through Week 4 to optimize the dose. Dose of SD-809 ER could be adjusted weekly (upward or downward) in increments of 6 mg per day (6 mg/day or 12 mg/day after a total daily dose of 48 mg was reached), based on chorea control and treatment regimen tolerability. Long-term treatment with SD-809 ER at a stable dose (although further dose adjustments were permitted, if clinically indicated) continued until SD-809 ER became commercially available in United States.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) Depression Subscale Score at Week 171</title>
          <description>HADS is a self-administered instrument reliable for detecting states of depression and anxiety It includes 2 subscales: Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale - anxiety (HADS-A) assesses state of generalized anxiety (anxious mood, restlessness, anxious thoughts, panic attacks); Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale - depression (HADS-D) assesses state of lost interest and diminished pleasure response (lowering of hedonic tone). Each subscale comprised of 7 items with range 0 (no presence of anxiety or depression) to 3 (severe feeling of anxiety or depression). Total score ranged from 0 to 21 for each subscale; where higher score indicated greater severity of anxiety and depression symptoms.</description>

        <description>ESS is a self-administered questionnaire comprised of 8 questions that provides a measure of a participant's general level of daytime sleepiness. Participants were asked to rate their usual chances of dozing off or falling asleep in different situations or activities that most people engage in as part of their daily lives (sitting and reading; watching TV; sitting inactive in a public place; as a passenger in a car for an hour without a break; lying down to rest in the afternoon when circumstances permit; sitting and talking to someone; sitting quietly after a lunch without alcohol; in a car, while stopped for a few minutes in traffic), on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 0 to 3, where 0=no chance; 1=slight chance; 2=moderate chance; 3=high chance. Total ESS score is the sum of 8 item-scores and can range between 0 and 24 with a higher the score indicating a higher level of daytime sleepiness.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) Total Score at Week 171</title>
        <description>MoCA is a validated rapid screening instrument for assessing mild cognitive dysfunction. It assesses different cognitive domains: attention and concentration, executive functions, memory, language, visuoconstructional skills, conceptual thinking, calculations, and orientation by using 30 questions test. Time to administer the MoCA© is approximately 10 minutes. The total possible score ranges from 0 (worst) to 30 (best) points; where higher scores indicate better cognitive function. A score of 26 or above is considered normal and a score below 26 is considered as recognitive dysfunction.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) Total Score at Week 171</title>
          <description>MoCA is a validated rapid screening instrument for assessing mild cognitive dysfunction. It assesses different cognitive domains: attention and concentration, executive functions, memory, language, visuoconstructional skills, conceptual thinking, calculations, and orientation by using 30 questions test. Time to administer the MoCA© is approximately 10 minutes. The total possible score ranges from 0 (worst) to 30 (best) points; where higher scores indicate better cognitive function. A score of 26 or above is considered normal and a score below 26 is considered as recognitive dysfunction.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) Total Behavior Score at Week 171</title>
        <description>The UHDRS is a research tool developed by the Huntington Disease (HD) Study Group to provide a uniform assessment of the clinical features and course of HD. The components of the full UHDRS assess motor function, cognition, behaviour, functional abilities, independence scale and total functional capacities. The total behavior score is made up of subscores evaluating depressed mood, apathy, low self-esteem/guilt, compulsive behavior, anxiety, irritable behavior, perseverative/obsessive thinking, disruptive/aggressive behavior, suicidal thoughts, delusions, and hallucinations. For each subscore the frequency and severity was assessed separately. Frequency was rated on a scale of 0 (never or almost never) to 4 (very frequently, most of the time). Severity was rated on a scale of 0 (no evidence) to 4 (severe). Total behavior score ranges from 0 (no impairment) to 88 (severe impairment). Higher scores indicated greater behavioral impairments.</description>

Dose titration was continued through Week 8 to optimize the dose. Dose of SD-809 ER could be adjusted weekly in increments of 6 mg/day (6 or 12 mg/day after a total daily dose of 48 mg was reached) based on chorea control and adverse events. Daily doses of SD-809 ER 12 mg and higher were administered twice daily. Maximum total daily dose of SD-809 ER was 72 mg/day (36 mg twice daily), unless the participant was receiving a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., paroxetine, buproprion, and fluoxetine), in which case the maximum total daily dose was 42 mg (21 mg twice daily). Long-term treatment with SD-809 ER at a stable dose (although further dose adjustments were permitted, if clinically indicated) continued until SD-809 ER became commercially available in United States.</description>

Participants remained on initial dose of SD-809 ER through Week 1. Dose adjustment was continued through Week 4 to optimize the dose. Dose of SD-809 ER could be adjusted weekly (upward or downward) in increments of 6 mg per day (6 mg/day or 12 mg/day after a total daily dose of 48 mg was reached), based on chorea control and treatment regimen tolerability.

        <title>Change From Baseline in UHDRS Total Functional Capacity (TFC) Score at Week 132</title>
        <description>UHDRS is a research tool developed by HD Study Group to provide a uniform assessment of the clinical features and course of HD. Components of the full UHDRS assess motor function, cognition, behaviour, functional abilities, independence scale and total functional capacities (TFC). TFC is a 5-item clinician rating scale typically completed after a brief interview with a participant and/or collateral source. TFC globally assesses occupation, finances, domestic chores, activities of daily living, and level of care, with scores on each item ranging from 0 to either 2 or 3 (e.g., Occupation: 0 = unable, 1 = marginal work only, 2 = reduced capacity for usual job, 3 = normal). The five items are summed to yield a TFC total score, which ranges from 0 (normal function) to 13 (severe dysfunction). Higher scores indicated better functioning.</description>

            <description>Participants who completed study SD-809-C-15 (either placebo group or SD-809 group, including 1-week washout period and Week 13 evaluation), received 6 mg SD-809 ER tablet once daily as a starting dose in this study. Dose titration was continued through Week 8 to optimize the dose. Dose of SD-809 ER could be adjusted weekly in increments of 6 mg/day (6 or 12 mg/day after a total daily dose of 48 mg was reached) based on chorea control and adverse events. Daily doses of SD-809 ER 12 mg and higher were administered twice daily. Maximum total daily dose of SD-809 ER was 72 mg/day (36 mg twice daily), unless the participant was receiving a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., paroxetine, buproprion, and fluoxetine), in which case the maximum total daily dose was 42 mg (21 mg twice daily). Long-term treatment with SD-809 ER at a stable dose (although further dose adjustments were permitted, if clinically indicated) continued until SD-809 ER became commercially available in United States.</description>

            <description>Participants who were receiving FDA-approved dosing regimen of tetrabenazine for at least 8 weeks prior to screening, were converted overnight from their existing tetrabenazine regimen to SD-809 ER regimen to achieve targeted steady-state AUC of total (alpha+beta)-HTBZ metabolites that was predicted to be comparable to that of participant’s prior tetrabenazine regimen. Participants remained on initial dose of SD-809 ER through Week 1. Dose adjustment was continued through Week 4 to optimize the dose. Dose of SD-809 ER could be adjusted weekly (upward or downward) in increments of 6 mg per day (6 mg/day or 12 mg/day after a total daily dose of 48 mg was reached), based on chorea control and treatment regimen tolerability. Long-term treatment with SD-809 ER at a stable dose (although further dose adjustments were permitted, if clinically indicated) continued until SD-809 ER became commercially available in United States.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in UHDRS Motor Assessment: Total Maximal Chorea (TMC) Score at Week 171</title>
        <description>UHDRS is a research tool developed by HD Study Group to provide a uniform assessment of the clinical features and course of HD. Components of the full UHDRS assess motor function, cognition, behaviour, functional abilities, independence scale and total functional capacities. Motor function assessment includes total motor score (TMS) and TMC score. TMC score is determined from Item 12 (maximal chorea) of UHDRS TMS and quantifies chorea based on assessments of the face, bucco-oral-lingual area, trunk, and the 4 extremities. TMC score is a sum of chorea scores in the 7 body regions, ranging from 0 (absent chorea) to 28 (marked/prolonged chorea). Lower TMC scores indicated less chorea.</description>

            <description>Participants who completed study SD-809-C-15 (either placebo group or SD-809 group, including 1-week washout period and Week 13 evaluation), received 6 mg SD-809 ER tablet once daily as a starting dose in this study. Dose titration was continued through Week 8 to optimize the dose. Dose of SD-809 ER could be adjusted weekly in increments of 6 mg/day (6 or 12 mg/day after a total daily dose of 48 mg was reached) based on chorea control and adverse events. Daily doses of SD-809 ER 12 mg and higher were administered twice daily. Maximum total daily dose of SD-809 ER was 72 mg/day (36 mg twice daily), unless the participant was receiving a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., paroxetine, buproprion, and fluoxetine), in which case the maximum total daily dose was 42 mg (21 mg twice daily). Long-term treatment with SD-809 ER at a stable dose (although further dose adjustments were permitted, if clinically indicated) continued until SD-809 ER became commercially available in United States.</description>

            <description>Participants who were receiving FDA-approved dosing regimen of tetrabenazine for at least 8 weeks prior to screening, were converted overnight from their existing tetrabenazine regimen to SD-809 ER regimen to achieve targeted steady-state AUC of total (alpha+beta)-HTBZ metabolites that was predicted to be comparable to that of participant’s prior tetrabenazine regimen. Participants remained on initial dose of SD-809 ER through Week 1. Dose adjustment was continued through Week 4 to optimize the dose. Dose of SD-809 ER could be adjusted weekly (upward or downward) in increments of 6 mg per day (6 mg/day or 12 mg/day after a total daily dose of 48 mg was reached), based on chorea control and treatment regimen tolerability. Long-term treatment with SD-809 ER at a stable dose (although further dose adjustments were permitted, if clinically indicated) continued until SD-809 ER became commercially available in United States.</description>

Components of the full UHDRS assess motor function, cognition, behaviour, functional abilities, independence scale and total functional capacities. Motor function assessment includes TMS and TMC score. The UHDRS TMS assesses all the motor features of HD and includes maximal chorea, maximal dystonia, ocular pursuit, saccade initiation and velocity, dysarthria, tongue protrusion, finger tapping, hand pronation and supination, luria, rigidity, bradykinesia, gait, tandem walking, and retropulsion pull test. Each of these was rated on a scale of 0 (normal motor function) to 4 (severely impaired motor function). TMS score is a sum of individual scores ranging from 0 (normal motor function) to 124 (severely impaired motor function). Lower TMS scores indicate better motor function.</description>

        <title>Change From Week 8 in UHDRS Motor Assessment: TMS at Week 171</title>
        <description>Components of full UHDRS assess motor function,cognition,behaviour,functional abilities,independence scale,total functional capacities. Motor function assessment includes TMS and TMC score. TMS assesses all motor features of HD and includes maximal chorea, maximal dystonia,ocular pursuit,saccade initiation and velocity,dysarthria,tongue protrusion,finger tapping,hand pronation and supination,luria rigidity,bradykinesia,gait,tandem walking,retropulsion pull test. Each of these was rated on a scale of 0(normal motor function) to 4(severely impaired motor function). TMS score is a sum of individual scores ranging from 0(normal motor function) to 124(severely impaired motor function). Lower TMS scores= better motor function. Data was available for total safety population, not by individual cohorts(rollover and switch cohort) from Week 8 to Week 171,as was done for change from baseline. Therefore, in order to present results data,the total,combined safety population treatment arm was used.</description>

          <description>Participants who completed study SD-809-C-15 (either placebo group or SD-809 group, including 1-week washout period and Week 13 evaluation), received 6 mg SD-809 ER tablet once daily as a starting dose in this study. Dose titration was continued through Week 8 to optimize the dose. Dose of SD-809 ER could be adjusted weekly in increments of 6 mg/day (6 or 12 mg/day after a total daily dose of 48 mg was reached) based on chorea control and adverse events. Daily doses of SD-809 ER 12 mg and higher were administered twice daily. Maximum total daily dose of SD-809 ER was 72 mg/day (36 mg twice daily), unless the participant was receiving a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., paroxetine, buproprion, and fluoxetine), in which case the maximum total daily dose was 42 mg (21 mg twice daily). Long-term treatment with SD-809 ER at a stable dose (although further dose adjustments were permitted, if clinically indicated) continued until SD-809 ER became commercially available in United States.</description>

          <title>Switch Cohort: SD-809 ER</title>
          <description>Participants who were receiving FDA-approved dosing regimen of tetrabenazine for at least 8 weeks prior to screening, were converted overnight from their existing tetrabenazine regimen to SD-809 ER regimen to achieve targeted steady-state AUC of total (alpha+beta)-HTBZ metabolites that was predicted to be comparable to that of participant’s prior tetrabenazine regimen. Participants remained on initial dose of SD-809 ER through Week 1. Dose adjustment was continued through Week 4 to optimize the dose. Dose of SD-809 ER could be adjusted weekly (upward or downward) in increments of 6 mg per day (6 mg/day or 12 mg/day after a total daily dose of 48 mg was reached), based on chorea control and treatment regimen tolerability. Long-term treatment with SD-809 ER at a stable dose (although further dose adjustments were permitted, if clinically indicated) continued until SD-809 ER became commercially available in United States.</description>
