    <textblock>
      This is a study to evaluate a drug called bevacizumab in patients with cancer whose disease
      has spread to their brain. This study will not evaluate the effect of bevacizumab on the
      systemic solid tumor cancer. Bevacizumab is a medication and it is thought that bevacizumab
      may interfere with the growth of new blood vessels; therefore it might stop tumor growth and
      possibly shrink the tumor by keeping it from receiving nutrients and oxygen supplied by the
      blood vessels.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the radiographic response rate in patients with solid tumor brain metastases
      treated with bevacizumab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate the progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 6 months. II. Determine the time to
      progression based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scans.

      III. Determine the time to response based on radiographic imaging. IV. Determine the duration
      of response based on radiographic imaging. V. Determine overall survival. VI. Collect
      additional safety data. VII. Assess changes in quality of life using the Functional
      Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Brain (FACT-Br) while on treatment.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive bevacizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes every 2 weeks. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 8 weeks.

    <measure>Objective Radiographic Tumor Response in Patients With Recurrent Solid Tumor Brain Metastases Treated With Bevacizumab</measure>
    <time_frame>Every other cycle, starting cycle 3 (1 cycle =28 days) until off study. Range of cycles completed 1-20.</time_frame>
    <description>Radiographic Response to treatment will be assessed prior to every odd-numbered cycle using CT or MRI scans until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity as assessed by the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) Criteria for target lesions. Response is defined as the number of patients with Complete Response (CR) plus those with Partial Response (PR) radiographically. Generally CR is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions and PR is defined as &gt;=50% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-Free Survival (PFS) at 6 Months in Patients With Recurrent Solid Tumor Brain Metastases Treated With Bevacizumab</measure>
    <time_frame>At 6 months from treatment initiation.</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-Free Survival (PFS) will be measured as the time from the first dose to the first occurrence of progression or death for any reason. To estimate PFS, Kaplan-Meier curves will be calculated and PFS at 6 months will be determined from the progression-free survival curve.
Progression is defined using Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Criteria (RANO), as a 25% or more increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Progression in Patients With Recurrent Solid Tumor Brain Metastases Treated With Bevacizumab</measure>
    <time_frame>From treatment initiation, every 2 cycles (1 cycle = 28 days) until progressive disease. Range of cycles completed 1-20.</time_frame>
    <description>MRI or CT scans and clinical assessment will be used to measure Time to Progression which will be assessed as the time from the date of first dose to the date of first observation of progressive disease, non-reversible neurologic progression or increasing steroid requirements, or early discontinuation of treatment as assessed by the RANO Criteria in those patients that experience response.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Response in Patients With Recurrent Solid Tumor Brain Metastases Treated With Bevacizumab</measure>
    <time_frame>From the start of treatment every 2 cycles (1 cycle =28 days) until time of response. Range of cycles completed 1-20.</time_frame>
    <description>MRI or CT scans and clinical assessment will be used to measure Time to Response which will be assessed as the time from the date of first dose to the date of first observed tumor response in all patients that a response is observed. Response to treatment will be assessed using the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) Criteria for target lesions. Response is defined as either Complete Response (CR) or a Partial Response (PR) radiographically. Generally CR is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions and PR is defined as &gt;=50% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response in Patients With Recurrent Solid Tumor Brain Metastases Treated With Bevacizumab</measure>
    <time_frame>From documentation of response, every two cycles (1 cycle =28 days) until progressive disease. Range of cycles completed 1-20.</time_frame>
    <description>The Duration of Overall Response is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) until the first date that recurrent or Progressive Disease (PD) is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). Duration of response will be based on CT or MRI scans and clinical assessment performed prior to every odd-numbered cycle to detect date of first response to study treatment until date of disease progression and assessed by the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) Criteria for target lesions. Generally CR is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions, PR is defined as &gt;=50% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions and PD is defined as a 25% or more increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS) in Patients With Recurrent Solid Tumor Brain Metastases Treated With Bevacizumab</measure>
    <time_frame>From start of treatment until death from any cause. Median follow up of 8 months (range 1.3 to 47.9 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Overall Survival (OS) will be measured as the date of first dose of bevacizumab to the date of death from any cause. To estimate OS, Kaplan-Meier curves will be calculated and OS will be determined from the overall survival curve.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Toxicity of Bevacizumab in Patients With Recurrent Solid Tumor Brain Metastases</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed prior to every cylcle (cycle=28 days) while on treatment through 30 days post last dose. Range of cycles 1-20.</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events (AE) will be collected at the start of every cycle and graded according NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03. All AEs that are determined to be grade 3 or higher and at least possible related to bevacizumab will be reported for toxicity. In general AEs will be graded:
Grade 1 - Mild: the event causes discomfort without disruption of normal daily activities.
Grade 2 - Moderate: the event causes discomfort that affects normal daily activities.
Grade 3 - Severe: the event makes the patient unable to perform normal daily activities or significantly affects his/her clinical status.
Grade 4 - Life-threatening: the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event.
Grade 5 - Fatal: the event caused death.</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life Assessments in Patients With Recurrent Solid Tumor Brain Metastases Treated With Bevacizumab</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at Cycle 3 (1 Cycle = 28 days).</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in quality of life will be evaluated using questionnaires (FACT-Br) at baseline (before treatment initiation) and at cycle 3.
Four FACT scales were calculated. The higher the value the better the score, i.e., the better the quality of life perceived by patient.
FACT-G (Fact General, possible range 0 - 108) BrCS (Brain Cancer Subscale, possible range 0 - 92) TOTAL (FACT-G + BrCS, possible range 0 - 200) TOI (Trial Outcome Index = Physical Well Being _ Functional Well Being +BrCS, possible range 0 - 148)</description>

Grade 4 - Life-threatening: the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event.
Grade 5 - Fatal: the event caused death.</description>
