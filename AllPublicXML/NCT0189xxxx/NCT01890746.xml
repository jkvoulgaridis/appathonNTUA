  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled study was to provide clinical
      safety and exploratory efficacy data on the use of Eltrombopag in adult subjects with Acute
      Myeloid Leukemia (AML) receiving standard induction chemotherapy with daunorubicin plus
      cytarabine. A minimum of 120 evaluable subjects newly diagnosed with AML was stratified by
      antecedent malignant hematologic disorder and age.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Any Adverse Events (AE) and Any Serious Adverse Events (SAE) as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability.</measure>
    <time_frame>From the time the first dose of study treatment was administered until 30 days following discontinuation of investigational product regardless of initiation of a new cancer therapy or transfer to hospice</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, is an important medical event that jeopardizes the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition, or is associated with liver injury and impaired liver function.</description>

             days of first dose of study treatment and agree to use effective contraception during

      <recruitment_details>Participants (Par.) diagnosed with Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML) of any subtype (except acute promyelocytic [M3] or acute megakaryocytic leukaemia [M7]) were eligible for the study.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Sufficient number of participants were screened and 148 participants were randomized and entered in to the study. Participants were stratified by antecedent malignant hematologic disorder (yes versus no) and age (18-60 years versus &gt;60 years), before they were randomized to receive study treatments.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Par. received IDN CTY consisting of DAU bolus IV INF on D 1-3 at a dose of 90 mg/m^2 for Par. 18-60 years old or 60 mg/m^2 for Par.&gt;60 years old plus cytarabine 100 mg/m^2 continuous IV INF on D1-7. Par. received ELT as 200 mg (100 mg for East-Asian Heritage) QD oral dose starting on D4 of initial IDN CTY at least 20 hours after end of D3 DAU INF. If PT count was not &gt;100 Gi/L after 7 days the dose was increased to 300 mg (150 mg East-Asian Heritage) QD until a PT count of at least 200 Gi/L was achieved, until remission was assessed by bone marrow biopsy, or for a maximum of 42 days from the start of the CTY IDN cycle. Par. who were not aplastic after first cycle of IDN CTY received re-IDN with a modified DAU dose of 45mg/m^2/day on D1-3 plus cytarabine 100 mg/m^2/day on D1-7. For re-IDN Par., ELT was held from D1-3 of re-IDN, and resumed on D4 at the same dose and duration.</description>

        <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.

An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, is an important medical event that jeopardizes the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition, or is associated with liver injury and impaired liver function.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in the Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF).</title>
          <description>LVEF is a measurement of the percentage of blood leaving heart each time it contracts. LVEF was assessed by an echocardiogram (ECHO) or Multiple Gated Acquisition scan (MUGA). Baseline was defined as the most recent, non-missing value prior to or on the first study treatment dose date. Change from Baseline was calculated as the Day 42 value minus the Baseline value.</description>

If PT count was not &gt;100 Gi/L after 7 days the dose was increased to 300 mg (150 mg East-Asian Heritage) QD until a PT count of at least 200 Gi/L was achieved, until remission was assessed by bone marrow biopsy, or for a maximum of 42 days from the start of the CTY IDN cycle. Par. who were not aplastic after first cycle of IDN CTY received re-IDN with a modified DAU dose of 45mg/m^2/day on D1-3 plus cytarabine 100 mg/m^2/day on D1-7.

If PT count was not &gt;100 Gi/L after 7 days the dose was increased to 300 mg (150 mg East-Asian Heritage) QD until a PT count of at least 200 Gi/L was achieved, until remission was assessed by bone marrow biopsy, or for a maximum of 42 days from the start of the CTY IDN cycle. Par. who were not aplastic after first cycle of IDN CTY received re-IDN with a modified DAU dose of 45mg/m^2/day on D1-3 plus cytarabine 100 mg/m^2/day on D1-7.

Par. received ELT as 200 mg (100 mg for East-Asian Heritage) QD oral dose starting on D4 of initial IDN CTY at least 20 hours after end of D3 DAU INF. If PT count was not &gt;100 Gi/L after 7 days the dose was increased to 300 mg (150 mg East-Asian Heritage) QD until a PT count of at least 200 Gi/L was achieved, until remission was assessed by bone marrow biopsy, or for a maximum of 42 days from the start of the CTY IDN cycle. Par. who were not aplastic after first cycle of IDN CTY received re-IDN with a modified DAU dose of 45mg/m^2/day on D1-3 plus cytarabine 100 mg/m^2/day on D1-7. For re-IDN Par., ELT was held from D1-3 of re-IDN, and resumed on D4 at the same dose and duration.</description>

If PT count was not &gt;100 Gi/L after 7 days the dose was increased to 300 mg (150 mg East-Asian Heritage) QD until a PT count of at least 200 Gi/L was achieved, until remission was assessed by bone marrow biopsy, or for a maximum of 42 days from the start of the CTY IDN cycle. Par. who were not aplastic after first cycle of IDN CTY received re-IDN with a modified DAU dose of 45mg/m^2/day on D1-3 plus cytarabine 100 mg/m^2/day on D1-7. For re-IDN Par., ELT was held from D1-3 of re-IDN, and resumed on D4 at the same dose and duration.</description>

If PT count was not &gt;100 Gi/L after 7 days the dose was increased to 300 mg (150 mg East-Asian Heritage) QD until a PT count of at least 200 Gi/L was achieved, until remission was assessed by bone marrow biopsy, or for a maximum of 42 days from the start of the CTY IDN cycle. Par. who were not aplastic after first cycle of IDN CTY received re-IDN with a modified DAU dose of 45mg/m^2/day on D1-3 plus cytarabine 100 mg/m^2/day on D1-7. For re-IDN Par., ELT was held from D1-3 of re-IDN, and resumed on D4 at the same dose and duration.</description>
