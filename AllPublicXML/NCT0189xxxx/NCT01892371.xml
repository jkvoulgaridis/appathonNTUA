      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of quizartinib when given in
      combination with azacitidine or cytarabine in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia
      or myelodysplastic syndrome that have come back (relapsed) or are not responding to treatment
      (refractory). Quizartinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as azacitidine and cytarabine work
      in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by
      stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving quizartinib with
      azacitidine or cytarabine may work better in patients with acute myeloid leukemia or
      myelodysplastic syndrome.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the
      combination of quizartinib (AC220) with either azacitidine (5-azacitidine [AZA]) or low-dose
      cytarabine (LDAC) in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or high-risk myelodysplastic
      syndrome (MDS). (Phase I) II. To determine the clinical activity of the combination of
      quizartinib with either AZA or LDAC in patients with AML or MDS. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the clinical activity of the combination of quizartinib with either AZA or
      LDAC in patients with AML or MDS. (Phase I) II. To determine the safety of the combination of
      quizartinib with either AZA or LDAC in patients with AML or MDS. (Phase II) III. To determine
      the induction of hypomethylation, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage and FLT3 signaling
      during therapy with this combination and its correlation with response. (Phase I and II) IV.
      To determine the effect of this combination therapy on plasma levels of FLT3-ligand. (Phase I
      and II) V. To determine the pharmacodynamics of this combination therapy in patients with AML
      or high-risk MDS. (Phase I and II)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of quizartinib followed by a phase II
      study. Participants are assigned to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive quizartinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 5-28 of cycle 1 and
      on days 1-28 of subsequent cycles and azacitidine subcutaneously (SC) or intravenously (IV)
      over 10-40 minutes on days 1-7. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive quizartinib PO QD on days 5-28 of cycle 1 and on days 1-28 of
      subsequent cycles and cytarabine SC twice daily (BID) on days 1-10. Cycles repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6-12 months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  PHASE I

          -  Refractory or relapsed disease defined as follows: patients with MDS or chronic
             myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) should have failed prior therapy (e.g., with a
             hypomethylating agent, clofarabine, and/or with lenalidomide); patients with AML
             should have failed any prior induction therapy or have relapsed after prior therapy;
             patients (any age) with MDS or CMML who received therapy with a hypomethylating agent
             and progress to AML are eligible at the time of diagnosis of AML regardless any prior
             therapy for AML. The World Health Organization (WHO) classification will be used for
             AML; patients with any of the eligible diagnoses who have received no prior therapy
             are eligible if not candidates to receive standard intensive therapy (i.e., high-dose
             cytarabine-based chemotherapy).

          -  Patients are eligible regardless of their FLT3 mutation status.

          -  PHASE II

          -  COHORT 2A: Patients with MDS, CMML or AML who are either: age 60 years or older and
             newly diagnosed, previously untreated. Prior therapy with hydroxyurea or single agent
             ara-C for the purpose of control of white blood cells (WBC) is acceptable.; age 18
             years or older and with refractory or relapse disease who have received no more than
             one prior treatment regimen and will be receiving first salvage. For this purpose, a
             second induction cycle with the same drugs used during the first cycle, consolidation
             chemotherapy or stem cell transplant in complete remission (CR) (or complete response
             with incomplete platelet recovery [CRp] or complete response with incomplete bone
             marrow recovery [CRi]) will be considered part of the prior regimen. Prior therapy for
             MDS (or other malignancies) is not considered a prior regimen for AML in patients who
             progress from MDS (or other malignancies).

          -  COHORT 2A: Patients (any age) with MDS or CMML who received therapy with a
             hypomethylating agent and progress to AML are eligible at the time of diagnosis of AML
             regardless any prior therapy for AML. The WHO classification will be used for AML.

          -  COHORT 2A: Patients must have evidence of FLT3 ITD in their most recent assessment.

          -  COHORT 2B: Patients with MDS, CMML or AML who are either: Age 60 years or older and
             newly diagnosed, previously untreated. Prior therapy with hydroxyurea or single agent
             ara-C for the purpose of control of WBC is acceptable or age 18 years or older and
             with refractory or relapse disease who have received no more than two prior treatment
             regimens and will be receiving second salvage, or who have received a prior SCT and
             will be receiving their first salvage. For this purposes, a second induction cycle
             with the same drugs used during the first cycle, consolidation chemotherapy or stem
             cell transplant in CR (or CRp or CRi) will be considered part of the prior regimen.
             Prior therapy for MDS (or other malignancies) is not considered a prior regimen for
             AML in patients who progress from MDS (or other malignancies)

          -  COHORT 2B: Patients (any age) with MDS or CMML who received therapy with a
             hypomethylating agent and progress to AML are eligible at the time of diagnosis of AML
             regardless any prior therapy for AML. The WHO classification will be used for AML

               -  For patients with suspected liver infiltration from leukemia ALT should be =&lt; 5
                  ULN.

          -  Creatinine =&lt; 2 x ULN.

          -  Serum potassium, magnesium, and calcium (normalized for albumin) levels should be at
             least within institutional normal limits.

          -  Patients must provide written informed consent.

          -  Patients must have been off chemotherapy for 2 weeks prior to entering this study,
             unless there is evidence of rapidly progressive disease, and must have recovered from
             the toxic effects of that therapy to at least grade 1. Use of hydroxyurea for patients
             with rapidly proliferative disease is allowed before the start of study therapy and
             for the first four weeks on therapy. The additional days of hydrea after 28 is
             permitted as clinically indicated, on case by case basis after discussion with the
             principal investigator (PI). Other agents given transiently with the intention to
             control rapid proliferation such as 1-2 doses of single agent ara-C or few doses of
             sorafenib are also allowed.
