    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the new treatment of WH-1
      ointment compared to Aquacel® Hydrofiber® dressing, applied to chronic diabetic foot ulcers
      for up to 16 weeks.An additional objective of this study is to collect safety information
      including adverse events and clinical laboratory abnormalities.

      This trial is designed as a randomized, evaluator blinded, active-controlled, multi-center
      study comparing the efficacy and safety of WH-1 ointment and Aquacel® Hydrofiber® dressing in
      the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers. Independent evaluators who blinded to subjects'
      treatment will evaluate whether the wound has healed. Eligible subjects will be randomized to
      receive either WH-1 ointment or Aquacel® Hydrofiber® dressing in a 1:1 allocation. The study
      treatment will be applied to the selected ulcer for a maximum period of 16 weeks, until the
      wound/ulcer closure (wound size of 0) for two consecutive visits at least 2 weeks apart, or
      until the subject exited the study as treatment failure. After that, all subjects regardless
      of wound healing at the end of comparison period will be followed for 12 weeks to investigate
      durability. During the follow-up period, Aquacel® Hydrofiber® dressing will be applied for
      subjects who have unhealed or with recurrent wound. Each target ulcer with wound photographs
      for blind assessment will be monitored at each scheduled visit.

      One interim analysis is planned at around 50% of study information; the final analysis will
      be conducted at the end of the study.

    <description>The primary variable is the number of target ulcers healed in each group within 16 weeks. The primary efficacy outcome is the comparison of the incidence of complete healing of the target ulcer between the two treatment groups at the end of treatment.
For the purpose of this study a complete healing will be defined as complete epithelialization which is maintained with no drainage for at least 2 weeks and is confirmed by a blinded assessor.</description>
