    <textblock>
      It is unknown, if a modern prevention program, including intense nurse-coordinated education
      sessions, regular telephone contacts and a telephone hotline for 12 months, significantly
      reduces cardiovascular risk factors, clinical events and quality of life in myocardial
      infarction patients compared to usual care. Furthermore, actually no data on the additional
      effects and the feasibility of longterm telemetric care of cardiovascular risk factors exist.

      The primary hypothesis to be tested is that an intensive longterm prevention program compared
      to the standard of medical care, will achieve better risk factor control and consecutively
      less clinical adverse events in patients after myocardial infarctions. The study endpoints
      will be evaluated after 12 months and during long-term course (after 24 months = one year
      after termination of the prevention program).

      In a substudy the effects of short reinterventions (&quot;Prevention Boosts&quot;) during long-term
      course are tested (IPP Prevention Boost Study). Patients with at least one insufficiently
      controlled risk factor at 24-months visit are randomly assigned to a short (2-month)
      reintervention vs. no reintervention. The effects of the reinterventions on risk factor
      control are evaluated after 36 months.

      A further substudy focusing on young patients &lt;= 45 years of age at time of MI (IPP-Y = IPP
      in the Young) was added after completion of the pilot IPP study. In this study we focus on
      the prevention program in young MI-patients. A retrospective analysis of individual genetic
      risk (assessed by genetic risk scores) in the young patients is included in this substudy.
