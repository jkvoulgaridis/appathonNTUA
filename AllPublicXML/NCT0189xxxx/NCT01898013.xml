  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study design is a randomized, double-blind, two-arm trial of pregnenolone and placebo to
      determine the possible analgesic effects in OEF/OIF Veterans with chronic low back pain. The
      total study duration is 6 weeks (followed by two-follow up phone calls). All patients will
      monitor pain symptoms for one week with pain diaries, followed by a 1-week placebo-only
      lead-in period, 90 subjects will be randomly assigned to one of two groups. Of these
      subjects, 45 subjects will receive pregnenolone, and 45 subjects will receive placebo for 4
      weeks. Patient interview assessments and laboratory studies will be performed at each
      interview time point. Pregnenolone, allopregnanolone and other neurosteroid metabolites will
      be determined by gas chromatography / mass spectrometry (GC/MS), proceeded by high
      performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).

    <measure>Change in Pain Intensity Rating (Visit 6-Baseline)</measure>
    <time_frame>Difference Scores (Visit 6-Baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>Weekly mean of the 24-hour average pain severity scores recorded daily on an 11-point Likert scale, an ordinal scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain). The outcome measure is the change in scores before and after treatment. That is, the baseline and Visit 6 difference scores.</description>

    <measure>Change in Pain Interference Scores (Visit 6-Baseline)</measure>
    <time_frame>Difference Scores of Averaged Pain Interference Domains (Visit 6-Baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>The The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) is a self-reported scale that measures the severity of pain and the interference of pain on function. The scores range from 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as severe as you can imagine). There are 4 questions assessing worst pain, least pain, average pain in the past 24 hours, and the pain right now. The Interference scores range from 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes). There are 7 questions assessing the interference of pain in the past 24 hours for general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep, and enjoyment of life. The outcome measure is the change in scores before and after treatment. That is, the baseline and Visit 6 difference scores.</description>

    <time_frame>Difference Scores of BDI (Visit 6-Baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>The Beck Depression Inventory is a 21-item, self-report rating inventory that measures characteristic attitudes and symptoms of depression (Beck, et al., 1961). Scores range from 0 (no depression) to 63 (severe depression). The outcome measure is the change in scores before and after treatment. That is, the baseline and Visit 6 difference scores.</description>

    <measure>Change in Davidson Trauma Scale (Visit 6-Baseline)</measure>
    <time_frame>Difference Scores of Total DTS Scores (Visit 6-Baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>The Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS) is a 17-item self-report measure that assesses the 17 DSM-IV symptoms of PTSD. Items are rated on 5-point frequency (0 = &quot;not at all&quot; to 4 = &quot;every day&quot;) and severity scales (0 = &quot;not at all distressing&quot; to 4 = &quot;extremely distressing&quot;). Respondents are asked to identify the trauma that is most disturbing to them and to rate, in the past week, how much trouble they have had with each symptom. The DTS yields a frequency score (ranging from 0 to 68), severity score (ranging from 0 to 68), and total score (ranging from 0 to 136). The outcome measure is the change in scores before and after treatment. That is, the baseline and Visit 6 difference scores.</description>

    <measure>Change in Tower of London (Visit 6-Baseline)</measure>
    <time_frame>Difference Z-Score (Visit 6-Baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>The Tower of London is a clinician administered subtest from the Brief Assessment of Cognition-Affect (BAC-A) which measures executive functioning. Participants were shown two pictures simultaneously. Each picture showed three balls of different colors arranged on three pegs, with the balls in a unique arrangement in each picture. Participants were asked to give the total number of times the balls in one picture need to be moved in order to make the arrangement of balls identical to that of the other, opposing picture. There were 20 trials, 2 more were added if all 10 prior trials were correct. Range of scores was 0-22, higher scores are better. Z scores calculated and reported. The outcome measure is the change in Z scores before and after treatment. That is, the baseline and Visit 6 difference scores.</description>

    <measure>Change in Digit Sequence (Visit 6-Baseline)</measure>
    <time_frame>Difference Z-Scores (Visit 6-Baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>Digit Sequencing Task is a clinician administered subtest from the Brief Assessment of Cognition-Affect (BAC-A) which measures working memory and attention. Participants were presented with clusters of numbers of increasing length.They were asked to tell the experimenter the numbers in order, from lowest to highest. Measures: number of correct responses (range: 0-28, higher is better). Scores converted to Z-scores. The outcome measure is the change in Z scores before and after treatment. That is, the baseline and Visit 6 difference scores.</description>

         14. Have serious or unstable cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, metabolic, respiratory, or
             hematologic illness, symptomatic peripheral vascular disease, or other medical
             condition or psychiatric conditions that, in the opinion of investigator and study
             physician, would compromise participation or be likely to lead to hospitalization
             during the course of the study.

         15. Are non-ambulatory or require the use of crutches or a walker.

        <title>Change in Pain Interference Scores (Visit 6-Baseline)</title>
        <description>The The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) is a self-reported scale that measures the severity of pain and the interference of pain on function. The scores range from 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as severe as you can imagine). There are 4 questions assessing worst pain, least pain, average pain in the past 24 hours, and the pain right now. The Interference scores range from 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes). There are 7 questions assessing the interference of pain in the past 24 hours for general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep, and enjoyment of life. The outcome measure is the change in scores before and after treatment. That is, the baseline and Visit 6 difference scores.</description>

        <title>Change in Davidson Trauma Scale (Visit 6-Baseline)</title>
        <description>The Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS) is a 17-item self-report measure that assesses the 17 DSM-IV symptoms of PTSD. Items are rated on 5-point frequency (0 = &quot;not at all&quot; to 4 = &quot;every day&quot;) and severity scales (0 = &quot;not at all distressing&quot; to 4 = &quot;extremely distressing&quot;). Respondents are asked to identify the trauma that is most disturbing to them and to rate, in the past week, how much trouble they have had with each symptom. The DTS yields a frequency score (ranging from 0 to 68), severity score (ranging from 0 to 68), and total score (ranging from 0 to 136). The outcome measure is the change in scores before and after treatment. That is, the baseline and Visit 6 difference scores.</description>
