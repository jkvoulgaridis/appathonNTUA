  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the frequency of moderate to severe daily
      hot flashes 4 weeks after a single dose of erenumab (AMG 334) in women with hot flashes
      associated with menopause.

      This study will test the hypothesis that the vasodilation associated with capsaicin-induced
      dermal blood flow (DBF) provides a good model for the vasodilation associated with hot
      flashes; therefore erenumab doses that cause DBF inhibition will be safe and well tolerated,
      and will be effective in the reduction of the frequency and/or severity of HFs.

    <measure>Ratio of Week 4 to Baseline Average Number of Daily Moderate to Severe Hot Flashes</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (days -7 to day 1 predose) and week 4 (days 21 to 27)</time_frame>
    <description>The severity of hot flashes was assessed by participants based on the following categories:
Mild: sensation of heat without sweating, mild flushing;
Moderate: sensation of heat, face flushed, slightly clammy, some sweating, able to continue activity, may want to remove layers of clothing or covers at night;
Severe: sensation of heat with more severe sweating, have to stop current activity, may have to change clothing.
Baseline (BL) number of hot flashes is the average number of moderate or severe hot flashes per 24 hours from day -7 to day 1 predose based on geometric mean, and the week 4 number of hot flashes is the average number of moderate or severe hot flashes per 24 hours from day 21 to day 27 based on geometric mean.
The ratio of week 4 to BL was used to assess change from BL to week 4 via a log transformation (log[week4/BL] = log[week4] - log[BL]), which was estimated using a repeated measures analysis. The ratio was obtained via an exponential back-transformation.</description>

    <measure>Ratio of Week 4 to Baseline Daily Hot Flash Severity Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (days -7 to day 1 predose) and week 4 (days 21 to 27)</time_frame>
    <description>The daily severity score was calculated according to the following:
(Number of mild hot flashes * 1) + (number of moderate hot flashes * 2) + (number of severe hot flashes * 3).
The baseline daily hot flash severity score is the geometric mean daily hot flash severity score from day -7 to day 1 predose, and the week 4 daily hot flash severity score is the geometric mean daily hot flash severity score from day 21 to day 27.
The ratio of week 4 to baseline (week 4 / baseline) was used to assess change from baseline to week 4 via a log transformation (log[week4/BL] = log[week4] - log[baseline]), which was estimated using a repeated measures analysis. The ratio was obtained via an exponential back-transformation.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events</measure>

    <description>A treatment-emergent adverse event is any adverse event that began or worsened after the initial dose of study drug and before the end of study.
A serious adverse event is an adverse event that met at least 1 of the following serious criteria:
fatal
life threatening
required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
congenital anomaly/birth defect.
other medically important serious event A treatment-related adverse event (TRAE) is any treatment-emergent adverse event that per investigator review had a reasonable possibility of being caused by the study drug.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Suicidal Ideation</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) was used to assess suicidal ideation during the study based on the following Yes/No questions:
Have you wished you were dead or wished you could go to sleep and not wake up?
Have you actually had any thoughts of killing yourself?</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Who Developed Anti-erenumab Antibodies After a Single Dose</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Two validated assays were used to detect the presence of anti-erenumab antibodies. First, an electrochemiluminescent (ECL) bridging immunoassay was used to detect antibodies capable of binding erenumab. Second, a cell based bioassay was used to test positive binding antibody samples for neutralizing activity against erenumab.
A participant was defined as positive for developing anti-erenumab antibodies if they were binding antibody positive postbaseline with a negative or no result at baseline. If a sample was positive for binding antibodies and demonstrated neutralizing activity at the same time point, the participant was defined as positive for neutralizing antibodies.</description>

        <title>Ratio of Week 4 to Baseline Average Number of Daily Moderate to Severe Hot Flashes</title>
        <description>The severity of hot flashes was assessed by participants based on the following categories:
Mild: sensation of heat without sweating, mild flushing;
Moderate: sensation of heat, face flushed, slightly clammy, some sweating, able to continue activity, may want to remove layers of clothing or covers at night;
Severe: sensation of heat with more severe sweating, have to stop current activity, may have to change clothing.
Baseline (BL) number of hot flashes is the average number of moderate or severe hot flashes per 24 hours from day -7 to day 1 predose based on geometric mean, and the week 4 number of hot flashes is the average number of moderate or severe hot flashes per 24 hours from day 21 to day 27 based on geometric mean.
The ratio of week 4 to BL was used to assess change from BL to week 4 via a log transformation (log[week4/BL] = log[week4] - log[BL]), which was estimated using a repeated measures analysis. The ratio was obtained via an exponential back-transformation.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Who Developed Anti-erenumab Antibodies After a Single Dose</title>
        <description>Two validated assays were used to detect the presence of anti-erenumab antibodies. First, an electrochemiluminescent (ECL) bridging immunoassay was used to detect antibodies capable of binding erenumab. Second, a cell based bioassay was used to test positive binding antibody samples for neutralizing activity against erenumab.
A participant was defined as positive for developing anti-erenumab antibodies if they were binding antibody positive postbaseline with a negative or no result at baseline. If a sample was positive for binding antibodies and demonstrated neutralizing activity at the same time point, the participant was defined as positive for neutralizing antibodies.</description>

          <description>Two validated assays were used to detect the presence of anti-erenumab antibodies. First, an electrochemiluminescent (ECL) bridging immunoassay was used to detect antibodies capable of binding erenumab. Second, a cell based bioassay was used to test positive binding antibody samples for neutralizing activity against erenumab.
A participant was defined as positive for developing anti-erenumab antibodies if they were binding antibody positive postbaseline with a negative or no result at baseline. If a sample was positive for binding antibodies and demonstrated neutralizing activity at the same time point, the participant was defined as positive for neutralizing antibodies.</description>

      <restrictive_agreement>The Clinical Trial Agreement generally does not restrict an investigator's discussion of trial results after completion. The Agreement permits Amgen a limited period of time to review material discussing trial results (typically up to 45 days and possible extension). Amgen may remove confidential information, but authors have final control and approval of publication content. For multicenter studies, the investigator agrees not to publish any results before the first multi-center publication.</restrictive_agreement>
