  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Abbott Vascular (AV) obtained marketing approval for the XIENCE PRIME Everolimus Eluting
      Coronary Stent System (XIENCE PRIME EECSS) in China from the China Food and Drug
      Administration (CFDA) on August 10th, 2011.

      This prospective, observational, open-label, multi-center, single-arm, post-approval study is
      designed to evaluate the continued safety and effectiveness of the XIENCE PRIME EECSS in a
      cohort of real-world patients receiving the XIENCE PRIME EECSS during commercial use in
      real-world settings in China.

      This study has no primary outcome measure. All observations are of equal weight.

    <description>Cardiac death is defined as any death in which a cardiac cause cannot be excluded.
(This includes but is not limited to acute myocardial infarction, cardiac perforation/pericardial tamponade, arrhythmia or conduction abnormality, cerebrovascular accident within 30 days of the procedure or cerebrovascular accident suspected of being related to the procedure, death due to complication of the procedure, including bleeding, vascular repair, transfusion reaction, or bypass surgery.)
Myocardial Infarction (MI):
Q wave MI: Development of new, pathological Q wave on the ECG.
Non-Q wave MI: Elevation of Creatine kinase (CK) levels to ≥ two times the upper limit of normal (ULN) with elevated CK-MB in the absence of new pathological Q waves.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>A total of 2140 patients were registered from 35 centres in China. First patients was enrolled on July 12, 2013 &amp; enrollment was completed on Sep11, 2014 through the Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) excluding those without consent and those without stent implants &amp; duplicate entries. Thus the analysis population includes 2002 participants .</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Of the 2140 registered subjects,138 subjects withdrew from the study due to incomplete consent forms, no implanted study stents and repeated entry in voice interactive selection system. Among the final analysis population (n=2002), a total of 151 subjects failed to complete the follow-up period.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Cardiac death is defined as any death in which a cardiac cause cannot be excluded.
(This includes but is not limited to acute myocardial infarction, cardiac perforation/pericardial tamponade, arrhythmia or conduction abnormality, cerebrovascular accident within 30 days of the procedure or cerebrovascular accident suspected of being related to the procedure, death due to complication of the procedure, including bleeding, vascular repair, transfusion reaction, or bypass surgery.)
Myocardial Infarction (MI):
Q wave MI: Development of new, pathological Q wave on the ECG.
Non-Q wave MI: Elevation of Creatine kinase (CK) levels to ≥ two times the upper limit of normal (ULN) with elevated CK-MB in the absence of new pathological Q waves.
This study has no primary or secondary endpoints, all endpoints are of equal weight.</description>

        <description>Cardiac death is defined as any death in which a cardiac cause cannot be excluded.
(This includes but is not limited to acute myocardial infarction, cardiac perforation/pericardial tamponade, arrhythmia or conduction abnormality, cerebrovascular accident within 30 days of the procedure or cerebrovascular accident suspected of being related to the procedure, death due to complication of the procedure, including bleeding, vascular repair, transfusion reaction, or bypass surgery.)
Myocardial Infarction (MI): Patient diagnosed with myocardial infarction, but its relation with target vessel not clear, therefore considered target vessel myocardial infarction.
Q wave MI: Development of new, pathological Q wave on the ECG.
