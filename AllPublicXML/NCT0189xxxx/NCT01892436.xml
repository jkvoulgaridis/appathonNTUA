  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed as a 3-year extension to the phase III core study CAIN457F2306. It
      aimed to provide continuous treatment with secukinumab in pre-filled syringes (PFS) for
      subjects who completed the core study CAIN457F2306, to obtain further long term efficacy,
      safety and tolerability information in subjects with active psoriatic arthritis receiving
      secukinumab every 4 weeks. At Week 104 of the study CAIN457F2306, eligible subjects completed
      the assessments associated with the core study visit and subsequently continued in this
      extension study on the same dose that they were receiving during the core study. The regular
      assessments of disease activity ensure that subjects who are experienced worsening of disease
      in any of the treatment groups could exit the study upon their own wish or based on the
      advice of the investigator at any time.

    <time_frame>weeks 116, 128, 140, 156, 180, 208, 232 and 260</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in DAS28 (utilizing hsCRP) from baseline up to Month 60. The DAS28 is a measure of disease activity in PsA based on Swollen and Tender Joint Counts (out of a total of 28), hsCRP and the Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity. A DAS28 score greater than 5.1 implies active disease, equal to or less than 3.2 low disease activity, and less than 2.6 remission. This measure represents change in scores - not the actual scores.
DAS28 is a combined measure of disease activity based on the following formula:
DAS28-CRP = 0.56*TJC28^0.5 + 0.28*SJC28^0.5 + 0.36*ln(CRP+1) + 0.014*PGA + 0.96 The greater the score is, the more the disease activity exists. Remission is defined as DAS28-CRP &lt; 2.6 Low disease activity is defined as DAS28-CRP &lt; 3.2 The minimum value can be 0.96 (not applicable in our study due to the inclusion/exclusion criteria regarding tender, swollen joints). There is no maximum expected value for this score</description>

    <description>Secukinumab is a human monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibodies are proteins that recognize and bind to unique proteins that your body produces. Secukinumab binds and reduces the activity of a cytokine (a &quot;messenger&quot; protein in the body) called Interleukin 17 (IL-17).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI)</title>
        <description>Changes from baseline in score of the disability assessment component of the HAQ (Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index). The HAQ-DI, assesses a subject's level of functional ability and includes questions of fine movements of the upper extremity, locomotor activities of the lower extremity, and activities that involve both upper and lower extremities.
Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI) ranges from 0 (no disability) to 3 (very severe disability)</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Disease Activity Score-CRP (DAS28)</title>
        <description>Changes in DAS28 (utilizing hsCRP) from baseline up to Month 60. The DAS28 is a measure of disease activity in PsA based on Swollen and Tender Joint Counts (out of a total of 28), hsCRP and the Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity. A DAS28 score greater than 5.1 implies active disease, equal to or less than 3.2 low disease activity, and less than 2.6 remission. This measure represents change in scores - not the actual scores.
DAS28 is a combined measure of disease activity based on the following formula:
DAS28-CRP = 0.56*TJC28^0.5 + 0.28*SJC28^0.5 + 0.36*ln(CRP+1) + 0.014*PGA + 0.96 The greater the score is, the more the disease activity exists. Remission is defined as DAS28-CRP &lt; 2.6 Low disease activity is defined as DAS28-CRP &lt; 3.2 The minimum value can be 0.96 (not applicable in our study due to the inclusion/exclusion criteria regarding tender, swollen joints). There is no maximum expected value for this score</description>

        <description>Percentage of subjects achieving disease remission (DAS28&lt;2.6). The DAS28 is a measure of disease activity in PsA based on Swollen and Tender Joint Counts (out of a total of 28), hsCRP and the Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity. A DAS28 score greater than 5.1 implies active disease, equal to or less than 3.2 low disease activity, and less than 2.6 remission</description>
