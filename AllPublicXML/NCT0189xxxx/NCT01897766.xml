      The objective of this surveillance is to collect Safety and Effectiveness information for
      Long term Use of Somatropin for Patients with a Small for Gestational Age (SGA).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All the patients whom an investigator prescribes Genotropin should be registered
      consecutively until the number of subjects reaches target number in order to extract patients
      enrolled into the investigation at random.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 11.58 years</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse drug reaction (ADR) was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to Genotropin in a participant who received Genotropin. A serious ADR (SADR) was an ADR resulting in any of the following out comes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Relatedness to Genotropin was assessed by the physician.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Year 1</time_frame>
    <description>Change in height Velocity SD score from baseline was calculated. Height Velocity SD score = (Height - Standard height for chronological age of gender) / SD. An SD score indicates how far a participant's score deviates from the mean of the reference population; an SD score higher than the mean gives a positive SD score whereas an SD score lower than the mean gives a negative SD score. SD score indicates how similar participant was to reference population.</description>

        <description>Change in height Velocity SD score from baseline was calculated. Height Velocity SD score = (Height - Standard height for chronological age of gender) / SD. An SD score indicates how far a participant's score deviates from the mean of the reference population; an SD score higher than the mean gives a positive SD score whereas an SD score lower than the mean gives a negative SD score. SD score indicates how similar participant was to reference population.</description>

        <title>Change in Height Standard Deviation (SD) Score for Chronological Age From Baseline at Year 5</title>
        <description>Change in height SD score from baseline was calculated. Height SD score = (Height - Standard height for chronological age of gender) / SD. An SD score indicates how far a participant's score deviates from the mean of the reference population; an SD score higher than the mean gives a positive SD score whereas an SD score lower than the mean gives a negative SD score. SD score indicates how similar participant was to reference population.</description>

SD score indicates how similar participant was to reference population. Near final height was defined as the height at one of the following conditions: the annual height velocity became less than 2 cm/year after reaching the maximum height in puberty, bone age reached 17 years old and older for male and 15 years old and older for female, or the reason for discontinuation was that subject reached the near final height or had epiphyseal closure.</description>

        <title>Change in Height Standard Deviation (SD) Score at Puberty and at Near Final Height in Participants Who Reached Near Final Height From Baseline</title>
        <description>Change in height SD score from baseline was calculated. Height SD score = (Height - Standard height for chronological age of gender) / SD. An SD score indicates how far a participant's score deviates from the mean of the reference population; an SD score higher than the mean gives a positive SD score whereas an SD score lower than the mean gives a negative SD score. SD score indicates how similar participant was to reference population. Near final height was defined as the height at one of the following conditions: the annual height velocity became less than 2 cm/year after reaching the maximum height in puberty, bone age reached 17 years old and older for male and 15 years old and older for female, or the reason for discontinuation was that subject reached the near final height or had epiphyseal closure.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, At Puberty, At Near Final Height within the span of approximately maximum of 11.58 years</time_frame>
        <population>The efficacy analysis set comprised of participants in the safety analysis set who had effectiveness evaluation at least once. Among the efficacy analysis set, the participants who reached near final height was analyzed.</population>
