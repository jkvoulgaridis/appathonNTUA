  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objectives of this large phase IIb/III paediatric study are to assess the efficacy
      and safety of dabigatran etexilate relative to standard of care and to document the
      appropriateness of the proposed dabigatran etexilate dosing algorithm for use in patients
      from birth to less than 18 years of age.

    <description>The primary endpoint was the combined endpoint of the proportions of patients with:
Complete thrombus resolution
Freedom from recurrent VTE
Freedom from mortality related to VTE. The events outlined in the above combined primary endpoint were assessed by radiologists or other such qualified clinicians using an appropriate method such as ultrasound, echocardiography, venography, or CT scan, based on the location of the thrombus and the test used to perform the baseline assessment.
The primary efficacy endpoint contained 3 components. Each component was evaluated separately, and only if the criteria for all 3 components were satisfied, the primary endpoint was considered achieved.</description>

    <time_frame>From first administration of trial medication until last administration of trial medication +6 days (residual effect period). Up to 97 days.</time_frame>
    <description>Freedom from major bleeding events (MBEs), defined as either fatal bleeding, clinically overt bleeding associated with a decrease in haemoglobin of at least 20 g/L in a 24-hour period, bleeding that is retroperitoneal, pulmonary, intracranial or otherwise involves the central nervous system, or bleeding that requires intervention in an operating suite.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>All Bleeding Events</measure>
    <time_frame>From first administration of trial medication until last adminstration of trial medication +6 days (residual effect period). Up to 97 days.</time_frame>
    <description>The number of participants with bleeding events includes major bleeding events (MBEs), clinically relevant non-major (CRNM) bleeding, minor bleeding events, any bleeding events, and the numbers of the combined endpoint of major and CRNM bleeding events was presented, based on adjudication-confirmed data.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>All-cause Mortality</measure>
    <time_frame>From first administration of trial medication until last administration of trial medication +6 days (residual effect period). Up to 97 days.</time_frame>

    <measure>All Components of the Primary Efficacy Endpoint</measure>
    <time_frame>From the time of randomisation until Week 12, 84 days after randomisation including a visit window of 7 days.</time_frame>
    <description>Patients with VTE-related death occurring between randomisation to Day 84 + 7 days were considered as not meeting the endpoint. The presence of recurrent VTE(s) was examined throughout the trial, and only the date of first occurrence was used for analysis. Assessment of index VTE status (best overall response) was scheduled on Day 84 ± 7 days (Visit 8) for patients who were alive without an early consent withdraw. In the case a Patient discontinued trial medication prematurely due to any reason the index VTE assessment took place at the early end of treatment visit.</description>

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Conditions associated with an increased risk of bleeding

          -  Renal dysfunction (eGFR &lt; 50 mL/min/1.73m^2 using the Schwartz formula) or requirement

             repeat of the baseline imaging tests required to confirm thrombus resolution at study
             day 84 (or eEOT, whichever comes first) or in whom repeating such imaging tests at
             these pre-specified time points may not be medically in the patient's best interest.
             Examples may include unwarranted radiation exposure as a result of a repeat CT scan at
             day 84 for a patient with an isolated case of pulmonary embolism evaluated at baseline
             solely by a CT scan. In such cases, the baseline radiological assessment (e.g. CT) may
             be supplemented with an acceptable non-radiological assessment at baseline (e.g. MRI)
             which could then be repeated at day 84 hence alleviating any potential unwarranted
             radiation exposure.
