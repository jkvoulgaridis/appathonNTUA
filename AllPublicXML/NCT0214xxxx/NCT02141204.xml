  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the immunogenicity, reactogenicity and safety of GSK
      Biologicals' HRV liquid vaccine compared to GSK Biologicals' HRV lyophilized vaccine when
      administered as a two-dose primary vaccination in healthy infants aged 6-10 weeks at dose
      one, with no previous history of rotavirus illness or vaccination.

      While the lyophilized formulation of the HRV vaccine was licensed in India in February 2008,
      this study is conducted to generate additional clinical data for the liquid formulation of
      the HRV vaccine in India, as recommended by New Drug Advisory Committee on Vaccines
      (NDAC-Vaccines) of Drug Controller General of India (DCGI).

    <description>An unsolicited AE is defined as any AE reported in addition to those solicited during the clinical study and any 'solicited' AE with onset outside the specified period of follow-up for solicited AE.
Any = occurrence of AE regardless of intensity grade or relation to vaccination.</description>

          -  A male or female between, and including, 6 and 10 weeks of age at the time of the
             first vaccination.

          -  Healthy subjects as established by medical history and clinical examination before
             entering into the study.

          -  Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days in total) of immunosuppressants
             or other immune-modifying drugs since birth. For corticosteroids, this will mean
