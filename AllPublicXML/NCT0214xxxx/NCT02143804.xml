  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an expanded access protocol to study the safety and efficacy of CG0070 in Cis and Cis
      with Ta and/or T1 disease patients who failed both BCG therapy and the BOND protocol (NCT
      01438112), or in high grade Ta and T1 patients who failed BCG therapy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The plan is to study the safety and efficacy of CG0070 in high-grade NMIBC patients who
      failed BCG therapy. Most patients with NMIBCis (Cis, Cis with Ta and/or T1, high grade Ta or
      T1 with frequent or uncontrolled recurrences) who have failed BCG intravesical therapy
      (standard of care) usually have no other choice but to proceed to cystectomy. Cystectomy is a
      surgery associated with major morbidity, mortality and quality of life issues. Morbidity and
      long term tedious medical care will be for the rest of the patient's life span. Most patients
      at this stage do not show signs of disease progression into the muscle layer or of
      metastasis, making surgery a very difficult decision. CG0070, if successful in this trial,
      will serve to provide a therapeutic alternative for this patient population in need. For the
      present study, Cis or Cis with Ta and/or T1 patients can only be enrolled if they have failed
      the BOND study and are medically unfit for surgery. Furthermore, patients with high grade Ta
      or T1 disease who have failed both BCG and chemotherapy treatments are also prone to disease
      progression. Since these patients are not eligible to be enrolled in the BOND trial, the
      present study will serve as an alternative to access CG0070 experimental treatment.

                       intravesical BCG therapy must include at least six weekly treatments
                       (allowable range of instillations per course is 4-9) within a six-month

                  of the informed consent, whereby there is a clear explanation by the investigator
                  to the subject that a delay of cystectomy may increase his/her chance of disease
                  progression, the results of which may lead to serious and life threatening
                  consequences.

               -  Patients must be able to enter into the study within five weeks of their most
                  recent diagnostic procedure, which is usually a diagnostic biopsy, a

               -  Any underlying medical condition that, in the Investigator's opinion, will make
                  the administration of study vector hazardous to the patient, would obscure the

                  1 day) of a glucocorticoid is acceptable to prevent a reaction to the IV contrast
                  used for CT scans.

                  squamous cell skin cancers must have been adequately treated and the subject must
                  be disease-free at the time of registration. Subjects with a history of stage I
                  or II cancer, must have been adequately treated and have been disease-free for ≥
                  3 years at the time of registration.

               -  Progressive viral or bacterial infection

                  o All infections must be resolved and the patient must remain afebrile for seven
