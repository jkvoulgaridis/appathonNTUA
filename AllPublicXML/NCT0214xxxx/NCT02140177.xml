      Background:

      - Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death for U.S. adults. Medically ill people are at an
      increased risk of suicide. Most people who have killed themselves went to a healthcare
      provider within 3 months of their death. More and more, hospitals are being asked to assess
      people for signs of suicide risk so that they can get the help they need. If nurses and
      doctors can find out who is at risk they can make sure these people get help in the hospital.

      The asQ em (Ask Suicide-Screening Questions to Everyone in Medical Settings) is a brief
      questionnaire. It was created to detect suicidal thoughts and behaviors in hospitalized
      people. Researchers would like to further develop this tool and figure out which are the best
      questions to ask patients.

      Objective:

      - To determine the best questions for healthcare providers to ask people with medical
      illnesses to see if they are having suicidal thoughts or planning to hurt themselves.

      Eligibility:

      - NIH Clinical Center patients over age 18.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be asked questions about how they have been feeling in the past few
           weeks. They will be asked questions about depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts and
           behaviors. They also will be asked some background questions.

        -  It will take approximately 15 to 30 minutes to answer the questions.

      In 2010, the Joint Commission (JC) issued a Sentinel Event Alert highlighting the need to
      detect suicide risk in all non-behavioral patients in medical settings. Detecting suicide
      risk among medical patients is important because this population is at elevated risk for
      suicidal thoughts and behaviors, and because for many of these patients, a medical visit is
      their only portal into mental health services. Of note, the vast majority of people who die
      by suicide visit a medical setting, such as an inpatient oncology unit, more frequently than
      a psychiatric setting in the months leading up to their death. Thus, the inpatient medical
      setting is an important stakeholder in decreasing suicide-related morbidity and mortality.
      Physicians and nurses working in non-mental health settings require tools to guide them in
      recognizing patients at risk. Nonetheless, there are currently no suicide screening
      instruments designed specifically for assessing suicide risk in an adult inpatient medical
      population.

      In 2012, our study team conducted a Quality Improvement Project (QIP) at the National
      Institutes of Health Clinical Center (NIH CC) which demonstrated that the asQ em (Ask
      Suicide-Screening Questions to Everyone in Medical Settings), a brief instrument piloted to
      detect suicidal thoughts and behaviors among adult medical inpatients, was both feasible to
      administer and acceptable to both patients and staff. Extending this work, the aim of this
      current study is to further develop and psychometrically validate the asQ em among adult
      medical inpatients. While most inpatients will not be at imminent risk for suicide, we
      hypothesize that the asQ em will identify a number of patients who screen positive for
      suicide risk on a longer gold standard instrument, and that they are thus not only at risk
      for suicidal behavior in the future, but are also experiencing significant emotional distress
      and therefore warrant further mental health evaluation and recommendations for follow-up
      treatment.

      This study will be a prospective, cross-sectional multisite study with patients enrolled from
      the NIH CC, Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Rhode Island Hospital, and John
      Peter SmithHospital. The total planned sample size will be 810 (180 from WRNMMC, 180 from
      RIH, 200 from JPS, and 250 from NIH CC). We will administer several short measures of suicide
      risk: the 20 asQ em candidate items; a criterion standard Adult Suicidal Ideation
      Questionnaire (ASIQ); two questions which assess for suicidal behavior from a second
      criterion standard, the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSI); a brief depression screen, the
      Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9); and an exploratory variable questionnaire, to all
      eligible inpatients aged 18 years and older. The ultimate goal of this project is the
      development of a validated risk of suicide screening instrument that can be administered
      rapidly by non-mental health clinicians to medical inpatients and in turn, connecting those
      in need with mental health services. Additionally, we hope to pilot the Suicide Implicit
      Association Test (S-IAT) in a subsample of recruited patients. The S-IAT is a brief computer
      task which measures a person s implicit association between self and either life or death .
      We expect to demonstrate that the S-IAT is feasible to administer in the inpatient medical
      setting thereby providing a potential alternative to self-report questionnaires for assessing
      patients thoughts about death or suicide.

      Future studies will focus on examining the practical implications of nurses administering the
      asQ em as standard of care during the admission process on a medical inpatient unit and
      validating the asQ em in non-English speaking patients, addressing a critical gap in suicide
      prevention research. In addition, examining the long-term clinical impact of screening
      general medical patients for suicide risk with the asQ em and linking those in need with
      mental health services and/or other interventions will be important next steps.

        This is a prospective, cross-sectional multisite study. We will enroll adult patients, ages
        18 years and older, admitted to identified inpatient medical units during designated data
        collections days. Patients will be recruited at the NIH CC as well as Walter Reed National
        Military Medical Center (WRNMMC), Rhode Island Hospital (RIH), and John Peter Smith
        Hospital (JPS).

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        All adult medical inpatients, ages 18 and older, who are admitted to selected medical units
        during data collection weeks will be approached for enrollment. Patients will be included
        if:

          1. they are admitted as an inpatient on the designated medical units;

          2. they are 18 and older;

          3. they are capable of providing consent;

        5) they have not previously been enrolled in this study.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients will be excluded if:

          1. they are medically or cognitively unable to participate in the screening or assessment
             (e.g., sustained altered level of consciousness, psychosis, hostile behavior,
             unremitting distress, intubation, persistent vomiting, severe pain, acute or worsening
             medical acuity);

          2. they have been already enrolled during a previous visit;

          3. they are unwilling to provide consent;

          4. the patient is non-English speaking (because ASIQ has not been validated in languages
             other than English).
