  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study of children and young adults ages 6-20 years with type 1
      diabetes and age- and race-matched controls. The investigators will be examining blood and
      urine hormone levels as well as measures of bone density including DXA and high-resolution
      peripheral quantitiative computed tomography. The investigators will also be collecting data
      regarding physical activity via use of wearable accelerometers. The investigators hypothesize
      that youth with type 1 diabetes will have slower bone accrual and impaired bone
      microarchitectural integrity compared with non-diabetic controls, and that bones of
      individuals with type 1 diabetes will not respond as well to physical activity. The
      investigators hypothesize that poor bone accrual will be associated with sub-optimal glucose
      control as well as lower levels of insulin-like growth factor 1.

    <description>Bone mineral mass and density will be measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at baseline and 12 months. Percent change over time will be calculated and then compared in subjects with type 1 diabetes and matched control subjects.</description>

    <measure>Cross-sectional comparison of bone microarchitectural parameters in patients with diabetes vs. controls</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Bone microarchitecture will be assessed by high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT). Parameters measured will include cortical compartment density, cortical thickness, cortical porosity, trabecular density, trabecular number, and trabecular thickness.</description>

    <description>Bone microarchitecture will be assessed by high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) at 0 and 12 months. Parameters measured will include cortical compartment density, cortical thickness, cortical porosity, trabecular density, trabecular number, and trabecular thickness and percent change over 12 months will be calculated. Percent change will be compared in patients with diabetes and matched controls.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Association of glycemic control with bone mineral accrual</measure>
    <time_frame>0 and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Glycemic control will be assessed by hemoglobin A1c measurements at study visits and as part of routine diabetes care. An average hemoglobin A1c over the time of observation will be calculated using the trapezoidal rule. Association of glycemic control with bone mineral accrual as measured by DXA will be examined via regression analysis.</description>

    <measure>Association of bone mineral accrual with moderate-to-vigorous physical activity</measure>
    <time_frame>0 and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>activity will be assessed with accelerometers. The association of bone accrual among youth with and without diabetes will be assessed by correlation analysis.</description>
