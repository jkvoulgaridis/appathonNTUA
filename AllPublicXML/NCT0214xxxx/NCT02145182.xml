    <measure>Percentage Of Participants With Delayed Graft Function (DGF) In The First Seven Days Post-transplant</measure>
    <time_frame>First 7 days post transplantation</time_frame>
    <description>Results are reported for the DGF composite endpoint, defined as the occurrence of DGF (dialysis for any reason in the first 7 days post transplantation), graft loss, death, or loss to follow-up (including discontinuation) in the first 7 days post transplantation and for each item of the composite endpoint. Loss to follow-up included withdrawal due to any reason other than death. The sum of the counts in the events that make up the DGF composite may be greater than the composite count, because a participant who experienced multiple events was only counted once in the composite.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage Of Participants With DGF, Functional DGF, And Immediate Graft Function</measure>
    <time_frame>First 7 days post transplantation</time_frame>
    <description>DGF was defined as a requirement for dialysis for any reason in the first 7 days post transplantation; functional DGF was defined as no need for dialysis during the first 7 days post transplantation and either (1) a &lt;70% reduction in serum creatinine during the first 7 days post transplantation, or (2) failure of serum creatinine to decrease by at least 10% daily on 3 consecutive days, both measured during the first 7 days post transplantation. Blood and urine samples were collected, but because the study failed to demonstrate a treatment effect and the program subsequently lost funding, the collected data from the samples could not be analyzed to generate summary level data. As such, the data set for this secondary outcome measure cannot be summarized.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage Of Participants Who Required Dialysis Post Transplantation</measure>
    <time_frame>First 30 days post transplantation</time_frame>
    <description>The need for dialysis was assessed by evaluation of renal function; this included urine volume, blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and, starting on Day 2, the creatinine reduction ratio. Blood and urine samples were collected, but because the study failed to demonstrate a treatment effect and the program subsequently lost funding, the collected data from the samples could not be analyzed to generate summary level data. As such, the data set for this secondary outcome measure cannot be summarized.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 28 post transplantation</time_frame>
    <description>The eGFR was calculated by using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease 7 equation at Day 28 post transplantation. The equation requires serum creatinine, age, ethnicity, gender, blood urea nitrogen, and albumin. The eGFR was calculated retrospectively from participant demographics and laboratory chemistries and is reported in mL/min/square meter (m^2).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage Of Participants With Rejection-free Graft Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 26 and 52 post transplantation</time_frame>
    <description>Graft survival was defined as not having biopsy-proven acute rejection per Banff criteria, graft loss, or participant death. Participants who did not experience graft loss or death were censored at 365 days or the day they withdrew, whichever came first. There were no time-specific protocol mandated biopsies. Kidney biopsy would have been performed for cause at the discretion of the Investigator to assess poor graft function and would have been obtained prior to initiating treatment of suspected allograft rejection. Only summaries of Kaplan-Meier estimates of graft survival at Week 26 (Month 6) and Week 52 (Month 12) are reported.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Fifty-nine centers in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United States of America participated in this study. The study recruited participants who had been receiving dialysis for a median of approximately 50 months before undergoing transplantation and received a kidney from a deceased donor.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Written consent was provided prior to study-required assessments (N=333). Participants who passed screening (N=314) were vaccinated against Neisseria meningitidis. A total of 314 were randomized; of these, 286 underwent transplantation and received eculizumab or placebo. Two participants received placebo but withdrew prior to transplantation.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Eculizumab</title>
          <description>Participants received 2 doses of eculizumab: the first dose was just prior to reperfusion of the allograft and the second dose was within 18 to 24 hours (h) of completion of administration of the first dose. Each dose of eculizumab was administered by intravenous (IV) infusion over 25 to 45 minutes (min). The first dose was 1200 milligrams (mg) in 240 milliliters (mL) (5 mg/mL); the second dose was 900 mg in 180 mL (5 mg/mL).</description>

Each dose of placebo was administered by IV infusion over 25 to 45 min. The first dose was 240 mL of 0.9% NaCl; the second dose was 180 mL of 0.9% NaCl.</description>

        <description>Results are reported for the DGF composite endpoint, defined as the occurrence of DGF (dialysis for any reason in the first 7 days post transplantation), graft loss, death, or loss to follow-up (including discontinuation) in the first 7 days post transplantation and for each item of the composite endpoint. Loss to follow-up included withdrawal due to any reason other than death. The sum of the counts in the events that make up the DGF composite may be greater than the composite count, because a participant who experienced multiple events was only counted once in the composite.</description>

        <description>DGF was defined as a requirement for dialysis for any reason in the first 7 days post transplantation; functional DGF was defined as no need for dialysis during the first 7 days post transplantation and either (1) a &lt;70% reduction in serum creatinine during the first 7 days post transplantation, or (2) failure of serum creatinine to decrease by at least 10% daily on 3 consecutive days, both measured during the first 7 days post transplantation. Blood and urine samples were collected, but because the study failed to demonstrate a treatment effect and the program subsequently lost funding, the collected data from the samples could not be analyzed to generate summary level data. As such, the data set for this secondary outcome measure cannot be summarized.</description>

        <title>Percentage Of Participants With Rejection-free Graft Survival</title>
        <description>Graft survival was defined as not having biopsy-proven acute rejection per Banff criteria, graft loss, or participant death. Participants who did not experience graft loss or death were censored at 365 days or the day they withdrew, whichever came first. There were no time-specific protocol mandated biopsies. Kidney biopsy would have been performed for cause at the discretion of the Investigator to assess poor graft function and would have been obtained prior to initiating treatment of suspected allograft rejection. Only summaries of Kaplan-Meier estimates of graft survival at Week 26 (Month 6) and Week 52 (Month 12) are reported.</description>
