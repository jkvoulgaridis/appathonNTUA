      The purpose of this study is to test the antidepressant effects of Ezogabine in major
      depressive disorder (MDD). The investigators also aim to determine the safety and
      tolerability Ezogabine in patients with MDD. The investigators hypothesize that depressive
      symptoms will be significantly decreased following an 8-week treatment period of the
      medication compared to baseline.

      Study Introduction:

      Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a global health disease associated with significant
      morbidity and costs. Many anti-depressants exist within the monoaminergic system yet novel
      therapeutics are still needed outside of this system. Ezogabine, currently approved by the
      FDA for adjunctive treatment of partial-onset seizures, may serve as a potential key agent
      for those with MDD. Ezogabine is known to bind to and activate KCNQ transmembrane K+ ion
      channels, specifically targeting KCNQ2 in the VTA. Such membrane activity has been show to
      play a role in previous studies involving a social defeat model of depression. Specifically,
      data has shown that KCNQ channels were upregulated only in resilient mice and moreover,
      ezogabine was able to potentiate KCNQ channel activity to result in a fast reversal of the
      depressed phenotype.

      General Investigational Plan:

      Objectives:

      A. Primary Efficacy Objective: To test the antidepressant effects of Ezogabine in MDD.

      B. Primary Safety Objective: To characterize the safety and tolerability of Ezogabine in
      patients with MDD.

      C. Secondary Objectives: To measure the effects of Ezogabine on ventral tegmental area
      (VTA)-striatal reward circuitry in MDD using reward task-based functional MRI. Rationale:
      Ezogabine is hypothesized to modulate the firing rate of VTA dopamine (DA) neurons and
      thereby influence the functioning of the mesolimbic reward system.

      Hypotheses

      A. Efficacy Hypothesis:

      Hypothesis 1a: Depressive symptoms will be significantly decreased following an 8-week
      treatment period compared to baseline, as measured by change in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression
      Rating Scale (MADRS).

      Hypothesis 1b: The antidepressant response rate at study end (defined as 50% in depressive
      symptoms compared to baseline) will exceed 50%, consistent with known response rates of
      current antidepressant agents.

      B. Safety Hypothesis: Ezogabine will be safe and adverse event rates will be similar to rates
      observed in other adult populations. Specific safety items to be monitored include frequency
      and intensity of adverse events as measured by the Patient Rated Inventory of Side Effects
      (PRISE) and treatment-emergent suicidal ideation or behavior as measured by the
      Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS).

    <description>The Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (29) is a 10-item instrument used for the evaluation of depressive symptoms in adults and for the assessment of any changes to those symptoms. Each of the 10 items is rated on a scale of 0 to 6, with differing descriptors for each item. These individual item scores are added together to form a total score, which can range between 0 and 60 points. The MADRS is specifically designed to detect changes in depression severity in the context of a medication treatment trial.</description>

    <description>Functional MRI of reward processing: The primary neuroimaging endpoint is the degree of change observed in the reward system in the brain. Although it was an outcome measure, the data format is a set of 4-dimensional statistical maps and not reported in raw data. Mean changes in activation of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) or ventral striatum (VS) in response to reward cue to reward receipt, and VTA mean change in beta weight in response to reward cue at 8 weeks as compared to baseline. The Z-score indicates the number of standard deviations away from a reference population in the same age range. A Z-score of 0 is equal to the mean. Negative numbers indicate values lower than the mean and positive numbers indicate values higher than the mean.</description>

TEPS-CON full scale is from 9-54. Lower scores indicate greater levels of anhedonia.</description>

          <description>The Clinical Global Impression – Severity scale (CGI-S) is a 7-point scale that requires the clinician to rate the severity of the patient's illness at the time of assessment, relative to the clinician's past experience with patients who have the same diagnosis. Considering total clinical experience, a patient is assessed on severity of mental illness at the time of rating 1, normal, not at all ill; 2, borderline mentally ill; 3, mildly ill; 4, moderately ill; 5, markedly ill; 6, severely ill; or 7, extremely ill.</description>

        <description>The Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (29) is a 10-item instrument used for the evaluation of depressive symptoms in adults and for the assessment of any changes to those symptoms. Each of the 10 items is rated on a scale of 0 to 6, with differing descriptors for each item. These individual item scores are added together to form a total score, which can range between 0 and 60 points. The MADRS is specifically designed to detect changes in depression severity in the context of a medication treatment trial.</description>

        <description>Functional MRI of reward processing: The primary neuroimaging endpoint is the degree of change observed in the reward system in the brain. Although it was an outcome measure, the data format is a set of 4-dimensional statistical maps and not reported in raw data. Mean changes in activation of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) or ventral striatum (VS) in response to reward cue to reward receipt, and VTA mean change in beta weight in response to reward cue at 8 weeks as compared to baseline. The Z-score indicates the number of standard deviations away from a reference population in the same age range. A Z-score of 0 is equal to the mean. Negative numbers indicate values lower than the mean and positive numbers indicate values higher than the mean.</description>
