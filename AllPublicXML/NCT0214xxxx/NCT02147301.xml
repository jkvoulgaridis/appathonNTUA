  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TACE is frequently offered to patients with baseline hepatic dysfunction with the purpose of
      diminishing hepatic tumor burden while patients await transplantation. Without this
      therapeutic measure, disease may progress beyond UNOS T2 criteria required for organ
      allocation.

      The purpose of the study is to determine whether transarterial chemoembolization using
      doxorubicin-eluting beads (DEB-TACE) can be used safely and effectively to treat patients
      with liver-only hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and baseline hepatic dysfunction.

    <description>Best observed radiographic response rate to Doxorubicin Eluting Bead Transarterial Chemoembolization (DEB-TACE) by modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST) was defined as number of patients who had CR, PR, or SD as their best observed response divided by total number of patients with at least one available CT or MRI. Definition of mRECIST for Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC). Complete response (CR) = Disappearance of any intratumoral arterial enhancement in all target lesions. Partial response (PR)=At least a 30% decrease in sum of diameters of viable (enhancement in arterial phase) target lesions, taking as reference baseline sum of diameters of target lesions. Stable disease (SD)=Any cases that do not qualify for either partial response or progressive disease. Progressive disease (PD)=An increase of at least 20% in the sum of the diameters of viable (enhancing) target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of the diameters of viable (enh</description>

        <description>Best observed radiographic response rate to Doxorubicin Eluting Bead Transarterial Chemoembolization (DEB-TACE) by modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST) was defined as number of patients who had CR, PR, or SD as their best observed response divided by total number of patients with at least one available CT or MRI. Definition of mRECIST for Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC). Complete response (CR) = Disappearance of any intratumoral arterial enhancement in all target lesions. Partial response (PR)=At least a 30% decrease in sum of diameters of viable (enhancement in arterial phase) target lesions, taking as reference baseline sum of diameters of target lesions. Stable disease (SD)=Any cases that do not qualify for either partial response or progressive disease. Progressive disease (PD)=An increase of at least 20% in the sum of the diameters of viable (enhancing) target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of the diameters of viable (enh</description>

Doxorubicin-loaded LC Beads® are administered via a co-axially placed commercially available hepatic artery catheter into hepatic arteries targeted for treatment. Procedure is performed under direct fluoroscopic visualization until stasis of arterial flow is achieved or until a total of 4 ml of microspheres have been administered, whichever occurs first
