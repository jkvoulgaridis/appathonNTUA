  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the public health importance of clinical depression, more than 50% of depressed
      adults receive inadequate or no treatment, with even higher rates of under-treatment in men
      and minorities. Family members and/or friends often assist older adults in their health care
      and may help overcome barriers to formal care, yet there is a lack of primary care-based
      interventions that mobilize family members and friends to improve depression treatment. In
      partnership with a community-based clinic, this research will address this scientific gap by
      developing and then testing the feasibility and acceptability of a family-based intervention
      that can be delivered pragmatically in a primary care setting serving large numbers of older
      minorities.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The family-based intervention will be tested in a 6 month randomized controlled trial of 24
      depressed older men-family member dyads (18 intervention and 6 controls). The purpose of the
      RCT is to test the acceptability of the intervention, as well as the feasibility of the study
      methods. Patients from the RCT will be identified from a family practice clinic based on
      their scores on the PHQ-9 as well as additional inclusion and exclusion criteria. Once they
      and their family member have agreed to participate, patients will be randomized either to the
      family based intervention or a usual care control condition augmented by family
      psychoeducation. The investigators will recruit English and Spanish speaking age 60 and above
      older men from SJGH who have 1) significant depressive symptoms (i.e. PHQ &gt; 15, 2) have at
      least one criteria A symptom (depressed mood or anhedonia), 3) depression-related functional
      impairment) and 4) an adult family member willing to participate in the study. We have chosen
      a higher cut-off to minimize false positives. We will exclude psychotic, demented or
      institutionalized men. After enrollment, 24 dyads (i.e. older man and family member) will be
      randomized one of two groups: intervention or usual care augmented by written
      psychoeducational materials on depression. Dyads will be randomized to achieve a 2:1 ratio of
      intervention versus usual care dyads (i.e. 18 intervention and 6 control dyads). To ensure
      adequate numbers of ethnic minority patients in each arm of the trial, we will conduct a
      stratified randomization such that each arm of the RCT is 50% English language preferring and
      50% Spanish language preferring (i.e. 3 in control and 9 in intervention arm). The research
      assistant will conduct subject assessment at baseline, 1-month, 3-months and 6 months.

Family-based depression intervention: The primary focus of our approach is on effectively engaging family members of depressed older men in the care of the patient. The interventionist (social worker) will 1) work jointly with a family member and older men to strengthen depression self-management and participation during primary care visits and 2) conduct a brief training module for primary care provider skills to strengthen their skills in working with family members.</description>
