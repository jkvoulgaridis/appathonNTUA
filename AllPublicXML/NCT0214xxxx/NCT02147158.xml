    <time_frame>Last 35 consecutive days on treatment in the 12-Week Treatment Course 1</time_frame>
    <description>Participants recorded bleeding in a daily diary. Absence of bleeding was defined as no bleeding days (i.e., no entries for bleeding or heavy bleeding; however, spotting was allowed), during the last 35 consecutive days on treatment in Treatment Course 1.</description>

    <measure>Time to Absence of Bleeding on Treatment During Treatment Course 1</measure>
    <time_frame>From first dose up to the end of the 12-Week Treatment Course 1</time_frame>
    <description>Time to absence of bleeding was defined as the duration in days from first dose to the first day in the time interval in which absence of bleeding occurs and persists through the last dose in the first treatment course. The persistence of absence of bleeding occurred for a minimum of 35 consecutive days counting backward from the last dose in Treatment Course 1.</description>

    <description>Time to absence of bleeding is defined as the duration in days from first dose in treatment course 2 to the first day in the time interval in which absence of bleeding occurs and persists through the last dose in the second treatment course.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Uterine Fibroid Symptom and Health-Related Quality of Life Questionnaire (UFS-QOL) Revised Activities Subscale Score at the End of Treatment Course 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1-4) to End of 12-Week Treatment Course 1</time_frame>
    <description>The UFS-QOL is a uterine fibroid-specific questionnaire consisting of 37 questions developed to evaluate symptoms of uterine fibroids and their impact on health-related quality of life in women with leiomyomas. The first 8 questions comprise the Symptom Severity subscale to assess symptoms experienced by women with uterine leiomyomas, the remaining 29 questions comprise 6 subscales (Concern, Activities, Energy/mood, Control, Self-consciousness, Sexual Function) which overall deal with women's feelings and experiences regarding impact of uterine leiomyoma symptoms on her life. Each item is scored between 1 and 5, where 1=none of the time or not at all and 5=all of the time or a very great deal. A Revised Activities subscale was created to include the most relevant items pertaining to physical and social activities with a total possible score of 0 to 100. Higher Revised Activities subscale scores indicate less impact on activities. A positive change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Uterine Fibroid Symptom and Health-Related Quality of Life Questionnaire (UFS-QOL) Revised Activities Subscale Score at the End of Treatment Course 1</title>
        <description>The UFS-QOL is a uterine fibroid-specific questionnaire consisting of 37 questions developed to evaluate symptoms of uterine fibroids and their impact on health-related quality of life in women with leiomyomas. The first 8 questions comprise the Symptom Severity subscale to assess symptoms experienced by women with uterine leiomyomas, the remaining 29 questions comprise 6 subscales (Concern, Activities, Energy/mood, Control, Self-consciousness, Sexual Function) which overall deal with women's feelings and experiences regarding impact of uterine leiomyoma symptoms on her life. Each item is scored between 1 and 5, where 1=none of the time or not at all and 5=all of the time or a very great deal. A Revised Activities subscale was created to include the most relevant items pertaining to physical and social activities with a total possible score of 0 to 100. Higher Revised Activities subscale scores indicate less impact on activities. A positive change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>
