  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      External Genital Warts (EGW) are the most common sexually transmitted disease associated with
      more than 30 types of the Human Papillomavirus (HPV). Cryotherapy is an effective method of
      EGW treatment. However, multiple sessions may be required with reported clearance rates
      ranging between 27-88%. Sinecatechins 15% ointment is Food and Drug Administration approved
      for three times daily application in immunocompetent subjects 18 years and older for the
      treatment of EGW and perianal warts. Treatment of EGW with cryotherapy followed by
      sinecatechins appears to be logical. Cryotherapy has direct cytodestructive effects with
      immediate short-term efficacy on treated EGW, while sinecatechins provide field therapy,
      treating both clinical and sub-clinical lesions. For this study, the investigators used
      sinecatechins 15% ointment twice daily regimen and anticipated that the synergistic effect
      with cryotherapy will provide better efficacy that cryotherapy alone. The investigators also
      anticipated that the sequential therapy with be safe.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 42 subjects received standardized cryotherapy to all lesions, using two cycles of
      five seconds each, separated by a five second interval rest (Week 0/Baseline). One week
      following cryotherapy, subjects were randomized 1:1 to either additional treatment with
      sinecatechins 15% ointment twice daily or no additional treatment. Those subjects randomized
      to additional treatment received sinecatechins 15% ointment BID for up to sixteen weeks, or
      until complete clearance of all EGW, whichever occurred first. Additionally, subjects were
      advised to maintain safe sexual practices and have all recent sexual partners examined for
      EGW. Subjects were followed every 8 weeks for a total of 16 weeks (Table 1). EGW lesion
      counts were conducted at all study visits by the same qualified blinded evaluator.
      Additionally, at each visit local skin reactions, change in concomitant medications, and
      adverse events were assessed. Any subjects who received sinecatechins 15% ointment and
      discontinued prematurely were asked to return for an End of Study Visit. Females of
      childbearing potential underwent a urine pregnant test at all visits during study treatment
      period. Subjects that met complete responder criteria as above, were additionally followed
      and assessed at Visit5/Week 41 and Visit 6/Week 65 to assess for wart recurrence.

      <desc>There were no serious adverse events related to the study medication reported during the study. All subjects experienced mild to moderate local site reactions (eg, any symptom of erythema, edema, scaling, crusting, and erosion which were not collected separately) that were related to both cryotherapy and/or sinecatechins ointment. There were no subject discontinuations or dose interruptions.</desc>
