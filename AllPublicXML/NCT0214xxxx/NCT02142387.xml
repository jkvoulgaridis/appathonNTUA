  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite aggressive cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training, the outcome of cardiac
      arrest is not good. The problem is method of education. So, the investigators want to add the
      dispatcher-assisted CPR simulation into conventional CPR training. In this study, the study
      is aimed to investigate the effect of newer CPR training program.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The training program focuses on working in team with dispatcher, performing all steps from
      recognizing cardiac arrest to performing CPR, together with the dispatcher. The one hours
      training session is split into four parts:

        1. Video self-instruction manikin practice (30 min), including a brief introduction to
           automated external defibrillator (AED).

        2. Practice in pairs (15 min). Practicing the dispatcher and rescuer role in a simulation
           to enhance learning.

        3. Debriefing. Questions, answers and reflection (15 min).

        4. Homework. Leaflet with tasks like learn how to activate the speaker function on your own
           phone.

      The main difference between dispatcher-assisted basic life support (DA-BLS) and traditional
      BLS training is that DA-BLS provides the scenes and interactive experiences on calling
      emergency medical service (EMS) and receiving CPR instruction via telephone speaker function,
      following up the skill training by scenario simulation training.

    <description>A one-hour training course that includes a 30-minute video-based self-instruction (VSI) training session, a short role-play, and a debriefing. The video consists of a bystander CPR simulation with dispatcher instructions using the trainee's own phone and practice session following demonstration by a simulated layperson. After watching the video clip, all trainees are divided into two groups and conduct a role-play as dispatchers and laypersons for 15 minutes. Finally, there is a 15-minute debriefing session with several assignments. The HEROS program focuses on cooperation with a dispatcher, from recognition of cardiac arrest to performing DA-CPR, with hands-on practice so that laypersons can provide bystander CPR immediately in a real situation. Moreover, the HEROS program emphasizes practice for providing the correct address of the scene and switching to speakerphone mode, especially for the elderly.</description>

          <description>A 30-minute video-based self-instruction (VSI) training session, a short role-play, and a debriefing. The video consists of a bystander CPR simulation with dispatcher instructions using the trainee’s own phone and practice session following demonstration by a simulated layperson. After watching the video clip, all trainees are divided into two groups and conduct a role-play as dispatchers and laypersons for 15 minutes. Finally, there is a 15-minute debriefing session with several assignments. The HEROS program focuses on cooperation with a dispatcher, from recognition of cardiac arrest to performing DA-CPR, with hands-on practice so that laypersons can provide bystander CPR immediately in a real situation. Moreover, the HEROS program emphasizes practice for providing the correct address of the scene and switching to speakerphone mode, especially for the elderly.</description>

          <title>Current BLS Training Program</title>
          <description>A one-hour training program that was developed by the Korea CDC and it was based on the AHA BLS provider course (http://www.cdc.go.kr/board.es?mid=a20503050000&amp;bid=0021&amp;tag=&amp;act=view&amp;list_no=127655). The program consists of a 30-minute VSI, and a 30-minute practice debriefing session. It focuses on detailed techniques for performing high-quality chest compressions including the correct hands and body position of the bystanders.</description>
