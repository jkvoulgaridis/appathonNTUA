    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to test the effectiveness and safety of the medicine Ameluz®
      (5-aminolevulinic acid) in comparison to methyl-aminolevulinate (MAL), used with photodynamic
      therapy (PDT), to treat thin, non-aggressive BCC (basal cell carcinoma).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The treatment comprises of up to 2 PDT cycles, each with two PDT sessions one week apart.

      If 12 weeks after the the second PDT all lesions are completely cleared the patient will
      enter the follow-up phase. In case of remaining lesions the patient will receive a second PDT
      cycle starting on the same day.

Please note that the high SD for BF-200 ALA is due to a patient who had increased lesion area fom 63 mm² at baseline to 225 mm² 12 weeks after PDT. This lesion area included a lesion that was later confirmed to be benign skin condition (lentigo solaris).</description>

    <description>Overall cosmetic outcome 12 weeks after last PDT is calculated as difference between 12 weeks after PDT sum score and baseline sum score of all skin quality assessments.

Skin surface
Hyperpigmentation
Hypopigmentation
Mottled or irregular pigmentation
Degree of scarring
Atrophy
Cosmetic outcome categories are:
Very good: 12 weeks sum score improved by at least 2 points compared to baseline
Good: 12 weeks sum score improved by 1 point compared to baseline
Satisfactory: 12 weeks sum score identical to the one at baseline
Unsatisfactory: 12 weeks sum score worsened by 1 point compared to baseline

      <pre_assignment_details>Of the 394 patients screened in this study, 281 patients were randomized (138 patients to BF-200 ALA and 143 patients to methyl-aminolevulinate) and treated. 113 patients were excluded before randomization due to screening failure (104 patients), patient’s decision (7 patients), and lost to FU and “other reason” (each 1 patient).</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Topical application of BF-200 ALA gel (78 mg/g 5-aminolevulinic acid). The dose of BF-200 ALA was up to 1 g per PDT session (depending on size and number of target lesions located on neck, trunk, extremities, face or scalp, no more than 2 illumination areas with a maximum area incl. margin of 10cm², and a film thickness of about 1mm). Up to 4 administrations of study treatment (i.e. PDT sessions: drug application and subsequent illumination with BF-RhodoLED after 3h of drug incubation) were applied. For all patients, PDT-1 was to be administered directly after randomization and PDT-2 was to be administered approximately 1 week later. The total number of PDT sessions per patient depended on response as follows: Complete responders (all lesions totally cleared clinically) 12 weeks after PDT-2: entered the FU part with no further treatment. Partial or non-responders 12 weeks after PDT-2 were retreated with by applying 2 additional PDTs in a second PDT cycle and then entered FU.</description>

          <description>Topical application of BF-200 ALA gel (78 mg/g 5-aminolevulinic acid). The dose of BF-200 ALA was up to 1 g per PDT session (depending on size and number of target lesions located on neck, trunk, extremities, face or scalp, no more than 2 illumination areas with a maximum area incl. margin of 10cm², and a film thickness of about 1mm). Up to 4 administrations of study treatment (i.e. PDT sessions: drug application and subsequent illumination with BF-RhodoLED after 3h of drug incubation) were applied. For all patients, PDT-1 was to be administered directly after randomization and PDT-2 was to be administered approximately 1 week later. The total number of PDT sessions per patient depended on response as follows: Complete responders (lesions totally cleared clinically) 12 weeks after PDT-2: entered the FU part with no further treatment. Partial or non-responders 12 weeks after PDT-2 were retreated with by applying 2 additional PDTs in a second PDT cycle and then entered FU.</description>

Please note that the high SD for BF-200 ALA is due to a patient who had increased lesion area fom 63 mm² at baseline to 225 mm² 12 weeks after PDT. This lesion area included a lesion that was later confirmed to be benign skin condition (lentigo solaris).</description>

The dose of MAL was up to 1 g per PDT session (depending on size and number of target lesions located on neck, trunk, extremities, face or scalp, no more than 2 illumination areas with a maximum area incl. margin of 10cm², and a film thickness of about 1mm). Up to 4 administrations of study treatment (i.e. PDT sessions: drug application and subsequent illumination with BF-RhodoLED after 3h of drug incubation) were applied. For all patients, PDT-1 was to be administered directly after randomization and PDT-2 was to be administered approximately 1 week later. The total number of PDT sessions per patient depended on response as follows: Complete responders (lesions totally cleared clinically) 12 weeks after PDT-2: entered the FU part with no further treatment. Partial or non-responders 12 weeks after PDT-2 were retreated by applying 2 additional PDTs in a second PDT cycle and then entered FU.</description>

          <title>Reduction of Lesion Area 12 Weeks After the Last PDT Compared to Baseline</title>
          <description>Reduction of total lesion area (summation of sizes of all treated lesions) per patient, assessed 12 weeks after the last PDT. The PP set is the primary analysis set for the analysis of the secondary endpoint.
Please note that the high SD for BF-200 ALA is due to a patient who had increased lesion area fom 63 mm² at baseline to 225 mm² 12 weeks after PDT. This lesion area included a lesion that was later confirmed to be benign skin condition (lentigo solaris).</description>

        <description>Overall cosmetic outcome 12 weeks after last PDT is calculated as difference between 12 weeks after PDT sum score and baseline sum score of all skin quality assessments.

Skin surface
Hyperpigmentation
Hypopigmentation
Mottled or irregular pigmentation
Degree of scarring
Atrophy
Cosmetic outcome categories are:

      <time_frame>Each subject was assessed for a maximum of approximately 6 months after randomization depending on whether they received a second PDT cycle or not. Complete responders after the first PDT cycle were assessed for approximately 3 months after randomization. Additionally, there was a pre-randomization period of max. 2 weeks per patient.</time_frame>

          <title>BF-200 ALA</title>
          <description>Topical application of BF-200 ALA gel (78 mg/g 5-aminolevulinic acid). The dose of BF-200 ALA was up to 1 g per PDT session (depending on size and number of target lesions located on neck, trunk, extremities, face or scalp, no more than 2 illumination areas with a maximum area incl. margin of 10cm², and a film thickness of about 1mm). Up to 4 administrations of study treatment (i.e. PDT sessions: drug application and subsequent illumination with BF-RhodoLED after 3h of drug incubation) were applied. For all patients, PDT-1 was to be administered directly after randomization and PDT-2 was to be administered approximately 1 week later. The total number of PDT sessions per patient depended on response as follows: Complete responders (lesions totally cleared clinically) 12 weeks after PDT-2: entered the FU part with no further treatment. Partial or non-responders 12 weeks after PDT-2 were retreated with by applying 2 additional PDTs in a second PDT cycle and then entered FU.</description>
