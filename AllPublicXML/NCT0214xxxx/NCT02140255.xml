    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the effects of early intensive antiretroviral therapy
      (ART) on achieving HIV remission (HIV RNA below the limit of detection of the assay) among
      HIV-infected infants.

      The study will enroll two cohorts. Cohort 1 will include infants at high risk for in utero
      HIV infection. Cohort 2 will include in utero HIV-infected, ART-started infants.

      Three early intensive therapy regimens will be assessed. Regimen 1L will include 2 nucleoside
      reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) plus nevirapine (NVP) plus lopinavir/ritonavir
      (LPV/r). Regimen 2R will include 2 NRTIs plus NVP plus raltegravir (RAL). Regimen 2RV will
      include 2 NRTIs plus NVP plus RAL plus VRC01 monoclonal antibody.

      The study will be conducted in four steps. In Step 1, Cohort 1 infants will be enrolled for
      evaluation of HIV infection and initiation of early intensive therapy within 48 hours of
      birth. Infants in whom in utero HIV infection is excluded will switch from the study regimen
      to standard perinatal prophylaxis per local guidelines within two weeks; these infants will
      continue in Step 1 safety monitoring for two additional weeks, undergo final HIV testing at
      approximately 12 weeks of age, and then exit the study. Infants in whom in utero HIV
      infection is confirmed will enter Step 2 at least two weeks after enrollment in Step 1.

      In Step 2, Cohort 1 infants identified with in utero HIV infection and Cohort 2 infants will
      receive the study regimen for up to 288 weeks. Beginning at Step 2 Week 84, children who
      achieved HIV RNA suppression by Week 24, and maintained suppression thereafter, with no HIV
      RNA detected at or after Week 48, will be evaluated for possible treatment cessation.

      In Step 3, children in Step 2 who meet criteria for treatment cessation will stop ART, and be
      closely monitored for viral rebound for up to five years.

      In Step 4, children who experience viral rebound in Step 3 or meet other Step 4 inclusion
      criteria will re-initiate ART, and be closely monitored for viral re-suppression on ART until
      five years of age or six months after re-suppression, whichever is later.

      HIV-uninfected infants will be followed for 12 weeks. HIV-infected infants will be followed
      for up to 288 weeks in Step 2 (on ART); those entering Step 3 will be followed for primary
      endpoint ascertainment at 48 weeks and for up to a total of five years (off ART) in this
      step.

                       for NVP to not be taken on up to three of the first five days of life)

        Infant Inclusion Criteria, Step 3, Treatment Cessation

          -  Note: The criteria in this section may be modified in response to expert panel review.

          -  Must have been enrolled in Step 2.

          -  Must have reached Step 2 Week 96.

          -  Must have the following based on testing at the local CLIA-certified (US sites) or
             VQA-certified (non-US sites) laboratory:

               -  No confirmed plasma HIV RNA greater than or equal to 200 copies/mL at Step 2 Week
                  24 and up to but excluding Step 2 Week 48 (see the study protocol for procedural
                  guidance related to this criterion) AND

               -  No plasma HIV RNA detected at Step 2 Week 48 and thereafter

                    -  Note: Sample dilution for HIV RNA assays should not occur at or after Step 2
                       Week 24. In the event that an adequate sample volume cannot be collected at
                       a given study visit, the infant should return to the clinic on a different
                       day within the allowable visit window for a repeat specimen collection
                       attempt. If the repeat attempt is unsuccessful, or if for any reason sample
                       dilution is unavoidable, the infant may be considered for entry into Step 3
                       as long as dilution occurs only once at or after Step 2 Week 24 and the HIV
                       RNA assays immediately preceding and immediately following the diluted assay
                       are not performed with a diluted sample and provide results that otherwise
                       meet criteria for entry into Step 3.

          -  If breastfed, must have permanently ceased breastfeeding, with no exposure to breast
             milk for at least six weeks prior to specimen collection for the testing specified in
             criterion below.

          -  Must have met ALL of the following additional criteria while in Step 2, obtained at
             greater than or equal to Step 2 Week 84 and less than or equal to Step 2 Week 288:

               -  Two consecutive negative HIV antibody tests by fourth generation enzyme-linked
                  immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (performed in the study's designated central
                  laboratory) at least 8 weeks apart

               -  Two consecutive HIV DNA tests with no DNA detected in at least 850,000 PBMCs
                  assayed (performed in the study's designated central laboratory) at least 8 weeks
                  apart

                    -  Note: One million PBMCs should ideally be assayed; to accommodate variable
                       specimen volumes and cell counts, however, a minimum of 850,000 PBMCs
                       assayed is acceptable.

               -  No plasma HIV RNA detected at the time of the second consecutive negative HIV DNA
                  test (based on testing performed in the study's designated VQA-certified central
                  laboratory)

               -  CD4 cell percentage greater than or equal to 25 AND CD4 cell absolute count
                  greater than or equal to the lower limit of normal for age (i.e., 1000 cells/mL
                  if 2-3 years of age, greater than or equal to 750 cells/mL if 3-4 years of age)

               -  Infant assessed by the site investigator or designee as expected to comply with
                  the Step 3 Schedule of Evaluations

             with specimen collection for the assay within 14 days prior to Step 3 Entry.

        Infant Inclusion Criteria, Step 4, Treatment Re-Initiation

                  sites) laboratory after ART cessation (see the study protocol for procedural
                  guidance related to this criterion).

               -  Confirmed CD4 cell percentage less than 25% or CD4 cell absolute count less than
                  the lower limit of normal for age

               -  Confirmed or suspected diagnosis of acute retroviral syndrome

               -  Otherwise assessed by the site investigator or designee, in consultation with the
                  Clinical Management Committee (CMC), as having an indication to re-initiate
