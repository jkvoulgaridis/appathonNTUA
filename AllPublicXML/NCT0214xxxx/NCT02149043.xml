  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ulcerative colitis represents a chronic condition occurring in relapsing and remitting
      fashion with uncertain outcome and requires lifelong treatment with considerable side
      effects. Diagnostic methods currently in use, clinical (endoscopy), imaging (CT, MR) or
      laboratory (C - reactive protein, fecal calprotectin) give an insight into disease activity
      but are possibly associated with significant discomfort for the patient and / or increased
      risk of irradiation and potential allergic reactions on contrast agents. For that reason
      there is a need for a noninvasive, biologically inert method for evaluation of disease
      activity in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Thermography possesses most of these
      characteristics. The aim of this study is to find potential link between pathological
      thermographic signs and endoscopic findings, serum C reactive protein (CRP) and calprotectin
      in the stool of patients with active and extensive ulcerative colitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypothesis: Documenting pathological thermographic signs in patients with extensive
      ulcerative colitis investigators will demonstrate pathological thermography criteria that
      correlate with standard inflammatory markers such as Mayo endoscopic subscore (ESS), CRP and
      calprotectin in patients with ulcerative colitis.

      Aims: The aim of this study is to record abdominal thermographic images of patients with
      active ulcerative colitis (UC), to create interpretational thermographic criteria for these
      images and to compare them to abdominal infrared (IR) images of healthy volunteers.
      Furthermore, investigators intend to correlate these criteria with standard markers of
      inflammation such as CRP and calprotectin in patients with UC at the beginning of treatment
      and at the end.

      Materials and methods: For the purpose of this work, 36 patients with extensive UC and 30
      healthy individuals will be put throe thermographic imagining, have their stool tested for
      calprotectin and their blood for CRP. In addition, patients with UC will receive colonoscopy
      evaluations.

      Expected scientific contribution: The results of this paper would give an additional
      contribution to existing tools for pursuing ulcerative colitis activity thus demonstrating
      the potential of thermography as a complementary method to standard methods in assessing
      disease activity. Establishing diagnostic criteria for this method would be a good addition
      to present clinical practice.

    <measure>Change in abdominal surface temperatures in ulcerative colitis patients at 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Six months</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be treated with mesalamin, corticosteroids or biologic therapy according to disease status during 6 months. Abdominal temperatures (maximal, minimum and average temperatures measured in Celsius) recorded by a thermographic camera will be acquired at enrollment and after 6 months of therapy.</description>

    <measure>Correlation of abdominal surface temperature values with clinical markers of inflammation in ulcerative colitis.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Maximal, minimal and average abdominal surface temperatures expressed in Celsius will be correlated to the Disease Activity Index (Mayo score). The Index assesses stool frequency (0-3 points, according to severity) rectal bleeding (0-3 points, according to severity), mucosal appearance at endoscopy (0-3 points, according to severity) and physician rating of disease activity (0-3 points, according to severity). All of the points make up a total sum to produce a score ranging from 0 to 12 points (no activity, to most severe activity). All correlations will be performed before and after 6 months of therapy.</description>

    <description>Maximal, minimal and average abdominal surface temperatures expressed in Celsius will be correlated to endoscopic parameters expressed as Mayo endoscopic subscore on a scale 0 - 3. [0 - normal or inactive disease; 1 - mild disease (erythema, decreased vascular pattern, mild friability); 2 - moderate disease (marked erythema, absent vascular pattern, friability, erosions); 3 - severe disease (spontaneous bleeding, ulceration)].
All correlations will be performed before and after 6 months of therapy.</description>
