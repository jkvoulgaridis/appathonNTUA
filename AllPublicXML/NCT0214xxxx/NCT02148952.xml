    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure the impact of a checklist-based childbirth safety
      program (the WHO Safe Childbirth Checklist Program) on reduction of severe maternal, fetal,
      and newborn harm in institutional deliveries in north India.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The WHO Safe Childbirth Checklist Program is a quality improvement program designed to
      support health workers to deliver evidence-based practices to women and newborns around the
      time of institutional childbirths. At the program's core is the Safe Childbirth Checklist, a
      31-item list of essential practices that target the major causes of maternal and newborn
      mortality in low-resource settings globally. The program was developed over 3 years by a
      partnership of WHO and HSPH, working with a large international network of experts and
      stakeholders in maternal, fetal, and newborn health. Pilot testing of the program at a
      public-sector birth center in south India demonstrated dramatic improvements in health worker
      adherence to essential childbirth-related clinical care standards. The current study is a
      matched-pair, cluster randomized trial to measure the efficacy of the program in reducing
      severe maternal and newborn harm. This trial will be conducted at approximately 120 health
      facilities in Uttar Pradesh, India.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  For measuring outcomes, inclusion criteria are all mothers admitted to a study site
             for childbirth and newborn babies who are to be followed-up. In case a mother or baby
             from an enrolled site is referred out to another facility (before or after delivery)
             the mother-baby dyad will be included in the study and the outcome will be allocated
             to the referring facility

          -  For a smaller subset of birth events (approximately 4,650 deliveries total), health
             worker practices will be observed to measure the impact of the SCC program on delivery
             of essential practices, as a secondary outcome. A convenience sample of women who
             agree to observation and their babies cared for by the health workers around the time
             of childbirth at the facility during data collectors' duty hours will be included in
             this component of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Mothers who have been referred into the facility by an inter-facility transfer.

          -  Mothers being managed for abortion.

          -  Mothers who refuse consent for follow-up

      <population>The baseline analysis population may refer to number of women, number of newborns, or number of facilities, depending on the measure. We obtained facility consent to collect baseline information for a total of 161,107 women who were eligible for inclusion. A total of 157,687 women consented to participate in follow-up.</population>

Intervention Health Facilities received the WHO Safe Childbirth Checklist Program.
WHO Safe Childbirth Checklist Program: The IHF group will receive the WHO Safe Childbirth Checklist Program designed to maximize likelihood of effective and sustained uptake of the program by birth attendants in the designated facilities. The program includes three key implementation steps that involve: engagement of leadership and clinicians at the state, district, and local levels, a formal launch to introduce the Checklist, and support through peer coaching and data feedback. The intervention facilities will also receive a standardized maternity register to ensure appropriate data collection.</description>

WHO Safe Childbirth Checklist Program: The IHF group will receive the WHO Safe Childbirth Checklist Program designed to maximize likelihood of effective and sustained uptake of the program by birth attendants in the designated facilities. The program includes three key implementation steps that involve: engagement of leadership and clinicians at the state, district, and local levels, a formal launch to introduce the Checklist, and support through peer coaching and data feedback.

Intervention Health Facilities received the WHO Safe Childbirth Checklist Program.
WHO Safe Childbirth Checklist Program: The IHF group will receive the WHO Safe Childbirth Checklist Program designed to maximize likelihood of effective and sustained uptake of the program by birth attendants in the designated facilities. The program includes three key implementation steps that involve: engagement of leadership and clinicians at the state, district, and local levels, a formal launch to introduce the Checklist, and support through peer coaching and data feedback. The intervention facilities will also receive a standardized maternity register to ensure appropriate data collection.</description>

Intervention Health Facilities received the WHO Safe Childbirth Checklist Program.
WHO Safe Childbirth Checklist Program: The IHF group will receive the WHO Safe Childbirth Checklist Program designed to maximize likelihood of effective and sustained uptake of the program by birth attendants in the designated facilities. The program includes three key implementation steps that involve: engagement of leadership and clinicians at the state, district, and local levels, a formal launch to introduce the Checklist, and support through peer coaching and data feedback. The intervention facilities will also receive a standardized maternity register to ensure appropriate data collection.</description>

Intervention Health Facilities received the WHO Safe Childbirth Checklist Program.
WHO Safe Childbirth Checklist Program: The IHF group will receive the WHO Safe Childbirth Checklist Program designed to maximize likelihood of effective and sustained uptake of the program by birth attendants in the designated facilities. The program includes three key implementation steps that involve: engagement of leadership and clinicians at the state, district, and local levels, a formal launch to introduce the Checklist, and support through peer coaching and data feedback. The intervention facilities will also receive a standardized maternity register to ensure appropriate data collection.</description>

Intervention Health Facilities received the WHO Safe Childbirth Checklist Program.
WHO Safe Childbirth Checklist Program: The IHF group will receive the WHO Safe Childbirth Checklist Program designed to maximize likelihood of effective and sustained uptake of the program by birth attendants in the designated facilities. The program includes three key implementation steps that involve: engagement of leadership and clinicians at the state, district, and local levels, a formal launch to introduce the Checklist, and support through peer coaching and data feedback. The intervention facilities will also receive a standardized maternity register to ensure appropriate data collection.</description>

      <desc>Maternal &amp; neonatal mortality were measured as outcomes, not as adverse events. No adverse events such as death or morbidity were linked to direct effect of the trial. Our adverse events included loss of a consent form or a breach of PHI.
While our outcomes denominators reflect either the woman/newborn dyad or women only, this denominator includes all individual mothers plus all individual newborns enrolled in the trial, in order to obtain an all cause mortality count.</desc>

          <description>Women/newborn dyads at intervention facilities who registered for labor and delivery, eligible for inclusion, and who provided consent.
Intervention Health Facilities received the WHO Safe Childbirth Checklist Program.
WHO Safe Childbirth Checklist Program: The IHF group will receive the WHO Safe Childbirth Checklist Program designed to maximize likelihood of effective and sustained uptake of the program by birth attendants in the designated facilities. The program includes three key implementation steps that involve: engagement of leadership and clinicians at the state, district, and local levels, a formal launch to introduce the Checklist, and support through peer coaching and data feedback. The intervention facilities will also receive a standardized maternity register to ensure appropriate data collection.</description>
