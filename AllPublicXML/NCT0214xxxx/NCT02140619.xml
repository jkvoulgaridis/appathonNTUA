      The study aimed to demonstrate the relationship between secondary prevention medication
      persistence and clinical prognosis of ischemic stroke patients at 3,6,12 months

      The study is a prospective, multicenter, hospital-based study on secondary prevention for
      patients with ischemic cerebrovascular diseases between May 2014 and June 2015. Physicians
      from 24 hospitals in Beijing underwent a standard secondary prevention training of ischemic
      cerebrovascular diseases by professional training, instruction manuals, stratification
      management software. In order to improve the persistence of taking preventive secondary
      medicine, IS patients from these 24 hospitals received healthy education through manuals and
      Digital Video Disc about health education during hospitalization and acquired secondary
      preventive knowledge of ischemic cerebrovascular diseases through regular health education
      messages during 6 months after discharge. Patients with IS from other 6 hospitals were used
      as a control, and no such intervention was given to them.

      Telephone follow-up was performed at 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year after the onset of
      cerebral infarction, during which the use of antiplatelet and statins drugs and recurrence of
      IS were recorded. Patients who took antiplatelet drugs or statins at three follow-ups were
      regarded as persistent antiplatelet drugs or statins taking within one year after the onset
      of the disease. The main prognostic indicator was the recurrence of IS and persistence of
      antiplatelet and statins medication within 1 year, and the main purpose was to explore the
      impact of persistent statins and antiplatelet medication use on IS recurrence.

    <description>Medication persistence at 3 months. Persistence is defined as continuing a therapy or class of therapy from discharge to the 3 months follow-up. Subjects prescribed an individual medication at discharge but who were not taking that medication at follow up were defined as &quot;nonpersistent&quot;. Persistence for the specified medication classes (antiplatelet, statins) was defined in the same way; however, subjects were considered persistent if there was a switch to another medication within the same class.</description>
