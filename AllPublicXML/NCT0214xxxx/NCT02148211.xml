  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pregnancy registry study is to detect and describe abnormal pregnancy
      outcomes in women intentionally or unintentionally vaccinated with any of GlaxoSmithKline
      (GSK) Biologicals' seasonal Inactivated Influenza Vaccines (sIIVs): Fluarix, FluLaval,
      Fluarix Quadrivalent and FluLaval Quadrivalent.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a transition of existing ongoing pregnancy registries for Fluarix/
      FluLaval/Fluarix Quadrivalent/ FluLaval Quadrivalent into one post-authorization safety study
      (PASS).

      Pregnancy outcome data will be collected using questionnaires within 2 months of the
      estimated date of delivery (EDD) and approximately 6 months and 12 months after the EDD (for
      all live births) to ascertain the presence of birth defects not diagnosed before, from Q2
      2014 to Q2 2019.

      The intent of the Registry is to prospectively collect data such as vaccination with GSK
      sIIVs during pregnancy or within 28 days preceding conception, potential confounding factors
      (such as exposure to other medications) and information related to the outcome of the
      pregnancy.

    <measure>Number of Subjects Reported With Exposure and Outcomes, Stratified by Trimester of Exposure, in Pregnant Women Intentionally or Unintentionally Vaccinated With FluLaval During Pregnancy or Within 28 Days Preceding Conception</measure>
    <time_frame>Data collected for a minimum of 5 years starting from June 1, 2014 till May 31, 2019: for each subject, data was collected within 2 months of estimated date of delivery (EDD) and follow-up 6 and 12 months after EDD (for all live births)</time_frame>
    <description>Exposures and outcomes were stratified by trimester of exposure: first (1st), second (2nd), third (3rd) and unknown trimester (Tr?) multiple exposures during a pregnancy were classified by the earliest trimester of exposure. The estimated gestational age at the time of vaccination was calculated based on the date of the last menstrual period. The 2nd trimester was considered to begin at week 14 and the 3rd trimester begun at week 28. The presence or absence of birth defects or other abnormalities was evaluated within each of the preceding outcome categories. Ongoing = subject still pregnant at the time of last contact. Note: The remaining pregnancies were ongoing at the time of last contact by the study staff. No further information on the outcome of these pregnancies was available as of 1st April 2020. Unknown = unknown outcome at the time of last contact.</description>

    <description>Exposure and outcomes were stratified by trimester of exposure: 1st, 2nd, 3rd and Tr?; multiple exposures during a pregnancy were classified by the earliest trimester of exposure. The estimated gestational age at the time of vaccination was calculated as described in the first outcome. Results were presented for the following categories: Ongoing, Live infants without congenital anomalies (Live infants without CA.); Spontaneous abortions with no apparent congenital anomalies (Sp. abortions with no ACA); Spontaneous abortions with congenital anomalies (Sp. abortions with CA). One subject had FluLaval Quadrivalent and Fluarix Quadrivalent listed as vaccine used. Therefore, same case was included in the respective table of each product in &quot;Live infants without CA, 3rd Tr.&quot; category. Note: The remaining pregnancies were ongoing at the time of last contact by the study staff. No further information on the outcome of these pregnancies was available as of 1st April 2020.</description>

        <title>Number of Subjects Reported With Exposure and Outcomes, Stratified by Trimester of Exposure, in Pregnant Women Intentionally or Unintentionally Vaccinated With FluLaval During Pregnancy or Within 28 Days Preceding Conception</title>
        <description>Exposures and outcomes were stratified by trimester of exposure: first (1st), second (2nd), third (3rd) and unknown trimester (Tr?) multiple exposures during a pregnancy were classified by the earliest trimester of exposure. The estimated gestational age at the time of vaccination was calculated based on the date of the last menstrual period. The 2nd trimester was considered to begin at week 14 and the 3rd trimester begun at week 28. The presence or absence of birth defects or other abnormalities was evaluated within each of the preceding outcome categories. Ongoing = subject still pregnant at the time of last contact. Note: The remaining pregnancies were ongoing at the time of last contact by the study staff. No further information on the outcome of these pregnancies was available as of 1st April 2020. Unknown = unknown outcome at the time of last contact.</description>

One subject had FluLaval Quadrivalent and Fluarix Quadrivalent listed as vaccine used. Therefore, same case was included in the respective table of each product in &quot;Live infants without CA, 3rd Tr.&quot; category.

The estimated gestational age at the time of vaccination was calculated as described in the first outcome. Results were presented for the following categories: Ongoing, Live infants without CA; Live infants with CA; Sp. abortions with no ACA; Sp. abortions with CA; Stillbirth with no ACA. Unknown = unknown pregnancy outcome at the time of last contact. One subject had FluLaval Quadrivalent and Fluarix Quadrivalent listed as vaccine used. Therefore, same case was included in the respective table of each product in &quot;Live infants without CA, 3rd Tr.&quot; category. Note: The remaining pregnancies were ongoing at the time of last contact by the study staff. No further information on the outcome of these pregnancies was available as of 1st April 2020.</description>
