      The purpose of the iSPOT Study is to evaluate the contractility using positive left
      ventricular (LV) dP/dt max across LV pacing site(s) in patients indicated for cardiac
      resynchronization therapy (CRT).

    <measure>Percentage Change in Positive Left Ventricular (LV) dP/dt Max (mm HG/Sec) of Multispot LV Pacing Configuration Compared to Normal Biventricular Pacing</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for the time of the EP procedure, which has an average duration of 2 to 3 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Measure the percentage change in positive left ventricular (LV) dP/dt max (mm HG/sec) of multispot LV pacing configuration compared to normal biventricular pacing in patients undergoing a research study, an electrophysiological exploratory procedure or cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) implant. The percentage changes correspond to a percentage change between a pacing configuration (pacing on, e.g., Multispot pacing) and baseline (LV pacing off). There are several repetitions of pacing off and on for each pacing configuration. For one repetition, the percentage change is determined as ([median dP/dt max during pacing On] - (median baseline dP/dt max during pacing Off])/[median dP/dt max during pacing Off]. From all percentage changes for a given pacing configuration and subject, a regression analysis is performed to determine the regression predicted highest percentage change. The presented percentage change is the average over all subjects.</description>

    <measure>Correlation of Blood Pressure, Electrograms (EGMs) and Electrocardiographic Mapping Measurements With the Positive LV dP/dt Max Values</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for the time of the EP procedure, which has an average duration of 2 to 3 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Correlate blood pressure, EGMs and electrocardiographic mapping measurements with the percentage change LV dP/dt max values obtained during each of the three pacing configurations BiV (BiV distal, BiV mid, BiV proximal, BiV anterior, BiV posterior), MultiVein and MultiSpot. Correlation will be summarized over all pacing configurations and time points since the interest is in the overall correlation between LV dP/dt max and other measurements, not in the correlation per pacing configuration or per time point. A linear mixed effects models as described in Roy, Biometrical Journal 48 (2006) 2, 286- 301 was used for the diastolic and systolic blood pressures. Due to the convergence problems for the linear mixed for Q-LV and QRS, the general linear model as described in Blank &amp; Altman, Biometrical Journal 310 (1995), p 446, was used for Q-LV and QRS.</description>

    <measure>Use of Non-invasive Measurements to Identify Pacing Configuration With Highest Positive LV dP/dt Max</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for the time of the EP procedure, which has an average duration of 2 to 3 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluate whether the non-invasive measurements (Nexfin blood pressures) that are also collected during the study can identify the pacing configuration with the highest percentage change LV dP/dt max. For each patient and all time points of data collection, a regression analysis was applied to determine the highest predicted percentage change LV dP/dtmax or percentage change Nexfin pressure per configuration. The Kappa statistic was then determined based on a 7x7 contingency table where the rows and columns corresponded to the pacing configurations. There is no interest in determining the agreement statistics Kappa per time point or per configuration since the interest of this analysis is in the overall agreement between LV dP/dt max and non-invasive measurements.</description>

    <measure>Within Patient Variability in Positive LV dP/dt Max</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for the time of the EP procedure, which has an average duration of 2 to 3 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluate the within patient variability in positive LV dP/dt max measurements. The standard deviation of the percentage change LV dP/dt max between pacing configurations will be evaluated to obtain information for future sample size calculations for the primary outcome.The standard deviation is summarized over all available subjects and could be used as an estimate of within patient variability for future sample size calculations for the primary outcome.</description>

        <title>Percentage Change in Positive Left Ventricular (LV) dP/dt Max (mm HG/Sec) of Multispot LV Pacing Configuration Compared to Normal Biventricular Pacing</title>
        <description>Measure the percentage change in positive left ventricular (LV) dP/dt max (mm HG/sec) of multispot LV pacing configuration compared to normal biventricular pacing in patients undergoing a research study, an electrophysiological exploratory procedure or cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) implant. The percentage changes correspond to a percentage change between a pacing configuration (pacing on, e.g., Multispot pacing) and baseline (LV pacing off). There are several repetitions of pacing off and on for each pacing configuration. For one repetition, the percentage change is determined as ([median dP/dt max during pacing On] - (median baseline dP/dt max during pacing Off])/[median dP/dt max during pacing Off]. From all percentage changes for a given pacing configuration and subject, a regression analysis is performed to determine the regression predicted highest percentage change. The presented percentage change is the average over all subjects.</description>

        <title>Percentage Change in Positive Left Ventricular (LV) dP/dt Max (mm HG/Sec) of Multi-vein LV Pacing Configuration Compared to Multispot LV Pacing Configuration</title>
        <description>Measure the percentage change in positive left ventricular (LV) dP/dt max (mm HG/sec) of multi-vein LV pacing configuration compared to multispot LV pacing in patients undergoing a research study, an electrophysiological exploratory procedure or CRT-implant. The percentage changes correspond to a percentage change between a pacing configuration (pacing on, e.g., Multispot pacing) and baseline (LV pacing off). There are several repetitions of pacing off and on for each pacing configuration. For one repetition, the percentage change is determined as ([median dP/dt max during pacing On] - (median baseline dP/dt max during pacing Off])/[median dP/dt max during pacing Off]. From all percentage changes for a given pacing configuration and subject, a regression analysis is performed to determine the regression predicted highest percentage change. The presented percentage change is the average over all subjects.</description>

        <title>Correlation of Blood Pressure, Electrograms (EGMs) and Electrocardiographic Mapping Measurements With the Positive LV dP/dt Max Values</title>
        <description>Correlate blood pressure, EGMs and electrocardiographic mapping measurements with the percentage change LV dP/dt max values obtained during each of the three pacing configurations BiV (BiV distal, BiV mid, BiV proximal, BiV anterior, BiV posterior), MultiVein and MultiSpot. Correlation will be summarized over all pacing configurations and time points since the interest is in the overall correlation between LV dP/dt max and other measurements, not in the correlation per pacing configuration or per time point. A linear mixed effects models as described in Roy, Biometrical Journal 48 (2006) 2, 286- 301 was used for the diastolic and systolic blood pressures. Due to the convergence problems for the linear mixed for Q-LV and QRS, the general linear model as described in Blank &amp; Altman, Biometrical Journal 310 (1995), p 446, was used for Q-LV and QRS.</description>

        <title>Use of Non-invasive Measurements to Identify Pacing Configuration With Highest Positive LV dP/dt Max</title>
        <description>Evaluate whether the non-invasive measurements (Nexfin blood pressures) that are also collected during the study can identify the pacing configuration with the highest percentage change LV dP/dt max. For each patient and all time points of data collection, a regression analysis was applied to determine the highest predicted percentage change LV dP/dtmax or percentage change Nexfin pressure per configuration. The Kappa statistic was then determined based on a 7x7 contingency table where the rows and columns corresponded to the pacing configurations. There is no interest in determining the agreement statistics Kappa per time point or per configuration since the interest of this analysis is in the overall agreement between LV dP/dt max and non-invasive measurements.</description>
