      The purpose of this study is to achieving a six-month progression free survival (PFS) of
      patients receiving autologous dendritic cell vaccine (ADKV) loaded with allogeneic tumor
      lysate expression of cancer-testis antigens (CTA) in patients with soft tissue sarcomas

      Vaccination is carried out on the planned days ± 3 days

        1. All examinations must be performed before the vaccine is administered.

             -  Full physical examination.

             -  Assessment of vital signs (blood pressure, temperature, heart rate), the general
                condition of the patient and physical activity.

             -  Evaluation of concomitant therapy.

             -  Assessment of vital signs.

             -  Laboratory safety and immunological indicators

             -  Assessment of adverse events, symptoms and syndromes of the disease.

        2. Introduction of CV in accordance with the dose determined for a given vaccination (see
           section 9.2. - procedures for delivery and use)

        3. After administration, patients are observed for at least 1 hour. An assessment of vital
           indicators. Undesirable effects detected at the introduction are recorded.
