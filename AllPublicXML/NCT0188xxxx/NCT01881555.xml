  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this trial is to compare the clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness of 2
      therapeutic strategies, one based on coronary angiography guidance and the other based on
      coronary angiography with fractional flow reserve (FFR) in multivessel coronary artery
      disease patients.

      The trial is a prospective, multicenter, French, randomized clinical trial including men and
      women ≥ 18 years presenting with significant multivessel disease defined by coronary
      angiography as coronary narrowing &gt; 50% diameter stenosis in at least 2 major epicardic
      vessels. The patients who give their informed consent will be randomly assigned to a
      therapeutic strategy based upon coronary angiography or angiography with FFR testing. In the
      FFR group, a significant coronary stenosis will be defined by a FFR ≤ 0.8. Based upon this
      multivessel evaluation (angiography or FFR), the investigator will choose the best
      therapeutic strategy to his discretion (medical optimal treatment, coronary stenting,
      coronary artery bypass graft surgery). The aim of revascularization procedures will be to
      obtain complete revascularization. In the FFR group, only stenosis with FFR≤0.8 will be
      treated.

      The primary end point of the trial is a composite of major cardiovascular events including
      death from any cause, myocardial infarction, any hospitalization for coronary
      revascularization performed in addition to initial treatment and stroke at 1 year of
      follow-up.

      Secondary end points will include adverse events, individual major cardiovascular events,
      stent thrombosis, bleeding events, occlusion of coronary artery bypass graft, patient's
      quality of life and cost-effectiveness and 30-day, 6 month, 2-year and 5-year outcomes.

    <description>Patients will have FFR measured in each diseased vessel identified by the coronary angiographic evaluation. Intra-coronary adenosine (at least 100 micrograms performed 2 times) OR intravenous adenosine (at a dose of 140µg/kg/min during at least 4 minutes) will be administered prior to FFR assessment.
Revascularization strategy will be based upon FFR findings and revascularization either by coronary stenting or CABG will only be performed on target lesions with FFR≤0.8.</description>
