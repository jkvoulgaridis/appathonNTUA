      The main objective of the study is to determine the pharmacokinetics profile of Subgam-VF.
      The secondary objectives are to assess the safety of Subgam-VF and refine the dose adjustment
      coefficient for Subgam-VF needed for subjects switching from prior intravenous immunoglobulin
      (IGIV) therapy.

      This will be a Phase III, multicenter, open-label, non-randomized study.

      Following a screening period, eligible subjects will commence weekly Subgam-VF treatment;
      this is a 16% subcutaneous IgG product.

      Subjects will receive Subgam-VF for 26 weeks during which time safety will be assessed.

      After Week 21, PK sampling will commence.

      Follow-up visit (one week after the last Subgam-VF infusion, Week 27). All AEs will be
      monitored up to 28 days after the last Subgam-VF infusion by telephone contact (Week 30).

      Subgam-VF will be administered subcutaneously using infusion pumps.

      Subjects will be given diaries to record adverse event data as well as any infusions
      administered at home. In addition there will be a telephone follow up by an appropriately
      qualified site staff member on day 3 after each site administered and home administered
      infusion to check for any adverse reactions including infusion site reactions and remind
      subjects to document these in their subject study diary.

    <measure>Data (Derived From Absolute Concentration) Were Pooled With Historical Data and a Treatment Variable Defined (Subgam-VF or Gammaplex 5% IGIV). Outcome Measure Defined as Log Transformed sAUC0-t Standardized to One Week.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>Log transformed sAUC0-t, (AUC0-t standardized to one week) were analysed using a multiple linear regression model fitted including treatment, allowing for variability between treatment groups. The mean difference (Subgam-VF or Gammaplex IGIV 5%) between treatments with 90% Confidence Interval (CI) were back transformed to give an estimate of the ratio (Subgam-VF/ Gammaplex 5% IGIV) of sAUC(0-t). Data was collected at the following timepoints after week 21 of the clinical trial over a period of 1 week: Pre-dose on Day 0 and post-dose at days 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7.</description>

    <measure>Dose Refinement in Switching From Gammaplex 5% IGIV to Subgam-VF</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>The initial weekly dose of Subgam-VF administered was calculated by taking the average weekly equivalent of the subject's IGIV dose, divided by the average dosing interval in weeks (i.e. 3 or 4), multiplied by 1.37, a dose adjustment coefficient based on other licensed subcutaneous IgG products. If the subject was already receiving a weekly SCIG IgG there will be no dose adjustment.
A refined dose adjustment was estimated as 1.37/the ratio (Subgam-VF/ Gammaplex 5% IGIV) of geometric means for sAUC0-t and presented with 90% CI.</description>

    <time_frame>30 months</time_frame>
    <description>Develop a population pharmacokinetic (PK) model for IgG in PID patients following IV (Gammaplex 5%) or SC (Subgam-VF) administration;
Conduct a formal covariate analysis to assess the impact of patient demographics, and disease-related factors on the PK of IgG following IV or SC administration and to identify those patient covariates which may be utilized in or require dose adjustment;
Use the final population PK model to simulate serum IgG concentration-time profiles in a population of PID patients in order to:
Assess switching from various IgG IV and SC dosing regimens; and
Derive the weight-adjusted dose increment required to achieve a specified difference in serum IgG trough levels when Subgam-VF is administered either weekly or biweekly</description>

Subgam-VF is a 16% IgG and will be administered weekly, by subcutaneous infusion. The total duration of treatment will be for 26 weeks.
The initial weekly dose of Subgam-VF administered will be calculated by taking the average weekly equivalent of the subjectâ€™s IGIV dose (should be stable, as in same mg/kg +/- 5%), divided by the average dosing interval in weeks (i.e. 3 or 4), multiplied by 1.37, a dose adjustment coefficient based on other licensed subcutaneous IgG products. If the subject was already receiving a weekly SCIG IgG there will be no dose adjustment.
This population included 50 Subjects from GMX01 (NCT00278954), 25 Subjects from GMX04 (NCT01289847) and 38 Subjects from SCIG03.</description>

        <title>Dose Refinement in Switching From Gammaplex 5% IGIV to Subgam-VF</title>
        <description>The initial weekly dose of Subgam-VF administered was calculated by taking the average weekly equivalent of the subject's IGIV dose, divided by the average dosing interval in weeks (i.e. 3 or 4), multiplied by 1.37, a dose adjustment coefficient based on other licensed subcutaneous IgG products. If the subject was already receiving a weekly SCIG IgG there will be no dose adjustment.
A refined dose adjustment was estimated as 1.37/the ratio (Subgam-VF/ Gammaplex 5% IGIV) of geometric means for sAUC0-t and presented with 90% CI.</description>
        <time_frame>Week 26</time_frame>
        <population>The PK Dose-Adjustment population included all those in the Subgam PK population who had previous treatment with IGIV and those in the Gammaplex 5% PK population. This population was analysed to estimate a refined dose adjustment factor.</population>

            <description>Subgam-VF is a 16% IgG and will be administered weekly, by subcutaneous infusion for a total duration of 26 weeks.
This population included 23 Subjects from the Gammaplex PK Populations in GMX01 (NCT00278954) and 21 Subjects from GMX04 (NCT01289847), in addition included 20 Subjects from SCIG03.</description>

          <title>Dose Refinement in Switching From Gammaplex 5% IGIV to Subgam-VF</title>
          <description>The initial weekly dose of Subgam-VF administered was calculated by taking the average weekly equivalent of the subject's IGIV dose, divided by the average dosing interval in weeks (i.e. 3 or 4), multiplied by 1.37, a dose adjustment coefficient based on other licensed subcutaneous IgG products. If the subject was already receiving a weekly SCIG IgG there will be no dose adjustment.
A refined dose adjustment was estimated as 1.37/the ratio (Subgam-VF/ Gammaplex 5% IGIV) of geometric means for sAUC0-t and presented with 90% CI.</description>
          <population>The PK Dose-Adjustment population included all those in the Subgam PK population who had previous treatment with IGIV and those in the Gammaplex 5% PK population. This population was analysed to estimate a refined dose adjustment factor.</population>

Subgam-VF is a 16% IgG and will be administered weekly, by subcutaneous infusion. The total duration of treatment will be for 26 weeks.
The initial weekly dose of Subgam-VF administered will be calculated by taking the average weekly equivalent of the subjectâ€™s IGIV dose (should be stable, as in same mg/kg +/- 5%), divided by the average dosing interval in weeks (i.e. 3 or 4), multiplied by 1.37, a dose adjustment coefficient based on other licensed subcutaneous IgG products. If the subject was already receiving a weekly SCIG IgG there will be no dose adjustment.</description>
