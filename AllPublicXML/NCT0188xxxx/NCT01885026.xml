      Objectives: This study evaluates the efficacy of eScreen for internet psychiatry patients
      treated for major depressive disorder, panic anxiety and social phobia. The eScreen brief
      Internet intervention for problematic alcohol and drug use offers self-screening, in-depth
      self-reporting, personalized feedback and treatment recommendations as well as an electronic
      diary. Progress over time is shown in diagrams detailing consumption levels.

      Method: This is a two-armed randomized controlled design, measuring outcomes in terms of
      changes in problematic alcohol use up to one year after study recruitment. Participants with
      problematic alcohol use (AUDIT &gt;7 for men and &gt;5 for women) and/or problematic drug use
      (DUDIT &gt; 1 for both men and women) are randomized into one of two groups: T1, eScreen
      referral or Control group. Outcomes on alcohol and drug use as well as health-related
      symptoms are assessed after 3, 6 and 12 months.

      The hypothesis is that the group receiving the eScreen intervention will reduce their
      alcohol/drug use to a larger extent than the control group at follow-up compared to the
      baseline level.

      This study evaluated the efficacy of eScreen for internet psychiatry patients treated for
      major depressive disorder, panic anxiety and social phobia. The eScreen brief Internet
      intervention for problematic alcohol and drug use offers self-screening, in-depth
      self-reporting, personalized feedback and treatment recommendations as well as an electronic
      diary. Progress over time is shown in diagrams detailing consumption levels. The design was a
      two-armed randomized controlled design, measuring outcomes in terms of changes in problematic
      alcohol use up to one year after study recruitment. Participants with problematic alcohol use
      (AUDIT &gt;7 for men and &gt;5 for women) and/or problematic drug use (DUDIT &gt; 1 for both men and
      women) were randomized into one of two groups: T1, eScreen referral or Control group.
      Outcomes on alcohol and drug use as well as health-related symptoms are assessed after 3, 6
      and 12 months.

      The hypothesis was that the group receiving the eScreen intervention would reduce their
      alcohol/drug use to a larger extent than the control group at follow-up compared to the
      baseline level. The results have not yet been analyzed due to technical issues. However,
      qualitative interviews have been conducted with participants and our intention is to publish
      the qualitative results in tandem with the quantitative results available.
