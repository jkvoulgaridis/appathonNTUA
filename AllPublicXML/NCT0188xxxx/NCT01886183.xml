    <textblock>
      The objective of this work will be compare the effects of two balance training programs, one
      Nintendo Wii Fit-based and the other traditionally-based without the use of a gaming system,
      on the (1) motor function, (2) cognition, (3) balance and (4) gait in chronic stroke
      patients. It is a prospective, single blinded, randomized clinical trial performed at Center
      of Research of the courses of Speech Therapy, Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy of
      São Paulo University. Forty patients will be randomly assigned in control and experimental
      group, 20 each one.

      The objective of this work is to compare the effects of two balance training programs, one
      Nintendo Wii Fit-based and the other traditionally-based without the use of a gaming system,
      motor function, balance and quality of life in chronic stroke patients. It is a prospective,
      single-blinded, randomized clinical trial performed at Center of Research of the courses of
      Speech Therapy, Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy of São Paulo University. Forty
      chronic stroke patients are randomly in control and experimental group, 20 each one. Both
      groups conduct 14 training sessions, twice a week, for seven weeks. Each session will consist
      a 30 minute-global-exercise series including stretching, muscle strength and axial mobility
      exercises. After this, both groups will performed more 30 minutes of balance training: the
      control group will performed balance exercises without external cues, visual or auditory
      feedbacks or cognitive stimulations; the experimental group will performed the balance
      training with 8 Wii Fit games which stimulate motor and cognitive functions. The main outcome
      measures will be: (1) the lower limb subscale of the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA-LE); (2);
      Balance Evaluation Systems Test (BESTest);(3) the Stroke-Specific Quality of Life (SS-QOL);
      (4) 6- minute walk test (6MWT) and (5) The limits of stability (LOS).

    <measure>The lower limb subscale of the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA-LE)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>FMA-LE is a subscale measuring lower limb motor recovery. It examines movement and coordination of the hip, knee, and ankle in the supine, sitting, and standing positions. Each item is scored on a 3-point scale (0, cannot perform; 1, partially performs; 2, performs fully). The score range is 0 to 34, with higher scores indicating better lower limb motor performance</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Balance Evaluation Systems Test (BESTest)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Balance Evaluation Systems Test (BESTest) measures balance. It includes 36 items that evaluate performance of 6 balance systems: biomechanical constraints, stability limits/verticality, anticipatory postural adjustments, postural responses, sensory orientation, and stability in gait.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>6-minute walk test</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The 6MWT is a practical simple test. This test measures the distance that a patient can quickly walk on a flat, hard surface in a period of 6 minutes (the 6MWD). The 6MWT has been used as a measure of functional status of patients.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Stroke speciﬁc quality of life scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Stroke Speciﬁc Quality of Life Scale is a self-report assessment that includes 12 stroke speciﬁc subscales with 49 items. The Stroke Speciﬁc Quality of Life Scale attempts to capture the domains of stroke speciﬁc QOL that are insufficiently assessed with generic QOL measures. The 12 subscales, which are unidimensional, are Energy, Family Role, Language, Mobility, Mood, Personality, Self-Care, Social Roles, Thinking, Upper Extremity Function, Vision, and Work-Productivity. Participants responded to each item on a 5-point scale. Domain scores are the averages of the item scores, and the total score is the average of the domain scores. All summary scores therefore range from 1 to 5. Higher scores indicate better function.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Limits of Stability</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Limits of Stability subtest quantifies the maximum distance a person can intentionally displace their center of pressure (COP) from start position of midline COP centered over the base of support to eight targets. Location and movement of the COP was indicated by a cursor display projected on a screen in front of the subject. As targets were highlighted, the subject was to move the COP cursor quickly and accurately as possible towards a target located on the Limits of Stability perimeter and hold position as close to the target as possible. The parameters include COP movement velocity and directional control (% to target).</description>
