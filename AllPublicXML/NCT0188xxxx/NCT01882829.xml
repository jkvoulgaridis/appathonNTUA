    <textblock>
      There is an urgent need, therefore, to identify well-tolerated, orally available compounds
      that target the NMDA receptor as a novel treatment approach for TRD. The current project aims
      to test the safety, tolerability and efficacy of Nuedexta - containing the NMDA antagonist
      dextromethorphan.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately one-third of patients with major depressive disorder do not achieve adequate
      symptom control despite a series of multiple treatment trials with currently available
      antidepressant medication (for example a serotonin-selective reuptake inhibitor). This group
      of patients - representing treatment-resistant depression (TRD) - accounts for an alarmingly
      high public health burden and signifies a critical area of need in pharmaceutical treatment
      development. While current treatments are slow to act and only partially effective, new basic
      and clinical research focusing on the glutamate system is yielding promising new avenues for
      novel drug discovery. Ketamine - a glutamate N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist
      - has now been demonstrated in several studies to bring about a rapid and robust
      antidepressant effect, even in patients suffering from TRD. Ketamine is limited as a
      treatment for TRD by the need for intravenous administration and the potential for untoward
      medical or psychiatric adverse effects. There is an urgent need, therefore, to identify
      well-tolerated, orally available compounds that target the NMDA receptor as a novel treatment
      approach for TRD. The current project aims to test the safety, tolerability and efficacy of
      Nuedexta - containing the NMDA antagonist dextromethorphan.

    <measure>Sheehan Disability Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and Visit 6 (week 10)</time_frame>
    <description>The Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) is a self-rated scale which assesses illness-related disability in three areas of functioning: work, social and family. The SDS assess disability or functional impairment across three domains: work/school, social life/leisure activities and family life/home responsibilities. Each domain is scored from 0 (not at all) to 10 (very severely). The three domains can be summarized to evaluate global functional impairment by adding the scores of each of the three domains, resulting in global SDS score ranges from 0 (unimpaired) to 30 (highly impaired).</description>

        <description>The Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) is a self-rated scale which assesses illness-related disability in three areas of functioning: work, social and family. The SDS assess disability or functional impairment across three domains: work/school, social life/leisure activities and family life/home responsibilities. Each domain is scored from 0 (not at all) to 10 (very severely). The three domains can be summarized to evaluate global functional impairment by adding the scores of each of the three domains, resulting in global SDS score ranges from 0 (unimpaired) to 30 (highly impaired).</description>
