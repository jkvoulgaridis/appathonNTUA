  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Emerging research implicates biased attention to threat in the pathophysiology of anxiety
      disorders. Recent findings demonstrate significant associations between attention bias and
      stress vulnerability. This work has motivated the development of a novel therapy,
      attention-bias-modification (ABM) treatment . ABM is designed to implicitly modify patients'
      biased threat attendance via computerized training protocols. Emerging evidence indicates
      that ABM is effective in modifying threat-related attention biases and in ameliorating
      anxiety symptoms. However, it is unclear whether ABM is efficacious for posttraumatic stress
      disorder (PTSD). The present pilot study is a double blind trial that seeks to examine
      feasibility, acceptability, safety, efficacy, and risk/benefit ratio of ABM in individuals
      with PTSD. In addition this pilot study seeks to identify specific genes associated with
      anxiety disorders and to examine whether these can predict the success of the ABM.

    <description>Placebo-training program: attention control training (ACT), is identical to the ABM protocol except that during the presentation of the trials where a threat word is presented, the probe will appear with equal frequency in the position of the threat and neutral word. Thus, neither threat nor neutral words provide information regarding the position of the target probe, and there is no contingency between the position of either threat or neutral words, and the position of the probes</description>

    <description>Attention-bias-modification treatment (ABM) is designed to implicitly modify patients' biased threat attendance via computerized training protocols. During each session, 240 trials (80 neutral-neutral pairs, 160 threat-neutral pairs) will be presented. On trials where participants see one neutral word and one threat word, the probe will always follow the neutral word location. Thus, although there is no specific instruction to direct attention away from threat words, on 66% of all trials (and 100% of the threat-neutral trials) the position of the neutral word will indicate the position of the target probe.</description>

    <description>The training protocol consisted of 160 trials per session with 120 angry-neutral and 40 neutral-neutral trials. Each participant was trained with an alternative set of faces to the one used in the assessment task (i.e. if measured with set A then trained with set B and vice-versa). In the ABM condition, training was contin- gent on the bias measured at pre-treatment. Specifically, for those showing a bias toward the threat, the target appeared at the neutral-face location in 100% of the threat-neutral trials, while for those showing a bias away from the threat, the target appeared at the threat-face location in 100% of the threat-neutral trials.</description>
