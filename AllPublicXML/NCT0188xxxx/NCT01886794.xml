    <textblock>
      Our primary aim in the current study is to determine important tissue differences, including
      muscle and connective tissue changes, between postmenopausal women and reproductive age women
      with pelvic floor dysfunction to help develop targeted and noninvasive treatments.

      Our primary aim in the current study is to determine important tissue differences, including
      muscle and connective tissue changes, between postmenopausal women and reproductive age women
      with pelvic floor dysfunction to help develop targeted and noninvasive treatments. We will
      perform in vivo evaluations with colposcopy and OCT to determine epithelial thickness and
      overall mucosal health prior to surgery. At the time of surgery, we will obtain tissue for
      histologic and imaging analysis.
