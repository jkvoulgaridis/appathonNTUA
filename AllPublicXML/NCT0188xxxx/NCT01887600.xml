  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was conducted to treat anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease. Anemia is a
      reduced number of red blood cells or hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is important for the transport of
      oxygen in your blood. The purpose of the study was to see if Roxadustat is both effective and
      safe as a treatment for anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease.

    <time_frame>Baseline and weeks 12 to 28</time_frame>
    <description>Change from BL in SF-36 VT sub-score to the average value in weeks 12-28 was calculated using the physical component scores (PCS) of SF-36. The multi-purpose, short-form health survey has 36 questions with an 8-scale profile of functional health and well-being scores as well as psychometrically-based physical and mental health summary measures. The survey measures eight dimensions or scales: (1) physical functioning (PF) (10 items); (2) role limitations due to physical health problems (RP) (3 items); (3) bodily pain (BP) (2 items); (4) social functioning (SF) (2 items); (5) general health perceptions (GH) (5 items); (6) role limitations due to emotional problems (RE) (3 items); (7) vitality, energy or fatigue (VT) (4 items); and (8) mental health (MH) (5 items). The SF-36 scores ranged from 0-100 with higher scores indicating better health status.</description>

The SF-36 scores ranged from 0-100 with higher scores indicating better health status. All available SF-36 PF values were used i.e., both scheduled and unscheduled for the calculation of the average PF sub-score of weeks 12 to 28.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and weeks 20 to 28</time_frame>
    <description>The MAP was derived for each visit from the average systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) calculated for each visit using the three readings and the following equation: MAP = (2/3) * DBP + (1/3) * SBP. Baseline assessment was the assessment on day 1 (average of the three readings).

    <description>The functional assessment of cancer therapy general (FACT-G) Version 4 contains 27 items that cover four dimensions of well-being: physical (PWB)—7 items, functional (FWB)—7 items, social/family (SWB)—7 items each, and emotional (EWB)—6 items. A subscale of 13 fatigue specific items (the Fatigue Subscale) plus seven additional items related to anemia were developed for use in conjunction with the FACT-G. The 13 fatigue items plus the seven additional items related to anemia comprise the Anemia Subscale (AnS). Administration of the FACT-G plus the AnS is referred to as the FACT-An. Respondents are asked to provide responses, (i.e., 'Not at all', 'A little bit', 'Somewhat', 'Quite a bit' and 'Very much'), to a list of statements which are either positively or negatively phrased. For all FACT-An scales, a higher score indicates better QoL.</description>

    <description>FACT-An Total Score consist of 27 items that cover four dimensions of well-being: physical (PWB) - 7 items, functional (FWB) - 7 items, social/family (SWB) - 7 items, and emotional (EWB) - 6 items and Anemia Subscale (AnS). Respondents were asked to provide responses, (Not at all, A little bit, Somewhat, Quite a bit and Very much), to a list of statements which were either positively or negatively phrased. Each individual item was scored from 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much), and then the total score was obtained by summation of the resulted scores. A final higher score indicates better QoL.</description>

    <measure>Change From BL to the Average Value of Weeks 12-28 in the Euroqol Questionnaire - 5 Dimensions 5 Levels (EQ-5D 5L) Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and weeks 12 to 28</time_frame>
    <description>The Euroqol Questionnaire - 5 Dimensions 5 Levels (EQ-5D 5L) is a self-reported questionnaire. The EQ-5D 5L is used as a measure of respondents' Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL). The EQ-5D 5L consists of the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (VAS). The EQ-5D 5L descriptive system comprises of 5 dimensions of health: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, extreme problems. The VAS records the respondent's self-rated health status on a graduated (0-100) scale, where the answers are labeled 'Best imaginable health state' and 'Worst imaginable health state' with higher scores for higher HRQoL.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and weeks 12 to 28</time_frame>
    <description>Work productivity and activity impairment:anemic symptoms (WPAI:ANS) questionnaire version 2 was used to measure work and activity impairment during the last seven days due to anemia. It is self-assessed questionnaire which consists of 2 domains and 6 questions covering work and daily activities. Questions include asking if participant is working, how many hours the person missed work due to anemic symptoms, how many hours participant actually worked and how the anemic symptoms impacted their productivity and ability to do daily activities. WPAI:ANS was scored from 0-10 with 0 identifying low impact and 10 highest impact on the work activities. Work time missed due to anaemic symptoms was calculated as 100 x Q2/(Q2+Q4). Overall work impairment due to anaemic symptoms was calculated as 100 x Q2/(Q2+Q4)+[(1-Q2/(Q2+Q4))x(Q5/10)].</description>
