  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this clinical study include:

        -  Evaluate E1 Wear including early bedding-in process, clinical outcomes on patients who
           received Total Hip Arthroplasty with E1

        -  Compare E1 wear used with CoCr and Biolox Delta heads
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed as PROSPECTIVE, RANDOMIZED, MULTI-CENTER Study to compare two
      different materials (CoCr and Delta ceramic) articulating against E1 Highly Crosslinked
      polyethylene in Hip Replacement.

      Patient population is 160 (80 each). Follow-up period is 10 year postoperatively. E1 liners
      with thickness of 4.8mm at 45 degrees position (load bearing direction) will be used in all
      cases.

      Randomization will occur via random number generator by 4 blocks randomization.

    <measure>WOMAC Osteoarthritis Index at 6 Month Follow-up Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>6 month postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) is used in evaluation of Hip and Knee Osteoarthritis. It is a self-administered questionnaire consisting of 24 items.
The scores for each subscale are summed up, with a possible score range of 0-20 for &quot;Pain&quot;, 0-8 for Stiffness, and 0-68 for Physical Function. Usually a sum of the scores for all three subscales gives a The total WOMAC score ranged from 0 to 96.
Higher scores on the WOMAC indicate worse pain, stiffness, and functional limitations.

          <description>The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) is used in evaluation of Hip and Knee Osteoarthritis. It is a self-administered questionnaire consisting of 24 items.
The scores for each subscale are summed up, with a possible score range of 0-20 for &quot;Pain&quot;, 0-8 for Stiffness, and 0-68 for Physical Function. Usually a sum of the scores for all three subscales gives a The total WOMAC score ranged from 0 to 96.
Higher scores on the WOMAC indicate worse pain, stiffness, and functional limitations.</description>

          <title>WOMAC Osteoarthritis Index at 2 Year Follow-up Visit</title>
          <description>The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) is used in evaluation of Hip and Knee Osteoarthritis. It is a self-administered questionnaire consisting of 24 items.
The scores for each subscale are summed up, with a possible score range of 0-20 for &quot;Pain&quot;, 0-8 for Stiffness, and 0-68 for Physical Function. Usually a sum of the scores for all three subscales gives a The total WOMAC score ranged from 0 to 96.
Higher scores on the WOMAC indicate worse pain, stiffness, and functional limitations.</description>
