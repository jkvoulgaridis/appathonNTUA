      This is a phase I, open-label, multicentre study of AZD8186 administered orally in patients
      with advanced castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), squamous non-small cell lung cancer
      (sqNSCLC), triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and known PTEN-deficient/mutated or PIK3CB
      mutated/amplified advanced solid malignancies as monotherapy and in combination with
      abiraterone acetate or AZD2014.

      This is a phase I, open-label, multicentre study of AZD8186 administered orally in patients
      with advanced castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), squamous non-small cell lung cancer
      (sqNSCLC), triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and known PTEN-deficient/mutated or PIK3CB
      mutated/amplified advanced solid malignancies. The study design allows an escalation of dose
      with intensive safety monitoring to ensure the safety of the patients.

      There are 4 parts to this study: Part A, monotherapy dose escalation, Part B, monotherapy
      expansion cohort(s) in PTEN deficient patients at the monotherapy intended therapeutic
      dose(s) and schedule(s), Part C, AZD8186 added to abiraterone accetate (with prednisone)
      treatment - dose/ schedule finding followed by expansion phase in PTEN-deficient/mutated or
      PIK3CB mutated mCRPC and Part D, AZD8186 in combination with AZD2014 (a novel dual mTORC1/2
      inibitor) dose/schedule finding followed by expansion phase in PTEN-deficient/mutated or
      PIK3CB mutated TNBC.
