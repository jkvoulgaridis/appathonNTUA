  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect long-term safety data in participants with
      metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) who are receiving HGT-1110 and have participated in Study
      HGT-MLD-070 through Week 40.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MLD is an inherited, autosomal recessive disorder of lipid metabolism characterized by
      deficient activity of the lysosomal enzyme, arylsulfatase A (ASA). MLD is a rare orphan
      disease that occurs in most parts of the world. The estimated overall incidence of the
      disease in the western world is approximately 1 in 100,000 live births that varies by
      geographic location. There are no approved therapies for MLD.

      This study is a multicenter open-label study designed to evaluate safety and efficacy
      outcomes of HGT-1110 administered intrathecally in children with MLD who have participated in
      the dose escalation study, HGT-MLD-070, through Week 40 and are receiving study drug every
      other week (EOW).

      Treatment groups will be identical to those in HGT-MLD-070, ie, participants assigned to
      Cohort 1 in Study HGT-MLD-070 will continue to receive a dose of 10 milligrams (mg),
      participants assigned to Cohort 2 in Study HGT-MLD-070 will continue to receive a dose of 30
      mg, and participants assigned to Cohorts 3 and 4 in Study HGT-MLD-070 will continue to
      receive a dose of 100 mg. Participants in Cohort 4 are to exclusively receive drug product
      produced with Process B in Study HGT-MLD-070 and will continue receiving this drug product in
      this study. Participants enrolled in this study from Cohorts 1 to 3 in Study HGT-MLD-070 were
      transitioned to Process B after all necessary approvals were obtained. In HGT-MLD-071, all
      participants in the 10 mg dose cohort who experienced disease progression, as determined by
      the Investigator, increased to the 30 mg dose after agreement by the Medical Monitor. Based
      on the interim analysis results from HGT-MLD-070 (Cohorts 1-3), the dose of HGT-1110 will be
      increased to 100 mg for all participants in HGT-MLD-071 after all necessary approvals were
      obtained.

    <description>An AE is any noxious, pathologic, or unintended change in anatomical, physiologic, or metabolic function as indicated by physical signs, symptoms, or laboratory changes occurring in any phase of a clinical study, whether or not considered investigational drug product-related. TEAEs are defined as all AEs occurring or worsening at or after the first dose of investigational drug product in HGT-MLD-071 or ongoing from HGT-MLD-070 at the time of enrollment into HGT-MLD-071.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Motor Function as Assessed by Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM-88) Total Score at Week 624</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 624</time_frame>
    <description>The GMFM-88 item scores can be used to calculate a domain-specific percent score for each of the 5 GMFM-88 dimensions, which are the following: Lying and rolling; Sitting; Crawling and kneeling; Standing; Walking, running, and jumping. Each of the 88 items is rated on a 4-point scale: 0=does not initiate; 1=initiates; 2=partially completes; and 3=completes. The GMFM-88 total scores range from 0% (no mobility) to a score of 100%, that is (i.e,) the score that can be obtained by an average 5-year-old or older child with normal motor abilities. The domain-specific percent scores are averaged to obtain the total score (percent).</description>

    <description>The VABS-II test measures adaptive behaviors, including the ability to cope with environmental changes, to learn new everyday skills, and to demonstrate independence. This test measures the following 4 key domains: communication, daily living skills, socialization, motor skills, and the adaptive behavior composite (a composite of the other 4 domains). The ABC score ranges from 20 to 160 on which higher scores indicate a higher level of adaptive functioning. A positive change value indicates improvement in adaptive functioning.</description>

    <description>The COMFORT is a questionnaire that will be used to assess health status and the impact of disease on the ability of participants with MLD to carry out activities of daily life. The questionnaire is organized by 8 domains (that is, Personal Care, Positioning, Transfer or Mobility, Eating, Pain and Discomfort During the Day, Sleep, Emotions, Communication, Play and Leisure Activities) and will be completed by the participant's parent(s) or legal representative(s). It will be conducted in available validated languages. The COMFORT scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating a decline in the functioning.</description>
