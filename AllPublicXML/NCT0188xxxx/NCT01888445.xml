             dose range of ESA label

          -  Hb value at screening test is ≥10.0 g/dL

          -  Receiving hemodialysis via arteriovenous fistula (AVF) or arteriovenous graft (AVG) or
             via permanent catheter

          -  Most recent two Hb values before dialysis during washout period must be both &lt;9.5 g/dL
