    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs
      (DMARDs) dose reduction in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

      Remission is the treatment target in RA, but knowledge about the best way to treat RA
      patients who achieve sustained remission is limited. DMARDs have potential serious adverse
      events, and biologic DMARDs are costly to the society. The objectives for ARCTIC REWIND are
      to assess the effect of tapering and withdrawal of DMARDs on disease activity in RA patients
      in sustained remission, to study predictors for successful tapering and withdrawal of DMARDs
      in this patient group, and to study cost-effectiveness of different treatment options in RA
      remission.

      ARCTIC REWIND is a randomized, open, controlled, parallel-group, multicenter, phase IV,
      non-inferiority strategy study. Patients with less than five years of disease duration and
      stable remission for at least 12 months are randomized to either continued stable treatment
      or tapering and withdrawal of DMARDs, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors and
      synthetic DMARDs. Patients are assessed by clinical examination, patient reported outcome
      measures, ultrasonography, MRI and X-ray, and monitored for adverse events. The primary
      endpoint of the study is the proportion of patients who are non-failures (have not
      experienced a flare) at 12 months. Secondary endpoints include composite disease activity
      scores and remission criteria, joint damage and inflammation assessed by various imaging
      modalities, work participation, health care resource use and health related quality of life.

    <description>Flare is defined as composite measure: (1) An increase in disease activity score (DAS) to &gt;1.6 AND (2) a change in DAS of at least 0.6 AND (3) &gt; 1 swollen joint. If a patient does not fulfill this formal definition, but experiences a clinically significant flare according to the investigator and patient, this is treated as a flare.</description>
