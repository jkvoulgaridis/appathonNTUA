      To determine if the addition of midostaurin (PKC412) to Standard of Care (SOC) therapy
      reduces relapse in FLT3-ITD mutated AML patients receiving an allogenetic hematopoietic stem
      cell transplant,

    <description>The assessment of safety will be based mainly on the frequency of Adverse Events (AEs), on the number of laboratory values summarized by CTCAE grades and non-relapse mortality(NRM). The assessment of tolerability will be based on whether midostaurin can be administered at a daily dose of 50mg twice daily at least 80% of the time to 50% or more of patients during the first 100 days after allogeneic HSCT</description>
