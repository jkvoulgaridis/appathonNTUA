  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A thorough infertility evaluation commonly involves determining whether a woman's fallopian
      tubes are patent. The two most often utilized methods of evaluating the fallopian tubes are
      hysterosalpingogram (taking an X-ray of the pelvis after injecting dye through the uterus and
      fallopian tubes) and laparoscopic chromopertubation (a surgical procedure in which dye is
      visualized passing through the fallopian tubes).

      The FemVue Saline-Air device is a new method of assessing tubal patency. The device utilizes
      a mixture of saline and air bubbles that can be seen passing through the fallopian tubes by
      ultrasound. FemVue can be efficiently performed in a physician's office and is minimally
      invasive. Unlike hysterosalpingogram and laparoscopic chromopertubation, it does not carry
      the risks of anesthesia or surgery, and doesn't expose the patient to radiation or contrast.
      It does, like the other two methods, carry a small risk of infection.

      This study will involve using the FemVue device on patients under anesthesia in the operating
      room before they undergo scheduled laparoscopic chromopertubation, the gold standard for
      evaluating tubal patency. The two methods will be compared to determine the accuracy of the
      FemVue device.
