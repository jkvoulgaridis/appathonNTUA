  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if enzalutamide is safe and effective in the
      treatment of patients with advanced breast cancer that express the androgen receptor but do
      not express the estrogen or progesterone receptor and are not Her2 amplified.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Clinical Benefit at Week 16: Evaluable Population</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants with a clinical benefit at Week 16 defined as percentage of participants with a best response of complete response (CR), partial response(PR), stable disease(SD) for &gt;= 16 weeks on radiologic imaging based on Investigator assessment using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1(RECIST 1.1). An estimate of the percentage and its exact 2-sided 85% confidence interval(CI) were calculated using the Blaker method. As per RECIST 1.1, CR defined as disappearance of all target, non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level and all lymph nodes decreased to non-pathological in size &lt;10mm short axis. PR: At least 30% decrease in sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as reference baseline sum of LD, without progression of non-target lesions, no appearance of new lesions. SD: Neither sufficient reduction to qualify as PR nor sufficient increase to qualify as PD, using the smallest sum diameters during the study as a reference</description>

        <description>Percentage of participants with a clinical benefit at Week 16 defined as percentage of participants with a best response of complete response (CR), partial response(PR), stable disease(SD) for &gt;= 16 weeks on radiologic imaging based on Investigator assessment using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1(RECIST 1.1). An estimate of the percentage and its exact 2-sided 85% confidence interval(CI) were calculated using the Blaker method. As per RECIST 1.1, CR defined as disappearance of all target, non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level and all lymph nodes decreased to non-pathological in size &lt;10mm short axis. PR: At least 30% decrease in sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as reference baseline sum of LD, without progression of non-target lesions, no appearance of new lesions. SD: Neither sufficient reduction to qualify as PR nor sufficient increase to qualify as PD, using the smallest sum diameters during the study as a reference</description>
