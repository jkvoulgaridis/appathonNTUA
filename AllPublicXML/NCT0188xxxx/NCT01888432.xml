    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial was to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of everolimus in
      combination with reduced tacrolimus, compared to tacrolimus control, in living donor liver
      transplant recipients.

      This study was 24 month, multicenter study in 280 living donor liver transplant patients from
      Asia, Europe and Canada. The study has an long term extension in Japan and approximately 28
      patients were to be included to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of
      concentration-controlled everolimus regimen plus reduced tacrolimus compared to standard
      tacrolimus in recipients of living donor liver transplants in Japan who participated in the
      CRAD001H2307 study.

      Data reported here are the CRAD001H2307 core study results and its extension
      (CRAD001H2307E1).
