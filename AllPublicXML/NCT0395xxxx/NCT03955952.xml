    <textblock>
      The objective of the analysis was to evaluate the relationship between bariatric surgery and
      cardiovascular outcomes in obese patients with type 2 diabetes. This is a retrospective
      matched cohort study of patients with diabetes that underwent bariatric surgery at the
      Cleveland Clinic between 2004-2017. Each bariatric patient was matched to a non-surgical
      control with obesity and type 2 diabetes in a 1:5 ratio using data from the Electronic
      Medical Record (EMR). The maximum observation time was 10 years. Cumulative incidence rates
      for all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events were calculated at years 1, 3, 5, 7 and 10.
      Kaplan-Meier curves were created for all the outcomes with all-cause mortality considered as
      a completing risk.
