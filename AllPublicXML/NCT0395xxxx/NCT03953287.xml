      Brief Summary:

      The study evaluate the absorption rate and pharmacodynamic of different formulation of
      paracetamol either in the form of normal tablets or a new rapid absorbable gelation capsule
      formulation &quot;Paracetamol1523&quot; by determining T-max and area under the response curve of
      paracetamol in blood concentration as well as from clinical effects after intake. Data is
      entered on data sheet in anonymous form and processed. The results are presented in anonymous
      form by publication and lecture. Experts are given the supplement: &quot;The applicant's rights in

      Detailed Description:

      Twelve healthy young volunteers are recruited, and the experiments begin at 07:45 after an
      overnight fast. Clinical data are recorded and a catheter is inserted in an antecubital vein
      for blood samples.

      At 08.00 paracetamol (500 mg) taken as tablet or a &quot;Paracetamol1523&quot; c in random order.
      Subsequently, blood samples are taken every 3 minute for one hour minutes, then every 10
      minutes the following two hours. In addition, blood pressure and puls rate are measured every
      10 minute the first hour, and then every 30 minutes.Side effects and time to the participants
      registrate any effect of the drugs are assessed in a prefabricated scheme.

      The disadvantages associated with the experiment are sought monitored by adverse event
      registration which ends at the end of the trial. The trial day lasts 4 hours in which blood
      samples are taken as described above, and blood pressure and records are stored .

    <description>Detailed Description:
Twelve healthy young volunteers are recruited, and the experiments begin at 07:45 after an overnight fast. BMI and blod pressure are recorded and a catheter is inserted in an antecubital vein for blood samples.
At 08.00 participants take 500 mg paracetamol as a tablet with 200 ml tap water or a &quot;Paracetamol1523&quot; capsule in random order. Subsequently, blood samples are taken every minute for 3 minutes the first hour, then every 10 minutes the following two hours. In addition, blood pressure and puls rate are measured every 20 minute the first hour, and then every 30 minutes.Side effects and time to the participants registrate any effect of the drugs are assessed in a prefabricated scheme.
The disadvantages associated with the experiment are sought monitored by adverse event registration which ends at the end of the trial. The trial day lasts 2 hours in which blood samples are taken as described above, and blood pressure and records are stored .</description>
