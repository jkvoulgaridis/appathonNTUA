  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates a technology-enabled decision aid that provides evidence-based education
      (i.e. on understanding the condition, treatment options and comparisons, patient values and
      question &amp; answer quiz) and personalized, quantifiable benefit-risk ratio alongside the level
      of potential benefit in relation to joint stiffness, joint pain and quality of life. The
      study will be performed in the setting of an integrated care system providing
      patient-centered care for hip and knee osteoarthritis over the full cycle of care. The impact
      of a technology-enabled decision aid incorporating predictive analytics with machine learning
      capabilities on decision quality, activation, experience &amp; limitations of patients in this
      setting is relatively unknown.
