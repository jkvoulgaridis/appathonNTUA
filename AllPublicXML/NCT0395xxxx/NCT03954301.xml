      The aim of this study is to analyze all of the variables with a Hierarchical Cluster Analysis
      of Multivariate Statistical Methods to obtain more sensitive results, and also to add a new
      dimension to the hypothesis included in the study.

      Aim and Introduction: Due to individual anthropometric differences, there are many different
      types of foot posture Foot posture variations affect lower extremity structure, alignment and
      biomechanical characteristics. Particularly in younger people, performing critical
      biomechanical measurements in the lower extremity and foot is extremely important to the
      detection of, and early intervention in, orthopedic problems that these individuals will
      encounter in their later life. In the literature, attempts at analysis of the evaluations
      realized so far have been made by univariate analysis. Considering the relationship between
      variation and variables, these methods result in loss of information. The aim of this study
      is to analyze all of the variables with a Hierarchical Cluster Analysis of Multivariate
      Statistical Methods to obtain more sensitive results, and also to add a new dimension to the
      hypothesis included in the study.

      Methods: The study is carried out on 2nd and 3rd year university students in the
      physiotherapy and rehabilitation department taking a kinesiology course. The analyses are
      performed at the Biruni University Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation laboratory. Patients with
      musculoskeletal system pathomechanics which could prevent standing and walking are not
      included in the study. After demographic characteristics are recorded, Q, valgity angle,
      subtalar joint, medial longitudinal arch and hallux valgus angles are measured with a
      goniometer. The height from the ground of the navicula are calculated by caliper, using the
      Navicular drop test. Metatarsal width are also calculated with this device. Medial
      longitudinal arch angle, metatarsal width and nacivular drop tests are performed under
      weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing conditions.
