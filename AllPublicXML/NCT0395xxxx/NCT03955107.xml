      Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is defined as any degree of glucose intolerance that is
      first identified during pregnancy, excluding diabetic patients diagnosed before pregnancy.
      The purpose of this study is to determine if Continuous glucose monitoring improves glycemic
      control and pregnancy outcomes of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a open-label, randomized controlled trial. The investigators plan to recruit 154 women with gestational diabetes at 24-28 weeks gestation. 77 subjects (Group 1) will be selected to undergo CGM every 4 weeks and another 77 subjects will be recruited to undergo usual antenatal care ,and last month undergo CGMS (Group 2).
The primary outcomes will be time in range of glycaemic control in the third trimester. The investigators also plan to assess changes to management made by the endocrinologist based on the additional information on glycemic control obtained from professional CGM use. The investigators also plan to compare hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia detection rates using the CGMS and fingerstick methods of glucose evaluation. Written and informed consent will be obtained in accordance with the principles of the Helsinki Declaration.</intervention_model_description>
