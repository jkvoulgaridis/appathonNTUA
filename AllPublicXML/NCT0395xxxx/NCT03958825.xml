  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic left sectionectomy has been associated with shorter hospital stay and reduced
      overall morbidity compared with open left sectionectomy. Strong evidence has not, however,
      been provided.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The application of laparoscopic technology to liver surgery has been developing rapidly, yet
      very few studies have been conducted to compare the outcomes between open and laparoscopic
      liver resections. So little is known about their advantages and disadvantages. The aim of
      this prospective randomized study is to compare the outcomes between laparoscopic and open
      liver resection in treatment of hepatolithiasis within the left lobes within an enhanced
      recovery after surgery programme.

    <measure>Composite endpoint of liver surgery specific morbidity</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 year after liver resection</time_frame>
    <description>Parameter composed of a combination of procedure-specific complications and considered as a single, dichotomous outcome: operative mortality, intra-abdominal haemorrhage, ascites, bile leakage, intra-abdominal abscess and postresectional liver failure. These components, which are all specific to liver surgery and have substantial clinical relevance, reflect Dindo grade 3-5 complications. A composite score of 1 (=failure) will reflect the occurrence of at least one of the above liver specific complications, consequently a score of 0 (=success) will be assigned if none occur.</description>

    <measure>Hospital and societal costs</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 year after liver resection</time_frame>
    <description>The economic evaluation will include a cost-utility analysis from a Dutch societal perspective. The incremental costs per Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) gained will be based on utility scores from the EQ-5D. All hospital expenses (direct and indirect) related to both interventions will be monitored. In addition, a cost questionnaire offered at the regular follow-up consultation (3, 6 and 12 months) will help us to assess the societal and individual costs outside health care relating to patients' absence, impaired mobility, work or normal daily activities.</description>
