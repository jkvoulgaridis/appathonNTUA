  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to determine the accuracy of blood test ClarityDX Prostate to predict
      the results of prostate biopsies in men who have PSA (Prostate Specific Antigen) greater than
      3 and no higher than 10 ng/mL.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to validate ClarityDX Prostate as a reflex test to PSA to
      refine the prediction of clinically-significant prostate cancer in a prospective cohort of
      men to be recruited in Alberta, Whitehorse and in the United States of America when they are
      scheduled for a biopsy as a result of on an elevated PSA.

      This prospective training and validation cohort study will consist of up to 2,800 consenting
      men in total, between ages 40-75 years old, without prior diagnosis of prostate cancer, who
      have been selected to undergo a prostate biopsy to rule out prostate cancer.

    <description>For the first 1,400 patients, processed microflow cytometry data for each patient will be linked with patient clinical data to determine which patients have benign vs. aggressive prostate cancer.
The models created during the Training Phase will be locked down and then used to determine the probability of approximately 1,400 patients in the investigational Validation Phase having clinically significant prostate cancer.</description>
