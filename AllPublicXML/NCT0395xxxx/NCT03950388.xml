  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Care Quality Commission (2017) concludes that too often care for people with severe
      mental health problems on mental health inpatient wards institutionalises people, rather than
      helping them to have an independent life in the community. There is good evidence that
      psychological interventions improve patient well-being and independent living, but patients
      on acute mental health wards often do not have access to evidence-based psychological
      therapies which are strongly advised by NICE guidance for severe mental health problems (e.g.
      NICE, 2011). The overall aim of this programme of work is to increase patient access to
      psychological therapies on acute mental health inpatient wards. Stage one of the programme
      aimed to identify barriers and facilitators to delivering therapy in these settings through a
      large qualitative study. The key output of stage one was an intervention protocol that is
      designed to be delivered on acute wards to increase patient access to
      psychologically-informed care and therapy. Stage two of the programme aims to test the
      effects of the intervention on patient wellbeing and serious incidents on the ward which are
      routinely collated by wards and patient and staff contact is not required (primary outcomes),
      patient social functioning and symptoms, staff burnout, ward atmosphere from staff and
      patient perspectives and cost effectiveness of the intervention (secondary outcomes). The
      study is a single blind, pragmatic, cluster randomised controlled trial and will recruit
      thirty-four wards across England that will be randomised to receive the new intervention plus
      treatment as usual, or treatment as usual only. Primary and secondary outcomes will be
      assessed at baseline and 6-month and 9-month follow-ups, with serious incidents on the ward
      collected at an additional 3-month follow-up. A process evaluation will be nested within the
      trial to understand factors that influence the effects of the intervention and implementation
      in real world settings.

    <description>Patient well being using the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Questionnaire. WEMWBS: Scale: 1= None of the time, 2 = Rarely, 3 = Some of the time, 4 = Often, 5 = All of the time. Participants are asked to select an option considering the statement over the past 2 weeks. WEMWBS is a 14 item scale with 5 response categories, summed to provide a single score ranging from 14-70. The items are all worded positively and cover both feeling and functioning aspects of mental wellbeing, thereby making the concept more accessible.</description>

Serious Incidents: Taken from current reports pulled by each trust to monitor the number of incidents which occur within a ward. Categorised by each Trust using a levelling system of 1-5 with 5 being the most serious level. The incidents are also categorised by event type which varies at each Trust and again is the responsibility of each data entry personnel to assign a category. Data to be taken at baseline for the 3 months prior, at 3 months for the 3 months prior, at 6 months for the 3 months prior and at 9 months for the 3 months prior</description>

    <description>EQ-5D-5L:
Each of the 5 dimensions comprising the EQ-5D descriptive system is divided into 5 levels of perceived problems:
Level 1: indicating no problem Level 2: indicating slight problems Level 3: indicating moderate problems Level 4: indicating severe problems Level 5: indicating extreme problems A unique health state is defined by combining 1 level from each of the 5 dimensions.
Scoring: level 1 is coded as 1, level 2 as 2, level 3 as 3, level 4 as 4 and level 5 as 5. There should be only ONE response for each dimension NB: Missing values can be coded as '9'.NB: Ambiguous values (e.g. 2 boxes are ticked for a single dimension) should be treated as missing values. The EQ VAS should be coded as per where the X is placed on a scale of 0-100 with 100= the best health and 0= the worst health. Missing values should be coded as '999'.</description>

    <description>Wards randomly assigned to receive the intervention will have a Band 8a Psychologist based on the ward for 0.5FTE for 7 months. During this time, all patients will be involved with the proposed stepped model of care intervention at one of three levels. The level the patient receives will be decided by the multidisciplinary ward team. At Step one, all patients will have a psychological formulation developed by the psychologist in conjunction with the patient or members of the ward team. At Step 2, all qualified nurses will be trained and supervised to deliver guided self-help material of psychological interventions targeting key problem areas for patients. At Step 3, patients will be offered up to 16, one-to-one therapy sessions with the psychologist.</description>
