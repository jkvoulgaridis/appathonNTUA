    <textblock>
      This trial is a translational, open-label, monocentric, prospective cohort study of 900
      patients aiming to describe the PD-1 (programmed death) expression in T cells (T lymphocytes)
      in different solid tumors.

      The study will be conducted on a population of patients with local and/or metastatic
      malignant solid tumor and who are followed for their standard of care at the IUCT-O.

      Patients with any of the following tumor types may be enrolled in the trial:

        -  Head and neck cancer,

        -  Ovarian cancer,

        -  Cervical cancer,

        -  Pre-invasive CIN III cervical cancer (Cervical Intra-epithelial Neoplasia III cervical
           cancer),

        -  Other solid tumor types (including glioblastoma, NSCLC (Non-small cell lung cancer),
           anal cancer)

      Each tumor type will be considered as an independent cohort.

      For each included patient, biological specimen (tumor sample, blood samples and ascites
      samples if applicable) will be collected.

      Study participation of each patient will be 5 years.

    <description>Blood samples, tumor biopsy specimens and ascites samples will be collected at different time points (if feasible, according to the samples taken in the standard practice):
at Baseline,
every 6 months (± 1 month) during the planned visits in the center for clinical standard care and for a maximum follow-up period of 5 years from baseline.
If tumor biopsy and/or ascites sampling are performed during the standard care, a sample will be collected for the study at baseline and at the time of progression.</description>
