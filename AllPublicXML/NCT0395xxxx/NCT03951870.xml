    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the link between neurobehavioral measures of the
      mesolimbic reward system and immune functioning in healthy individuals, via fMRI
      neurofeedback modulation of mesolimbic reward system, and the consecutive assesment of immune
      response to Hepatitis B vaccination.

    <textblock>
      For many years, the link between mental processes and physical health has remained obscure.
      Yet, over time, studies have begun to shed light on the intimate relationship between one's
      physical condition and mental state. One body of research aimed at elucidating the mind-body
      relationship is the study of the placebo effect. Placebo effects result mainly from conscious
      expectations to become healthy in therapeutic settings, and from unconscious conditioned
      responses to therapeutical settings that predict beneficial outcomes. Both processes are
      asociated with the neuronal reward system, which mediates reward processing, reward valuation
      and value based-learning. However, it remains unclear how do these processes mediated by the
      reward system promote therapeutic effects?

      A recent study established a causal relationship between mesolimbic activation (VTA) and a
      measurable immunological response in mice. Stimulation of the VTA increased anti-bacterial
      immune functioning, an effect that was mediated by sympathetic nervous system, which is
      regulated by the brain and innervates all immune organs.

      In light of these findings, the current study aims to assess the relationship between
      reward-related brain activation and immune functions in humans. fMRI Neurofeedback, a task
      that allows individuals to self modulate specified neural patterns in real-time, will be used
      to induce mesolimbic activation, following which healthy individuals will vaccinate against
      Hepatitis B. Immunological effects will be assessed by comparing immunological measures with
      respect to Hepatitis B prior and following mesolimbic activation and Hepatitis B vaccination.

      The long-term goal of this study is to demonstrate a causal link between reward activation
      and an objective measurable physiological response of great significance, and to develop the
      means for individuals to exploit such mechanism for boosting immune functioning. i.e. to
      harness endogenous reward-related brain activation to strengthen the immune system, for
      clinical pathologies such as autoimmune diseases, maleble pathogens, cancer, etc.

    <measure>Immunological: change in anti HBs immunoglobins in plasma</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To measure antibody titers in plasma, blood samples will be taken at four time points: before neurofeedback training (-14d); immediately before Hepatitis B vaccination (day 0), 14 days and 28 days after vaccination. Anti-HBs change will be defined as average levels post-vaccination (14 and 28 days) minus average levels pre-vaccination (-14 and 0 days).
The investigators predict that:
i.Simple group effect: experimental arm subjects (mesolimbic fMRI NF) will exhibit higher levels of anti-HBs change than both the active comparator group (control fMRI-NF) and the no-treatment group.
ii.Mesolimbic activation-Immunologic response correlation: mesolimbic activity during the neurofeedback task (across all NF participants) during the last session will predict anti-HBs levels following vaccination.</description>

    <measure>Immunological: change in cytokines blood concentrations following vaccination</measure>
    <time_frame>10-24 days</time_frame>
    <description>To assess cytokine levels in plasma (IL-4, IL-6, TNFalpha, IFNgamma), the investigators will use the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in plasma taken before vaccination (day 0) and three days following vaccination. As mere NF practice may affect cytokines levels, change in cytokines will be analyzed via repeated measures linear model, comprising three time points - before NF training (-14d), before vaccination (day 0) and 3 days following vaccination. groupXtime (3X3) main effect and interactions will be inspected.
The investigators predict that:
Experimental arm group will exhibit higher levels of cytokines concentration that the active control group and natural history group.</description>

    <measure>Neurobehavioral measures of reward anticipation and responsivity during Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Neurobehavioral measures of reward responsitivity and reward anticipation will be assessed via application of MID task during fMRI scanning at the beginning of the first fMRI session (for all three study groups).
The investigators intend to inspect whether neural and behavioral indices of reward anticipation and consumption could account for differences in immunological outcome measures, as defined above (see primary outcome measures). Specifically, the investigators predict that BOLD responses to reward anticipation and consumption will be positively correlated with immunological outcome measures, as defined above (see primary outcome measures).</description>

The investigators expect to find changes in functional connectivity of the mesolimbic reward network specifically in the mesolimbic fMRI-NF group (when compared with control fMRI NF group).</description>

    <measure>Subjective reports of SHAPS (Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A 14 items (answered on a four points scale ranging from 'strongly disagree' to 'strongly agree') questionnaire for estimation of the degree of which a person is able to experience pleasure or the anticipation of a pleasurable experience. The questionnaire is scored as the sum of of the items (totals scores ranged from 0 to 14). A higher total score indicates higher levels of anhedonia.
Exploratory Analyses: The investigators will examine whether the questionnaire scores prior to NF practice and vaccination, will account for differences in NF learning and in immunological outcome measures. Moreover, the investigators will track changes in this score along the experiment in order to inspect the relationship between subjective hedonic experience and NF success/immune functioning.</description>

    <description>A questionnaire for assessing responsiveness to reward and punishment. The questionnaire includes 48 yes/no questions divided into two scales - sensitivity to punishment (SP) and sensitivity to reward (SR). Each sub-scale score is derived by summation of the reports.
Exploratory analysis: the investigators will examine whether the questionnaire score during the first session (prior to NF practice and vaccination), will account for differences in NF learning and in immunological outcome measures.</description>
