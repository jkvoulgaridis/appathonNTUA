    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effects of various types of ultrasound therapy: continuous, pulsed,
      sham ultrasound and ultrasound combined with electrotherapy in patients with hip
      osteoarthritis. Beside ultrasound therapy, patients received usual physiotherapy
      (balneotherapy, exercise and massage) either.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During ultrasound therapy electrical energy is converted into mechanical energy and heat. It
      has physical, chemical and biologic effects, like thermal effect, micro-massage, increased
      tissue metabolism, capillary permeability and tissue healing. Continuous or pulsed forms can
      be applied.

      As pulsed ultrasound therapy has no thermal effect, greater intensity can be used. It can
      alleviate acute pain and inflammation. Continuous ultrasound is usually used in chronic
      musculoskeletal diseases, in case of limitation of joint motion because its thermal effect.

      Ultrasound can be combined with electrotherapy, when the effects of the two modalities are
      summed up.

    <description>change from baseline Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) at week 2. It is comprised of 24 items divided into three subscales: Pain (5 items), stiffness (2 items), and physical function (17 items). All the items are scored on a 100mm visual analogue scale. Values are summed up for a combined WOMAC score. The lower score represents better outcome.</description>

    <description>change from baseline physical function measured by the 6-minute walking test. The test measures the distance an individual is able to walk over a total of six minutes on a hard, flat surface. Patients can walk at a self chosen walking speed, can have a rest or can use a walking aid. The accomplished distance is the total distance at the end of the 6 minutes.</description>

    <description>change from baseline quality of life (36-Item Short Form Health Survey /SF-36/) at week 2. It consists of eight scaled scores (vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning, mental health), which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more the disability, i.e. a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability.</description>
