  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the efficacy and safety of autologous adipose
      mesenchymal stem cells in the treatment of early knee arthritis. Investigator believes that
      autologous adipose mesenchymal stem cells can relieve pain, improve knee function, promote
      knee cartilage regeneration and improve life satisfaction of patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators extracted abdominal fat from eight patients, extracted autologous adipose
      mesenchymal stem cells and injected them into the knee joint of the patients. The data were
      followed up regularly after operation and compared with those before operation.

But it did not exceed the articular surface; in grade III, the shape of meniscus was irregular and incomplete. Irregular or linear high signal appeared in the meniscus and extended to the articular surface of meniscus. The grade I and II symptoms of meniscus injury were mild, suggesting meniscus degeneration, and grade III suggesting meniscus tear.</description>
