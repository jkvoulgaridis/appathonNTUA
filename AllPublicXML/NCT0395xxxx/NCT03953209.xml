  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to prospectively gather data on the efficacy and tolerability of
      spironolactone to treat refractory melasma and to compare treatment response of randomized 50
      mg, 100mg, and 200mg per day dosing.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Melasma is a common, acquired condition of the skin characterized by symmetric reticulated
      hyperpigmented patches, most often of the central face and mandible.

      An array of treatment modalities encompassing topical, oral, procedural, and combination
      therapies have been used to treat the disorder, with varying levels of immediate and
      long-term efficacy. Current treatment options are often unsuccessful in inducing complete
      disease remission. The tolerability of certain treatments is a valid concern, with adverse
      reactions such as irritation, peeling, burning, and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation a
      common occurrence. Antiandrogens like spironolactone have been successfully used as
      adjunctive treatment for melasma. However, evidence for its off-label use for this purpose
      remains anecdotal. Clinical data regarding its efficacy and dosing are absent from the
      literature and are likely barriers to the drug's use in melasma. The high relapse rates and
      unfavorable side effect profiles of traditional treatment regimens underlie the need for an
      improved multimodal approach.

      This prospective, randomized trial seeks to obtain information about the efficacy and
      tolerability of spironolactone to treat refractory melasma to guide future studies and
      clinical decision making. Participants will be randomized to one of the three dosage groups
      and take the study drug for 12 weeks. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, week 6, week 12,
      and week 16. Subjects may opt to participate in a treatment extension period of up to 9
      additional months, in which they will return to clinic monthly for outcome assessment.
