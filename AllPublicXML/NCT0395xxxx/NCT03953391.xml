  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sedentary behaviour of healthy subjects may have a detrimental impact on cerebral blood flow
      as well as cognitive measures related to mood and alertness. In this study we focus on the
      impact of leaving the desk to consume a cup of tea at regular intervals during a sedentary
      working day.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prolonged desk work has detrimental impact on cerebral blood flow as well as cognitive
      measures related to mood and alertness caused. These effects might be prevented by taking
      short breaks with physical activity. Usually, desk workers have short breaks during office
      times for either a visit to the restroom or to enjoy for a moment a (hot) drink. Consumption
      of tea has been associated with benefits related to attention, alertness, mood and
      creativity. This study focuses on the impact of physically leaving the desk to prepare and
      consume a cup of tea at regular intervals during a sedentary working day.

    <description>Dynamic cerebrovascular autoregulation is assessed via squat-stand manoeuvres performed to elicit oscillations in blood pressure within the high-pass filter frequency range (&lt;0.20 Hz) of the cerebrovascular. Squat-stand cycles are performed at 0.2 Hz (2.5-seconds squatting, followed by 2.5-seconds standing) and at 0.1 Hz (5-seconds squatting, followed by 5-seconds standing) for 5-minutes each, separated by a 5-minute rest.
Transfer function analysis is conducted on the beat-to-beat blood pressure and middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity mean signals to produce values of gain (damping effect of Cerebrovascular autoregulation on the magnitude of blood pressure oscillations).</description>

    <time_frame>Before (0) and at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 hours during tea and water interventions. Both dimensions will be tested in a repeated measures linear mixed model. The treatment effect is the difference in the least square means of tea versus water.</time_frame>
