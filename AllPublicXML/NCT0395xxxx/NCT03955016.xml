    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the impact of a personalized, partly supervised
      rehabilitation program on the exercise capacity in patients with pulmonary hypertension. The
      rehabilitation program consists of 2 weeks inpatient, 2 weeks ambulatory and 11 weeks home
      based rehabilitation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study is a 15 weeks, randomized (1:1) controlled trial. Patients in both groups
      will not change their usual medical treatment. After 2 clinical visits (screening and
      randomization visit), patients in the intervention group will follow a 15 week rehabilitation
      program consisting of 2 weeks inpatient, 2 weeks outpatient and 11 weeks home based
      rehabilitation. At the end of the outpatient rehabilitation phase (week 4) and the home-based
      program (week 15), clinical outcomes will be reassessed.
