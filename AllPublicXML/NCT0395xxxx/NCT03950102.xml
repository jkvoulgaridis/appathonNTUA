  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, prospective study to assess the efficacy and safety of using
      stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) as bridging treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma
      (HCC) patients on transplant waitlist.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study population includes patients 18 years of age or older with HCC, who are accepted on
      waiting list for deceased donor liver transplantation (DDLT).

      Patient will be assessed in a multidisciplinary committee and they will receive SBRT unless
      otherwise contraindicated. Patients will undergo SBRT under standard protocol.

      Patients with HCC beyond University of California, San Francisco criteria (UCSF) will be
      removed from waitlist.
