  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ANRS EP66 SEPTAVIH Study aims to screen feasibility of evaluating frailty in people
      living with HIV aged 70 or older, to estimate its prevalence, to analyse associated risk
      factors and to evaluate the impact of frailty on pejorative events.

      SEPTAVIH is a French, multicentre, prospective, observational study which will include 500
      HIV-infected participants

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to assess the prevalence of frailty at baseline in People living
      with HIV (PLWH) aged 70 years and older, using the Fried index.

      The main secondary objectives of this study are :

        -  To assess frequency frailty according to different indexes or scores (Fried, Health
           deficits Index, HAS score, VACS index)

        -  To evaluate the association between frailty and specific HIV-related characteristics
           (for example known duration of HIV infection), or non-specific factors (such as non-
           HIV-related diseases or living conditions)

        -  Proportion of subjects with a pejorative event at 12 months of follow-up (recurrent or
           serious falls, emergency department visit, unscheduled hospitalization,
           institutionalization, loss of one point on the IADL scale or death)

        -  Association between baseline evaluation of frailty and pejorative events incidence
           during the 12 months of follow-up.

        -  Transition between frail or non frail status during the 12 months of follow-up

        -  To assess the prevalence of sarcopenia and osteoporosis

        -  To describe study population including :

             -  Demographic characteristics

             -  HIV medical history and antiretroviral therapy

             -  Comorbidities, polymedication and evaluation of drug-drug interactions

             -  Mental Health, quality of life, socioeconomic status

             -  Healthcare use and additional care implementation (nursing, physical therapy, home
                care services, …)

        -  Assessment of Inflammatory and Immunosenescence biomarkers at Baseline

        -  Anthropologic substudy about hiv and polypathologies management

        -  Focus COVID-19 with clinical questionnaire, self-administrated questionnaire, SARS CoV2
           serology and biobank (serum library)
