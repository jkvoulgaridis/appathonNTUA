  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will investigate the enrichment type, in pancakes, most effective at
      improving markers of metabolic syndrome. Ready-made pancakes enriched with either
      docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), beta-glucan (BG) or anthocyanins (AC), alone or in combination of
      DHA+BG or DHA+AC, will be consumed for 4 weeks.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is scientific evidence to support health claims that docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an
      omega-3 fatty acid, and beta-glucan (BG), a soluble plant fibre, can help to maintain healthy
      cholesterol and triglyceride levels. It is also reported that anthocyanins (AC), colour
      pigments found in many dietary plants, can lower concentrations of low-density lipoprotein
      (LDL) cholesterol and increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol in dyslipidemic
      adults. Research studies often focus on bioactives administered as supplements, this study
      will also investigate the effectiveness of the food matrix. The project addresses the
      exploitation of bioactive compounds extracted from natural food sources that when added as
      ingredients to foods and consumed within the common diet, could significantly benefit human
      health and wellbeing.
