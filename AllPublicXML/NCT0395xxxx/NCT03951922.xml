  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this quasi-experimental study is to explore the impact of a therapeutic
      horticulture program as an occupation-based intervention to address chronic pain symptoms for
      cancer survivors. The main objectives are to assess participants' perceptions of pain,
      physical and psychosocial wellness, stress management, and quality of life at pre-, post-,
      and 3-month follow-up. Quantitative and qualitative data will be synthesized and analyzed to
      explore this phenomenon.

    <measure>Salivary Cortisol Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Change between baseline and three months</time_frame>
    <description>Participant stress level will be determined by salivary cortisol levels. Participant's salivary cortisol level will be measured at awakening, 30 minutes following awakening and bedtime. Typically, there is Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR), which is a steep rise in cortisol output during the first 30 minutes following awakening, followed by a steady decline across the morning, afternoon, and evening hours, with the daily nadir typically occurring around midnight. Flattened diurnal cortisol slope relates to increased emotional and psychosocial stress and related to worse health outcomes.
The typical Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR) is defined as an increase of at least 2.5 nmol/l from the cortisol level taken at awakening. Although there are no agreed norms for the absolute concentrations of free cortisol in saliva it typically ranges between 4.7-18.5 nmol/l for post-awakening, between 8.6-21.9 nmol/l for 30 minutes post-awakening, and 0.3-15.2 nmol/l for bedtime.</description>
