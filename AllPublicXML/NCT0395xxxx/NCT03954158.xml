    <measure>Change From Baseline in Total Sign Score (TSS) in Target Lesions at Day 15: Crisaborole Ointment 2% Versus Vehicle</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>Lesion TSS was an assessment of the target lesion severity, which was based on severity of 4 clinical signs erythema, induration/papulation, excoriation and lichenification. All of these 4 signs were rated on a scale of 0 to 3 (0= none, 1= mild, 2= moderate, 3= severe). These ratings were added to create a total TSS score; ranging from 0 (none) to 12 (most severe), with higher score representing greater severity.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Investigator's Static Global Assessment (ISGA) Score in Target Lesions at Day 8 and Day 15</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 8, Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>ISGA assessed the severity of AD on a 5-point scale ranged from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe), where higher scores indicated higher degree of AD. Grades for classification of severity: 0= clear (minor residual hypo/hyper pigmentation, no erythema or induration or papulation, no oozing or crusting), 1= almost clear (trace faint pink erythema, with barely perceptible induration or papulation and no oozing or crusting), 2= mild (faint pink erythema with mild induration or papulation and no oozing or crusting), 3= moderate (pink-red erythema with moderate induration or papulation with or without oozing or crusting) and 4= severe (deep or bright red erythema with severe induration or papulation and with oozing or crusting).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) in Target Lesions up to Day 15 in Participants Aged 12 Years or More</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15</time_frame>
    <description>The severity of itch (pruritus) due to AD at the target lesion was assessed using the peak pruritus NRS. Participants aged 12 years or more, were asked to rate their itch severity at the worst moment during the past 24 hours on a scale ranging from 0 (no itch) to 10 (worst itch imaginable); higher scores represented more severe itch.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Itch Severity Scale in Target Lesions up to Day 15 in Participants Aged Between 6 to 11 Years</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15</time_frame>
    <description>The itch severity scale was used for participants &gt;=6 to 11 years of age to assess severity of itch (pruritus) due to AD at the target lesion. In this assessment, participants were asked to choose a unit that showed how itchy their skin had been on day of assessment on a 5-point scale ranging from 1= not itchy to 5= very itchy, where higher scores represented more severe itch.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Observer Reported Itch Severity Numerical Rating Scale in Target Lesions up to Day 15 in Participants Aged Between 2 to 11 Years</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15</time_frame>
    <description>Observer reported itch severity NRS was used for participants &gt;=2 and &lt; 12 years of age to assess severity of itch (pruritus) due to AD at the target lesion. Parents/caregivers (of participants) were asked to rate participants' itch (i.e. scratching, rubbing) at the worst moment during past 24 hours on a scale of 0 (no itch) to 10 (worst itch imaginable); higher scores represented more severe itch.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (AEs) in the Target Lesions Per Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Preferred Term</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 up to 35 days after end of treatment (maximum up to Day 50)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. Treatment-emergent were events between first dose of study drug and up to end of study that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pre-treatment state. For this outcome measure, treatment-emergent AEs occurred at each treated target lesion were summarized. MedDRA version 22.1 coding dictionary was used.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Total Sign Score (TSS) in Target Lesions at Day 15: Crisaborole Ointment 2% Versus Vehicle</title>
        <description>Lesion TSS was an assessment of the target lesion severity, which was based on severity of 4 clinical signs erythema, induration/papulation, excoriation and lichenification. All of these 4 signs were rated on a scale of 0 to 3 (0= none, 1= mild, 2= moderate, 3= severe). These ratings were added to create a total TSS score; ranging from 0 (none) to 12 (most severe), with higher score representing greater severity.</description>

        <description>Lesion TSS was an assessment of the target lesion severity, which was based on severity of 4 clinical signs erythema, induration/papulation, excoriation and lichenification. All of these 4 signs were rated on a scale of 0 to 3 (0= none, 1= mild, 2= moderate, 3= severe). These ratings were added to create a total TSS score; ranging from 0 (none) to 12 (most severe), with higher score representing greater severity.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Investigator's Static Global Assessment (ISGA) Score in Target Lesions at Day 8 and Day 15</title>
        <description>ISGA assessed the severity of AD on a 5-point scale ranged from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe), where higher scores indicated higher degree of AD. Grades for classification of severity: 0= clear (minor residual hypo/hyper pigmentation, no erythema or induration or papulation, no oozing or crusting), 1= almost clear (trace faint pink erythema, with barely perceptible induration or papulation and no oozing or crusting), 2= mild (faint pink erythema with mild induration or papulation and no oozing or crusting), 3= moderate (pink-red erythema with moderate induration or papulation with or without oozing or crusting) and 4= severe (deep or bright red erythema with severe induration or papulation and with oozing or crusting).</description>

        <population>FAS included all participants who were randomized and received greater than or equal to 1 dose of investigational product. Here, “Number Analyzed” signifies number of participants evaluable at specified time points.</population>

Participants aged 12 years or more, were asked to rate their itch severity at the worst moment during the past 24 hours on a scale ranging from 0 (no itch) to 10 (worst itch imaginable); higher scores represented more severe itch.</description>
          <population>FAS included all participants who were randomized and received greater than or equal to 1 dose of investigational product.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Itch Severity Scale in Target Lesions up to Day 15 in Participants Aged Between 6 to 11 Years</title>
        <description>The itch severity scale was used for participants &gt;=6 to 11 years of age to assess severity of itch (pruritus) due to AD at the target lesion. In this assessment, participants were asked to choose a unit that showed how itchy their skin had been on day of assessment on a 5-point scale ranging from 1= not itchy to 5= very itchy, where higher scores represented more severe itch.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Day 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15</time_frame>
        <population>Analysis population included all participants who were randomized and received greater than or equal to 1 dose of investigational product and aged between 6 to 11 years.

        <description>Observer reported itch severity NRS was used for participants &gt;=2 and &lt; 12 years of age to assess severity of itch (pruritus) due to AD at the target lesion. Parents/caregivers (of participants) were asked to rate participants' itch (i.e. scratching, rubbing) at the worst moment during past 24 hours on a scale of 0 (no itch) to 10 (worst itch imaginable); higher scores represented more severe itch.</description>

        <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; Initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent were events between first dose of study drug and up to end of study that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pre-treatment state.</description>
