  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, Phase 1b/2 trial for adults with advanced melanoma. The objective of
      the Phase 1b portion of the study is to establish the recommended Phase 2 dose of
      cabozantinib in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with unresectable melanoma and
      assess the safety and tolerability of the combined treatments. The objective of the Phase 2
      portion of the study is to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of the established dose of
      cabozantinib in combination with pembrolizumab as measured by best overall response rate
      (ORR) (complete response [CR] + partial response [PR]) with the combination of agents in
      patients with unresectable stage III or stage IV melanoma.

          -  Patient has a known history of or is positive for Hepatitis B (HBsAg reactive) or
             Hepatitis C (HCV RNA [qualitative] is detected). Patients will be tested for hepatitis
             B or C infections during screening if they are considered by the investigator to be at
             higher risk for these infections and have not been previously tested.

          -  Patient has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory
             abnormality that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the patient's
             participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of

               1. Low-dose aspirin for cardioprotection (per local applicable guidelines) is
                  permitted.

               2. Low-dose low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) are permitted.

               3. Anticoagulation with therapeutic doses of LMWH is allowed in subjects without
                  known brain metastases who are on a stable dose of LMWH for at least 6 weeks
                  before first dose of study treatment, and who have had no clinically significant

             not have received a strong CYP3A4 inducer within 12 days prior to registration nor a
             strong CYP3A4 inhibitor within 7 days prior to registration. Because the lists of
             these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a
             comprehensive list such as the one located at
             http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/.

        * Cardiovascular: The subject has a corrected QT interval calculated by the Fridericia
        formula (QTcF) &gt;/= 500ms within 14 days before Cycle 1 Day 1. Ejection fraction on Echo or
        MUGA &lt;/= 50%. NYHA class &gt;/= 3. Note: If a single ECG show a QTcF with an absolute value
        &lt;/= 500 ms, two additional ECGs at intervals of approximately 2 min must be performed
        within 30 min after the initial ECG, and the average of these three consecutive results for
        QTcF will be used to determine eligibility.
