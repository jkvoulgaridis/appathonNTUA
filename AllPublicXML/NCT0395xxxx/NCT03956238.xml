  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present project integrates previous research on factors associated with alcohol-involved
      sexual assault, with research on how intoxication alters attention and social perceptions in
      ways that increase the risk of sexual aggression and victimization. Specifically, this
      project examines whether alcohol intoxication on the part of a male perpetrator impairs
      attentional capacity and leads to a narrowing of the perceptual field causing a dehumanizing
      perspective of women as sexual objects for men's pleasure rather than individuals with
      thoughts and feelings, thereby increasing the propensity for sexual aggression. The present
      research also examines whether women's responses to this sexual objectification from men
      interfere with risk perception in sexual situations, particularly when women are drinking,
      increasing the likelihood of sexual victimization.

    <textblock>
      These studies will provide a comprehensive test of our proposed model of alcohol-involved
      sexual assault that includes situation-specific mechanisms and key moderators of sexual
      violence. Specifically, hypotheses will be tested in the context of two carefully controlled
      laboratory studies. In Study 1, laboratory alcohol administration procedures will be used to
      manipulate intoxication (vs. placebo control) in men. Impaired attention and objectification
      will then be measured multi-modally including behavioral, self-report, and implicit measures.
      Finally, sexual aggression will be measured with a laboratory-based analogue of sexual
      assault. Study 2 will include women and follow the same alcohol administration procedures as
      Study 1. Additionally, mirroring men's objectification, objectifying gazes (vs. eye gazes)
      will also be manipulated. Impaired attention, self-objectification, and decreased sexual risk
      perceptions will then be assessed. Prior the laboratory visit, all participants will complete
      a battery of questionnaires to assess key moderators including a history of sexual assault
      perpetration and victimization, prior sexual objectification and self-objectification, as
      well as alcohol-related sex expectances and rape myth acceptance. The overall model will be
      analyzed within a conditional process model framework.

    <description>Male participants wear a portable eye tracker and discuss media preferences with a female confederate while dwell time on the female confederate's face and body is monitored (longer dwell times on the woman's body and shorter dwell times on the woman's face indicate more sexual objectification)</description>

    <description>On a computer, male participants sort stimuli words representing the categories object (e.g., tool), human (e.g., person), women (e.g., female), and men (male). Participants must respond as quickly and accurately as possible to categorize the words on a computer screen to object, human, women, and men categories via a computer key press. Responding faster to object and woman words and slower to woman and human words indicates implicit objectification of women</description>

Participants must respond as quickly and accurately as possible to categorize the words on a computer screen to object, human, me, and others categories via a computer key press. Responding faster to object and me words and slower to human and me words indicates implicit self-objectification.</description>
