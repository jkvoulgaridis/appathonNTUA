  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the product use and adaptation in adult, current
      cigarette smoking subjects between baseline and after one month of use of one of two P3P
      variants. The effect of P3P use behavior on nicotine pharmacokinetic (PK) profile,
      acceptability, as well as the safety and tolerability of P3P over a period of 1 month will be
      investigated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of daily use of up to 15 P3P products over one month, including 2 confinement
      periods (2 overnight stays at the beginning of the study and 1 overnight stay at the end of
      the exposure period). During the confinement visits, nicotine PK from P3P exposure will be
      assessed as well as pharmacodynamic effects related to craving, sensory parameters, product
      experience, and product acceptance.

      Between the two confinement periods, subjects will return to the investigational site for
      weekly ambulatory visits during which product will be resupplied and selected safety and
      other study assessments will be performed.

      From the start of the exposure period onwards, subjects will be instructed not to smoke or
      use other tobacco or nicotine containing products and to use P3P exclusively.
