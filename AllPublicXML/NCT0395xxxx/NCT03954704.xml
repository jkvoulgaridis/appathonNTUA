  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For Phase 1a, the primary objectives of this study are to assess safety and tolerability and
      to define the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended
      Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of GS-1423 monotherapy in participants with advanced solid tumors.

      For Phase 1b Cohort 1 safety run-in, the primary objective is to assess safety and
      tolerability and to define the DLT and MTD or RP2D of GS-1423 in combination with a
      chemotherapy regimen in participants with unresectable, recurrent or metastatic gastric or
      gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma.

      For Phase 1b Cohort 1 post safety run-in, the primary objective is to assess the preliminary
      efficacy of GS-1423 in combination with a chemotherapy regimen in participants with
      unresectable, recurrent or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma, as
      assessed by the confirmed objective response rate (ORR).

    <arm_group_label>Phase 1a, Part A - Dose Escalation</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Part A will consist of dose escalation by an accelerated dosing design and a 3+3 dose escalation scheme. Participants will receive escalating dose levels GS-1423 of up to 30 mg/kg on Day 1 of each 2-week cycle (Q2W) for up to 1 year or until any progressive disease (PD) or unacceptable toxicity, substantial noncompliance with study procedures or study drug, study discontinuation or withdrawal from study.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Part B will consist of 2 adaptive cohorts. Based on PK, pharmacodynamics, and safety results from the Part A study, participants will be administered a flat dose of GS-1423 Q2W and/or every 3 weeks (Q3W) for up to 1 year or until any progressive disease (PD) or unacceptable toxicity, substantial noncompliance with study procedures or study drug, study discontinuation or withdrawal from study.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Phase 1b, Cohort 1 (Gastric)</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Safety run-in: A standard 3+3 dose escalation design will be used to determine the DLT and MTD or RP2D of GS-1423 in combination with mFOLFOX6. The planned starting dose of GS-1423 will be targeted to achieve the exposure at -1 dose of RP2D monotherapy (Q2W) determined from Phase 1a. GS-1423 will be administered in combination with mFOLFOX6.
Post safety run-in: Approximately 70 participants will be enrolled to receive GS-1423 at the dose level determined from the safety run-in period, in combination with mFOLFOX6 regimen.
Participants will receive GS-1423 on Day 1 of each 14-day cycle up to 2 years until PD, or unacceptable toxicity, substantial noncompliance with study procedures or study drug, study discontinuation or withdrawal from study. Participants will also receive mFOLFOX6 regimen Q2W for up to 12 cycles.</description>
