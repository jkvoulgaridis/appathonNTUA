  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to develop and test Motherly, a smartphone app to promote maternal
      mental health and child development. The Motherly app is visually appealing aimed at engaging
      the user with a minimalistic layout. The app will offer a gamified experience ideal for
      engaging youth in behaviors that can promote mental health, such as stimulating pleasure,
      productivity, and physical activities, connecting with peers, and eating healthy food.
      Pregnant women aged 16-34 living in Brazil will participate in the clinical trial to test the
      efficacy of the intervention.
