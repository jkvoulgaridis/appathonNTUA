  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to evaluate the effect of Nesinaact on non-alcoholic steatohepatitis
      through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based proton density-fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) and
      liver fibroscan in patients with type 2 diabetes. This is a prospective, open-label,
      single-arm, single-center clinical Study. After 24 weeks of Nesinaact 25/15 (Alogliptin
      benzoate 25mg, pioglitazone hydrochloride 15mg) treatment, the improvement of parameters
      estimated by MRI and liver fibroscan will be estimated.
