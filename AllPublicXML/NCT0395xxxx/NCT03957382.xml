    <description>Assessment of modified Rankin Scale
Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is a commonly used scale for measuring the degree of disability or dependence in the daily activities.
The scale runs from 0-6:
0 - No symptoms.
- No significant disability. Able to carry out all usual activities, despite some symptoms.
- Slight disability. Able to look after own affairs without assistance, but unable to carry out all previous activities.
- Moderate disability. Requires some help, but able to walk unassisted.
- Moderately severe disability. Unable to attend to own bodily needs without assistance, and unable to walk unassisted.
- Severe disability. Requires constant nursing care and attention, bedridden, incontinent.
- Dead.</description>
