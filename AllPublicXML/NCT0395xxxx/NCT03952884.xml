  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Skeletal muscle quality is an important determinant of exercise performance and overall
      health. It is vital for not just movement, but also metabolizing nutrients. Protein from the
      diet can promote muscle protein synthesis for muscle recovery and growth. More importantly,
      doing so shifts net protein balance positively (e.g. protein synthesis is greater than
      protein breakdown) and promotes greater rates of muscle protein turnover. Leucine is an amino
      acid required to build muscle, but it also acts as a signaling molecule informing the muscle
      to start protein synthesis. Before reaching skeletal muscle, dietary protein is digested into
      small peptides and free amino acids. Rate of absorption from the intestine to the blood
      stream is significantly faster for peptides compared to amino acids. As amino acid
      availability in the blood is a precursor for muscle protein synthesis, our objective is to
      determine if the different absorption rates between free amino acid and peptides influence
      muscle protein synthetic and breakdown rates.

    <measure>Fractional Synthetic Rate of Mixed Muscle Proteins</measure>
    <time_frame>Postabsorptive for 3.5 hours, Postprandial for 3 hours.</time_frame>
    <description>Mixed muscle protein synthesis rates will be assessed during the 3.5hr Postabsorptive period (e.g. non-fed state) and the 3hr postprandial period (e.g. fed state) for both experimental interventions (e.g. leucine and leucine peptide). This will allow us to assess the change in fractional synthetic rate from the Postabsorptive period to the postprandial period.</description>

    <measure>Fractional Breakdown Rate of Mixed Muscle Proteins</measure>
    <time_frame>Postprandial for 1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>Mixed muscle protein breakdown rates will be assessed during the first hour of the postprandial period (e.g. fed state) for both experimental interventions (e.g. leucine and leucine peptide). This will allow us to assess the change in fractional breakdown rate for each respective experimental intervention.</description>
