  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Health literacy is the ability to access, understand, evaluate and apply information in order
      to communicate with health professionals and understand health instructions but also,
      promote, maintain and improve health throughout life. Health literacy (HL) is known as a
      health determinant.

      An association has been shown between low HL and poorer health outcomes such as increased
      number of unscheduled hospitalisation or emergency visits, low medication adherence and poor
      health status.

      These have been particularly demonstrated with cardiovascular diseases, which combine risk
      factors (emergency hospitalization, reduction in the length of hospital stays, and complex
      secondary preventive drug treatments). Despite large scientific international literature
      about HL and health outcomes, no information is available in France on the prevalence of low
      HL level among patients managed for neuro-cardio-vascular diseases.

      It has been shown in other countries that healthcare professionals overestimate the HL level
      of their patients and do not adapt information to the HL level. Therefore, patients with low
      HL do not understand and/or are not able to use properly the information they receive.

      Having a better knowledge of HL level and characteristics in these patients is necessary to
      develop tools for helping healthcare professionals to identify patients with low HL level and
      to realize the role of HL as a determinant of health. It will also provide more precise
      information on the difficulties or needs of patients with different levels of health
      literacy.

    <description>Health literacy will be measured using the Brief Health Literacy Screening (BHLS) questionnaire.
The BHLS is known to screen quickly health literacy with 3 questions corresponding to 3 dimensions of the Health and Labour Questionnaire (HLQ): Enough information to manage health, Ability to actively engage with healthcare providers and Sufficient understanding to know what to do.</description>

    <description>All eligible patients included into one of the three existing cohorts studies of Hospices Civils de Lyon's hospitals: LOOP-HF, HIBISCUS-STEMI and HIBISCUS-STROKE
LOOP-HF (Registry of Congestive Heart Failure, NCT03422991),
HIBISCUS-STEMI (Prospective cohort with a heart attack from ST segment elevation myocardium admitted to the centre coronary angiography room participating investigators, NCT03070496)

    <intervention_name>To explore health literacy levels in patients hospitalized for acute neuro-cardiovascular diseases i.e. stroke, myocardial infarction, or heart failure</intervention_name>
    <description>All patients included and followed within one of the three cohorts studies: LOOP-HF, HIBISCUS-STEMI and HIBISCUS-STROKE who accepted to participate in the study, will be contacted by phone (attempted calls are set to 3 to reach the patient), mail or during a consultation, to answer to a health literacy questionnaire. The patient will participate in the study only once. The estimated duration is therefore estimated at 1 day for each patient and two month for the study. Thanks to the many following periods within the cohorts (6 months, 1 year and 18 month), we will measure health literacy at different times of the care.</description>
