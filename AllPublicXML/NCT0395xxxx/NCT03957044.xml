    <textblock>
      This study was conducted to clarify the effect of vestibular education for autistic children
      on &quot;sensory profile&quot; and &quot;postrotary nistagmus&quot;. In the study, the results of two groups were
      compared through the treatment of sensory entegration: the once who got the education and the
      once who did not. For this study, 26 autistic children were included who joined the &quot; Çatalca
      District Unit of Disabled the Project of No Disabilities &quot;, who were diagnosed with autism,
      who were 3-10 years (older than 36 months younger than 11 years).For each child, the analysis
      of the sensory entegration and nistagmus were applied twice; at the beginning and in the end
      of the research. At the beginning of the research the children were divided into two groups
      randomly drawn by lots. The first group was given the education of sensory entegration with
      vestibular education and the second group was given the education of sensory entegration
      without vestibular education. Both groups were educated for 10 weeks, 2 days a week with 40-
      minute sessions.

    <description>Tactical, proprioceptive, visual and auditory senses were used in sensory integrity training sessions. In this group, the training program on tactile, proprioceptive, visual and auditory sensory activities was carried out for 2 weeks and 40 minutes. Sensory integrity training was performed by the physiotherapist and in the sensory room.
At the end of the training sessions, mothers were informed about the application of sensory integrity training to daily activities.Sensory integrity therapy room added tactile, proprioceptive, visual and auditory sensory materials as well as materials for vestibular sensation. Vestibular sensory materials, skateboard, swing, hammock, bowl, ball, ball pool, slide, climbing bar, thrombolin and balance board were used.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The study included autistic children aged between 3 and 10 years (36 months, 11 years
             old) who were diagnosed with autism according to DSM-IV criteria. The families of all
             children who participated in the study were informed and their written permissions
             were obtained.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Children who were not diagnosed with autism and who had previously received treatment
             for sensory integrity were excluded. The children who participated in the study had
             independent walking problems, those with lack of extremity, those with hip
             dislocation, those with postural anomalies, those who had an operation, those with
             infectious diseases, those with additional diagnoses with autism (such as CP),
             patients with seizures, traumatic postpartum trauma, and motor development disorder.
             those with postural disorder were not included in the study
