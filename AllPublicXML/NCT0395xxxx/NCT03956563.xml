    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to clinically confirm, by comparison with a control
      group, the performance of the 10600 +1540 nm laser in the improvement of atrophic vaginal
      epithelium at 3 months after the last laser treatment.

      The secondary objectives are:

        1. Confirm the performance of 10600 +1540 nm laser in the improvement of atrophic vaginal
           epithelium at 9 months post-laser treatment, and compare it with the results at 3
           months.

        2. Evaluate the improvement of the GSM urinary symptoms and urinary incontinence (UI) and
           their impact on the Quality of Life, at each timepoint after the first laser treatment.

        3. To assess the Patient's Global Impression of Improvement (PGI) with the laser treatment

             -  For the GSM symptoms

             -  For the urinary symptoms and UI

        4. To assess the patient's satisfaction with the laser treatment.

             -  For the GSM symptoms

             -  For the urinary symptoms and UI.

    <description>The primary efficacy outcome measure in this study is to obtain on the atrophic vaginal epithelium at 3 months after the last laser treatment, values going from absent/low estrogenization (0-49%) to moderate or high estrogenization (50-64%) measured with VMV. The results will be compared between the treatment and the control arm.</description>
