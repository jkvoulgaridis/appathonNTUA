  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral blood contains enormous quantity of biological information that can improve our
      patient care. Investigators plan to use proteomics from serum to study its value in
      predicting the therapeutic response and toxicities of immunotherapy in non-small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC).

  <detailed_description>

      An extra tube of blood for research will be collected from consented subjects prior to the
      initiation of anti-PD-1/L1 based immunotherapy, either single agent or in combination with
      chemotherapy. The blood will be coded, processed and sent for analysis. Results of analysis
      will be correlated with clinical data to see whether serum proteomics can be a good
      therapeutic predictor for future studies and treatments of NSCLC.

    <description>An extra tube of peripheral blood (~10ml) will be collected prior to the treatment. This blood specimen will be spun down and the serum collected and aliquoted. ~1ml serum will be shipped to Biodesix Inc. for the analysis of blood proteomics using matrix-assisted laser/desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry. We will correlate proteomics data with patients clinical information including treatment response, toxicities, tumor mutation/PD-L1 status, etc. to determine if peripheral blood protemoics can predict therapeutic response.</description>
