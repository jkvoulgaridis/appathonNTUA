  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to determine the safety and activity of combined hormonal
      chemoimmunotherapy in a single-arm phase II trial of REGN2810, androgen deprivation therapy
      (ADT), and docetaxel in patients with newly metastatic, hormone-sensitive prostate cancer
      (mHSPC), using a primary endpoint of undetectable prostate-specific antigen (PSA) at 6
      months, defined from start of combination therapy (week 10) until 6 months (week 37).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The slow progress for notable trials in metastatic, hormone-sensitive disease is attributed
      to the long duration of follow-up required, as well as the focus on time-to-event end points,
      i.e. overall survival, in clinical trial design. These landmark trials (CHAARTED, STAMPEDE,
      LATITUDE), which used overall survival as their endpoints, required, on average, 10 years
      from start of trial to first peer-reviewed publication. Given the challenge of using
      traditional measures of response (RECIST criteria) when designing prostate cancer clinical
      trials, the Prostate Cancer Working group 2 (PCWG2) made trial-design recommendations. One
      was to separate treatment outcomes into early measures of response and later time-to-event
      measures of progression. The goal is to shift the trial objective to capture and reflect the
      actual effect of the tested treatment and, in doing so, provide a more timely drug
      development milieu for the metastatic patient. These early measure of response end points,
      such as undetectable PSA with testosterone recovery, are now being actively integrated into
      clinical trial design.

             therapy) at least 12 months after completing adjuvant or neoadjuvant hormonal therapy

                  thromboplastin time (PTT) ≤ 1.5 upper limit of normal (ULN) (except if on
                  therapeutic anticoagulation in which case the patient can be enrolled if stable
                  and anti-coagulation levels are appropriate for their condition per good clinical
                  practice).

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)(SGOT)/ alanine aminotransferase (ALT)(SGPT) ≤2.5
                  × institutional ULN

               -  Total bilirubin within normal institutional limits. Note: Patients with
                  hyperbilirubinemia clinically consistent with an inherited disorder of bilirubin
                  metabolism (e.g. Gilbert's syndrome) will be eligible at the discretion of the
                  treating physician and/or the principal investigator.

               -  Creatinine clearance of ≥ 30 mL/min. Creatinine clearance (CrCl) should be

         14. Agree to undergo serial tumor biopsies, unless medically contraindicated in the
             opinion of the treating physician, and discussed with the principal investigator

         15. The effects of REGN2810 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and
             because REGN2810 agents [as well as other therapeutic agents used in this trial] are
             known to be teratogenic, men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to
             use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study
             participation, and 4 months after completion of REGN2810 administration. Should a
             woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while her partner is participating in
             this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The subject must be excluded from participating in the trial if the subject:

          1. Received ADT or other hormonal agents within 6 months prior to entering the study or
             in the metastatic setting.

          2. Received prior immunotherapy (including inhibitors of programmed cell death protein 1
             (anti-PD-1), anti-PD-L1, anti-CTLA4, or Sipuleucel-T).

          3. Received prior chemotherapy for prostate cancer treatment.

             (i.e. with use of disease-modifying agents, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive
             drugs).

          8. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any
             other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial
             treatment.

          9. Has a diagnosed additional malignancy within 2 years prior to first dose of trial
             treatment with the exception of curatively treated basal cell carcinoma of the skin or
             squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.

         10. Has a known history of, or any evidence of, interstitial lung disease or active
             noninfectious pneumonitis.

         11. Peripheral neuropathy must be ≤ grade 1.

         12. Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.

         13. Has a history of current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator, including
             dialysis.

         14. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

         15. Has a known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies).

         16. Has untreated active Hepatitis B (HBV).

         17. Has dual infection with HBV/Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) or other hepatitis combinations at
             study entry.

         18. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy (Cycle 1,
             Day 1). Note: The killed virus vaccines used for seasonal influenza vaccines for
             injection are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., FluMist®) are live
             attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.

         19. Patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity reaction to docetaxel or other
             drugs formulated with polysorbate 80 must be excluded.
