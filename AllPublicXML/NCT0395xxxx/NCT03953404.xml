  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Septic shock is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. SIRS (systemic inflammatory
      response syndrome) can progress over hours to days to severe sepsis and septic shock.
      Currently, lactate levels are used to guide resuscitative efforts and have been shown to be a
      predictor of mortality independent of vital sign abnormalities (1). However, their use seems
      to be limited to trending in a given patient, and not for prognostic value of a single level
      (2). This is because there is significant overlap in lactate levels of individuals who
      progress to death and multisystem organ failure as compared to those who do not (2). Blood
      cultures are also extensively used to detect blood stream infection (BSI), but these are time
      consuming and are not immediately useful to clinicians caring for sick patients.

      A biomarker that adequately distinguishes between patients at high risk for progression to
      severe sepsis/shock/death and those who will not would be helpful in the appropriate
      initiation of aggressive treatment and appropriate disposition of patients in clinical care.
      Previously, the investigators demonstrated that sPLA2-IIA detected by ELISA assay had a
      sensitivity of 87% and a specificity of 91% in detecting sepsis (3). Zeus Pharmaceuticals has
      developed a bedside point-of-care test measuring sPLA2-IIA in real time. The investigators
      propose to study this assay in terms of its discriminatory value in distinguishing between
      SIRS from non-infectious causes, sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock in a cohort of
      patients presenting to the emergency department at Anderson and Bethlehem campuses. The
      investigators propose to better define the threshold level for this marker assay as well as
      seek to establish its utility in a clinical population.

      The investigators will take samples of blood from emergency department patients presenting
      who meet SIRS criteria or have a positive q-SOFA screen. The investigators will take
      subsequent samples of blood when lactate levels are redrawn as per St. Luke's sepsis
      protocol. After informed consent is obtained, blood specimens will be run in analyzer
      provided by Zeus for sPLA2-IIA. The investigators will record presence and quantity of
      sPLA2-IIA, as well as other markers of sepsis such as lactate, vital signs, blood cultures,
      and patient oriented outcomes (ie ICU days, organ dysfunction, and survival to discharge).
      Printouts from analyzer will be stored in locked cabinet, and remaining blood will be
      discarded. The data will then be compiled by the investigators at St. Luke's University
      Hospital. The results will be correlated with the patients' clinical progression to determine
      the biomarker's utility and cut-off values for predicting progression of SIRS.

      As clear threshold levels for this marker have yet to be defined, the investigators would
      like to enroll patients meeting criteria until the investigators have enrolled 50 patients
      with septic shock. It is anticipated that, proportionally, this will lead to enrollment of
      75-100 patients with severe sepsis, 100-150 patients with sepsis, and 100-150 patients
      meeting SIRS criteria who are not septic. This will help delineate if there is any value in
      this assay for distinguishing among the severity of sepsis pathophysiology.
