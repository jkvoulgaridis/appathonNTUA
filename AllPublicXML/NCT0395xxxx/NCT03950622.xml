  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of V114 with respect to
      the proportion of participants with adverse events (AEs). The primary hypotheses are that 1)
      V114 is noninferior to Prevnar 13® as measured by the serotype specific OPA GMTs for 13
      shared serotypes at 30 days postvaccination and that 2) V114 is superior to Prevnar 13® as
      measured by serotype-specific OPA GMTs for 2 unique serotypes in V114 at 30 days
      postvaccination.
