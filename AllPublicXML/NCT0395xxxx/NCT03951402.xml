  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effect of multiple oral administration of two doses of CG5503 PR (prolonged release)
      compared to placebo on the electrical activity of the heart were investigated. The rationale
      to perform this study was to exclude any effect of CG5503 on the heart rhythm. This study was
      a randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo- and moxifloxacin-controlled, 4-way
      cross-over study. Participants were given a combination of either CG5503 PR and placebo
      (medication with inactive ingredients which looks like the study drug) or moxifloxacin and
      placebo. Moxifloxacin was used as a positive control. It has consistently shown that it has
      an effect on the heart rhythm.

      Within 14 days prior to the first dosing, participants had a physical examination, a 12-lead
      electrocardiogram (ECG) was recorded and haematological, serological, biochemical, and urine
      analyses took place. A blood sample for optional genotyping of genes responsible for long QT
      syndrome was taken. During each dosing session, the participants were confined in the evening
      before baseline assessments were performed and stayed in the clinic until 48 hours after the
      last dosing. Study medication was administered on Day 1 and 2 in the morning (0.5 hours after
      breakfast) and in the evening (1.5 hours after dinner), and on Day 3 in the morning (0.5
      hours after breakfast). Dosing was separated by at least 7 days between the last dosing of
      each period and the first dosing of next period. Interim analysis of ECG-data were performed
      after completion of 24 participants (group 1) with possible subsequent adjustment of sample
      size for group 2.

    <intervention_model_description>This study was a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo- and moxifloxacin-controlled, 4-way cross-over study. The randomization was in the ratio 1:1:1:1. In all treatments the amount of administered tablets and capsules were the same. At the lower dose step the amount of tablets/capsules was adjusted with matching placebos. All study procedures were the same, irrespective of whether active compound, positive control or placebo was administered.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>On Day 0 drug-free baseline 12-lead ECGs were recorded (in supine position after at least 10 minutes of rest) at time points corresponding to those on Day 3. On Day 3, 12-lead ECGs were recorded prior to and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 24 hours after dosing. A regression analysis was applied for each participant to obtain an individual correction.</description>

    <measure>Withdrawal symptoms: 5 categories of COWS scale, sum of scores (of 11 items) and changes to placebo in sum of scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 4 and Day 5</time_frame>
    <description>The clinical opiate withdrawal scale (COWS) assessment consisted of 11 questions which rated the severity of opiate withdrawal symptoms, including resting pulse rate, gastrointestinal upset, sweating, restlessness, pupil size, tremor, anxiety or irritability, bone or joint aches, gooseflesh skin, yawning, and runny nose or tearing. Each symptom was rated on a scale from 0 (not present) to 4 or 5 (most severe). The total score was calculated by summing the 11 individual scores. Scores from 0 to 4 are considered &quot;no withdrawal&quot;, from 5 to 12 &quot;mild withdrawal&quot;, from 13 to 24 &quot;moderate withdrawal&quot;, 25 to 36 &quot;moderately severe withdrawal&quot; and above 36 &quot;severe withdrawal&quot;.</description>
