  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep disorders represent an important public health problem that cause important personal
      problems, absenteeism and considerable health costs. Although the main drugs used for the
      treatment of insomnia are still Benzodiazepines and Z-drugs (Zolpidem, Zopiclone, Zaleplon),
      these are not entirely effective and have numerous side effects that lead to poor compliance
      with therapy . For the treatment of sleep disorders, alternative non-pharmacological
      therapies have also been implemented, such as cognitive therapy, relaxation therapy, and the
      introduction of new agents, including the use of melatonin as a human endogenous molecule
      with low or zero toxicity.

      In Europe, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has stated that &quot;A cause and effect
      relationship is established between the consumption of melatonin and the alleviation of
      subjective feelings of jet lag. In order to present the declaration of health, the dose of
      melatonin should be between 0.5 and 5 mg and should be taken close to bedtime on the first
      day (and subsequent days) of the trip and the following days after arrival at destination.The
      target population is the general population &quot;. On the other hand, the EFSA states that &quot;A
      cause and effect relationship is established between the consumption of melatonin and the
      reduction of sleep onset latency. The Panel considers that to obtain the declared effect, 1
      mg of melatonin should be consumed near bedtime. The target population is the general
      population.&quot;

      The results of several studies in humans show that melatonin administered orally has a low
      bioavailability (approximately percentage) and a very short half-life. Therefore, it has been
      suggested that the sublingual route represents an attractive alternative for the
      administration of compounds that have a low bioavailability, since through this route, the
      substances are distributed throughout the body avoiding the loss of the compounds by their
      first-pass metabolism by the liver, as well as the loss by the process of absorption by the
      digestive system.

      On this basis the present hypothesis is posed: the administration of melatonin sublingually
      will have a greater bioavailability than the administration of melatonin orally.

      The main objective of this study was to quantify the bioavailability of 1 mg of melatonin
      when administered sublingually and orally.
