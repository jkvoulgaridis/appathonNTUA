      -  Aim: To evaluate the short-term effects of 16 week multi-modal exercise program on
           physical performance variables in independent community-dwelling older adults with knee
           osteoarthritis.

        -  Design: randomized controlled trial.

        -  Setting: home-based intervention.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC)</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It is a self-questionnaire consisting of 24 items divided into 3 sub-scales: pain (5 items): when walking on level ground, using stairs, in bed, sitting or lying down, and standing. Rigidity (2 items) morning and during the rest of the day. Functional capacity (17 items): use of stairs, getting up from sitting, standing, stooping, walking, getting in / out of a car, going shopping, putting on / taking off socks and / or socks, getting out of bed, lying on the bed, entering / leaving the shower / tub, sitting and getting up from the toilet, performing heavy and light household chores.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Numeric pain Rating Scale (NRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The NRS is a one-dimensional measure of pain intensity. The format is a line in which the participant selects a number between 0-10 that best reflects the intensity of the pain itself. A higher value corresponds to a greater intensity of pain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Timed 10-Meter Walk Test (10-MWT)</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It is a test for the evaluation of the usual and maximum gait speed along a distance of 10 meters corridor.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>6-Minute Walk Test (6-MWT)</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It is a test that evaluates the maximum distance a participant can walk during 6 minutes along a 30 meter long corridor.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Each session (48) starts with 7 minutes of moderate warm-up exercises focusing on mobility and flexibility. Secondly, the strengthening exercises consist of knee extensions, knee flexions, hip abductions, ankle plantar flexions, and ankle dorsiflexions. Thirdly, a set of balance exercises including knee bends, backwards walking, walking and turning around, sideways walking, tandem stance, tandem walk,one-leg stand, heel walking, toe walking, toe to heel walking backwards, sit-to-stand, and stair walking. Finally, participants are instructed to walk at their usual pace for at least 10 minutes.</description>
