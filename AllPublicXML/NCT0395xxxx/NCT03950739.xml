    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b safety and tolerability single-sequence study in which PAH subjects on a
      stable regimen of Tyvaso will switch to a corresponding dose of TreT.

      United Therapeutics Corporation (UTC) is developing a combination drug-device product which
      is comprised of a dry powder formulation of Treprostinil Inhalation Powder (TreT) and a
      small, portable, dry powder inhaler. In this Phase 1b safety and tolerability study, patients
      with PAH on a stable dose of Tyvaso (6 to 12 breaths 4 times daily [QID]) will be evaluated
      after switching to a corresponding dose of TreT. Patients will undergo PK assessments, safety
      assessments, a 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT), and questionnaires for satisfaction/preference for
      inhaled devices and patient-reported PAH symptoms and impact. Following 3 weeks of treatment
      with TreT, patients will be offered the opportunity to participate in the Optional Extension
      Phase until the study terminates or the drug/device becomes commercially available.

             ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or are not postmenopausal (defined as amenorrhea
             for at least 12 consecutive months). WOCBP must be nonpregnant (as confirmed by a

          7. Baseline 6MWD ≥150 m.

          8. If currently receiving other approved background therapy (eg, endothelin receptor
             antagonist or phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor or both), the subject must be on a

             for a 6MWT.

         12. Subject has had a new type of chronic therapy (including but not limited to oxygen, a
             different class of vasodilator, diuretic, and digoxin) for pulmonary hypertension

         13. Initiation of pulmonary rehabilitation within 12 weeks prior to the Baseline Visit.
