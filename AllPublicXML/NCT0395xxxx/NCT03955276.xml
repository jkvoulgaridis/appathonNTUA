  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to perform a prospective study that is histology-independent
      personalized navigation approach to cancer therapy based upon tumor molecular profile as
      determined by Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certified comprehensive
      genomic analysis. The molecular mutation profile will then be matched to existing,
      FDA-approved, targeted agents or to existing clinical trials using investigational agents for
      treatment of patients with incurable hematologic malignancies for whom no effective standard
      therapy exists or who have either exhausted or are intolerant of standard options.

      A sample of the subject's blood and/or tumor specimen will be collected during screening and
      prior to study treatment. The sample will be reviewed by hematopathology. Genomic
      /immunophenotypic studies will be performed to guide therapy selection.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with incurable hematologic malignancies with ≥50% 2-year cancer-associated
             mortality.

          -  Patients with relapsed/refractory hematologic malignancies, irrespective of 2-year
             mortality, who, in the opinion of the investigator, have no treatment option expected
             to yield significant clinical benefit.

          -  Patients with a rare tumor histology (i.e., fewer than 6 cases per 100,000 per year)
             with no approved therapies.

          -  Patients must have measurable disease for malignancies: defined as at least one lesion
             that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension with spiral CT scan, PET-CT,
             MRI, or calipers by clinical exam. Or presence of hematologic abnormalities with or
             without bone marrow involvement.

          -  Patients must have evaluable tissue/blood with adequate tumor content/purity for
             testing as specified by the molecular profiling lab. This will be obtained during the
             standard of care tumor diagnosis and tumor staging evaluation.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years.

          -  ECOG Performance Status 0-2.

          -  New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Classification I-II.

          -  Adequate organ function that reasonably allows for safe administration of therapy.

          -  At the time of treatment, patients should be off other anti-tumor agents for at least
             5 half-lives of the agent or 2 weeks from the last day of treatment, whichever is
             shorter, so long as there is recovery from clinically significant side effects from
             previous therapy to less than or equal Grade 1.

          -  Able to swallow and/or retain oral medication, if needed.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent.

          -  Female patients of childbearing potential must agree to use at least one form of
             contraception during the study.

        Patients must have at least one of the following for a diagnosis/disease status:

          1. Advanced symptomatic disease

          2. Medically unfit for standard therapy

          3. Disease where no conventional therapy leads to a survival benefit &gt; 3 months in the
             respective cohort and line of therapy for which the patient is otherwise eligible

          4. Actionable biologically informed targets determined by certified genomic profiling,
             immunophenotyping or other clinically validated techniques.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Severe or uncontrolled medical disorder that would, in the investigator's opinion,
             confound study analyses of treatment response or preclude the patient from safely
             receiving treatment (i.e. substance abuse or psychiatric illness/social situations
             that would limit compliance with study requirements).

          -  Pregnancy, breast-feeding women or any patient with childbearing potential not using
             adequate pregnancy prevention.

          -  Inadequate end organ function that would preclude safe administration of
             anti-neoplastic therapy; including hepatic dysfunction (LFTs &gt; 5 x normal limit, total
             bilirubin &gt; 3 and Cr &gt; 3 x normal limit or GFR &lt; 20 cc/min, or symptomatic heart
             failure (EF &lt; 20%), except when organ function impairment is a consequence of
             underlying malignancy and there is a reasonable expectation for improvement following
             initiation of appropriate therapy.

          -  Uncontrolled infections or sepsis. Patients with chronic viral infections (including
             HIV, HBV/HCV) that are controlled with appropriate concurrent therapy are allowed to
             participate in the study, provided ongoing compliance with antiviral therapy can be
             reasonably expected throughout the duration of the study. Patients with acute
             infections must start appropriate anti-microbial therapy and demonstrate stabilization
             of infection prior to study initiation.
