  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension is closely related to metabolic abnormalities such as obesity, dyslipidemia and
      diabetes. When hypertension is complicated with metabolic abnormalities, target organ damage
      is more serious, the risk of cardiovascular adverse events is greater, and the treatment is
      more complex. The pathophysiological mechanism of obesity-associated hypertension has its
      particularity. Blood pressure control and effective control of obesity are important
      therapeutic targets. At present, there are no guidelines for the treatment of
      obesity-associated hypertension. Although several drugs have certain effects on fat
      metabolism, they have little effect on blood pressure and have some side effects in long-term
      use. Among the existing antihypertensive drugs, angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT-1)
      antagonists have shown their particularity in improving glycolipid metabolism, but strict
      clinical trials are needed to confirm their effectiveness in weight loss and metabolism
      improvement. Previous studies have shown that obese patients with hypertension have severe
      insulin resistance, poor glycolipid metabolism and are prone to cardiovascular damage.
      Telmisartan can block AT-1 receptor and partially activate PPAR-γ, increase the expression of
      PPAR-γ target gene in preadipocytes, improve the function of visceral adipose tissue, and
      effectively prevent obesity-related cardiovascular diseases. It is presumed that telmisartan
      can act as a PPAR-γ agonist in clinic by altering the metabolic components and insulin
      sensitivity, but there is no clinical evidence for this. On the basis of previous studies,
      this study aims to evaluate the clinical efficacy of telmisartan or amlodipine in controlling
      blood pressure, reducing fat accumulation, improving insulin sensitivity, and reducing
      cardiac remodeling in obese patients with hypertension by prospective cohort study.

      At present, there are no guidelines for the treatment of obese patients with hypertension.
      Blood pressure control and effective control of obesity are important therapeutic targets for
      obesity-associated hypertension. Whether telmisartan can be used as PPAR-γ agonist, unlike
      other AT-1 receptor antagonists and calcium channel blockers amlodipine, can improve the
      visceral adipose tissue function and cardiac remodeling in obese patients with hypertension
      by altering their metabolic components and insulin sensitivity while controlling blood
      pressure. There is no evidence that telmisartan can reduce cardiac remodeling in obese
      patients with hypertension.

      1.Research contents:

        1. To evaluate the clinical efficacy of telmisartan or amlodipine in controlling blood
           pressure, reducing fat accumulation, improving glycolipid metabolism and insulin
           sensitivity, and reducing cardiac remodeling in obese patients with hypertension;

        2. To evaluate whether telmisartan can alter metabolic components and insulin sensitivity,
           improve visceral adipose tissue function and reduce cardiac remodeling in obese patients
           with hypertension by blocking AT-1 receptor and partially activating PPAR-gamma, which
           is different from other AT-1 receptor antagonists and calcium channel blockers
           amlodipine.
