  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The treatment landscape of metastatic NSCLC is rapidly evolving. There are new diagnostic and
      treatment options available in the coming months and years.

      New combination treatments will give different solutions to pneumo-oncologists who might be
      guided by certain patient and tumor characteristics.

      The link between patient and tumor characteristics in untreated stage IV NSCLC patients and
      systemic treatment needs further investigation, allowing the identification of possible
      treatment issues, data gaps and/or areas of improvement.

      This is a multicenter, non-interventional, cross-sectional study. Consecutive patients with
      metastatic stage IV NSCLC selected for systemic treatment or best supportive care will be
      included in the trial at the time the patient signed the informed consent form (ICF).
      Patients that were selected for systemic treatment, should have received at least their first
      dose and a maximum of one cycle of the same treatment.

      The pneumo-oncologist that treats the patient will fill in the CRF, indicating the systemic
      treatment option and the link with the variable categories that impacted the choice for a
      systemic treatment option.

        At least 200 stage IV NSCLC subjects treated in approximately 20 Belgian hospitals starting
        first-line treatment or best supportive care will be enrolled in line with inclusion and
        exclusion criteria. Assuming that three stage IV NSCLC subjects can be recruited per month
        per site, enrollment period has been set to 4 months. Only a maximum of 10% of subjects can
        be enrolled by one site.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have voluntarily agreed to participate by giving written informed consent/assent for
             the trial.

          -  Have a histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of stage IV NSCLC on
             first-line (1L) systemic treatment.

          -  Have received at least their first dose of the selected systemic treatment and a
             maximum of 1 cycle of the same treatment. Patients that were selected to receive best
             supportive care will not have to comply to this inclusion criterion.

          -  Be â‰¥ 18 years of age on day of signing informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has received prior systemic treatment for their metastatic NSCLC before the first dose
             of trial treatment. However, subjects who received adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy
             during an earlier stage of their disease, but evolved to stage IV, are eligible.

          -  TKI selected as first-line systemic treatment.

          -  Is participating in an interventional trial or medical need program.
