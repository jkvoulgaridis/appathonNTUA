  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the elective neck was treated to 40 Gray (Gy) (rather than the typical 56-60
      Gy), and nodal levels were entired spared radiotherapy if more than 1 echleon away from
      malignant lymphadenopathy. Thus far there have been no elective nodal recurrences.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is notable that the majority of disease sites treated with radiotherapy no longer receive
      elective/prophylactic radiotherapy to clinically-negative areas, including lung, pancreas,
      and lymphoma. Indeed, as will be discussed, these disease sites now employ involved nodal
      radiotherapy, or INRT, focusing on involved lymphadenopathy. In this study, we aim to improve
      acute and long-term toxicity of IMRT for OPC, LXC and hypopharyngeal cancer (HPX) by
      delivering INRT.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Pathologically-proven diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx, larynx,
             or hypopharynx. Squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary is not allowed.

          2. Patients must have clinically or radiographically evident measureable disease at the
             primary site and/or nodal stations. Diagnostic lymph node excision (&lt; 2 nodes) is also
             allowable.

          3. Patients may undergo a diagnostic or therapeutic transoral resection for a T1-2 tonsil
             or base of tongue cancer.

          4. Clinical stage I-IVB (AJCC, 7th edition); stages I-II glottic cancer are excluded

          6. ECOG Performance Status 0-2

          7. Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for
             the duration of study participation, and for 90 days following completion of therapy.
             Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this

               -  Has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months (i.e.,
                  has had menses at any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months).

          8. Negative serum pregnancy test within 2 weeks before registration for women of
             childbearing potential.

          9. Neck CT and/or neck MRI, and PET-CT (at least skull-to-thigh).

             after treatment, provided all other eligibility criteria are met .

          6. Prior invasive malignancy with an expected disease-free interval of less than 3 years.

             composition to the chemotherapy agents in this study (if necessary).

         11. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, would limit compliance with study requirements

         12. Subjects must not be pregnant or nursing due to the potential for congenital
             abnormalities and the potential of this regimen to harm nursing infants.

             allogeneic stem cell transplant.
