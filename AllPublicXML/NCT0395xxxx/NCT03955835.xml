      Study objective is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of acute permanent stenting of
      symptomatic intracranial stenosis following unsuccessful recanalization by thrombectomy in
      acute ischemic stroke with large vessel occlusion using the self-expandable Credo® stent
      together with the NeuroSpeed® PTA balloon catheter.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Acute ischemic stroke from large vessel occlusion (LVO)

          -  Failed recanalization after treatment with thrombectomy, i.e. persistent occlusion of
             intracranial internal carotid artery (ICA), proximal segment (M1, M2) of the middle
             cerebral artery (MCA) (TICI 0-1)

          -  Small to moderate infarct core prior to initiation of thrombectomy (CT ASPECTS 6-10,
             DWI lesion &lt; 70 ml)

          -  Suspected underlying stenosis of the occluded artery amenable to stenting by judgement
             of the treating neurointerventionalist

          -  Age 18- 80 years

          -  Informed consent (see below)

          -  Decision to perform angioplasty and stenting &lt; 12 hours of symptom onset

          -  Previous passage of occlusion with microcatheter obtained

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Large infarct core prior to initiation of thrombectomy (CT ASPECTS 0-5, DWI lesion &gt;
             70 ml)

          -  Vessel occlusion or stenosis of different known or suspected cause than
             atherosclerosis (e.g. vasculitis)

          -  Pre-stroke disability (MRS &gt; 2)

          -  Any sign of intracranial haemorrhage on brain imaging prior to thrombectomy

          -  Any sign of intracranial vessel perforation during thrombectomy

          -  Contraindication against treatment with double anti-platelet treatment

          -  Current effective use of oral anticoagulants (e.g. INR &gt; 1.7 for Vitamin K
             antagonists)

          -  More than 3 attempts for recanalization of target lesion prior to the use of the study
             device.

          -  Stenosis longer than the working length of the NeuroSpeed PTA balloon catheter.

          -  Diameter of the healthy vessel proximal and distal to the stenosis prevents save
             treatment with the NeuroSpeed PTA balloon catheter or is outside the indicated range
             of the Credo stent.

          -  Diameter of the target area is outside the indicated range of the Credo stent after
             predilation.

          -  Contraindication against anti-platelet or anticoagulation therapy

          -  Heavily calcified lesions that may prevent access or safe stent placement.

          -  Pregnant and breastfeeding women
