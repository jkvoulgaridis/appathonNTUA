  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aims of this pilot study are to examine the feasibility and to explore the effects of a
      physiotherapy treatment compared to standard usual care in gynecological cancer survivors
      with urinary incontinence in preparation of a large randomized controlled study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epidemiological studies demonstrated a growing number of gynecological cancer survivors, and
      this population is at great risk of developing pelvic floor dysfunction after cancer and its
      treatment. Representing the most prevalent pelvic floor dysfunction, urinary incontinence
      affects up to 70% of gynecological cancer survivors. International practice guidelines, in
      line with available meta-analysis, recommend physiotherapy as a first-line treatment to
      reduce urinary incontinence. However, there is limited evidence on its effectiveness in
      gynecological cancer survivors. Considering the current knowledge and the negative impacts of
      urinary incontinence, there is an urgent need to examine whether this population can benefit
      from this intervention in a pilot study, to conduct eventually a larger randomized controlled
      trial. The objectives of the present study are to examine the feasibility and to explore the
      effects of a physiotherapy treatment compared to standard usual care in gynecological cancer
      survivors with urinary incontinence. A total of 44 participants will be randomized to receive
      either physiotherapy or standard usual care (wait-list for physiotherapy). Baseline and
      post-treatment evaluations will be realized by a physiotherapist.
