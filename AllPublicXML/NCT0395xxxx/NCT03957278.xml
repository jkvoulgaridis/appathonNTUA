  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This purpose study is to demonstrate the safety and performance of the DAISe System used to
      remove clot in the brain during a stroke. This study will assess how well the device removes
      clot from the brain and how well patients recover from their stroke. This study plans to
      enroll 100 study patients at up to 10 hospitals in Europe. Study patients are followed for 3
      months after the procedure.

      The study is a prospective, multi-center, single arm study that will enroll a maximum of 90
      subjects, plus up to 50 roll-in subjects. A maximum of 10 sites in Europe will be involved in
      this study. The primary performance endpoint is successful revascularization defined as TICI
      2b-3 flow in the target vessel post-treatment of up to three passes with the DAISe System.
      The primary safety endpoint is symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage at 24 hours
      post-procedure as detected by CT/MRI with an NIHSS change of &gt;/=4. Subject will be followed
      through hospital discharge with a visit at Day 1 post procedure, Day 7 or prior to
      discharge/transfer, 30 days and 3 months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18 to 85 years.

             symptoms.

          -  Disabling stroke defined as a baseline NIHSS &gt; 6.

          -  Pre-stroke (24 hours prior to stroke onset) independent functional status in
             activities of daily living with modified Rankin Score 0-1.

          -  If thrombolytic therapy (tPA) is administered, it must be administered per the

          -  Confirmed symptomatic intracranial occlusion, based on single phase, multiphase or
             dynamic CTA, at one or more of the following locations: Carotid T/L, M1 MCA, or M1-MCA
             equivalent (2 or more M2-MCAs), or M2-MCA.

             4 OR CT criterion: ASPECTS &gt; 6

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  CT or MRI evidence of recent/ fresh hemorrhage on presentation.

             occlusion is chronic.

             judgement.

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Severe contrast allergy or absolute contraindication to iodinated contrast.

          -  No femoral pulses or very difficult endovascular access that will result in an
             inability to deliver endovascular therapy.

          -  Evidence of dissection in the carotid or middle cerebral arteries.

          -  Severe unilateral or bilateral carotid artery stenosis requiring treatment at the time
             of the procedure as determined during diagnostic angiography.

          -  Renal failure (serum creatinine level â‰¥ 4 mg/dL or on dialysis).

          -  Severe, sustained hypertension (SBP &gt;185 mmHg or DBP &gt;110 mmHg).

          -  Cerebral vasculitis.

          -  Suspicion of aortic dissection, presumed septic embolus or suspicion of bacterial
             endocarditis.

          -  Clinical symptoms suggestive of bilateral stroke or occlusions in multiple vascular
             territories (e.g., bilateral anterior circulation, or anterior/posterior circulation).

          -  Seizure due to stroke.

          -  Platelet count &lt; 50,000/mm3.

          -  A severe or fatal comorbid illness that will prevent improvement or follow-up or that
             will render the procedure unlikely to benefit the patient.

          -  Patient is unable or unwilling complete follow up visits.
