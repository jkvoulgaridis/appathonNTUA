  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endovascular treatment with stenting is currently used in the treatment of femoro-popliteal
      lesions. This technique tends to extend to lesions for which the gold standard remains until
      now the open surgery treatment (lesions TASC C and D).

      The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy at 12 months of the
      SuperA stent (Abbott) in the treatment of long de novo atherosclerotic lesions TASC C and D
      in patients with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease. The secondary objectives are to
      evaluate the clinical effectiveness of the SuperA stent at 24 months, according to clinical,
      morphological and haemodynamic criterias, the possible influence of calcifications and the
      quality of life of patients

      Patient will be recruiting during 1 year. Patient will be followed in the study during 2
      years. Pre-operative exams are collected. Patients are asked to give their oral authorization
      to participate in the study by their surgeon.

      Patient can be included up to the next day of the intervention.

      Endovascular treatment of femoropopliteal lesion with SuperA stents :

      Intervention will be achieved in operative room, under local anesthesia and sedation or
      general anesthesia. An angio-CT or an arteriography is necessary to attest the presence for
      TASC C or D lesion involving the superficial femoral and/or popliteal arteries.

      The long femoropopliteal lesion must be pre-dilated during 3 minutes with a balloon of 1mm
      diameter more than the stent to be implanted.

      A control arteriography will be done before the implantation of the stent and at the end of
      the intervention to assess the success of the procedure.

      If needed, endovascular treatment could be realized on the inflow or outflow in the same
      time.

      Patient follow-up :

      Patient follow-up is performed at 1, 6, 12 and 24 months. Follow-up will systematically
      include a clinical evaluation and a duplex scan with the ankle brachial index (ABI).

      The x-rays and the quality of life questionnaire will be done at 1, 12 and 24 months.

      All clinical surveillance events, complications and re-hospitalizations will be collected.
