  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this protocol is to use probabilistic reinforcement learning choice tasks
      and magnetic resonance neuroimaging to demonstrate the impact of problematic opioid use and
      opioid withdrawal on dynamic decision-making and reveal the neurobehavioral and
      neurobiological processes underlying abnormal task performance.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must meet moderate/severe criteria for moderate/severe opioid use disorder, report
             recent prescription or illicit opioid use, and be opioid dependent, as evidenced by
             either a urine sample positive for recent opioid use or being in frank withdrawal
             during screening.

          -  Female subjects must be using an effective form of birth control (e.g., birth control
             pills, surgical sterilization, IUD, cervical cap with a spermicide, or abstinence).

          -  Able to speak and read English

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of, or current, clinically significant physical disease (e.g., respiratory
             disease [asthma, COPD, sleep apnea], impaired cardiovascular functioning, seizure
             disorder or CNS tumors) or current or past history of psychiatric disorder that would
             limit compliance in the studies, other than substance use disorder.

          -  Meet diagnostic criteria for psychoactive substance use disorder for substances other
             than opioids (OUD subjects only) or nicotine that would require detoxification (i.e.,
             alcohol, benzodiazepines or barbiturates).

          -  Contraindications for MRI scanning (e.g., pacemaker, metal implants, claustrophobia,
             or any other implanted medical device).

          -  Vision or hearing problems that would preclude completion of experimental tasks.

          -  At risk for respiratory complications and have predictors of difficult bag mask
             ventilation (e.g., dentures, very full beard), in case emergency respiratory
             intervention is needed.

          -  Seeking treatment for SUD.
