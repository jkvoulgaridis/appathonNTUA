  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who are being scheduled for an operative procedure with an inpatient postoperative
      stay are eligible for this study. Participants will be selected to start a physical fitness
      plan or a nutrition plan at the time of surgical scheduling. Each participant will be asked
      to continue their current lifestyle for two days after their pre-operative appointment to get
      a baseline of activity (by pedometer and functional tests) and nutritional risk (by
      questionnaire). After two days, patients in the activity group will start their activity
      plans. They will be encouraged to get 10,000 steps per day and to perform whole body strength
      training exercises 3 times a week. Five days before and after surgery, participants in the
      nutrition group will be asked to consume a standard liquid nutrition supplement (i.e. Boost
      or Ensure) two times per day. Participants in the activity group will record steps and number
      of strength training sessions completed, while patients in the nutrition group will record
      the number of supplements consumed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Increases in physical activity and nutritional status are associated with improvements in a
      number of health conditions, including coronary artery disease, hypertension, stroke, insulin
      sensitivity, osteoporosis, and depression. Regretfully, despite the evidence supporting the
      benefits of physical activity, greater than half of adults in the United States do not get
      adequate activity and approximately one quarter do not get any activity. As such, many
      people, especially the elderly and those with comorbid diseases, have low levels of physical
      fitness. Additionally, up to 45% of community dwelling older adults are malnourished.
      Patients undergoing surgery with poor exercise tolerance and suboptimal nutritional status
      may be at an increased risk of perioperative complications. Thus, increasing physical
      activity and dietary intake quality prior to surgery is recommended, to hopefully decrease
      these risks. The primary objective is to determine if recommended physical activity or
      dietary intake results in an increase in patient physical function performance and if so, to
      what extent. The secondary goal is to examine if increased exercise or nutrition reduces
      perioperative complications.

    <time_frame>Baseline, Day of surgery (up to 50 days after Baseline), Follow-up (30 days after surgery)</time_frame>
    <description>Body Mass Index is a weight-to-height ratio, calculated by dividing one's weight in kilograms by the square of one's height in meters (kg/m^2) and used as an indicator of underweight, normal, overweight and obese weights.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Day of surgery (up to 50 days after Baseline), Follow-up (30 days after surgery)</time_frame>
    <description>The 6 minute walk test (6MWT) assesses distance, in meters, walked over 6 minutes as a sub-maximal test of aerobic capacity and endurance.</description>

    <measure>Change in grip strength</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day of surgery (up to 50 days after Baseline), Follow-up (30 days after surgery)</time_frame>
    <description>Hand grip is measured in pounds using a dynamometer to test the maximum isometric strength of the hand and forearm muscles. Grip strength is a measurement of muscle strength and tends to decline with frail states.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Day of surgery (up to 50 days after Baseline), Follow-up (30 days after surgery)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be timed, in seconds, to see how quickly they can rise from a chair, walk 3 meters, turn around, walk back, and sit down.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Day of surgery (up to 50 days after Baseline), Follow-up (30 days after surgery)</time_frame>
    <description>Nutritional risk will be assessed with the Short-Length Food Frequency Questionnaire. This 18-item instrument asks participants how frequently they consume certain foods, such as alcohol, produce, grains, and fried foods. There is not a summary score for this questionnaire, rather, the researchers can examine changes over time in foods consumed in a variety of ways.</description>

    <description>For the first two days after their pre-operative visit, participants will be asked to continue their present level of exercise and activity, which will be monitored by pedometer. Participants will begin the activity intervention on study Day 3. Participants will be instructed to take 10,000 steps per day, recording their daily steps with a pedometer. Participants also will be provided with resistance bands and instructed on how to safely perform 10 whole-body strength training exercises. They will be instructed to perform the exercises once per day, three days a week. Participants will complete the exercise intervention until they have surgery, which is typically 12 to 48 days after the pre-operative visit.</description>
