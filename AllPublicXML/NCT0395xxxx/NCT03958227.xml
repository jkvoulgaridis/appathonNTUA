  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the investigator's study is to compare the efficacy of manual therapy and exercise
      practices compared to exercise practice in patients with Glenohumeral Arthritis. Thirty
      volunteer patients will include into the study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will randomly divide into two groups. A common exercise program was applied to both
      groups during 15 sessions. Manual therapy techniques will apply to the manual therapy group
      in addition to exercise practices. Patients will evaluate in terms of functional status,
      pain, range of motion, muscle strength and health-related quality before and after 5 weeks of
      treatment. Also, patient's satisfaction from treatment will evaluate at the 5th week of the
      treatment. DASH and ASES forms for functional status, VAS for pain, digital goniometer for
      range of motion, manual muscle test for muscle strength, SF-12 for health-related quality of
      life, and Global Rating of Change (GRC) Scale for patient satisfaction will be used as
      evaluation criteria.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Shoulder Range of Motion (ROM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Evaluation will be performed first time at baseline and second time will be performed after 5 weeks rehabilitation program. After treatment &quot;change&quot; will be assessed.</time_frame>
    <description>The shoulder flexion, abduction, internal and external rotation ROM will be evaluated with digital goniometer while the patient will be in supine position.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>ASES (The American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Standardized Shoulder Assessment) Form</measure>
    <time_frame>Evaluation will be performed before treatment and after 5 weeks rehabilitation program.</time_frame>
    <description>ASES is an assessment form prepared by shoulder and elbow surgeons with objective and subjective sections. The total score is at least 0 and at most 100, and the high scores are positively correlated with the normal function.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Evaluation will be performed before treatment and after 5 weeks rehabilitation program.</time_frame>
    <description>The levels of pain is felted at rest / activity / night will be measured using Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).Patients will be asked to evaluate their pain status with a 10-point scale and high scores are positively correlated with pain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Manual Muscle Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Evaluation will be performed before treatment and after 5 weeks rehabilitation program.</time_frame>
    <description>Manual Muscle Test is a procedure for the evaluation of strength of individual muscle or muscles group, based upon the effective performance of a movement in relation to the forces of gravity or manual resistance through the available ROM.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Short Form 12 (SF-12)</measure>
    <time_frame>Evaluation will be performed before treatment and after 5 weeks rehabilitation program.</time_frame>
    <description>SF-12 will be used to assess physical and mental health-related quality of life. The total score is at least 0 and at most 100, and the high scores are positively correlated with high quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Global Rating of Change (GRC) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Evaluation will be performed after 5 weeks rehabilitation program.</time_frame>
    <description>Global Rating of Change (GRC) scale will be used to assess the overall satisfaction levels of the patients. Patients will be asked to evaluate their post-treatment status with a 5-point likert scale and high scores are positively correlated with satisfaction.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Evaluation will be performed before treatment and after 5 weeks rehabilitation program.</time_frame>
    <description>DASH questionnaire inquires about the activities of a person in daily life, the degree of participation in recreational activities, the symptom and psychosocial state that affects their pain, emotional state and sleep quality. The total score is at least 0 and at most 100, and the high scores are positively correlated with the increased functional impairment.</description>
