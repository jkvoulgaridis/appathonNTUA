  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      NSTE-ACS patients are more likely to exhibit high-risk plaque characteristics in non-culprit
      lesions. Both IVUS and OCT imaging techniques interact in a complementary manner to provide
      morphological characterization of the atherosclerotic coronary plaques and help
      identification of high-risk vulnerable plaques. Using morphological parameters obtained from
      OCT and IVUS, a new plaque vulnerability score will be established for more precise
      definition of the most vulnerable plaques that carry the greatest risk of rupture and
      subsequent detrimental clinical outcomes in the future. Such score might help in targeting
      these plaques with certain therapeutic interventions aiming to their stabilization.

      Patients with NSTE-ACS presented to the study site fulfilling the eligibility criteria during
      enrollment period of 1 year. The culprit lesion(s) being responsible for the acute event will
      be revascularized by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Both OCT (OPTISTM, St. Jude
      Medical Inc., St. Paul, MN, USA) and IVUS (Boston Scientific iLabTM Ultrasound Imaging
      System, MA, USA) will be performed after PCI to examine the non-culprit lesion(s) for
      detection of atherosclerotic plaques with the morphological characteristics consistent with
      high-risk plaques, namely &quot;Vulnerable plaques&quot;. Plaque characteristics from IVUS and OCT
      imaging will be merged to establish novel scores, which help improve diagnostic accuracy for
      detection of high-risk lesions. Correlations IVUS and OCT images will be performed to
      identify most reliable factors associated with plaque vulnerability.Patients will be followed
      up to 6 months after PCI for detection of major adverse cardiovascular outcomes (MACE) after
      ischaemia-driven revascularization of the culprit lesion(s).

        The study subjects are patients with history of non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome
        (NSTE-ACS):

        â€¢ *Diagnosis of NSTE-ACS: history of prolonged anginal pain (more 20 min) at rest, or
        recent instability of previously stable angina pectoris (at least Canadian Society
        Cardiovascular angina class III), or post-MI angina, together with ST segment or T wave
        changes. According to the results of cardiac biomarker, NSTE-ACS is subdivided into: NSTEMI
        (with +ve cardiac biomarkers) and unstable angina (with -ve cardiac biomarkers).
