  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol is the most harmful psychoactive substance in terms of overall damage. Though
      abstinence remains the objective of most pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches
      addressing alcohol use disorder, new therapeutic objectives of reduced alcohol intake and
      controlled-drinking have emerged. A standardized 10 weeks long, the &quot;ChoiziTaConso&quot; (CTC)
      therapeutic education program consisting in weekly workshops is one such non-pharmacological
      intervention that targets the recovery of conscious protective mechanisms with respect to
      alcohol use. The objective of our study is to measure the effectiveness of this
      non-pharmacological intervention in reducing alcohol-related harms.

      The evaluation of the CTC intervention will rely on a sequential explanatory design, where
      the qualitative study (25 semi-structured interviews) will assist in explaining and
      interpreting the findings of the controlled before-and-after quantitative study. The
      evolution of selected outcomes will be compared after 6 months between the treatment group
      (individuals entering CTC) and the control group (individuals with alcohol use disorder
      followed-up in standard addiction healthcare facilities).
