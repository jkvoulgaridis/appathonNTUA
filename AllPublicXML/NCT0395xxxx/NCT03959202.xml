  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive decline and sleep complaints are prevalent in older adults and severely affect
      older adults' physical health and quality of life. Sedentary lifestyle, which is reported by
      90% of older Americans, is an important risk factor for both cognitive decline and sleep
      disturbances. Although promoting physical activity has benefits to older adults' health,
      including sleep and cognition, traditional interventions to increase activity are challenging
      due to extensive staffing requirements and low adherence. Electronic activity monitors, such
      as wrist-worn accelerometers, can track heart rate, activity, and sleep to allow individuals
      to work towards personal activity and sleep goals. These appealing features make these
      devices ideal for interventions that aim to change behaviors and improve health outcomes.
      However, the efficacy of using electronic activity monitors to promote physical activity and
      health in older adults has not been examined.

      The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial in a cohort of older adults
      (without dementia) with both sedentary lifestyle and nocturnal sleep complaints to examine
      the effectiveness of a 24-week personalized behavioral intervention (compared to a control
      group) embedded within a smartwatch application in older adults. 94 cognitively intact elders
      will be enrolled and randomly allocated to intervention or control group. Participants in the
      intervention arm will receive a 2-hour in person education session, and personalized,
      circadian-based activity guidelines, with real time physical activity self-monitoring,
      interactive prompts, biweekly phone consultation with the research team, and financial
      incentives for achieving weekly physical activity goal. The control group will receive
      general education on physical activity in older adults and continue routine daily activity
      for 24 weeks. The global hypothesis is that the proposed intervention will result in
      increased physical activity, longer nocturnal sleep duration, and improved cognitive
      performance over the course of 24 weeks. In addition, plasma inflammatory biomarkers will be
      assessed to explore mechanisms for associations among the study outcomes.

    <time_frame>Week 1, Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>The Cogstate Brief Battery (CBB) will be used as the primary assessment of cognitive function. The CBB is a computer based cognitive battery that scores four core cognitive domains: processing speed, attention/vigilance, visual learning memory and visual working memory. The composite cognition score is the primary cognition measure used to measure global cognitive function. The score will range from 0-400, with a higher score indicating higher performance.</description>

    <description>In person training: Participants will receive a 2-hour in person education session with the exercise trainer. Self-monitoring: Subjects will self-monitor subjects' level of physical activity (steps &amp; minutes of moderate activity) using the smartwatch. . The Google calendar and Fitbit apps will send messages and alerts to the subject's smartwatch that encourage subjects to achieve subjects' daily goals. If a participant has low activity for 3 consecutive days, the research assistant will call the participant to either encourage the participant to adhere to the plan or provide a modified plan after consulting the exercise trainer. Phone consultation: Subjects will have biweekly phone consultation with the research team members to receive guidance and adjustment on activity plans.Financial incentives: The intervention will include financial incentives. Specifically, when the daily activity goal is achieved for more than four days per week, a $5 reward will be given to subjects.</description>
