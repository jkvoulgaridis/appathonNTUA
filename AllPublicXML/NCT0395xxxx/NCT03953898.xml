  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well olaparib works in treating patients with acute myeloid
      leukemia that has come back (relapsed) or does not respond to treatment (refractory), or
      myelodysplastic syndrome. Patients must also have a change in the gene called the IDH gene
      (IDH mutation). Olaparib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. This study is being done to see if olaparib is better or worse in
      treating acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome compared to the standard
      chemotherapy drugs.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the overall response rate (ORR) to olaparib in subjects with isocitrate
      dehydrogenase (IDH)1/2 mutant myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or IDH1/2-mutant acute myeloid
      leukemia (AML).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To establish the progression free survival (PFS) of patients with IDH mutant AML or MDS
      treated with olaparib.

      II. To determine the overall survival (OS) of patients with IDH mutant AML or MDS treated
      with olaparib.

      III. To establish the duration of response (DOR) to treatment with olaparib. IV. To evaluate
      the safety and tolerability of olaparib in AML or MDS patients.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To establish a relationship between treatment response and correlative studies such as
      plasma and bone marrow 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) levels, and IDH variant allele frequency.

      II. To evaluate persistence of double strand breaks in IDH 1/2 mutant AML or MDS.

      III. To evaluate response to therapy in the different IDH mutant genotypes.

      IV. To perform molecular profiling assays on malignant and normal tissues, including, but not
      limited to, whole exome sequencing (WES), ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing (RNAseq) order
      to:

      IVa. Identify potential predictive and prognostic biomarkers beyond any genomic alteration by
      which treatment may be assigned.

      IVb. Identify resistance mechanisms using genomic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)- and RNA-based
      assessment platforms.

      IVc. Identify whether minimal residual disease (MRD) can be used to correlate mutational
      clearance with clinical outcome in IDH-mutated patients treated with olaparib.

      V. To contribute genetic analysis data from de-identified biospecimens to Genomic Data
      Commons (GDC), a well annotated cancer molecular and clinical data repository, for current
      and future research; specimens will be annotated with key clinical data, including
      presentation, diagnosis, staging, summary treatment, and if possible, outcome.

      VI. To bank blood and bone marrow aspirate obtained from patients at the Experimental
      Therapeutics Clinical Trials Network (ETCTN) Biorepository at Nationwide Children's Hospital.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive olaparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for at least 90 days.

Will evaluate two different variables: MRD negativity (defined by the absence of detection of the IDH mutant in the sample) and the molecular response (defined by the log reduction of the frequency of the mutant allele). MRD negativity is a qualitative variable and will be reported as a percentage with 95% confidence interval for each time point and mutation. Will compare the different groups using a Chi-Square test. Molecular response is a quantitative variable reported as a median, min and max for each time point and we will use a student t test for the comparison of the different groups.</description>

             effective form of contraception if they are of childbearing potential.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia.

          -  Patients with active central nervous system (CNS) leukemia or requiring maintenance
             intrathecal chemotherapy.

          -  Patients receiving concurrent chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or immunotherapy for
             AML/MDS.

          -  Patients actively receiving any other investigational agents.

             patient.

          -  Hyperleukocytosis with &gt; 50,000 blasts/mcl. Hydroxyurea for blast count control is
             permitted before starting treatment and may be continued until day 28 of cycle 1. The
             maximum dose of hydrea will be 6 grams per day. Patients will be withdrawn from the
             study if &gt; 50,000 blasts/mcl occur or recur &gt; 14 days after starting treatment on the
             study.

          -  Active, uncontrolled infection. Patients with infection controlled with antibiotics

          -  Patients who are pregnant or nursing. Pregnant women are excluded from this study
             because olaparib is a PARP inhibitor with the potential for teratogenic or
             abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for AEs in
             nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with olaparib, breastfeeding
             should be discontinued if the mother is treated with olaparib. These potential risks
             may also apply to other agents used in this study.

          -  Resting electrocardiogram indicating uncontrolled, potentially reversible cardiac
             conditions, as judged by the investigator (e.g., unstable ischemia, uncontrolled
             symptomatic arrhythmia, congestive heart failure, corrected QT by Fridericia's formula

             prednisone daily, before and during the study as long as these were started at least 4
             weeks prior to treatment.

          -  Patients unable to swallow orally administered medication and patients with
             gastrointestinal disorders likely to interfere with absorption of the study
             medication.

          -  Any previous treatment with PARP inhibitor, including olaparib.

          -  Concomitant use of known strong (e.g., phenobarbital, enzalutamide, phenytoin,
             rifampicin, rifabutin, rifapentine, carbamazepine, nevirapine and St John's wort) or
             moderate CYP3A inducers (e.g., bosentan, efavirenz, modafinil). The required washout
             period prior to starting olaparib is 5 weeks for enzalutamide or phenobarbital and 3
             weeks for other agents.

             protocol therapy and/or with significant risk of clinical relapse within 12 months
             that would require treatment interfering with protocol therapy are excluded.

          -  Persistent toxicities (&gt; Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event [CTCAE] grade
             2) caused by previous cancer therapy, excluding alopecia.

          -  Patients receiving any systemic chemotherapy or radiotherapy (except for palliative
             reasons) within 3 weeks prior to study treatment.

          -  Concomitant use of known strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g. itraconazole, telithromycin,
             clarithromycin, protease inhibitors boosted with ritonavir or cobicistat, indinavir,
             saquinavir, nelfinavir, boceprevir, telaprevir) or moderate CYP3A inhibitors (e.g.
             ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, diltiazem, fluconazole, verapamil). The required washout
             period prior to starting olaparib is 2 weeks. Patients without reasonable alternative
             may be included in the trial after discussion with the medical monitor.
