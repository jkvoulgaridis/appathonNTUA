  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect ECG data after a single IVT injection of brolucizumab
      6 mg in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, open-label, multicenter study to collect ECG data after a single IVT
      injection of brolucizumab 6 mg in patients with nAMD. Triplicate 12-lead ECG recording will
      be performed at screening to determine eligibility. A second triplicate 12-lead ECG recording
      will be collected approximately 2h prior to the brolucizumab IVT injection on Day 1. Holter
      ECG recording will start approximately 1 h prior to the brolucizumab IVT injection and will
      end approximately 48h after the IVT injection. A third triplicate 12-lead ECG recording will
      be performed after the conclusion of Holter monitoring on Day 3.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Signed informed consent MUST be obtained prior to participation in the study

          -  Study eye is diagnosed with nAMD and deemed to be eligible for intravitreal injection
             at the discretion of the Investigator

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Concomitant conditions or ocular disorders in the study eye at screening which may
             cause safety concerns on the judgement of the investigator

          -  Any active intraocular or periocular or systemic infection or active intraocular
             inflammation at Baseline

          -  Treatment with any ocular intravitreal injection in the study eye within the past 7
             half lives prior to Baseline

          -  Intraocular surgery, prior long-acting therapeutic agent, or ocular drug release
             device implantation (approved or investigational) in the study eye any time during the
             past 3 months prior to Baseline

          -  Diagnosis of ECG abnormalities including:

          -  Clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias, e.g., atrial fibrillation, sustained
             ventricular tachycardia, and clinically significant second or third degree AV block
             without a pacemaker

          -  Familial long QT syndrome or known family history of Torsades de Pointes

          -  Resting heart rate &lt; 50 or &gt; 90 bpm at screening

          -  Resting QTcF ≥ 450 ms (male) or ≥ 460 ms (female) at screening

          -  Use of concomitant medications that are classified as known risk, conditional risk or
             possible risk to prolong QT/QTc interval within 7 half-lives prior to Baseline

          -  History of stroke (including transient ischemic attack, reversible ischemic
             neurological deficit, prolonged reversible ischemic neurological deficit) or
             myocardial infarction (ST or non-ST elevation myocardial infarction) at any time prior
             to baseline

          -  Chronic kidney disease as determined as a CrCL at screening of &lt; 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 as

             regulations (observational clinical studies solely involving over-the-counter
             vitamins, supplements, or diets are not exclusionary)
