  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Quality nutrient intake is essential for proper development and well-being of children in all
      aspects of health, including cognitive development. Eggs are of particular interest based on
      potential cognitive and neurological benefits due in part to significant concentrations of
      choline and lutein. While overall, choline and lutein have received considerable attention in
      the literature in relation to cognition and brain function, most studies involving intake in
      young adults have had short intervention periods ranging from 90 minutes to 3 days. Food
      insecurity has been associated with decreased academic performance. Given that populations
      with food insecurity have limited resources to direct towards nutrition, identifying how a
      widely available, highly versatile and largely affordable source of nutrients (i.e. eggs) may
      have favorable impacts on cognitive function and brain function will be valuable in informing
      public health recommendations in this at-risk population. As such the investigators will
      examine whether an increased egg consumption dietary prescription can have positive effects
      on functional activity (i.e. fMRI) during an Eriksen-Flanker task, anatomical changes in the
      brain (i.e. DTI, MRI), and cognitive abilities as measured by the Stop Signal Reaction Time
      task, Operation Span task, Raven's Progressive Matrices and the Boston Naming Task.
