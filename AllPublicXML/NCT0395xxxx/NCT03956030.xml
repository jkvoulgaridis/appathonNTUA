  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this study is to determine if distribution of a standardized educational
      handout on contraceptive options given to patients in the prenatal office setting will
      increase contraception use six months postpartum.

    <textblock>
      Reducing unintended pregnancies and those that are conceived within 18 months of a previous
      livebirth is an important health concern in the United States. Both unintended and
      close-interval pregnancies constitute 40% and 35% of pregnancies in the United States
      respectively with some overlap between the two categories and are associated with adverse
      maternal and fetal outcomes. A national survey found that 17.8% of women using
      'less-effective' methods and 23% of women using no birth control became pregnant in â‰¤18
      months2. Access to better contraception education could potentially decrease the proportion
      of unintended pregnancies and close-interval pregnancies. In addition to the health concerns,
      58% of women in the US would like more information about contraceptive options, and organized
      handouts on birth control have been shown to contribute to the choice in birth control.
      However, there has been conflicting evidence about which educational methods increase
      postpartum contraception use. Therefore, the investigators propose a randomized controlled
      trial (RCT) that assesses whether a handout on contraception options increases postpartum
      birth control use. The control group would receive a nutrition handout, and the intervention
      group would receive a handout on birth control options in addition to each receiving the
      standard of care. The researchers would also give pre- and post-natal questionnaires,
      covering patient satisfaction, intention to use birth control, and how often a provider
      discusses birth control options.
