  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some studies have compared the clinical profile during propofol induction anesthesia with
      Target-controlled infusion (TCI) and manually bolus showed similar control of anesthesia,
      such as depth of anaesthesia and hemodynamic stability, but did not use an objective measure
      of instantaneous autonomic activity during the brief time of induction anesthesia. In this
      study, TCI and manually bolus of propofol injection techniques during induction were studied
      with wavelet-based spectral analysis and the amplitudes of the pulse plethysmographic. The
      investigators hypothesized that during propofol induction anesthesia, the instantaneous ANS
      activities was more stable with TCI than traditional manually bolus

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Propofol induction anesthesia has been reported to be associated with cardiovascular
      depression and autonomic nervous system (ANS), which is an important neural control system
      for maintaining cardiovascular stability and plays a major role in regulating cardiovascular
      homeostasis. There are many methods for the administration induction of propofol, such as a
      manually bolus or target-controlled infusion (TCI) techniques. TCI devices could rapidly
      achieve and maintain the desired predicted concentration and is a more satisfactory technique
      to reduce the incidence of side effects and with the advantage of better hemodynamic control.
      More precise knowledge of how anesthetic agents modify ANS activity is important for
      understanding subsequent cardiovascular responses. However, there was no study using
      validated measurement of ANS index comparing propofol induction anaesthesia with TCI or
      manually bolus would have different effects on ANS.

        The subjects were selected from patients scheduled for surgery under general anesthesia.
        Exclusion criteria were recent administration of sedative or opioid drugs, emergency
        surgery and impairment of renal, hepatic, cardiac or respiratory function. No sedative or
        opioid drugs were administered before induction of anaesthesia.
