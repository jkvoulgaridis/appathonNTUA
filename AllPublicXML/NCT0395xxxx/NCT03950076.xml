      To assess whether edoxaban (60/30 mg daily) compared to non-antithrombotic medical therapy
      (either no antithrombotic therapy or antiplatelet monotherapy) reduces the risk of stroke
      (composite of ischemic, hemorrhagic and unspecified stroke) in high-risk atrial fibrillation
      (CHA2DS2-VASc ≥2) patients with previous intracranial hemorrhage.

             investigator, dependent person (e.g., employee or student of the investigational site)

               -  Post menopausal female subjects must be amenorrheic for ≥12 months prior to

                  negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to randomization or urine
                  pregnancy testing within 24 hours of randomization. Heterosexually active women
                  of childbearing potential must use highly effective methods of contraception for
