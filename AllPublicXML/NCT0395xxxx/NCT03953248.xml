    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to evaluate efficacy and safety of Alpha Lipoic Acid(ALA) as an
      adjuvant in the management of patients with acute phosphide poisoning.

      The study was carried out following approval of the research ethical committee of Tanta
      Faculty of Medicine on patients admitted to The Poison Control Unit (Emergency Hospitals,
      Tanta and Mansoura Universities) with acute phosphide poisoning in the period from January
      2016 to January 2018. A written informed consent was taken from each patient or his/her
      guardians (if the patient was unable to participate in the consent process). Confidentiality
      of the data was maintained by making code numbers for each patient. The investigators planned
      to conduct a randomized clinical trial to evaluate efficacy and safety of LC as an adjuvant
      in treatment of patients with acute phosphide poisoning. Fifty patients was randomized to LC
      or a non LC in a 1:1 ratio (25 patients in each group). LC was given IV, as a dose of 1 g/8
      hours. Patients was monitored and a detailed documentation of any adverse effect due to LC
      therapy was recorded.

      This intervention represented an added treatment to the existing standard of care. All
      patients will continue to receive standard treatment, which was determined by the attending
      physician who maintained clinical responsibility for all patients. It consisted of patient
      resuscitation, gastric decontamination (with sodium bicarbonate, and activated charcoal [1
      g/Kg, orally] in the first 6 hours after onset of poisoning), adequate hydration and
      supportive treatment. All the patients was followed up until discharge or death. All patients
      was subjected to:

      I. History. II. Clinical examination. III. Laboratory investigations: At admission and
      repeated before discharge.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients (male or female, aged 12 years or older) with symptomatic acute phosphide
             poisoning (deliberate or accidental), with diagnosis made on the basis of:

        The typical clinical manifestations due to and following shortly after a single exposure to
        phosphide.

        Reliable identification of the compound based on the container brought by patient
        attendants or a subsequent confirmation by silver nitrate test for phosphine detection in
        stomach contents.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients less than 12 years of age Pregnant and lactating women Patients with
             ingestion or exposure to other substances in addition to phosphide.

        Patients with other major medical conditions (e.g. cardiovascular disease, renal or hepatic
        failure).

        Patients presenting more than 6 hours of having consumed the phosphide compound (late
        presenters).
