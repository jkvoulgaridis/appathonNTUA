      The purpose of this study is to assess percentage reduction in the of urine NTX and serum CTX
      , in patients with NSCLC and bone metastases 1) with actionable driver oncogene on standard
      of care (SOC) TKI at 3 months post treatment and 2) without actionable mutations on standard
      of care therapy (chemotherapy/immunotherapy) treated with zoledronic acid or denosumab at the
      same time period.

      This is an observational study involving two arms of NSCLC with metastatic bony disease at
      the time of enrollment in the study. One group will have an actionable driver oncogene and
      initiate treatment in any line with a TKI as standard of care and concurrent to participation
      to this study; expected to have an objective response rate in ≥40% who have not previously
      seen anti-bone resorptive therapy. The other group will not have actionable mutations and
      initiate treatment with chemotherapy/immunotherapy along with new onset therapy with IV
      zoledronic acid 4mg Q4 weeks or subcutaneous denosumab 120 mg Q12 weeks for bone disease,
      which is standard of care and would be concurrent to participation in this study.

      Baseline and on-treatment imaging and serum total alkaline phosphatase will be performed per
      SOC.

      Additional non-SOC bone turnover markers including , urine N-telopeptide (NTX) and serum
      C-terminal telopeptide (CTX), will be checked at baseline and then at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months.

        About 30-40% of patients with lung cancer develop bone metastases during the course of
        their disease; the median survival time of patients with this secondary lesion is 7 months.
        In a retrospective study of 259 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, the most
        common site of skeletal metastases was the spine in 50% of patients, followed by the ribs
        (27.1%), ilium (10%), sacrum (7.1%), femur (5.7%) and humerus, scapula and sternum (2.9%).
        At our institution it is a standard practice not to use anti-bone resorptive therapy in
        driver mutation addicted NSCLC with bony metastasis, while anti-bone resorptive therapies
        are commonly used in NSCLC with bony metastases without any actionable driver mutation.
        This study relates to exploring the potential differential need for anti-resorptive bone
        medications (bisphosphonates or RANK-L inhibitors) in patients with advanced non-small cell
        lung cancer and bone metastases with and without actionable driver mutations.
