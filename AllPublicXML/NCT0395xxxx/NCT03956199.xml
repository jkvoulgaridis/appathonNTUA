  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to compare two methods of repairing and saving a badly damaged or infected
      tooth. One method is called root canal treatment (RoCT) and the other (new method) is called
      pulpotomy. RoCT involves removing the damaged area of the tooth including the tooth nerve
      (called the pulp), cleaning, disinfecting and sealing it. Pulpotomy however attempts to
      preserve as much of the tooth nerve as possible (keeping the tooth alive). RoCT is more
      expensive and painful. Therefore, some patients delay or avoid getting treated, resulting in
      later complications treated in an emergency setting. This research will aim to show that
      pulpotomy is less painful, less involved (i.e. less invasive), less time consuming and
      consequently more cost effective. Long term costs of dental treatment as well as the improved
      quality of life will therefore offer benefits for patients, public and the NHS who use dental
      services. Caries (tooth decay) is the most common diseases in the world. The NHS spends at
      least £3.4 billion per year on dental visits or at dental hospitals. This does not include
      private (societal) costs to individuals who do not qualify for NHS dental treatment.
      Consequently, those who end up avoiding or delaying treatment result in complications often
      treated through the NHS. We have therefore chosen a randomized controlled trial design, a
      gold standard method to compare the effectiveness of the two treatment options. The
      participants will be 168 dental patients (male or female) from different parts (London and
      Liverpool) of the UK so that results can be generalized. This design was considered in
      consultation with a member of the public (a co-applicant) who will be involved in the trial
      from the start to completion. The results will be published and discussed at conferences as
      well as through our patient and public network.

    <description>The vitality or absence of apical pathology of the tooth at 24 months: that is, an absence of either pain, swelling or tenderness to biting of the tooth and no evi-dence of inflammation in the tissues around the tip of the root detected by con-ventional radiographs and CBCT (independent assessors) after 24 months from randomisation. Both assessors must agree to conclude an overall absence of apical pathology. Treatment outcome will be assessed objectively using scans taken pre-treatment and and follow-up (6,12,24 months) appointments.</description>

    <description>• The EQ-5D-3L and EQ-5D-5L measured at baseline, over the first 7 days, 6 and 12 months post randomisation. One major feature of the EQ-5D tool is that the health states obtained from the questionnaire may be con-verted into a single index value with country specific value sets. This will facilitate the calculation and comparison of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) between pulpotomy vs. primary root canal treatment. The QALY is a measure of disease burden including the quality and quantity of life lived, with one QALY equating to one year in perfect health</description>
