  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to translate and culturally adapt the MSQ to Turkish language
      and test the validity and reliability of Turkish version of MSQ in shoulder dysfunction
      patients. And also, the ultimate goal was to facilitate international researches in shoulder
      problems as well as to serve the physicians for their clinical practice.

      Munich Shoulder Questionnaire (MSQ) is an innovative tool for self-assessment of shoulder
      function. It was especially designed for an effective follow-up of shoulder patients which
      were also allowing for a quantitative assessment of the Constant, Shoulder Pain and
      Disability Index (SPADI) and DASH score consisting of a 30-items questionnaire. It based on
      subjective and objective parameters of shoulder function.

      Standart questionnaire enable to follow patients on a close and regular base with manageable
      effort for both the disability and the patients.an optimal instrument for outcome measurement
      of shoulder problems should meet the following requirments: a) the instrument should be a
      self-assmment patient reporting tool, b) the questions must be easily comprensible, c)
      filling in should be finished less than 30 minutes, d) the results should provide calculation
      of several well established scoring system. MSQ can be completed at home and typical
      functional abilities about evaluation are explained with pictures so these can make it easy.
      As a result, we choose to translate the MSQ into Turkish as it is less costly, practical and
      time consuming than developing a new tool. In addition, objective (normal joint movement and
      muscle strength) and subjective (pain, daily life activity, sport and leisure time
      activities) parameters in a single form to create the advantage in terms of ease of use and
      time. With these properties, MSQ may be preferred during follow-up of the results of
      conservative and / or surgical treatment.

    <description>The Munich Shoulder Questionnaire is a 30-items self-assessment questionnaire. Its raw score ranges from 0 to 314. For comparability, the raw numbers are divided by 314 giving a percentage ranging from 0 to 100 in which higher scores represent a better function of the shoulder.</description>

    <measure>Objective Function</measure>
    <time_frame>2 days</time_frame>
    <description>The objective function of the shoulder and consists of six items. The first five questions assess the range of motion: flexion, abduction, internal rotation, external rotation and range of the hand. Each question offer result from 0 to 10 points resulting in a total score ranging from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 50 points ( 16 % of totals of MSQ) . The 6th targets at the power of the shoulder in 90° of abduction and 20° of quested to lift flexion. The patient is asked to fill a bag with items of daily living with a defined weıght such as a 500 gr water plastic bottle or bag. Then the patient is requested to lift the bag to the horizontal plane and hold 5 seconds. This is performed stepwise with increasing weights until the 12 kg. Each 500 gr is 2 point and maximum points is 24 for this question.(8%of the total MSQ).Altogether the objective part is a total score ranging from 0 to 74 points (%24 of the MSQ).</description>

    <measure>Subjective Function</measure>

    <description>subjective function and consists of 24 items. Six of the items deal with pain, nine cover work and activities of daily living, six cover sports and recreation activities and three ask for the social and emotional quality of life. This section accounts for a total score ranging from 0 to 240 points (%76 of the MSQ). It raw score ranges from 0 to 314. For comparability, the raw numbers are divided by 314 giving a percentage ranging from 0 to 100 in which higher scores represent a better function of shoulder</description>
