  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spread pattern, the lack of alternative treatments, and emerging data on the activity of
      anti-Programmed death ligand 1 (PDL1) targeted checkpoint inhibitor therapy in gynecological
      cancers provide the rationale for this investigation.

      Surgery and Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy (HIPEC) are likely to increase the
      tumor-antigen expression and the mutational load. As a result, it would be interesting to
      combine this approach with immunotherapy. Moreover, Intraperitoneal (IP) infusion will
      directly target the peritoneal cavity and potentially enhance the immune response. Indeed
      some recent papers indicate that the peritoneum could be considered as a lymphoid organ,
      involving &quot;milky spots&quot;, thus able to produce a better immune response when immunotherapy is
      given by IP route rather than intravenous (IV) route.

      The investigating team in Lyon, France is one of the major groups for HIPEC research in
      Europe (Pr O. Glehen et al) - Reference center for the tumors of the peritoneum (French
      National Cancer Institute).

      The aim of this study is to assess in this I/II phase study, the feasibility of extensive
      debulking surgery and HIPEC followed by Intraperitoneal (IP) nivolumab dose escalation in
      patients with advanced ovarian carcinoma.

    <description>The National Cancer Institute created originally the Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) to aid in the recognition and grading severity of adverse effects caused by chemotherapy treatments. The grading scale is as follows with grade 0 being no cancer and grade 5 being death:
