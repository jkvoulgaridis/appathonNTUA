  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with inoperable endometrial cancer have limited treatment options. PD-L1 expression
      is common in endometrial cancers and RT induces tumor and systemic changes that induce the
      immune system. The purpose of this trial is to evaluate anti-PD-1/PD-L1 axis therapy in
      conjunction of standard of care RT for patients with inoperable endometrial cancer in order
      to establish the safety and efficacy of inducing an anti-tumor immune response.

    <description>PFS is defined as the time from last TSR-042 administration to disease progression or death. Response and progression will be evaluated in this study in a qualitative fashion by symptoms (such as bleeding, abdominal or pelvic pain, changes of bowel or bladder habits lasting more than two weeks), clinical exam and/or evidence of disease on imaging by RECIST 1.1 as not all patients will have measurable disease at baseline on imaging. Persistent/recurrent clinical disease will be confirmed by biopsy whenever possible.</description>

             infarction, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, uncontrolled major seizure
             disorder, unstable spinal cord compression, superior vena cava syndrome, or any
             psychiatric disorder that prohibits obtaining informed consent.

          -  Patient experienced ≥ Grade 3 immune-related AE with prior immunotherapy, with the
             exception of non-clinically significant lab abnormalities.

          -  Participant has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or has receiving systemic steroid

             reactive) or hepatitis C (eg, hepatitis C virus [HCV] ribonucleic acid [qualitative]
             is detected).

          -  Participant has an active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in
             the past 2 years (ie, with use of disease-modifying agents, corticosteroids, or
             immunomodulatory drugs). Replacement therapy (eg, thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic
             corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is
             not considered a form of systemic treatment.

          -  Participant must not have a history of interstitial lung disease.

          -  Participant has received a live vaccine within 14 days of initiating protocol therapy.
