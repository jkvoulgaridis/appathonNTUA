      The investigators are going to Investigate the comparative efficacy of intense pulsed light
      therapy alone with that of intense pulsed light plus meibomian gland expression for meibomian
      gland dysfunction.

      Enrolled patients are going to be randomly assigned to two groups. All of the patients will
      undergo four treatment sessions in total, which are two weeks apart. Group 1 will undergo two
      sessions of intense pulsed light therapy with meibomian gland expression, as well as two
      sessions of intense pulsed light alone. Group 2 will receive two sessions of intense pulsed
      light therapy alone, and two sessions of intense pulsed light therapy with meibomian gland
      expression. The following parameters will be measured at baseline, 2 weeks after the second
      treatment session, and 2 weeks after the fourth treatment session: tearfilm break-up time,
      Oxford grade for corneal staining, meibomian gland expressibility, meibum quality, and ocular
      surface disease index.

    <description>Oxford grade for staining was assessed on a scale of 0 to 5. It was scaled according to the degree of corneal staining as follow: 0 (absent), 1 (minimal), 2 (mild), 3 (moderate), 4 (marked), and 5 (severe)</description>

    <description>The meibomian gland expressibility was assessed on a scale of 0 to 3 in ﬁve glands on the central lower lid. It was scaled according to the number of glands expressible, as follows: 0 (all glands), 1 (three to four glands), 2 (one to two glands) and 3 (no glands)</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and 2 weeks after the last treatment session</time_frame>
    <description>The meibum quality score were divided into the following four degrees: 0 (clear), 1 (cloudy), 2 (granular), and 3 (toothpaste)</description>

    <description>The ocular surface diseases index score range from 0 to 100 based on the result of standardized ocular surface disease index questionnaire. Higher value represent worse subjective symptom.</description>

    <description>IPL therapy will be performed with the M22® (Lumenis, Dreieich, Germany). IPL treatment is going to be administered to the skin below the lower eyelid. Before treatment, the eyes will be protected with opaque goggles. Ultrasound gel is going to be applied to the patient's face from tragus to tragus including the nose in order to conduct the light, help to spread the energy evenly, and provide a degree of protection. The intensity of the IPL treatment will range from 9.8J/cm2 to 13J/cm2 according to Fitzpatrick Skin Type Grading.</description>
