  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People experiencing severe mental illnesses (SMI), including schizophrenia, psychosis,
      bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder, are prone to poorer physical health and
      increased incidences of premature mortality when compared to the general population (De Hert
      et al., 2009; Hert et al., 2011; Hennekens et al., 2005; Tiihonen et al., 2009 .
      High-intensity-interval-training (HIIT) is a type of exercise involving alternating short
      bursts of high intensity exercise with recovery periods of rest/ light exercise (Weston,
      Wisløff &amp; Coombes, 2014). HIIT improves physical health, quality of life and cognition in the
      general population and in those with physical health disorders (Gomes-Neto et al., 2017;
      Hwang, Wu &amp; Chou, 2011; Wen et al., 2019). It has been proposed that HIIT may improve
      symptoms, physical health and time to discharge among inpatients with SMI.

      The research will involve three stages: 1) Focus groups, 2) A pilot study, 3) Follow-up
      qualitative interviews and focus groups.

      Firstly, a series of focus groups with inpatients with SMI, carers of individuals with SMI
      and clinical staff will be conducted. The focus groups will scope perceptions of attitudes,
      and practicalities of a pilot RCT. The information gained will be used to inform a pilot HIIT
      trial which will evaluate whether HIIT is acceptable and feasible amongst this population
      group. Each focus group will run for ≈2 hours and will involve an open discussion about the
      benefits and barriers of conducting HIIT exercise sessions in a population with SMI.

      Secondly, the HIIT pilot study will be trialed. The final protocol will be developed with
      feedback from the focus group but will involve an RCT where 12 weeks of HIIT will be compared
      to 12 weeks of treatment-as-usual (TAU). HIIT will be conducted, twice a week, in a
      supervised environment using a stationary bike. Inpatients with a diagnosis of SMI will be
      eligible to participate. Thirdly, follow-up qualitative interviews, with pilot study
      participants, those that withdrew and those that did not want to take part, and focus groups
      with clinical staff will address the acceptability and feasibility of HIIT.

    <textblock>
      Setting:

      All three stages will take place in various South London and Maudsley Hospital NHS Trust
      (SLaM) Adult Mental Health settings affiliated with the Maudsley Hospital and the Bethlem
      Royal Hospital, and at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience (IoPPN).

      Stage One:

      A series of focus groups with inpatients with a diagnosis of SMI, carers of people with a
      diagnosis of SMI and clinical staff will scope perceptions of attitudes, and practicalities
      of a pilot RCT. It is expected that between 6-8 people will attend each focus group.

      Up to 5 focus groups will be conducted, lasting two hours each, addressed at the following
      populations: 1) Clinical staff affiliated with SLaM; 2) Inpatients with a diagnosis of SMI
      who reside at the Maudsley Hospital and the Bethlem Royal Hospital, and their carers; 3)
      Carers recruited via the national carers' forum, a carers group in SLaM.

      Procedure: A series of simple open-ended questions will be asked, and participants will
      answer verbally. The questions will address factors relevant to the pilot study design
      including optimal duration and intensity of exercise sessions; location of exercise sessions;
      procedures surrounding storage of exercise equipment; and procedure surrounding outcome
      assessments. An audio-recording will record responses to these questions when permission has
      been granted. The qualitative data gained from the questions asked as part of the focus group
      will be analysed using thematic analysis to understand the main themes.

      Stage Two:

      A pilot RCT will be conducted whereby inpatients with a diagnosis of SMI will be randomly
      allocated to either 12 weeks of HIIT or 12 weeks of TAU. For patients in the HIIT arm, HIIT
      will be conducted twice a week for 12 weeks using a stationary bike. Each session will have
      the following structure: 4-minute warm-up, followed by 5X1 minute intervals at 85-95% of
      maximum heart rate, interspersed with active pauses of 90 seconds cycling at approximately
      60-70% of maximum heart rate, and a 4-minute cool-down. Assessment measures including a
      neuropsychological test battery; fitness test; and physical health checks will be conducted
      at baseline, 6-, and 12-weeks. Twenty inpatients will be recruited to each arm of the RCT (40
      inpatients in total). This number is based on recruiting a big-enough sample to assess the
      feasibility of the study and on the resources available (Leon, Davis &amp; Kraemer, 2011).

      Pre-post intervention changes in will be measured, including changes in neuropsychological
      outcomes, fitness, physical health, and cardiovascular risk. A between-group analysis will
      also be conducted to see whether any changes in outcome differ from the control (TAU) group.

      Stage Three:

        1. Qualitative interviews:

           Participants who completed the pilot study will be invited to take part in individual
           semi-structured follow-up qualitative interviews. Feedback regarding the acceptability
           and feasibility of the study will be sought. Additionally, feedback will be sought from
           those that withdrew from the study and those that did not agree to take part. The
           interviews will assess 1) how participants experienced the intervention, 2) if there are
           any parts of the intervention that could be improved, and what factors influenced people
           in completing/not completing the intervention. Interviews will take place on a
           one-to-one basis with a member of the research team and a participant. Each qualitative
           interview will be conducted within 3 weeks of each participant finishing the HIIT pilot
           study/ within 3 weeks of drop-out if time commitments permit. Responses will be recorded
           when permission has been granted. Overall, each individual interview will take 30- 60
           minutes and will not require participants to participate in any follow-up tasks. The
           qualitative data gained from these questions will be analysed using thematic analysis to
           understand the main themes.

        2. Focus groups:

      Up to two focus groups with clinical staff at SLaM will be conducted and feedback regarding
      the acceptability and feasibility of the pilot HIIT study conducted in stage two of the
      research project will be sought. It is expected that between 6-8 people will attend each
      focus group. A series of simple open-ended questions will be asked, and participants will
      answer verbally. The questions will address staff's opinions regarding the acceptability and
      feasibility of conducting HIIT in a mental health setting. An audio-recording will record
      responses to these questions when permission has been granted. The qualitative data gained
      from these questions will be analysed using thematic analysis to understand the main themes.
      Overall, each focus group should take no more than 2 hours and will not require participants
      to participate in any follow-up tasks.
