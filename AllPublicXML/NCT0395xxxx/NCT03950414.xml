  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kidney transplantation is the ideal treatment for patients with end-stage kidney
      disease.However, kidney transplantation is associated with a great risk of morbidity and
      mortality due to infections, especially viral infections such as Cytomegalovirus(CMV) .This
      study measures the tolerability of viral-specific T cells against CMV in adult kidney
      transplant recipients. Participants are expected to be on study for 52 +/- 3 weeks.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Viral infections, or their reactivation in the immunocompromised host, remain serious
      complications that adversely affect outcomes of transplantation. These infections may be
      refractory to pharmacologic treatment and result in increased morbidity and mortality after
      transplantation. Furthermore, the available pharmacologic therapies can result in severe
      toxicities.

      Once an infection occurs, adequate immune reconstitution is decisive for recovery from viral
      disease after kidney transplantation. The present trial will consist of the treatment of
      kidney transplant recipients diagnosed with severe CMV infection when standard antiviral
      therapy is ineffective (disease progression on therapy, decline in viral load less than
      10-fold in 2 weeks, known drug resistance), or toxic (end-organ damage), with virus-specific
      T cells using the CliniMACS® Prodigy System. As described in the background section, these
      are the patients with the greatest unmet need and greatest risk or morbidity and allograft
      loss due to CMV infection. CMV-specific T cells will be isolated from donor leukapheresis
      products using the CliniMACS® Prodigy. Prior studies on transfer of CMV-specific T cells have
      been shown to be safe and efficacious in the treatment of CMV infections.

      The primary objective of this Phase I trial is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      CMV-specific T-cell transfer in adult patients suffering from CMV infections following kidney
      transplantation using a dose escalation design. The incubation with viral antigens (MACS GMP
      PepTivator) allows the enrichment of CMV-specific CD4+(Cluster of Differentiation 4) and
      CD8+(Cluster of Differentiation 8) T cells. Increasing evidence of the safety and efficacy of
      CMV-specific T-cell is available. Furthermore, the safety and efficacy of the specific
      manufacturing approach using the fully automated protocol of the ClinMACS® Prodigy for the
      isolation of CMV-specific T cells against CMV has been described and demonstrated that these
      cells retain their biological properties.

        Donor Eligibility

        Donor selection priority: The original donor will be the first choice as source of T cells.

        (NMDP) donor, cord blood unit, or related donor not available) of peripheral mononuclear
        cells or does not meet all donor eligibility criteria (including donor selection criteria
        based on University of Wisconsin - Madison Standard Operating Procedures for the selection
        of allogeneic donors), alternative related donors will be selected, with preference for
        those who have full HLA matching in 6/6 loci over those with partial HLA matching (≥ 3/6
        HLA loci). See Appendix 1 for patient and donor screening procedures.

          1. All donors must be &gt; 18 years old, available, CMV IgG positive, eligible and capable
             of undergoing a single standard 2 blood volume leukapheresis.

             OR If original kidney transplant donor is not available, CMV IgG negative or
             ineligible, a CMV IgG positive fully matched or haploidentical family donor will be
             used.

          2. Related donors must be at least partially HLA compatible, matching with recipient in
             at least 3/6 HLA loci (HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-DRB1 will be considered for this).

          3. Donors must be CMV IgG seropositive.

          4. Donors must show CMV T-cell activation after incubation with MACS GMP PepTivator
