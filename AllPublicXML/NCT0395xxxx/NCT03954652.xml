      The GENOME FIRST APPROACH project will enroll patients (n = 450) and their healthy parents
      with unclear molecular cause of the disease, suspected genetic cause of the disease and the
      healthy parents of those affected for trio analysis (N in total 1350).

    <textblock>
      In the GENOME FIRST APPROACH (monocentric, prospective, open-label diagnostic) project,
      patients with molecularly undiagnosed diseases will diagnostically be analyzed by Whole
      Genome Sequencing (WGS)-trio analysis. The following questions will be leading the project:

      Primary:

      • Efficacy of WGS trio analysis in different clinical indications

      Secondary:

        -  Systematically benchmark WGS analysis to detect genetic variations compared to WES and
           single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array analysis,

        -  Expand the analysis from coding single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) to regulatory
           mutations, structural variants (SVs), and low complexity regions,

        -  Validate the efficacy of clinical genome trio sequencing in a routine diagnostic
           setting,

        -  Analyse whether 42x coverage has the potential to discover mosaicism as disease causing
           mechanism,

        -  Further develop algorithms for integrative analyses of Trio-WGS data with Ribonucleic
           acid- sequencing (RNA-seq),

        -  Identify de novo alterations and novel disease mechanisms,

        -  Gain fundamental new insights into disease mechanisms and cellular biology,

        -  Combine WGS with further Omics methods to improve genetic diagnostics of future rare
           disease patients, and

        -  Explore overall financial costs and time to report conclusive data to the patients of
           the Trio-WGS approach compared to traditional multistep diagnostic approaches using
           single-gene, panel, whole-exome sequencing (WES) and chromosomal microarray (CMA) (SNP
           array, array-based comparative genomic hybridization (arrayCGH)) analysis.

      In addition, healthy parents of the subjects will be included in the project to perform
      parent-child (trio) analyzes.
