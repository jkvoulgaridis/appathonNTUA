    <textblock>
      This study will compare the effects of Eccentric training and Strength training with priory
      applied Active Release Technique on Quadriceps muscle in post operative patients of Dynamic
      Hip screw. Participants would be equally divided into two groups each receiving specific type
      of protocol besides standard post operative protocol of Dynamic Hip screw

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is Randomized Control Trial, being conducted at Fauji Foundation Hospital
      Rawalpindi .This study will compare the effects of two techniques addressing the contractile
      as well as non-contractile element of Quadriceps in early phase of Rehabilitation.

      Sample size of 18 was calculated using software Epitool with 95% confidence interval and 80%
      power. Individuals of selected population will be randomly allocated as 9 in Eccentric group
      and 9 in Active Release Technique group by sealed enveloped method.

    <description>First session will be performed 24 hours after pre-training tests i.e. on 4th post- operative day and subsequent sessions will be performed with lapse of 48 hours. During pre-testing, weight for the eccentric training will be determined using Standardized Brzycki formulas for lower limb. Participants will perform one set of 10 repetitions with selected weight. Intensity will be increased every week by decreasing the time of performance. Volume will be increased by increasing one set after two weeks. Eccentric training will be performed in sitting position on dynamic constant external resistance equipment.After session, patient will perform strengthening of quadriceps muscle as per clinical practice guidelines of National Health Service (UK).</description>

    <description>Isometric Quadriceps' contractions against therapist's resistance lasting for 10 seconds will be performed by the patient in inner range of knee extension and after relaxing; actively perform maximum full knee flexion. Patient will perform extension at knee joint again; when reaches the innermost range, therapist will apply pressure on deep fascia either through knuckles/fingers or forearm in the direction towards the hip joint and patient is asked to perform knee flexion simultaneously. The procedure is applied onto vastus lateralis, rectus femoris and vastus intermedialis thrice in a session. After session, patient will perform strengthening of quadriceps muscle as per clinical practice guidelines of National Health Service (UK).</description>
