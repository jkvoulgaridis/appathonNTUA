  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Managing pain, which affects 20-50% of the population, is a major issue in daily clinical
      practice. Evaluation of pain intensity is essential to adapt treatment but as it mainly
      relies on self-report, this assessment is difficult or impossible in non-communicating
      patients. In these cases, pain can only be evaluated by medical staff by the observation of
      pain-related characteristics like facial expression of pain (FEP). However, recognition of
      FEP is subjective, time-consuming and subject to multiple biases frequently leading to
      underestimation of pain and consequently under-treatment. Some of these biases could be
      solved by the use of facial recognition technology, allowing objective, automated and
      time-saving pain assessment. DEF-I aims to address technical issues and achieve the
      development of facial expression recognition digital tool able to evaluate severe acute pain
      in clinical practice, with high validity and utility by improving the quality of the images
      to be analyzed, by studying larger samples of patients, data and images, in order to
      correlate more efficiently the pain intensity felt by a patient with the expression of his
      face. The main objective of this study is to verify whether it is possible to quantitatively
      correlate the intensity of acute postoperative pain felt by a patient with his facial
      expression. The secondary objective is to define a reliable computer algorithm that
      qualitatively correlates the type of acute postoperative pain experienced by a patient with
      his facial expression.

    <description>numerical rating scale (NRS) is a psychometric response scale which can be used in questionnaires. It is a measurement instrument for subjective characteristics or attitudes that cannot be directly measured. When responding to a NRS item, respondents specify their level of agreement to a statement by indicating a position along a continuous line between two end-points. The range is 0=no pain to 10=acute pain</description>

    <description>Patients enrolled will be operated in our institution. Facial expression will be collected before and after surgery, and pain intensity will be collected at the same time. Facial expression will be analyzed using Facial Action Coding System (FACS) .This step will seek to confirm that the subset of Action Units (AUs) defined in previous studies is correlated with the presence and intensity of an acute pain or to identify a different original subset of facial AUs better correlated to pain intensity. . The developed algorithm (or model) here should be able to correlate facial AUs to pain intensity reported by the patients on the numerical rating scale. The developed model at this stage will be then validated on an additional sample of patients.</description>
