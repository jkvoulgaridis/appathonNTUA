  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are one of the most common conditions in the urology
      clinic, affecting at least one in four men after 40 years of age. Benign prostatic
      hyperplasia is the most common cause of LUTS. Bladder dysfunction (hypersensitivity or
      detrusor overactivity) and bladder outlet obstruction are two main pathologies involved in
      the etiology of LUTS. In men aged 40-49, moderate and severe LUTS are reported as 26%, while
      this ratio is doubled in the age group of 70 years and older. Clinically, BPH is defined as
      an international symptom score of more than 8, a prostate volume of more than 30 ml, and a
      maximum flow rate of less than 15 ml / sec. Alpha blockers are recommended as the first-line
      medical treatment according to European Urology Guidelines (EAU Guidelines 2018) for patients
      diagnosed with BPH clinically. In recent years, many studies have been published on the
      relationship of urinary biomarkers with LUTS. Nerve growth factor and brain derived
      neurotrophic factor have been shown to be closely related to neurogenic or non-neurogenic
      detrusor overactivity and significant improvements were observed after treatment.The
      relationship between urinary glycosaminoglycan and overactive bladder has been shown and it
      has been reported that the values have decreased after treatment.Male patients with LUTS
      caused by BPH often have symptoms of overactive bladder. However, as far as we know, there is
      no study in the literature about the meaning of urinary GAG levels in this patient group. The
      aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between urinary glycosaminoglycan
      levels and patients who had benign prostatic hyperplasia with and without overactive bladder
      symptoms.

      35 patients and 10 controls were planned to be included in the study. Urine will be collected
      from patients before and after one month of medical treatment (alpha-blocker). After being
      centrifuged at 5000 g for 10 minutes, urine will be stored at -80 ° C. At the end of the
      study, urinary glycosaminoglycan levels will be studied by spectrophotometric method. Urine
      GAG levels and pre and post treatment uroflowmetry, IPSS, overactive bladder symptom score,
      bladder frequency volume chart, post void residual urine volume will be compared.
