  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Close to one-third of Medicare decedents use the Medicare skilled nursing facility (SNF)
      benefit in the 6 months prior to death. SNF care often increases the risk for more
      aggressive, potentially burdensome treatments and unrecognized or undertreated symptoms.
      Palliative care is goal-directed, patient and family-centered care that focuses on a wide
      range of physical, psychosocial, and spiritual needs for persons with serious, life-limiting
      illnesses. Effective palliative care relieves suffering, enhances communication, and improves
      end-of-life care and decision making for seriously ill older adults. Despite its association
      with improved quality of care, higher satisfaction, and better symptom management at the end
      of life, palliative care is not widely available to Medicare patients in the Skilled Nursing
      Facility (SNF) setting. Palliative care consultation (PCC) is one approach that can
      potentially improve care for older adults with advanced illness in SNFs. This pilot study
      will test an evidence-based palliative care consult intervention for older adult SNF patients
      in nursing homes by comparing the patient/family caregiver reported quality of life in two
      participant groups: one receiving a PCC and the other receiving standard care.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient/Caregiver Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>Collected upon admission to the nursing home and again 15-days post-admission to the nursing home.</time_frame>
    <description>10 item Survey that measures quality of life in five dimensions: 1) physical; 2) emotional; 3) psychological; 4) spiritual needs, and 5) provision of information and support. Items scored on a 5 point Likert Scale (0=not at all, 4= overwhelmingly) based on symptom/need in the past week. Overall profile score is calculated by summing responses (range 0-40). Source: patient or family caregiver; Time to complete: 5-7 minutes</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Consult Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>Collected within 15 days of palliative care consultation</time_frame>
    <description>Measured using the Consultation Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ). The CSQ is an 18 item patient/caregiver-reported instrument that measures communication and satisfaction of a consult in four domains: 1) general satisfaction, 2) professional care, 3) depth of relationship, 4) perceived length of consultation.(scale format: 5-point Likert Scale (0= strongly disagree, 4=strongly agree).Overall score is calculated by summing responses (range 0-72) Source: patient or family caregiver; Time to complete: 3-5 minutes</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adherence to SNF-PCC recommendations</measure>
    <time_frame>30 Days post-admission</time_frame>
    <description>Adherence Protocol. Medical record review and/or phone interview with patient/caregiver
We will determine a recommendation adherence score after each participants' SNF-PCC. Each recommendation will be assigned 2 points, then we will define full (2 points), partial (1 point) and no adherence (0 point) to each recommendation. We will sum the points for each SNF-PCC recommendation and use this as the denominator. We will sum each recommendation with full, partial, no adherence and use this as the numerator. The fraction will be converted to a percentage ranging from 0-100% reflecting the recommendation adherence score.</description>
