  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether the saline-coupled bipolar sealer
      compared to the unipolar electrocautery provides superior hemostasis in patients undergoing
      primary unilateral total knee arthroplasty. This will be a prospective, randomized,
      single-blinded, non-inferiority study in patients scheduled for a primary unilateral total
      knee arthroplasty (TKA) with Dr. Eugene Krauss or Dr. Ayal Segal. The restriction of this
      study to two surgeons will limit variations in the outcomes being measured due to differences
      in surgical technique.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Total joint arthroplasty can result in significant blood loss. Minimizing blood loss has led
      to multiple blood conservation strategies in orthopaedic procedures. The use of unipolar
      electrocautery or the saline-coupled bipolar sealer are methods used to reduce intraoperative
      bleeding. Saline-coupled bipolar sealer technology initially demonstrated promising results
      in the literature when it was reported that this technology had superior efficacy by reducing
      blood loss and transfusion requirements in orthopaedic surgery. However, the saline-coupled
      bipolar sealer technology comes at a significantly higher cost when compared to the unipolar
      electrocautery. A bipolar electrode costs an additional $450.00 per case, whereas, the
      unipolar electrocautery catheter is included in all the pre-packaged orthopedic surgical
      trays. The added cost of the saline-coupled bipolar sealer was offset by the potential
      savings in the reduced need for blood transfusions. A single blood transfusion is estimated
      to be $750-$1200. This cost includes both the direct cost of the blood and the additional
      nursing time needed. Recent publications have challenged the superiority of the
      saline-coupled bipolar sealer in hemostasis. These randomized clinical trials (RCT) have not
      supported superiority of this method when compared to standard unipolar electrocautery and
      the continued use of the saline-coupled bipolar sealer has been questioned. The purpose of
      this study is to investigate whether the saline-coupled bipolar sealer compared to the
      unipolar electrocautery provides superior hemostasis in patients undergoing primary
      unilateral total knee arthroplasty. This will be a prospective, randomized, single-blinded,
      non-inferiority study in patients scheduled for a primary unilateral TKA with Dr. Eugene
      Krauss or Dr. Ayal Segal. The restriction of this study to two surgeons will limit variations
      in the outcomes being measured due to differences in surgical technique.

    <masking_description>Blinding of the principal investigator and operating staff is not possible. However, all attempts will be made to keep this information from the hospital staff caring for the patients in the postoperative period. The patient and the postoperative hospital staff will be blinded to the treatment arm. The OR staff will be trained not to discuss this information with the patient. During the transition of care from the OR to the Post Anesthetic Care Unit (PACU) the treatment arm will not be included in the verbal patient report. The lack of this information is not required to effectively manage the patient in the postoperative period and will not affect patient care. Postoperatively medical care is managed by the hospitalist, medical doctors specializing in the care of hospitalized patients.</masking_description>

    <description>The Aquamantys® System is a commercially available device used routinely used in the operating room for a wide variety of surgical cases. It allows for temperatures to stay at approximately 100°C, nearly 200°C less than conventional devices, which produces a tissue effect without the charring associated with other methods. The temperature is sufficient to shrink collagen fibers in the walls of blood vessels, effectively sealing the blood vessels, resulting in the reduction in bleeding from both soft tissue and bone. The device can be used to spot coagulate vessels that are actively bleeding or to broadly paint tissue surfaces to prevent bleeding or treat active oozing.</description>
