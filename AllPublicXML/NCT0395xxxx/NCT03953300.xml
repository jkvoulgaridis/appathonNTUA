    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate effect of benralizumab on structural and lung
      function changes in severe eosinophilic asthmatics.

      Changes will be assessed over 48 week treatment period in patients with persistent symptoms
      despite standard therapy of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) plus long acting B2-agonist (LABA)
      with or without additional controller medication.

      Patients who complete treatment will enter 4 weeks follow-up period.

             control. A highly effective method of contraception is defined as one that can achieve
             a failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly. Women of
             childbearing potential who are sexually active with a non-sterilized male partner must
             agree to use one highly effective methods of birth control, as defined above, from
             enrolment throughout the study and to within 16 weeks after last dose of study drug.

         11. Acceptable inhaler technique, as judged by the Investigator.

         12. Asthma control questionnaire (ACQ-6) &gt;1.5.

         13. Compliance with inhaled asthma maintenance medication &gt;70% (calculated in the period
             from Visit 2 to Visit 3). The screening/run-in period may be extended to accommodate
             this criterion.

         14. Fewer than 12 exacerbations within the 6 months prior to Visit 3.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Clinically important pulmonary disease other than asthma or subjects who have ever

             associated with elevated peripheral eosinophil counts.

          2. Life-threatening asthma, defined as episodes requiring intubation associated with
             hypercapnia, respiratory arrest, hypoxic seizures, or asthma related syncopal episodes
             within the 12 months prior to Visit 1.

          3. A history of allergies or adverse drug reactions to medications used for
             pre-bronchoscopy procedures.

          4. Any disorder that in the opinion of the Investigator can affect the safety of the
             subject during the study, influence the findings of the studies or their
             interpretations, or impede the subject's ability to complete the entire duration of
             the study.
