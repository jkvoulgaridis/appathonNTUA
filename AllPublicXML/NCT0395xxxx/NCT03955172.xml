  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Long-term success of organ transplantation is limited by the inexorable loss of graft
      function due to rejection. Prevalent dogma defends that allograft rejection is exclusively
      mediated by the adaptive immune system: T cells are responsible for cellular rejections and B
      cells producing Donor Specific Antibodies (DSA) are responsible for humoral rejection.
      Recently, we demonstrated that innate NK cells could be implicated in the generation of
      chronic vascular rejections lesions by sensing the absence of expression of self Major
      Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I molecules (&quot;missing self&quot;) on graft endothelial
      cells with their Killer cell immunoglobulin-like (KIR) receptors. Using human in vitro and
      murine in vivo models, we also showed that Mammalian Target Of Rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors
      could efficiently prevent this new kind of rejection.

      Objective:

      The aim of our project is therefore to test in a cohort of kidney transplanted patients the
      efficiency of mTOR inhibitors to treat this new kind of rejection

      Methods:

      A cohort of 20 kidney transplant patients with a missing self on their graft responsible for
      a NK-mediated rejection will be established prospectively. An mTOR inhibitor will be
      introduced in these patients for 6 months in association with a calcineurin inhibitor and
      corticosteroids. Graft function, histological lesions and NK activability will be monitored
      following this modification of treatment.

    <description>Patients will received everolimus (CERTICAN), oral form, at the necessary dose to obtain trough levels between 6 and 8 ng/ml, during 6 months. Everolimus will replace the anti-proliferative drug they have before (azathioprine or mycophenolic acid). Everolimus will be associated with corticosteroids (prednisolone) and a calcineurin inhibitor (tacrolimus or cyclosporin).</description>
