  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will conduct qualitative interviews to provide evidence for the content validity
      and comprehension of existing physician-reported measures of sedation levels of children
      receiving anesthesia to facilitate a diagnostic or surgical procedure. Information gained
      from this study will inform the use of the measure in studies that are part of the PTN.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the content validity and physician
      understanding of the Pediatric Sedation State Scale (PSSS) and the University of Michigan
      Sedation Scale (UMSS) via cognitive interviewing methods. Qualitative Interviewers will
      conduct 1 hour, phone-based cognitive interviews with clinicians to assess physicians'
      comprehension of items and response options on clinician reported pediatric sedation scales
      and clinician evaluation of the relevance of the scale to capture sedation levels.

    <description>A 1 hour qualitative interview will be completed and coded to assess the quality of the measures being assessed. The Pediatric Sedation State Scale requires that a physician choose a level from 1 - 5 that corresponds to the patient's sedation level. The University of Michigan Sedation Scale requires that a physician choose a sedation level from 1 - 4 that corresponds to the patient's sedation level. The scales will not be completed by clinicians and will not be scored. The content of the qualitative interview is the &quot;measure&quot;.
