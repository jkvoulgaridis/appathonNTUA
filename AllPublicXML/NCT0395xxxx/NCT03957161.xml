  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The American Heart Association guidelines for high blood pressure (BP) currently recommend
      using angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)
      as first-line therapy for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 3 or above.
      However, the prevalence of ACEi and ARB use in patients with CKD stage 4 or 5 is low, and
      current BP guidelines acknowledge the lack of solid evidence to support the benefit of using
      these agents in advanced CKD.This study seeks to conduct a pilot trial to determine the
      safety and feasibility of ACEi and/or ARB continuation (intervention) versus withdrawal
      (control) in patients with advanced CKD.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  adults ≥18 years of age who meet the eGFR eligibility criteria, which will be
             determined based on whether participants have at least two eGFR in the last three
             months that are &lt; 25 mL/min/1.73m2 or prior diagnosis of CKD (per electronic chart
             review) and at least one eGFR &lt; 25 mL/min/1.73m2 in the past six months

          -  receiving at least one antihypertensive medication at the time of the screening visit.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The investigators will exclude those who:

          -  are or are planning to become pregnant, due to inability to take multiple classes of
             anti-hypertensive agents

          -  are marginally housed, due to concerns regarding routine follow-up

          -  are actively participating in a different interventional trial that may affect blood
             pressure

          -  are unwilling to consent to participate

          -  institutionalized individuals or prisoners

          -  are actively abusing illicit drugs or alcohol

          -  have a history of poor or doubtful compliance (e.g., frequently missed appointments)

          -  have cognitive impairment prohibiting participation in the study

          -  on dialysis at time of recruitment
