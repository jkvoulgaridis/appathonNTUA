  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators propose to apply cognitive training, which has been largely
      used in the realm of age-related cognitive decline, dementia, and Alzheimer's disease, in a
      novel clinical context to individuals with vestibular impairment. In prior work the
      investigators observed that individuals with vestibular loss have evidence of spatial
      cognitive impairment. The investigators plan to evaluate the preliminary efficacy and
      feasibility of a cognitive training program in a sample of participants with chronic
      vestibular impairment who display deficits in spatial ability. The cognitive training program
      will focus on visuospatial skills and will be used as an adjunct to traditional vestibular
      physical therapy (VPT).

      Patients with chronic vestibular dysfunction with report symptoms of spatial cognitive
      impairment will be offered cognitive training. The intervention will consist of a
      well-validated cognitive training protocol that specifically targets spatial navigation
      skills. The protocol was developed by Willis et al. for the Adult Development and Enrichment
      Trial (ADEPT) trial, which trains map reading and route-learning skills through mental
      rotation training tasks over the course of 5 weeks. Patients will be assessed by study staff
      pre-intervention, immediately post-intervention and at 3 months post-intervention using
      spatial cognitive outcomes, quality of life measures, and gait and balance outcomes.
