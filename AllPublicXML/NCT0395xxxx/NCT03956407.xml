  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Upper limb paresis is the most common type of post-stroke neurological impairment and a major
      cause of functional disability. Repetitive peripheral electrical stimulation (RPES) is a
      novel strategy to improve upper limb motor performance in the post-stroke chronic phase but
      its effects in the subacute phase are still poorly understood. The objectives of this study
      are to compare the effects of RPES on motor performance of the upper limb in the subacute and
      chronic phases of stroke, and to identify the mechanisms underlying this intervention.

    <description>Active repetitive peripheral nerve stimulation will be applied to the median nerve of the affected forearm with surface electrodes. The stimulator will be set to deliver bursts of 10 Hz stimulation at 50% duty cycle (500 ms on and off). For active stimulation, intensities will be set at the highest intensity able to induce sensory paraesthesias without overt muscle contraction or pain, and adjusted if required.</description>
