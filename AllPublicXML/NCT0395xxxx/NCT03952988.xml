  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lactase is high in the newborn intestine, allowing him to digest the high amounts of lactose
      present in breastmilk. From weaning, lactase is genetically programmed to decrease, reaching
      residual levels in the adult. This situation occurs in 75% of the world population and is
      known as &quot;adult primary hypolactasia&quot; while the remaining 25% is &quot;lactase persistent&quot; i.e.
      maintains in adulthood lactase values similar to these of newborns. In subjects with
      hypolactasia, the intake of milk products can produce digestive symptoms, making that the
      affected individuals spontaneously reduce the consumption of these products and, therefore,
      their intake of calcium and proteins.

      In addition to lactose-free milk and exogenous lactase, a strategy for the intolerant
      subjects to continue consuming dairy products is, for example, to consume yogurt, due to the
      fact that the lactase of the yogurt bacteria continues to function in the intestine of the
      consumer, hydrolyzing lactose and decreasing the development of digestive symptoms.
      Similarly, many probiotic strains, such as L. acidophilus NCFM, L. casei CRL431, B. longum
      401 and B. bifidum Orla Jensen 1424, express β-galactosidases that hydrolyze lactose,
      preventing its fermentation and the production of gases. The acute administration of these
      strains improves lactose tolerance. In addition, a recent study reported that dietary
      supplementation of intolerant subjects for 4 weeks with L. casei Shirota and B. breve Yakult
      reduced digestive symptoms and breath hydrogen excretion not only at the end of the period of
      administration of the probiotics but also 3 months after having discontinued the use of
      probiotics.

      Based on this background, the aim of this study is to determine whether the regular
      consumption of an ice cream with the strain B. bifidum 900791 improves lactose intolerance in
      hypolactasic subjects, even after the suspension of the consumption of the product. To
      determine if this effect is due to the adaptation of the microbiota, the investigators will
      also evaluate changes in the composition of the microbiota and the generation of volatile
      fatty acids.

    <intervention_model_description>At Day 1, hypolactasic subjects will perform a Hydrogen Breath Test (HBT) with a placebo ice-cream with 20g lactose (Negative Control). A second HBT will be carried at Day-8 with the same product + an exogenous lactase (Positive control). A 3° HBT will be carried out at Day 15 with the probiotic ice cream with 20g lactose to determine the acute effect of the probiotic. Posteriorly, the subjects will be randomly assigned in one of 2 groups to consume an ice-cream/d, with or without the probiotic, for 4 weeks. At Day-43, they will carry out a 4° HBT with ice cream with 20g lactose and without probiotic (Evaluation of the chronic effect). At Day 71, after 4 weeks washout period, a 5° HBT will be carried out with the ice cream with lactose and without probiotic, to evaluate the remanence of the effect. A fresh stool will be obtained at days 15, 43 and 71 to determine the presence of the probiotic, microbiota composition, ß-galactosidase activity and short chain fatty acid concentrations.</intervention_model_description>
