    <textblock>
      The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of topical combined with
      intravenous tranexamic acid for high tibial osteotomy without placement of a drainage tube
      The clinical scores of patients and their possible risks were tracked. The investigators
      hypothesized that a combination of tranexamic acid and no drainage tube could reduce blood
      loss and facilitate early recovery. The implementation of the study will provide a new
      perioperative blood loss control program for High Tibial Osteotomy, reduce the cost of
      hospitalization, promote patients to get out of bed early, reduce the number of days in
      hospital.

      The condition of the patients was evaluated, and the total length of both lower limbs,
      anteroposterior position of knee and Mri of knee were included. The preoperative dose of
      tranexamic acid was calculated according to body weight of 20 mg / kg, 100 ml of tranexamic
      acid sodium chloride solution was dripped 30 minutes before operation, and after incision
      closure, 30 ml of normal saline solution containing 2 g of tranexamic acid was injected
      through drainage tube or subcutaneously. Postoperative intravenous drip of 100 ML sodium
      chloride solution containing 20 mg / kg tranexamic acid. Arthroscopy was first used to
      further confirm the cartilage defect, and a new type of lower limb alignment meter and a
      customized precise osteotomy template were used to perform the osteotomy according to the
      preoperative plan. One group was not placed drainage tube, the other group was placed
      drainage tube. Visual analogue pain score (Vas) and American Special Surgical Hospital (HSS)
      knee function score were recorded 3 month after surgery. Throughout the trial, the
      investigators will carefully observe and manage your complications and the outcome of your
      surgery.
