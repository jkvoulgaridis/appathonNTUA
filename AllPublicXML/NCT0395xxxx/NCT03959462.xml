  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Decisions are part of the daily life. On the neuronal level, activity in the dorsolateral
      prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) is important during complex decisions (e.g., whether something is
      emotional for a person or not). We apply transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) with
      the aim to increase dlPFC activity and thereby modulate decisions towards emotional content.

    <description>Changes in the subjective measure mood, assessed with self-report questionnaire splitted up into two mood scales. One scale measures a person`s positive emotion and the other scale measures the negative. Each segment has ten terms, which can be rated on a scale of 1 to 5 to indicate the extent to which the respondent agrees that this applies to him (higher values means higher agreement).</description>
