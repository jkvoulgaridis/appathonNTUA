  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of free vascularized fibula flaps for bony reconstruction has proved its success as a
      substitution for the resected bone and in some instances, the surrounding soft tissues

      The aim of this case series study is to evaluate the stability of the dental implants placed
      in free fibula flaps substituting a resected mandible and/or maxilla when they are
      immediately loaded with the All-On-Four technique along with the patient satisfaction.

      • Preoperative phase :

      Patients will be subjected to:

        -  Case history including personal data, medical, surgical and family history.

        -  Clinical examination

        -  Radiographic examination using computed tomography (C.T) bony and soft tissue window.

        -  Diagnostic studying casts.

        -  Operative phase :

      All cases will undergo surgery under local regional anesthesia. Injection of local
      anaesthesia (Articaine 4% and 1:100000 epinephrine) for regional infiltration. Sequential
      drilling then insertion of the dental implant fixtures and abutments on which the
      prefabricated temporary prosthesis will be fixed.

      • Postoperative care Proper postoperative instructions will be given to the patient such as
      strict oral hygiene measures and soft diet for 1 month, in addition to the postoperative
      medications including antibiotics (amoxicillin 1g capsules b.d.s ) and analgesics (diclofenac
      potassium 50mg as needed). Adherence to follow ups will be also instructed
