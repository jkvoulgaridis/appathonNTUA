  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goals of total, reverse total and hemi shoulder arthroplasty are the same, to alleviate
      the patient's pain and obtain a full functional recovery. This outcome depends on the
      surgeon's ability to reproduce normal glenohumeral anatomy including bone morphology,
      capsular tension and rotator cuff function. Shoulder arthroplasty has become a safe and
      effective treatment for various diseases of the shoulder. This study goal is to document and
      report the short-term functional, radiographic, and quality of life outcomes of total
      shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) using the titan modular shoulder system.

    <measure>ASES</measure>
    <time_frame>two year post op</time_frame>
    <description>1. ASES: the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Standardized Shoulder Assessment
The ASES scale is intended to measure functional limitations and pain of the shoulder.
ASES is a 0 - 100 point scale; higher scores indicate better outcomes.
i. The ASES consists of two dimensions: pain and function (worth 50 points each).
a. The ASES questionnaire is composed of both a physician-rated component and a patient-reported component. Patient questions focus on: joint pain, instability and activities of daily living. Physician questions focus on: range of motion, strength, signs and instability</description>

    <time_frame>two year post op</time_frame>
    <description>2. EQ5D-5L: EuroQuol-5D
a. The EQ5D-5L scale evaluates general health status. The EQ-5D-5L has two sections; the first section measures health status using a descriptive system (index of 5 scores) and the second section measures health status on a Visual Analog Scale.
i. The EQ-5D-5L VAS outcome is measured on a 0 - 100 point scale. Optimal health status is indicated with a score of 100.
ii. The EQ-5D-5L descriptive system consists of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension is evaluated with a score of 1-5, higher scores indicate worse outcomes.
1. On each dimension, a score of 1 indicates no patient problems in that dimension, 2 indicates slight problems in that dimension, 3 indicates moderate problems in that dimension, 4 indicates severe problems in that dimension and 5 indicates extreme problems in that dimension.</description>

    <measure>PENN</measure>
    <time_frame>two year post op</time_frame>
    <description>3. PENN: PENN Shoulder Score
The PENN Shoulder Score is used to assess patient self-reported levels of pain, satisfaction and function.
PENN is measured on a 0 - 100 point scale; higher scores indicate better outcomes.
The PENN consists of 3 subscales: pain (at rest, with activity, and with strenuous activity), satisfaction and function. The PENN Pain subscale is scored from 0 to 30, the PENN satisfaction subscale is scored from 0 to 10 and the PENN function subscale is scored from 0 to 60.</description>

    <measure>SANE</measure>
    <time_frame>two year post op</time_frame>
    <description>4. SANE: Single assessment numeric evaluation
SANE is an outcome scale used to record the patient's self-reported function.
SANE is implemented on a scale of 0 - 100, 100 indicates full function (or function prior to injury) and 0 represents no function.</description>

    <measure>CS</measure>
    <time_frame>two year post op</time_frame>
    <description>5. CS: Constant-Murley Score
The CS score assesses functionality after the treatment of a shoulder injury.
CS is measured on a 0 - 100 point scale. Higher scores indicate better shoulder function.
CS is composed of four subscales: pain (15 points, based on patient report), activities of daily living (20 points, based on patient report), strength (25 points), and range of motion (40 points).</description>

    <measure>WOOS</measure>
    <time_frame>two year post op</time_frame>
    <description>6. WOOS: Western Ontario Osteoarthritis of the Shoulder index
WOOS is a disease-specific quality of life PRO tool, developed for osteoarthritis.
WOOS is measured on a 0-1900 point scale; 1900 indicates a clinical outcome fully symptomatic of osteoarthritis and 0 indicates an asymptomatic outcome.
i. WOOS is composed of 19 items scored on 100-point VAS scales. The 19 items represent four domains (6 questions for pain and physical symptoms, 5 questions for sport/recreation/work function, 5 questions for lifestyle function and 3 questions for emotional function).</description>
