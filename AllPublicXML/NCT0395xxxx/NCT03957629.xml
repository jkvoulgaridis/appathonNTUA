  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Compared to TDF, peginterferon alfa 2a may has more therapeutic efficacy in hepatitis B
      surface antigen or e antigen seroconversion and anti-tumor occurrence in chronic hepatitis b
      patients. We design this study to compare the effectiveness and safety between the
      combination therapy of TDF and peg-IFN with TDF alone in NAs experienced patients with HBV
      related liver fibrosis. Especially the improvement of liver fibrosis and the occurrence of
      long-term end-stage liver disease such as cirrhosis, liver cancer, etc.

      Main purpose: Comparing the improvement rate of liver fibrosis. Secondary purpose: Comparing
      the incidence of adverse events. Comparing the incidence of cirrhosis, hepatocellular
      carcinoma, and liver failure.

      Comparing the rates of HBsAg and HBeAg serological conversion.

    <description>Regression of fibrosis was defined as liver stiffness measured by transient elastography changed from 9~12kpa to 6~9kpa or below, and from 6~9kpa to less than 6kpa. After treatment, the proportion of patients with regression of fibrosis in the two groups was the ratio of regression of fibrosis, separately.</description>
