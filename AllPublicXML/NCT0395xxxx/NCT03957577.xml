  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common, preventable and treatable disease
      characterized by increasing airflow obstruction and the progressive development of
      respiratory symptoms including chronic cough, increased sputum production, dyspnea, and
      wheezing. The purpose of this prospective, epidemiological, cohort study is to evaluate the
      etiology of AECOPD in a Japanese population for comparison with observations in studies
      conducted in the United States of America and Europe. This study will support a precision
      medicine approach to COPD by estimating the proportion of bacterial, viral, eosinophilic and
      pauci-inflammatory exacerbations experienced by subjects and by comparing the lung
      microbiome, including the presence of potentially pathogenic viruses and bacteria, in
      stable-state COPD and during an AECOPD.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must be able and willing to comply with the requirements of the protocol.

          -  Subject must be aged greater than or equal to 40 years at the time of signing the
             informed consent form (ICF).

          -  Subjects must have a record of a clinical diagnosis of COPD, ACOS or CB.

          -  Subjects must have moderate to severe airflow limitation based on spirometry:FEV1
             percent predicted normal greater than or equal to 40 to less than or equal to 80% and
             post-bronchodilator FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio less than 0.7.

          -  Subjects must be symptomatic, defined as having a CAT score greater than or equal to
             10.

          -  Subjects must have a documented history of at least 1 LRTI treated with antibiotics
             and/or oral/systemic corticosteroids, which may include an exacerbation of COPD, in
             the 12 months prior to Screening, and must have not experienced either of these in the
             4 weeks prior to Screening, and must be determined to be stable-COPD by the
             investigator.

          -  Subjects must be current or former tobacco (cigarette) smokers with a smoking history
             of greater than or equal to 10 pack-years.

          -  Subjects may be male or female.

          -  For female subjects: A female subject is eligible to participate if she is not
             pregnant or breastfeeding, and at least one of the following conditions applies: Is
             not a woman of child bearing potential (WOCBP) or Is a WOCBP and using an acceptable
             contraceptive method during the study period.The investigator should evaluate the
             effectiveness of the contraceptive method. A WOCBP must have had a highly sensitive
             urine pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to enrolment that proved negative. If a
             urine pregnancy test cannot be confirmed as negative (example given [e.g.], an
             ambiguous result), a serum pregnancy test is required. In such cases, the subject must
             be excluded from participation if the serum pregnancy result is positive. The
             investigator is responsible for review of subject's medical history, menstrual
             history, and recent sexual activity to decrease the risk of including a woman with an
             early undetected pregnancy.

             Screening.

          -  Participation in the study would result in loss of blood or blood products in excess
             of 500 milliliter (mL) within 12 months.

          -  Subjects who have participated in a clinical study and been exposed to an
             investigational vaccine, pharmaceutical product or device within 30 days prior to
             Screening, or within five half-lives (t1/2) or twice the duration of the biological
             effect of the investigational product (whichever is longer).

             or thoracic or abdominal surgery, unstable cardiovascular status, recent myocardial
             infarction or pulmonary embolism or an allergy to short-acting beta2-agonsts (SABAs).
