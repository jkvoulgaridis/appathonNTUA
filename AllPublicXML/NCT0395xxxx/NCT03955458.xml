  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effect of EXPAREL on total opioid consumption through 72 hours
      following fascia iliaca compartment block (FICB) in subjects undergoing repair of
      intertrochanteric hip fracture.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current standard of care treatment for pain relief in patients with intertrochanteric hip
      fracture is a FICB with continuous infusion of ropivacaine given via catheter.

      In this study, some people will receive a single injection FICB with EXPAREL + bupivacaine
      HCl. The groups will be evaluated to determine the amount of pain medication they took from
      the FICB to 72 hours after.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Individuals between 65 and 85 years of age (inclusive of) at screening.

          2. Intertrochanteric femoral fractures with American Society of Anesthesiology physical
             status 1, 2, or 3.

          3. Able to provide informed consent, adhere to the study visit schedule, and complete all
             study assessments.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Hip fracture that requires total arthroplasty.

          2. Patients transferred from other hospitals.

          3. Patients that have other acute fractures.

          4. Pre-existing dementia (Mini-Mental State examination score &lt;20) or delirium
             (Mini-Mental State examination score &lt;24).

          5. Allergy, hypersensitivity, intolerance, or contraindication to any of the study
             medications for which an alternative is not named in the protocol (e.g., amide-type
             local anesthetics, opioids, bupivacaine, ropivacaine, acetaminophen, NSAIDs).

          6. Serious systemic comorbidities that cause a contraindication for EXPAREL/bupivacaine
             (severe hepatic or renal impairment) or ropivacaine.

          7. Use of anticoagulants (including aspirin, except low dose aspirin).

          8. Chronic opioid use of â‰¥ 20 morphine milligram equivalent (MME)/day for more than 7
             days in the last 30 days.

          9. Body Mass Index (BMI) &lt;17 kg/m2 or &gt;45 kg/m2.

         10. Known history of renal or hepatic dysfunction, coagulation or bleeding disorder.

         11. Concurrent painful physical condition that may require analgesic treatment (such as
             long-term, consistent use of opioids) in the post-operative period for pain that is
             not strictly related to the surgery and which may confound the post-operative
             assessments based on the physician's discretion.

         12. Clinically significant medical disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, would
             make participation in a clinical study inappropriate. This includes any psychiatric or
             other conditions that would constitute a contraindication to participation in the
             study.

         13. History of suspected or known addiction to or abuse of illicit drug(s), prescription
             medicine(s), or alcohol within the past 2 years.

         14. Administration of an investigational drug within 30 days or 5 elimination half-lives
             of such investigational drug, whichever is longer, prior to study drug administration,
             or planned administration of another investigational product or procedure during the
             subject's participation in this study.

         15. Previous participation in an EXPAREL study.

         16. Resident of a skilled nursing facility (SNF), long-term acute care (LTAC) facility,
             inpatient rehabilitation facility (IRF), or nursing home. Participants from assisted
             living facilities will be eligible for the study.

             In addition, the subject may be withdrawn from the study if the subject meets the
             following criteria during the hospital stay:

         17. Any clinically significant event or condition uncovered during the surgery (e.g.,
             excessive bleeding, acute sepsis) that might render the subject medically unstable or
             complicate the subject's post-operative course.

         18. Subjects who undergo hip fracture surgery more than 30 hours after admission to the
             Emergency Department.
