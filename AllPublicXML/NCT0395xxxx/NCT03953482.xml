  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anaphylaxis is a hypersensitivity reaction systemic, generalized, severe, life-threatening
      that may result from exposure to a triggering factor. The prevalence of anaphylaxis is 0.05
      to 2% in the general population. Most reactions appear within 30 minutes after contact with
      the triggering factor and last up to 6 hours. The main triggering factors are: 1/food,
      2/hymenopteran bites, 3/drugs. The main treatment is the early administration of adrenaline
      by Intramuscular route on medical prescription or by AAI (adrenaline auto-injector)
      associated with the exclusion of the allergen. Adrenaline treatment should be administered as
      soon as possible, a failure or delay in the use of adrenaline is a risk factor for death.
      Anaphylaxis is a chronic disease and the patient must be informed from the first episode
      about the risk of recurrence and the risk of death he is exposed to. Patient education is
      essential for the complete removal of the triggering factor, recognition of anaphylaxis
      symptoms and use of AAI. The risk of recurrence is high given the difficulty to completely
      eliminate the favourable factor (mainly food causes and hymenopteran bites): 1/3 of deaths
      from food anaphylaxis occur at home, and the peak mortality rate is between 10 and 30 years
      old. The diagnosis of anaphylaxis can be difficult because the symptomatology can be so
      varied. It is under-diagnosed, which leads to a lack of medical care and therefore an
      under-prescription of AAI. Some American studies identifying emergency room visits for
      anaphylaxis find that in less than 30% of cases there is a prescription for AAI, in less than
      40% of advices about triggering factor's eviction and in less than 20% a guidance to an
      allergology consultation. In France, the HAS published in 2013 a procedure to be followed
      after the treatment of a suspected anaphylaxis: the patient's management must be diagnostic,
      therapeutic and educational. It must be systematically based on three axes:

        -  the prescription of AAI with an explanation of its use,

        -  the provision of written information on the mechanism and symptoms of anaphylaxis,
           attitude to be followed in event of an anaphylactic reaction, and need for eviction if
           the allergen has been identified,

        -  guidance to an allergology consultation.

      Therapeutic education for anaphylactic patients is essential given the risk involved. In an
      American study, it was shown that only 60% of teens and young adults suffering from food
      allergies report having AAI systematically with them. Information and education is therefore
      essential for these patients.
