  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to study the impact of Western lifestyle, including moderate
      alcohol consumption and delayed eating patterns on studying individuals' susceptibility to
      colorectal cancer. This study aims to increase our ability to identify individuals at risk
      for colorectal cancer in the future.

      Each subject will experience four conditions (each for one week in duration with a week +/- 2
      days wash-out in between): (1) &quot;right-time eating&quot; / no alcohol, (2) &quot;right-time eating&quot; /
      with alcohol, (3) &quot;delayed-eating&quot; / no alcohol, (4) &quot;delayed-eating&quot; / with alcohol. The
      order of experiments will be randomized [concealed randomization]. All subjects will undergo
      unprepped sigmoidoscopy after each week of intervention. In Aim 2, all subjects will have an
      option to undergo a 24h circadian assessment in the Biological Rhythms Research Lab after
      each week of intervention. The Investigator will assess (i) central circadian rhythms by
      collecting hourly salivary samples for melatonin assays and (ii) peripheral rhythm in the
      intestinal tract by buccal swabs once every 2h (12 time points) as well as by rectal sampling
      twice (every 12 hr). For Aim 3, sigmoidoscopy without sedation will be used to obtain colonic
      samples as the safe method compared to colonoscopy, which has some small but finite risks
      associated with the procedure (e.g, bleeding or perforation) as well as sedation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer mortality in the US. CRC's risk
      is closely linked to the modern lifestyle. Alcohol is commonly used in our society and is an
      established risk factor for both pre-cancerous (polyp) and cancerous lesions of the colon.
      However this knowledge has not been translated to our current risk stratifications for CRC as
      the process of alcohol-induced carcinogenesis is not predictable. Mucosal inflammation is a
      well-established mechanism that mediates the effect of alcohol induced tissue injury in the
      intestine. Inflammation also plays a crucial role in pathogenesis of CRC. Factors that
      promote a pro-tumorigenic inflammatory state in the setting of alcohol are unknown. Since CRC
      occurs only in a small subset of alcohol user, alcohol alone may not be sufficient to start
      the neoplastic process and additional cofactors are required. One such factor is circadian
      dysrhythmia that is another modern lifestyle habit, shown to be associated with an increased
      risk of CRC. Further, previous research has shown that disruption of circadian rhythm
      exacerbates alcohol-induced intestinal inflammation. The Investigator hypothesize that
      altered circadian rhythms due to &quot;wrong-time&quot; eating (abnormal eating) are an important
      determinant in alcohol induced mucosal inflammation and carcinogenesis. Our preliminary data
      supports our hypothesis and shows that abnormal eating patterns accelerate alcohol-induced
      polyposis in a mouse model of CRC. Each subject will experience four conditions (each for one
      week in duration with a week +/- 2 days wash-out in between): (1) &quot;right-time eating&quot; / no
      alcohol, (2) &quot;right-time eating&quot; / with alcohol, (3) &quot;delayed-eating&quot; / no alcohol, (4)
      &quot;delayed-eating&quot; / with alcohol. The order of experiments will be randomized [concealed
      randomization]. All subjects will undergo unprepped sigmoidoscopy after each week of
      intervention. In Aim 2, all subjects will have an option to undergo a 24h circadian
      assessment in the Biological Rhythms Research Lab after each week of intervention. The
      Investigator will assess (i) central circadian rhythms by collecting hourly salivary samples
      for melatonin assays and (ii) peripheral rhythm in the intestinal tract by buccal swabs once
      every 2h (12 time points) as well as by rectal sampling twice (every 12 hr). For Aim 3,
      sigmoidoscopy without sedation will be used to obtain colonic samples as the safe method
      compared to colonoscopy, which has some small but finite risks associated with the procedure
      (e.g, bleeding or perforation) as well as sedation.

    <description>Sigmoid mucosal biopsy specimens are collected at baseline and at the end of each intervention week. Using gene expression analysis (RNA seq), impact of our intervention on sigmoid mucosal samples, with regard to the mucosal immune response will be assessed. This will be assessed by % change in immune expression.
Tissue staining will be used to measure the effect of our interventions on markers of colonic neoplastic process including epithelial proliferation and apoptosis. The effect will be assessed by % changes in proliferation and apoptosis rate in the tissue.</description>

    <description>Impact of our treatments on circadian read outs will be assessed by using a wrist actigraphy in which activity data to calculate phase assessment (hr units) and sleep indexes including {sleep duration, wake after sleep onset (in minutes), total sleep time (in minutes), and sleep percentage} will be measured.
If the subject is interested, our in house circadian lab measurements (activity data and urine melatonin as described plus buccal circadian gene expression) will be available to complement the aforementioned circadian measures. To this end , subjects will enter the Biological Rhythms Research Lab after each week of the intervention period for 24h for assessments of central circadian rhythms (hourly salivary melatonin) and peripheral clock genes of the digestive tract from mucosal cells taken from buccal swaps once every 2h (12 time points). Percent change in expression level of the genes will be compared between groups.</description>
