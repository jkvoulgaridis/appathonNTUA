  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physiotherapy treatment protocols described in the bibliography after hip surgery are most of
      them nonspecific. An experimental study is proposed to determine the effectiveness of a
      protocolized treatment of physiotherapy in the postoperative treatment of femoroacetabular
      impingement treated by arthroscopy. This study tries to adapt the non-specific post-surgical
      physiotherapy treatment protocols of the hip to the characteristics of the femoroacetabular
      impingement and its arthroscopic surgery.

    <measure>Functionality of the hip</measure>
    <time_frame>14 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Modified Harris Hip Score Questionnaire (mHHS) is used to determine the functionality of the hip. The values are between 0 (lowest functionality) and 100 (normal function). The sub scales the subscales that compose it are hip pain (from 0 to 44), lameness in walking (from 0 to 11), need for walking aids (0 to 11), walked distance (0 to 11), ability to going up or down stairs (0 to 4), putting on shoes (0 to 4), sitting down without pain (0 to 5) and possibility of using public transport (0 to 1), with 0 being always the worst value.</description>

    <measure>Fabere Test</measure>
    <time_frame>14 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The patient's hip is flexed, abducted and externally rotated by placing the external malleolus on the knee of the contralateral leg. The pelvis is stabilized and an overpressure is applied to the inside of the knee. It is positive if the pain in the buttock or groin is reproduced. Test with inter-evaluator reliability in Kappa values (95% CI) of 0.60</description>

    <description>Flexion, adduction and internal rotation test. The supine patient, the evaluator patiently brings the patient's hip up to 100ยบ flexion and adduction while applying internal rotation. It is positive if pain in the groin is reproduced. Test with inter-evaluator reliability in Kappa values of 0.48</description>

    <description>The intervention is structured in 14 weeks. Gradually the level of demand for the exercises increases over the weeks. Isometric and concentric exercises of the affected muscle groups are combined in the first weeks, as well as mobilization exercises of the joints involved in the injury. In addition, the time of permanence in a sitting, prone or supine position is prescribed. The return to the march and activities of daily life are staggered.
The number of series and repetitions to be performed is described in each exercise.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Having suffered hip / groin pain for at least 3 months.

          -  Be a patient diagnosed with femoroacetabular syndrome by an orthopedic surgeon based
             on symptoms, clinical signs and diagnostic imaging.

          -  To have signed the informed consent.

          -  Have time available to follow a 14-week physiotherapy treatment program.

          -  Be programmed for hip arthroscopy.

          -  Be able to speak and understand the Spanish language.

          -  Be between 18 and 50 years of age.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  To have received physiotherapy treatment in the last three months.

          -  Having previously received hip surgery.

          -  Subjects with previous deformities in the femur that severely alter joint mobility
             such as Perthes disease, gliding of the upper femoral epiphysis or avascular necrosis,
             acetabular fracture, hip dislocation or fracture of the femoral neck.

          -  Evidence of preexisting osteoarthritis, defined as Tonnis grade&gt; 2

          -  Subjects with previous deformities in the pelvis that severely alter joint mobility.

          -  Any other cardiovascular, psychological and / or cognitive diagnosed pathology that
             impedes the correct understanding of the study and prevents objective study variables.

          -  Subjects that are under the effects of anesthetics or muscle relaxants that mask the
             sensation of the patient before the techniques of the study.

          -  Professional athletes.

          -  Subjects in which hip arthroscopy is contraindicated.
