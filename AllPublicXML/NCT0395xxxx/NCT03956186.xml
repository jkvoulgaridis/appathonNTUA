  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinal anesthesia for caesarean section is associated with a decrease in systemic vascular
      resistance and cardiac output and may cause hypotension in a significant portion of the
      parturients. Hypotension during delivery may cause maternal and fetal complications. If
      parturients who are likely to develop hypotension after spinal anesthesia can be identified
      before surgery, anesthesiologists would have opportunity to take measures such as
      prophylactic vasopressor administration. Perfusion index (PI) measured by pulse oximetry
      reflects vasomotor tone which affects the degree of hypotension after spinal anesthesia. This
      is a non-invasive method of assessing the relative vascular tone with the use of pulse
      oximeter which calculates the ratio of pulsatile versus the non-pulsatile component of the
      blood flow. A lower PI indicates greater peripheral vasomotor tone. Pleth variability index
      (PVI) is calculated using maximum and minimum values of perfusion index during respiratory
      cycles. PVI is one of the dynamic indices that can predict fluid responsiveness. There are
      several studies investigating the predictive value of finger PI and PVI on hypotension after
      spinal anesthesia. However the aortocaval compression by the gravid uterus directly effects
      the lower extremity perfusion. So, in this study we aimed to investigate whether the right
      toe PI and PVI values at supine and left lateral positions can predict hypotension during
      caesarean section.
