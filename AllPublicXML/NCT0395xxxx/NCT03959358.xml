  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with multiple myeloma (a type of blood cancer affecting the white blood cells) or
      amyloidosis (abnormal buildup of a protein called amyloid in the body) are often given
      treatment with the drugs lenalidomide or pomalidomide. Some patients may experience an
      allergic reaction to these drugs which would mean stopping the treatment.

      The purpose of this research study is to see how safe and useful desensitization is in
      allowing patients to receive further treatment with lenalidomide or pomalidomide.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Some doctors believe that the body may be taught to react less or stop reacting to, the
      things that would otherwise trigger an allergic reaction. This is called desensitization.
      Desensitization is usually done with repeat exposure to the thing that causes the allergic
      reaction. For example, people who have allergies may receive small, controlled doses of the
      allergen over a period of time until the allergic reactions are tolerable or are stopped
      completely.

      The researchers want to see if giving low doses of lenalidomide or pomalidomide to people who
      experienced an allergic reaction to these medications can become desensitized so that they
      are able to continue treatment for their disease with these drugs.

    <description>Participants will only receive lenalidomide if they had previously received this drug as a part of their treatment for multiple myeloma or amyloidosis and had experienced an allergic reaction to the drug.
Participants will first be given a low dose of lenalidomide with increasing doses over 10-12 steps over 3.5 to 5 hours. Participants will be monitored for side effects or reactions prior to each dose step and any reactions will be managed before giving the increased dose at the next step.
The final dose will be determined by the study doctor and is expected to be the dose that participants will restart treatment with lenalidomide at.</description>

          -  History of hypersensitivity reactions (HSR) to lenalidomide or pomalidomide within 30
             days of signing consent.

          -  All study participants must be registered into the mandatory Lenalidomide or
             Pomalidomide Pregnancy Prevention Plan, and be willing and able to comply with the
             requirements.

          -  Females of reproductive potential must adhere to the pregnancy testing and
             contraceptive techniques as required by the Pregnancy Prevention Plan.

          -  Diagnosed with multiple myeloma or amyloidosis, who had experienced moderately-severe
             cutaneous reactions, with or without being symptomatic (itchy rash) to
             immunomodulating agents (IMiDs) OR complained of angioedema or anaphylaxis reactions
             (in additional to body rash), attributable to lenalidomide or pomalidomide.

          -  Patients must be afebrile at least 48 hours prior to proposed desensitization day.

          -  For patients with existing body rash, a complete resolution of rash is needed prior to
             Rapid Desensitization Program procedures at least 7 days prior to desensitization.

          -  Patients may continue to administer their current medication prior to the start of
             Rapid Desensitization Program (RDP). Best possible medication history will be taken
             prior to RDP, with the exception of withholding beta- blockers on the day of
             desensitization. Patient's allergy history will be documented.

          -  Patients with other allergy history may also be included.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Female who is pregnant or suspected of being pregnant or breast feeding or likely to
             breast feed during the study duration

             active against myeloma, resulting in clinical deterioration.

          -  Patients who are taking IMiDs-based therapy for an indication other than multiple
             myeloma (MM) and/or systemic amyloidosis (AL).

          -  The development of erythema nodosum, if characterized by a desquamating rash while
             taking thalidomide, IMiDs or similar drugs.

          -  Patients who, for whatever reason, are unable to tolerate IMiDs (other than

          -  Patients who have completed 3 RDPs and continued to have breakthrough hypersensitivity
             reactions (HSR) post Rapid Desensitization Program (RDP).
