  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity leads to a vicious circle that increases intramuscular fat, insulin resistance,
      promotes muscular dysfunction resulting in increased muscle fat accumulation. The study of
      muscle function and intramyocellular lipids is insufficient for obesity. Particularly, the
      study of mechanisms in muscle function and intramyocellular lipids is few nationally and
      internationally.

      This study is prospective study. The goal of this study is

        1. To examine the distribution and contractile properties (cross-sectional area, maximal
           force, specific force, maximal shortening velocity) of single muscle fiber sex/Myosin
           heavy chain (MHC) type-related differences, by extracting a single muscle fiber from the
           vastus lateralis in young men and women.

        2. To examine the effects of intramyocellular lipids on physical activity ability, muscle
           dysfunction, and metabolic disorders in relation to aging and obesity.

        3. To examine the effects of intramyocellular lipids on physical activity ability, muscular
           dysfunction, and metabolic disorders after 12 weeks resistance exercise intervention.

    <measure>Single muscle fiber maximal shortening velocity (Vo)</measure>
    <time_frame>Before intervention / after 12weeks intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline Vo to 12 weeks after initial assessment. Chemically skinned vastus lateralis muscle fiber Vo (FL/s) is measured by slack test procedure. The time required to take up the imposed slack was measured from the onset of the length step to the beginning of the tension redevelopment . For each amplitude of length, the ﬁber was reextended while relaxed to minimize nonuniformity of sarcomere length. A straight line was presented to a plot of length vs. time, using least-squares regression, and the slope of the line divided by the segment length was recorded as Vo for that ﬁber.
Vo is analyzed to compare the change after intervention from baseline.</description>
