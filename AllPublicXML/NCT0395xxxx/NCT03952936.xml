  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of vestibular rehabilitation for an
      individual who has chronic central vestibular deficits due to cerebellar dysfunction. Due to
      the lack of treatment for chronic cerebellar dysfunction with Physical Therapy, the
      investigators hope to produce a protocol for chronic cerebellar dysfunction utilizing balance
      training, vestibular rehabilitation, or any other rehabilitation technique that may alleviate
      or eliminate symptoms.

      Investigators will test the subject initially at 4 weeks, 8 weeks and 6 months post start
      date to assess for symptom improvement.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Activity Specific Balance Confidence Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>2-6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Perceived self confidence with balance. 16 items are scored on a 0-100% scale. Items are totaled and then averaged. The higher the average score the higher the confidence with balance and the less likely risk there is for falling.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dizziness handicap inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>2-6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Perceived handicap from dizziness. Items are scored on a 0, 2 or 4 point scale with adding up the total number of the 26 items. The lower the score, the less perceived amount of handicap is present.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional Gait Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>2-6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Gait and balance test. 10 item test rated on each item from 0-3. total score is calculated of 10 items. the higher the score the less likely risk for falling is present.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Motion Sensitivity Quotient</measure>
    <time_frame>2-6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Motion sickness indicator. 16 items are scored based on symptom severity and duration. positive items are calculated together to receive a percentage. the lower the percentage the less motion sensitivity a person has.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Modified Clinical Test for Sensory Integration in Balance</measure>
    <time_frame>2-6 months</time_frame>
    <description>balance test for sensory system inputs. 6 item test to check for sensory integration with balance. each of the 6 items is calculated for length of time and amount of sway. the less the sway, the lower the score and the better the balance.</description>
