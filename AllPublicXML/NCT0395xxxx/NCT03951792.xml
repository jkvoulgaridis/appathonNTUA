  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers are trying to determine whether certain microbiome cause cancer or whether they
      are part of the microbiome in the gut due to the presence of cancer.

      The purpose of this research is to learn about how the gastrointestinal bacteria (microbiome)
      can contribute to colon cancer, and how it may change due to colon cancer. In addition, we
      are going to study the features of the microbiome that can help predict recovery after colon
      resection. To do this, we are going to compare the microbiome from subjects with colon cancer
      to subjects without colon cancer.

      Study participation involves collection of stool samples before and after your surgery, as
      well as samples of residual (left-over) colon tissue from your surgery. We would also like to
      collect optional samples from your follow-up colonoscopy. You may be in the study for up to 5
      years.

    <measure>Microbial 16S rDNA Biomarkers</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The samples will be used to partially (V3-V5 region) amplify the microbial 16S rDNA genes through a polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The PCR product will subsequently be purified and quantified before being sequenced. They will also be used for whole genome sequencing (WGS) and Methylation sequencing (Methyl-Seq). The RNA will be used for RNAseq.</description>
