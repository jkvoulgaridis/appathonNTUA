  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression in youth is a serious public health concern for which more personalized treatments
      are needed. This study will test the effect of an intervention aimed at enhancing depressed
      children's social cognitive capacities (e.g., ability to take another's perspective), thereby
      making treatment of depression in youth more efficient and effective. Participants in both
      the R61 (N=42) and R33 (N=82) will be youth between 12 and 17 years old currently
      experiencing a depressive disorder. Youth will be randomized to either an enhanced CBT
      intervention that teaches social cognitive skills, particularly social perspective taking and
      theory of mind as compared to CBT only. The primary target is improvement in the social
      cognitive skills at post treatment in the first trial (R61) and improvements in both social
      cognitive skills and depressive symptoms at post-treatment and at a 4-month follow-up (R33).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression in youth is a recurrent and impairing disorder. Although some treatments have
      shown modest effects in children and adolescents (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy -- CBT),
      there remains a critical need to build upon these therapies in order to reach even more
      youths with depression. One variable hypothesized to affect children's interpersonal
      relationships is their level of social cognitive development on abilities particularly
      relevant to social functioning and CBT (e.g., social perspective taking; theory of mind). The
      first RCT (R61) will test the efficacy of an intervention aimed at increasing children's
      social cognitive (SC) abilities.Youth (ages 12-17; N=42) with depression diagnoses or
      clinical levels of depressive symptoms (CESD &gt; 20) will be randomized to either the social
      cognitive training enhanced CBT (SCT-CBT) or CBT only. Pre- and post-treatment evaluations
      will assess the social cognitions. In the second RCT (R33), we will conduct a replication
      trial with a new sample of 82 youth (ages 12-17) again randomized to SCT-CBT or CBT only.
      Youth will be evaluated with regard to the SC abilities (i.e., theory of mind), level of
      depressive symptoms, and social functioning at baseline, post-treatment, and at a 4-month
      follow-up (R33). Finally, in the R33 we will test if increases in SC abilities partially
      account for the relation between treatment condition and decreases in depression. If the
      SCT-CBT intervention significantly improves children's SC abilities and social functioning
      and decreases depression, then this will provide therapists with a more efficient and
      personalized treatment of depression in youth,

    <intervention_model_description>The study has two intervention arms: (1) CBT + SCT is cognitive behavioral therapy enhanced with training in social cognitive abilities (e.g., social perspective taking), and (2) CBT-only is cognitive behavioral therapy without the additional SCT training component. Adolescents are randomized to either condition. We will stratify randomization by gender, age (12-14; 15-17), race/ethnicity (minority status), and medication use.</intervention_model_description>
