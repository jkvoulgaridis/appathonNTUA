  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several investigations suggest neural stem cells located in the subventricular region play an
      active role in promoting or even initiating cortical malignant glioma growth. Although normal
      appearing on neuroimaging, surgical specimens taken from this region show it contains
      malignant glioma stem-like cells. Some retrospective analyses found patients who received
      radiation therapy to this region during standard of care treatments lived longer than
      patients who did not.

      The investigator's study hypothesizes (1) stereotactic radiosurgery of cancer stem-like cells
      in these regions will be well tolerated during standard of care therapy, (2) focused
      stereotactic radiosurgery will be more effective in destroying cancer stem cells than
      conventional radiation therapy, and (3) treatment will improve malignant glioma survival.

      Since 2005, standard treatment for malignant gliomas includes surgery as extensive as
      possible to reduce tumor bulk without causing deficits, followed by temozolomide chemotherapy
      with radiation therapy to the surgical area plus an additional 1-2 cm margin around this
      cavity. Despite advances in surgical techniques and radiation delivery, 80% of tumors recur
      at the margins of the surgery, within the regions that were treated with radiation.

      In 2014, different institutions found patients lived longer if part of the brain that looked
      normal received radiation therapy. This region was called the &quot;subventricular zone&quot; and was
      known to contain embryonic stem cells that formed the brain. Researchers believed this region
      contained cancer stem cells promoting tumor survival and growth. Some studies suggested this
      area might even represent another reservoir of malignant tumor cells.

      During participation in this clinical trial, targeted radiation to the subventricular zone is
      given in addition to standard of care radiation and chemotherapy. The subventricular zone is
      divided into four regions and one of four regions on the same side as the tumor is treated,
      not the whole subventricular zone. Only patients scheduled to receive six weeks of standard
      therapy are eligible for participation. The additional radiation therapy is delivered over
      the course of one day. The study is not randomized and all patients will receive the
      experimental treatment. Patients complete regular evaluations over the next two years to
      monitor toxicity, which is the main concern of this Phase I study.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Consent to participate in a clinical trial

          -  Confirmed WHO III or WHO IV malignant glioma, based upon Northwell Health
             neuropathology review. Outside cases must be submitted for central neuropathology
             review.

          -  Completion of major surgical debulking procedure, defined as residual tumor volume of
             less than 20% original mass

          -  Age greater than 18 years old. Children are not included because their disease behaves
             in a biologically distinct manner and there are already national clinical trials
             specific to them

          -  Patients will not be excluded on the basis of advanced age (i.e., &gt;75 years old), but
             there will need to be an intent to deliver standard chemoradiation therapy. Patients
             scheduled for accelerated radiation therapy are ineligible

          -  Karnofsky performance status of 50 or higher. Patients may require considerable
             assistance and frequent medical care.

          -  Willingness to sign HIPAA authorization that allows the investigators to continue to
             obtain clinical information even if patient leaves the study institution for care
             elsewhere in order to collect long term outcome and toxicity data.

          -  Lobar tumor location (Frontal, temportal, parietal, occipital, or thalamic)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability to consent to participate in a clinical trial, as determined during the
             standard of care practice evaluation of a malignant brain tumor patient.

          -  Prior malignant glioma treatment less than 12 months prior to chemoradiation therapy,
             other than surgery with or without Gliadel wafer placement. Patients who received
             radiation therapy in the treatment of a lower grade malignancy (i.e., low grade glioma
             now transformed to WHO Grade III or WHO grade IV) are eligible as long as they are
             eligible for standard chemoradiation therapy and the radiation therapy delivered in
             the past was more than 12 months prior to planned chemoradiation therapy.

          -  Any localized interstitial radiotherapy treatment

          -  Concurrent clinical trial participation during standard of care therapy. Clinical
             trial participation is permitted in the event of recurrent disease.

          -  Nonlobar tumor location (e.g., callosal, brainstem, or cerebellar tumors)

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Any co-morbid systemic illnesses or other severe concurrent disease which, in the
             judgment of the principal investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry
             into this study or interfere significantly with the proper assessment of safety and
             toxicity of the proposed regimen

          -  Pregnancy is an exclusion criterion. Pregnant patients will not receive the study
             treatment. Women of childbearing age are routinely screened prior to radiation therapy
             administration for pregnancy. If found to be pregnant, then patient will not be
             offered participation in the trial
