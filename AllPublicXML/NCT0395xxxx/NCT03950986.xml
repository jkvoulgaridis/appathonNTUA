  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Office of Evaluation Sciences is collaborating with Emory University and the Atlanta VA
      Health Care System to increase adult immunizations uptake among veterans. The intervention
      targets patients of primary care providers (physicians, physician assistants and nurse
      practitioners) through a modification of the existing reminders in the VA electronic health
      record system. The team will evaluate the intervention using a randomized controlled trial.

      The Office of Evaluation Sciences is collaborating with Emory University and the Atlanta VA
      Health Care System to increase adult immunizations uptake among veterans. The intervention
      targets patients of primary care providers (physicians, physician assistants and nurse
      practitioners) through a modification of the existing reminders in the VA electronic health
      record system.

      The intervention includes a bundled vaccination reminder for influenza, pneumococcal and TDap
      vaccines, an immunization dashboard that relays a patient's vaccination status and history,
      and talking points for providers to use in their dialogues with patients. This intervention
      was designed to mitigate potential bottlenecks to vaccination, based on conversations and
      observations with facility clinicians.

      The team will evaluate the intervention using a randomized controlled trial.

    <intervention_model_description>Intervention is designed to target patients of primary care providers (physicians, physician assistants and nurse practitioners) in the Atlanta VA Medical System. Primary care providers will be assigned to a provider-side treatment (modified vaccine reminders in the electronic health record (EHR) system) or to control (existing vaccine reminders). Outcomes will be tracked for patients who have appointments with these providers.</intervention_model_description>

Other changes include an immunization dashboard that relays a patient's vaccination status and talking points for providers to use in their dialogues with patients.</description>
