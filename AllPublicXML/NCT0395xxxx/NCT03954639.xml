    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy adult male or female volunteers ages 18 or older

          2. American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status 1, 2 or 3.

          3. Able to provide informed consent, adhere to the study schedule, and complete all study
             assessments.

          4. Body Mass Index ≥18 and ≤40 kg/m2

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Allergy, hypersensitivity, intolerance, or contraindication to any of the study
             medications for which an alternative is not named in the protocol (eg, amide-type
             local anesthetics, opioids, bupivacaine, NSAIDs)

          2. Documented history of long-term diabetes, renal (serum creatinine level &gt;2mg/dL [176.8
             μmol/L]) or hepatic dysfunction (serum alanine or aspartame transferase &gt; 3 times the
             upper limit of normal), coagulation or bleeding disorder and severe peripheral
             vascular disease

          3. Concurrent painful physical condition that may require analgesic treatment (such as
             long-term, consistent use of opioids) in the post dosing period for pain and which, in
             the investigator's opinion may confound the post dosing assessments

          4. History of, suspected, or known addiction to or abuse of illicit drug(s), prescription
             medicine(s), or alcohol within the past 2 years

          5. Administration of an investigational drug within 30 days or 5 elimination half-lives
             of such investigational drug, whichever is longer, prior to study drug administration,
             or planned administration of another investigational product or procedure during the
             subject's participation in this study

          6. Previous participation in EXPAREL study

          7. Uncontrolled anxiety, schizophrenia, or other psychiatric disorder that, in the
             opinion of the investigator, could interfere with study assessments or compliance

          8. Currently pregnant, nursing, or planning to become pregnant during the study

          9. Clinically significant medical disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, would
             make participation in a clinical study inappropriate. This includes any psychiatric or
             other conditions that would constitute a contraindication to participation in the
             study

         10. Currently on neuroleptic agent [e.g., gabapentin, pregabalin (Lyrica), duloxetine
             (Cymbalta) etc.]

         11. Inadequate sensory function on the foot (monofilament test)

         12. Chronic opioid use in the last 30 days (≥30 morphine equivalents/ day)

             In addition, the subject may be withdrawn from the study if the subject meets the
             following criterion during or post-surgery:

         13. Any clinically significant event or condition uncovered during the surgery (e.g.,
             excessive bleeding, acute sepsis) that, in the opinion of the investigator, renders
             the subject medically unstable or complicates the subject's post-operative course
