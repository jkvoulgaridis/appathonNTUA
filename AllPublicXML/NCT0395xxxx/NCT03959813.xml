  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Palliative care is part of a comprehensive approach to the person, in the advanced phase of a
      serious illness. The purpose of this care is to relieve painful symptoms, to promote comfort
      and quality of life. In the context of a serious illness, the sick person is confronted with
      body modifications that have an impact on his body experience, that is, on his feelings and
      on the image that he has of his body.

      Psychomotricity is a paramedical discipline that focuses on body-psyche links. The
      psychomotor therapist is authorized to take care of psychomotor disorders, as defined in the
      decree of competences. These psychomotor disorders appear in connection with the evolution of
      the serious illness and the presence of symptoms in these patients (ex: disorders of the
      tonic regulation, psychomotor disharmony, disorders of the representation of the body, etc.).
      In palliative care, the psychomotor therapist seeks to regulate these psychomotor disorders
      and thus to promote a more satisfying physical experience in the patient, through the use of
      different bodily approaches.

      Several studies have shown the beneficial effects of touching and moving the body in cancer
      patients, but no work evaluating the effects of the psychomotor approach (involving various
      body mediations) on the body experience of patients with cancer in palliative situation

    <description>The patient will have a first psychomotricity session. It will be carried out remotely from the drug catches to avoid bias induced by their administration having effects on the symptoms studied.
Before and after the session, two evaluations will be offered to the patient and performed by a nurse:
A questionnaire, based on the physical experience,
The ESAS scale will be administered to the patient to assess the importance of symptoms (pain, depression, anxiety, discomfort) During the session, a touch treatment will be offered to promote awareness of the body. Passive mobilizations at the level of the members and the axis will then be proposed, to promote the pleasure of being in motion. A touch treatment will be done again to promote relaxation.
A questionnaire can be offered to the patient after 4 sessions to assess his perception of psychomotricity.</description>
