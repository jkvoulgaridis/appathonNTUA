      Treatment options for end-stage renal patients are renal transplantation, peritoneal
      dialysis, or hemodialysis, and the majority of these patients live on hemodialysis dependent.
      The venous access route required for hemodialysis is provided by dialysis catheters until
      arterio-venous shunts are performed. The aim of this study was to determine the difference
      between verbal or video-related anxiety levels of patients with hemodialysis and determine
      which one is better before the hemodialysis procedure is performed.

    <time_frame>10 minute</time_frame>
    <description>The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI):To measure via self-report the presence and severity of current symptoms of anxiety and a generalized propensity to be anxious. The STAI has 40 items, 20 items allocated to each of the S-Anxiety and T-Anxiety subscales. Range of scores for each subtest is 20-80, the higher score indicating greater anxiety. A cut point of 39-40 has been suggested to detect clinically significant symptoms for the S-Anxiety scale Visual Analogue Scale (VAS): The pain VAS is a unidimensional measure of pain intensity, which has been widely used in diverse adult populations. Using a ruler, the score is determined by mea-surging the distance (mm) on the 10-cm line between the &quot;no pain&quot; anchor and the patient's mark, providing a range of scores from 0-100. VAS have been recommended: no pain (0-4 mm), mild pain(5-44 mm), moderate pain (45-74 mm), and severe pain (75-100 mm)</description>

        The study was planned to receive 84 people. The people to be recruited will be divided into
        groups.

          1. the group will only be informed verbally.

          2. The group will be informed as both verbal and video. State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and
             VAS score will be made after informing all groups and after Hemodialysis Catheter
             Insertion
