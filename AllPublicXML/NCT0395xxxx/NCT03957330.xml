  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression and anxiety are common and prevalent conditions that often go untreated. In an
      attempt to increase timely and accessible psychological treatment, Internet-delivered
      cognitive behavioural therapy (ICBT) has emerged. ICBT involves delivering therapeutic
      content via structured online lessons. This is often combined with therapist guidance, such
      as once per week contact via secure messaging or phone calls over several months. Over the
      past several years, the investigators have been studying the efficacy of ICBT for symptoms of
      depression and anxiety and found ~70% of patient's fully complete treatment and demonstrate
      large improvement in symptoms. Although outcomes of ICBT are very impressive, there is some
      room for improvement in terms of completion rates and outcomes.

      In this three-factorial randomized controlled trial, the investigators aim to contribute to
      the literature by examining whether the efficacy of ICBT in routine practice is moderated by
      amount of contact (once versus twice a week), inclusion of homework reflection questionnaire
      (yes vs no) and location of therapist (specialized unit vs community mental health clinic).
      Follow-up measures will be carried out at 3, 6 and 12 months after randomization. Primary
      outcomes are reduced anxiety and depression. Secondary outcomes include psychological
      distress, panic, social anxiety, trauma, health anxiety, quality of life, disability,
      intervention usage (e.g., completion rates, log-ins, emails sent), satisfaction, therapeutic
      alliance, and costs (e.g., health care utilization).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Based on past research of ICBT in routine care, patients and therapists have expressed an
      interest in &quot;personalizing&quot; the delivery of ICBT, for example, by increasing the amount of
      therapist support available (from once a week to twice a week) to reflect the unique needs
      and preferences of the patients. Patients also express an interest in personalizing &quot;therapy
      messages&quot;. One current barrier to offering more personalized messages, however, is that
      patients do not consistently provide information on their use of new treatment strategies, as
      well as strengths and challenges of using strategies. As a result, therapists find it
      difficult to personalize their messages. One method of overcoming this difficulty is to
      systematically ask patients to reflect on their use of treatment strategies (e.g., monitoring
      thoughts, challenging thoughts, controlled breathing, pleasant activities, and exposure)
      through questionnaires rather than relying on patients to provide this information in emails.
      Another factor that could moderate ICBT efficacy is therapist location. Some therapists who
      provide ICBT work in a specialized unit where there is primary focus on ICBT and daily
      attention to following ICBT guidelines. Other therapists deliver ICBT from community mental
      health clinics where the primary focus of the setting is on face-to-face care and there is
      lower familiarity with ICBT. It is possible that ICBT may be more effectively delivered in a
      setting where the primary focus is on ICBT.

    <description>All clients will receive the Wellbeing Course developed at Macquarie University, Australia. The Wellbeing Course is a transdiagnostic Internet-delivered cognitive behaviour intervention targeting symptoms of depressive and anxiety disorders. It comprises 5 online lessons targeting: 1) symptom identification and the cognitive behavioural model; 2) thought monitoring and challenging; 3) de-arousal strategies and pleasant activity scheduling; 4) graduated exposure; and 5) relapse prevention. Materials are presented in a didactic (i.e., text-based with visual images) and case-enhanced learning format (i.e., educational stories demonstrate the application of skills) and include homework activities. Lessons are released gradually in a standardized order over 8 weeks. Phone calls will only be made if there is a significant clinical issue requiring therapist attention that cannot be addressed over email (e.g., sudden increase in symptoms). Therapists will spend ~15 mins. per week/per client.</description>
