  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to explore new safe effective psychotherapeutic interventions for
      schizophrenia through assessing the efficacy and acceptability of complementary &quot;Insight
      Enhancement Program&quot; (IEP) and &quot;Metacognitive Training for Psychosis&quot; (MCT), in relation to
      each other, and in relation to &quot;Treatment As Usual&quot; (TAU). It is hypothesized that at the end
      of therapy, compared to &quot;Treatment As Usual&quot;, patients undergoing whether (IEP) or (MCT) will
      display a significant reduction in psychopathology particularly positive symptoms and
      delusional ideation, and a significant improvement in Insight and metacognitive capacity.
      Additionally, it is hypothesized that the acceptance of (IEP) and (MCT) will be higher than
      acceptance of (TAU). This study also aims to examine whether metacognition is associated with
      insight even after controlling for the effects of psychiatric symptomatology.

    <intervention_model_description>This will be a three-armed parallel group, assessor-blind, randomized controlled trial comparing &quot;Insight Enhancement Program&quot; (IEP) and &quot;Metacognitive Training for Psychosis&quot; (MCT) with &quot;Treatment As Usual&quot; (TAU). Once the participant gives his/her consent, he/she will be randomized either to (IEP+TAU), or (MCT+TAU), or (TAU). Both interventions consist of eight session administered over 4 weeks. The total study duration will be 2 months as participants must be on a fixed dose of the antipsychotic medication for 4 weeks prior to starting the interventions. Participants will be assessed twice during the study period; the first assessment will be after 4 weeks of receiving the antipsychotic medication prior to starting the interventions, and the final assessment will be at the end of the study after finishing the interventions. A total of 120 participants will be recruited in the study and randomized across the three groups in a 1:1:1 proportion.</intervention_model_description>
    <primary_purpose>Treatment</primary_purpose>
    <masking>Single (Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Assessors will be blind to treatment allocation, and specific measures will be undertaken to preserve blinding and prevent a Rosenthal effect (e.g., assessors will not be employees of the same hospital, and before each assessment participants will be explicitly instructed not to disclose their group assignment to the assessor).
Randomization will be according to a randomization plan using stratified permuted block randomization with each block containing four participants. This method will be used to achieve balance among groups in terms of subjects' baseline characteristics. Stratified randomization is achieved by generating a separate block for each covariate such as age &amp; gender.</masking_description>

    <measure>Mean Change in Psychopathology as measured by The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale for Schizophrenia (PANSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-Intervention at Week 4, and Post-Intervention at Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale for Schizophrenia (PANSS) is a 30-item, seven-point (1-7) scale and it is the most widely used instrument for the assessment of schizophrenia symptoms in clinical trials. Ratings follow semi-structured interviews and clear standard operating procedures. Symptoms are rated according to their presence in the past 2 weeks. The PANSS was used many times before in trials of MCT &amp; insight in schizophrenia, which makes it more suitable allowing comparison of results.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change in Insight Scores as measured by The Beck Cognitive Insight Scale (BCIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-Intervention at Week 4, and Post-Intervention at Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The BCIS is a self-report consisting of 15 statements rated on a 4-point Likert scale. It is divided into 2 subscales; self-reflectiveness, and self-certainty. Self-reflectiveness consists of 9 items measuring objectivity, reflectiveness and openness to feedback. Self-certainty consists of 6 items measuring decision-making and resistance to feedback. Overall cognitive insight was defined by Beck and associates as the difference between self-reflectiveness and self- certainty and labeled composite index.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change in Metacognition Scores as measured by The Metacognition Assessment Scale - Adapted version (MAS-A)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-Intervention at Week 4, and Post-Intervention at Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The MAS-A is scored on the basis of the transcript of the Indiana Psychiatric Illness Interview (IPII). Scoring is performed by a consensus group of at least three trained raters. The four domains of metacognition are reflected in the four ordinal complexity scales of the MAS-A: self-reflectivity, understanding the other's mind, decentration, and mastery. The raters assign one point for each function on each scale that they judge is accomplished in the transcript.</description>

    <time_frame>Pre-Intervention at Week 4, and Post-Intervention at Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The PSP was used to assess subjects' social functioning. Patients' functioning is assessed in four core areas: Socially useful activities; personal and social relationships; self-care; and disturbing and aggressive behaviours. A global item is rated by the interviewer, ranging from 1 to 100 at 10-point intervals with lower scores indicating poorer functioning. The PSP shows good psychometric properties.</description>

Medications: In order to standardize treatment, Risperidone (Risperdal ) will be used as the antipsychotic medication in all three groups with a dose up to 6-8 milligrams according to clinical severity. The same dose will be used for 1 month prior to starting interventions). In case of occurrence of mild extrapyramidal symptoms associated with high doses of risperidone, an anticholinergic drug (Benztropine) might be used.</description>

    <description>IEP is comprised of 8 sessions, administered twice weekly, across a one month period. The session duration is 60-90 minutes. IEP will be administered in a group format with 8-12 patients in each group.
During sessions, different topics representing 8 different stages of illness are discussed according to a chronological schedule. These stages are presented on an Illness March Graph (IMG) and include: Stage I: Personality formation, Stage II: Pre onset confusion, Stage III: Prodroma, Stage IV: The illness, Stage V: Resistance, Stage VI: Remission, Stage VII: Maintenance, Stage VIII: Relapse. Patients actively participate through the exchange of their own experiences and interpretations, which are then reinterpreted by the therapist and by the patients themselves.</description>

    <description>The training consists of eight modules that are administered within the framework of a group intervention program that involves eight 1-hour group sessions with 4 to 10 patients in each group. MCT is manualized and currently available in thirty languages and can been downloaded via the following web address: http://www.uke.de/mct. Among the problematic thinking styles recognized as potential contributors to the development of delusions are attributional distortions (module 1), a jumping to conclusions bias (module 2 and 7), a bias against disconfirmatory evidence (module 3), deficits in theory of mind (module 4 and 6), over-confidence in memory errors (module 5) and depressive cognitive patterns (module 8).</description>
