  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nowadays, more and more women embark on pregnancy with previous Caesarean scar. One in five
      pregnancies requires induction of labour. The use of non-pharmacological methods (methods
      without using medication) has been gaining popularity for women who are not good candidates,
      such as women with previous Caesarean scar, for an induction with medications such as
      prostaglandin. Labour induction with prostaglandin carries higher risk of uterine rupture and
      thus it is not routinely offered to women with previous Caesarean delivery in cairo
      university Hospital. Non-pharmacological methods of induction of labour appear to be safe in
      women with previous Caesarean delivery. However, various methods are available and the
      efficacy among them remain in doubt.

      In cairo university Hospital, castror oil, which is a type of induction methods, is routinely
      offered to women with previous Caesarean delivery who require induction of labour. However,
      castor oil may not exert its labour induction effect immediately and the delivery may be
      delayed by up to 8 days. This may render a proportion of women to resort to repeated
      Caesarean section for failed induction.Castor oil is traditionally given by midwives in order
      to induce labor.

      The investigators intent to recruit 80 healthy pregnant women with a hsitory of previous one
      cesarean section and with no contraindication to trial of labor after cesarean . Women will
      be randomly and blindly divided into equal sized intervention group and control group.
      Intervention group will be given a single dose 60 mL of castor oil in 140 mL of orange juice,
      while control group will be given a placebo with similar texture. Primary outcomes to be
      tested are the percentage of women entering active labor within 24 hours of castor oil or
      placebo administration and the number of successful vaginal delivaries after cesarean.
