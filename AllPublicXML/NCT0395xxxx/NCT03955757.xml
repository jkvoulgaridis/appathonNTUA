  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this project is to implement the Boot Camp Translation process to develop
      a replicable approach for increasing adolescent vaccine uptake that can be adaptable and
      feasible to use in rural settings more broadly.

    <textblock>
      Boot Camp Translation (BCT) is a process to identify strategies that help communities improve
      health. It is a 6-month, facilitated, iterative community engagement process that brings
      together relevant stakeholders to develop and implement locally meaningful messages,
      materials, and strategies for health topics of interest.

      This is a novel community engagement process that has a proven ability to result in
      meaningful and impactful strategies to improve compliance with recommended health behaviors
      in rural communities. The investigators will expand this work by testing BCT on its ability
      to improve vaccination with all recommend adolescent vaccines (Tdap, MenACWY, HPV, Flu).

      The investigators will conduct a randomized, controlled trial in which 4 rural communities in
      Western Colorado will undergo BCT to develop and implement strategies to increase adolescent
      vaccination. Vaccination rates will be compared to 4 control communities that do not undergo
      BCT.
