  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The chronic cancer status, multidisciplinary and ambulatory care, as well as the cumbersome
      effects of the disease and treatments, lead patients to consider other options than those
      offered by traditional medicine, such as alternative medicine and complementary (CAM)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In order to put in place a policy on CAM based on the knowledge held by the patient and the
      health professionals, it is imperative to obtain and analyze the following information: why
      this type of medicine is used, what are its benefits, how does the patient get information
      and what are his sources, who practices them and how the patient perceives the place of the
      hospital and the various health professionals to develop and secure the use of CAM.

      Our study will focus on CAM that can bring iatrogenic risk (phytotherapy, food supplements,
      acupuncture, traditional Chinese medicine, homeopathy, essential oils), and the following
      techniques: hypnosis and sophrology.

      The study is carried out in two successive phases: the interview phase which will make it
      possible to obtain results to carry out the questionnaires phase. Patients who will be
      included in the interview phase will not participate in the questionnaire phase. Finally,
      patients who participate in the questionnaire phase will not have semi-structured interviews.
      They will only have to answer the questionnaire.

    <description>Screening and inclusion of patients hospitalized or seen in day hospital to conduct semi-structured interviews according to the interview grid. This interview schedule was established after review of the literature and identification of primary and secondary objectives.
Identification of key ideas through content analysis of the interviews conducted and based of the anchored theory.
This step is performed until the results are saturated (approximately 15 patients). The principle of saturation is based on the fact that from a threshold, the diversity of the elements collected decreases. Much more than an end signal, this principle is &quot;a methodological guarantee&quot; since it allows the possibility of comparing divergent or contradictory data and thus validating the data.</description>

    <description>From the previous results: elaboration of a written questionnaire built according to the results obtained thanks to the previous interviews. In order to apply the simple correspondence factor analysis method, this questionnaire will be constructed on a Likert scale. The objective is twofold:
to reduce the observer's bias by considering both the literature reviews but also the points of view of patients to develop the questionnaire;
reach a larger patient population (more than 100 patients) compared to the previous qualitative analysis (15 patients planned), in order to generalize the results. This methodology combines both qualitative and quantitative study to minimize bias induced by both types of study.
Dissemination of the questionnaire and filling by the patient independently. The health professional who submitted the questionnaire will remain available to answer any questions the patient may have.</description>
