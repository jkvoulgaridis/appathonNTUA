  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Food insecurity is associated with an increased risk of overweight/obesity and weight-related
      chronic illnesses. The availability of a default option (i.e., option a consumer selects if
      no active choice is made) has been shown to effectively nudge consumer behavior. An online
      default option (i.e., prefilled grocery shopping cart) was previously shown to positively
      impact food selection in an online grocery shopping task.The present study provides
      preliminary evidence for the efficacy of an online default option in enhancing the
      nutritional quality of online grocery purchases in individuals with food insecurity.

      Food insecurity is associated with an increased risk of overweight/obesity and weight-related
      chronic illnesses. The present study provides preliminary evidence for the efficacy of an
      online default option in enhancing the nutritional quality of online grocery purchases in
      individuals with food insecurity.

      In behavioral economics, the default option refers to the option a consumer selects if no
      active choice is made. This study aims to determine whether the use of a default prefilled
      online grocery shopping cart results in the purchase of healthier food items in individuals
      with food insecurity, compared to nutrition education. The default approach, a non-monetary
      intervention that manipulates choice architecture, improves food choice behaviors in
      individuals facing significant financial constraints. The intervention is potentially broadly
      scalable via online platforms.

      It was hypothesized that the default option effectively increases the nutritional quality of
      foods purchased online, compared to nutrition education.

      Fifty participants recruited from food pantries in New York in 2018 were randomized to: (1)
      review nutrition information before selecting groceries for a week using a local grocery
      store's online shopping and delivery service (n = 23) or (2) modify a default prefilled
      online shopping cart containing groceries that meet nutritional guidelines according to their
      personal preferences (n = 27).

      Primary outcome measures capture the nutritional quality of groceries purchased. Our primary
      nutritional outcomes include servings of whole grains fruits and vegetables, fiber, daily
      calories, fat, saturated fat, sodium and cholesterol content.

    <description>The Thrifty Food Plan Calculator (TFPC) was used to quantify the nutritional quality of groceries selected by study participants. The TFPC was developed using U.S. Department of Agriculture nutrition and consumption data and is designed to have users input information about the relative amount of money spent on various categories of food and provides comprehensive information on caloric, macro-, and micronutrient content of the foods selected based on participant age and gender.</description>

    <description>The &quot;default option&quot; is a behavioral economics construct that refers to the option a consumer selects if no active choice is made (e.g. opt-out 401K plans, which significantly increase enrollment, compared to active sign up). Participants in the default condition were presented with a prefilled online shopping cart containing groceries that met nutritional requirements based on participants' gender and age.</description>
