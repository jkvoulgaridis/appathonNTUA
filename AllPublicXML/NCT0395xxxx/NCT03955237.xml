      Background:Hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia both cause detrimental side effects for pediatric
      patients. Prolonged fasting time, age dependent physiological diffences and individual
      differences of patients make complicated the perioperative fluid therapy. Isotonic
      electrolyte solutions without glucose or with lower glucose concentrations recommended for
      intraoperative period in pediatric patients.

      Objective: The aim of this prospective study is to evaluate the different glucose
      concentrations(without dextrose, 1 % dextrose+LR, 2 % dextrose+LR) in perioperative infusion
      solutions according to preoperative blood glucose level to maintain normoglycemia in
      pediatric patients.

      Method: The consecutive 250 eligible pediatric patients aged between 6 months- 12 years with
      ASA risk score of I-II undergoing surgery lasting less than four hours were enrolled the
      study in six months period. Patient demographics, procedure, preoperative fasting time,
      preoperative and postoperative glucose levels were documented. Lactate ringer (LR) solution
      with % 2 glucose was infused to the patients with preoperative blood glucose level lower than
      60 mg/dL, LR solution with % 1 glucose was used for the patients with preoperative blood
      glucose level between 60-90 mg/dL, LR solution without glucose was used for the patients with
      preoperative blood glucose level higher than 90 mg/dL.
