    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to observe and examine prospectively whether excimer laser
      coronary angioplasty (ELCA) and percutaneous coronary intervention with biodegradable-polymer
      platinum chromium everolimus-eluting stent may improve the myocardial salvage in the patients
      with anterior ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) using the myocardial scintigram
      (acute-phase I123-BMIPP and chronic-phase 99mTc-tetrofosmin), and to clarify the myocardial
      protective effect of excimer laser in the patients with anterior STEMI.

    <textblock>
      The clinical result of catheter treatment in the patients with acute myocardial infarction in
      these several decades improved because of progress of early reperfusion therapy and stent
      treatment technique. However, the no-reflow phenomenon is still remaining as a problem, which
      is involved in a decrease in left ventricular function and worsening of prognosis. It is
      considered that the no-reflow phenomenon is induced by atherosclerotic and thrombotic emboli,
      endothelial dysfunction of capillary vessels, free radicals and cytokine. The treatment
      combining the peripheral protection and thrombus aspiration aiming at prevention of no-reflow
      is expected to reduce no-reflow and the infarct size and has been conducted on the patients
      with acute myocardial infarction. However, a lot of randomized studies have been conducted,
      so far, which do not lead to reduction of infarct size and improvement of survival rate, and
      the efficacy has not been demonstrated.

      Some explanations have been suggested for this phenomenon:

        1. The operation method of device is complicated, and it is difficult to acquire the
           treatment technique.

        2. Giant thrombus and solid lesion could not be aspirated effectively.

        3. A lot of randomized studies have not focused on the &quot;patients with anterior descending
           lesion of thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) grade 0/1, of which the time from
           onset to treatment is within 6 hours,&quot; considered to have the largest benefit of
           prevention of no-reflow.

      In recent years in Japan, excimer laser coronary angioplasty (ELCA) has been used in the
      patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), and not only debulking of arteriosclerotic
      lesion but also thrombolytic effect have been reported. In the Camel trial and Utility of
      Laser for Transcatheter Atherectomy Multicenter Analysis around Naniwa (ULTRAMAN) registry,
      the efficacy and safety in ACS have been reported, but the infarct size has not been
      evaluated.

      This time in this study, it is considered that verification whether or not ELCA is able to
      improve the myocardial salvage in anterior ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) using
      myocardial scintigram (acute-phase BMIPP and chronic-phase TF) will provide the useful
      information helpful for selection of treatment to medical care staffs and patients for future
      patients suffering from ACS and will be able to contribute to further improvement of medical
      science and medical practice.

      MRI will be performed twice at 5-9 days and at 6 months post index ST elevation myocardial
      infarction to assess myocardial damage and functional variables, which details will be
      described in the following outcome measurement section.

    <description>On the antegrade delivery of the laser catheter after wiring, we used safe laser techniques and injected saline before and during the laser procedure at a 0.5 mm/sec catheter advancement rate. Whether to perform a retrograde laser method depended on each operator. After ablation by ELCA, patients undergo balloon dilation via standard techniques, and as appropriate, receive drug-eluting stent deployment.</description>

    <description>The excimer laser catheter is equipped with multiple optical fibers on the periphery of the guide wire lumen corresponding to 0.014 inch, which is used for the purpose of reperfusion of barrier site of coronary artery. The connector on the front side is connected with the CVX-300 laser generator, and the tip at the top contact directly with the lesion. The laser catheter consisting of multiple optical fibers transmits the energy in the ultraviolet region from the CVX300 laser generator to the blockage in the blood vessel. The ultraviolet energy is transmitted from the tip of laser catheter, transpires the fibrous, calcified and arteriosclerotic lesion by light, and enables reperfusion in the lesion. The laser catheter has appropriate hydrophilic coating and easily follows the inside of coronary artery.</description>
