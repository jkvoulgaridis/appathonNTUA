      The purpose of this study is to characterize the immune response in vivo using approved
      vaccines and antigen challenges, as well as a skin wounding challenge to stimulate the immune
      system.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 30 kilogram per square meter (kg/m^2) (BMI
             = weight/height^2), inclusive, and a body weight of no less than 50 kilogram (kg)

          -  Healthy on the basis of physical examination, medical history, vital signs, and
             12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) (for Cohort 3) performed at screening. Any
             abnormalities, must be considered not clinically significant and this determination
             must be recorded in the participant's source documents and initialed by the
             investigator

          -  Healthy on the basis of clinical laboratory tests performed at screening. If the
             results of the serum chemistry panel, blood coagulation, hematology, or urinalysis are
             outside the normal reference ranges, the participant may be included only if the
             investigator judges the abnormalities or deviations from normal to be not clinically
             significant. This determination must be recorded in the participant's source documents
             and initialed by the investigator

          -  Must sign an informed consent form (ICF) indicating that he or she understands the
             purpose of, and procedures required for, the study and is willing to participate in
             the study

          -  All women must have a negative highly sensitive serum (Beta-human chorionic
             gonadotropin [Beta-hCG]) pregnancy test at screening and a negative urine pregnancy
             test predose on Day 1

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of any type of immunodeficiency or autoimmune disease or disease treatment
             associated with immune suppression or lymphopenia. These include but are not limited
             to bone marrow or organ transplantation, lymphoproliferative disorders, T- or B-cell
             deficiency syndromes, splenectomy, functional asplenia and chronic granulomatous
             disease

          -  History of liver or renal insufficiency, significant cardiac, vascular, pulmonary,
             gastrointestinal, endocrine, neurologic, hematologic, bleeding disorders,
             rheumatologic, psychiatric, or metabolic disturbances, and atopic dermatitis

          -  Known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to any of the interventions in this
             study or their excipients

          -  History of severe allergic reaction, angioedema, or anaphylaxis to drugs or food

          -  Contraindications to the use of any of the study interventions per prescribing
