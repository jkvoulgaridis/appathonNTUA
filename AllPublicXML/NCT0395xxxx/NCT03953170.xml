      The objective of the study is to investigate the natural history of patients with a temporary
      ileostomy and to assess the effect of Teduglutide in reducing morbidity, hospital
      readmissions and post reversal complications.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, controlled, randomized, double blind study. A total of 36 subjects
      will be enrolled into the study. Subjects will be randomized to receive Teduglutide or
      Placebo for 12 weeks or until the ileostomy is reversed. Teduglutide or placebo will be
      administered via a daily subcutaneous injection into the abdomen or thigh. The sites will be
      rotated with each injection. If adverse effects develop the subjects will be permitted to
      hold drug administration for a maximum of 5 days in total during the 12-week study.

    <description>Teduglutide (Gattex, Shire) was approved by the FDA in 2012 for use in adult patients with short bowel syndrome requiring parenteral support only.
The results of this study will not be used to justify a change of indication, or dose currently approved for Teduglutide, and will not be used to advertise the drug. This study meets all of the requirements for exemption from the IND regulations and an IND exemption has been confirmed by the FDA.</description>
