  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to determine if DMD patients / families and healthcare
      providers experience burdens related to access, and if so, to identify them, and to determine
      life impacts to the patient, if any, of these burdens. Data from healthcare providers will be
      collected by an online survey and from patients/families by one on one telephone interview.

      Patient/Parent Portion

      In this non-interventional study, DMD patients / parents of DMD patients will be interviewed
      to gather qualitative input, in the patient's voice, regarding challenges associated with
      access to medications, services and medical equipment, and how these burdens impact quality
      of life.

      Healthcare Provider Portion

      In this non-interventional study, healthcare providers who see patients with DMD and who deal
      with insurance issues on behalf of DMD patients will participate in an online survey designed
      to determine the burden associated with access to medications, services and medical
      equipment.
