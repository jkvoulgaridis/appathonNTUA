    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the multiple myeloma (MM) population concerning
      demographics and clinical characteristics (for example. frailty, risk strata, manifestations
      of target organ damage [TOD]) in 6 countries (that is Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Chile,
      Colombia and Panama); and to profile the treatment landscape of Latin American MM
      participants, including factors associated with health-care provider (HCP) selections of
      different treatment regimens. These factors can include a participant's demographic and
      clinical characteristics and availability of different therapy options per institution in
      each country.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>General Health Status Based on Frailty Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately up to 2.7 years</time_frame>
    <description>General health status based on Frailty Score will be reported. International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) frailty score: Participants frailty status will be assessed on the basis of 4 components: age (less than [&lt;75], 76- 80, and greater than [&gt;]80 years correspond to frailty scores of 0, 1, and 2, respectively), the charlson comorbidity scoring system without age weighting (scores of less than or equal to [&lt;=]1 and greater than or equal to [&gt;=]2 correspond to frailty scores of 0 and 1, respectively), independence in activities of daily living (scores of &gt;4 and &lt;=4 correspond to frailty scores of 0 and 1, respectively) and instrumental activities of daily living scale (scores of &gt;5 and &lt;=5 correspond to frailty scores of 0 and 1, respectively). The sum of the 4 frailty scores equals the total frailty score. The total frailty score ranges from 0 to 5, with a total of three categories: 0 (fit), 1 (intermediate-fitness) and greater than or equal to (&gt;=)2 (frail).</description>

    <measure>Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status Score</measure>

    <description>ECOG performance status is a standard criterion for measuring how the disease impacts daily living abilities. It describes the level of functioning in terms of the ability to care for oneself, daily activity, and physical ability (walking, working, etc). ECOG performance status score ranges from Grade 0 to 5: 0= Fully active and performances without restriction, 1= Restricted in physically strenuous activity, 2= Ambulatory and capable of all self-care but unable to carry out any work activities, 3= Capable of only limited self-care and confined to bed or chair more than 50% of waking hours, 4= Completely disabled, and 5= Dead.</description>

    <description>Number of participants in each stage of MM disease will reported. The stage of MM disease will be determined by International Staging System (ISS). ISS categorizes MM participants into three groups (Stage I, II, or III). Stage I: beta2-microglobulin less than (&lt;)3.5 milligram per liter (mg/L) and albumin greater than or equal to (&gt;=)3.5 gram (g)/100 milliliter (mL); stage II: neither stage I nor stage III; and stage III: beta2-microglobulin &gt;=5.5 mg/L.</description>
