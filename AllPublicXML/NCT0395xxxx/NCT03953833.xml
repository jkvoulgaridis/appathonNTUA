    <intervention_model_description>The study is divided into the dose escalation group and the dose expansion group. Dose escalation stage: treatment cycle is administered every 21days,the infusion is taken at the first day of each treatment cycle.Observation period of DLT is from day 1 to day 21 of the first treatment cycle.
Dose expansion stage: treatment cycle is administered every 21days and could be administered continuously until the disease progresses or is intolerable.DLT is not accessed during this stage.
