               2. evaluated as a resectable lesion. Note: Whether there is a distant metastasis
                  should be confirmed by CT or MR scan. If bone metastasis is suspected, a bone
                  scan should be performed. If there is suspected peritoneal metastasis, a
                  laparoscopy should be performed. If brain metastasis is suspected, CT or MR
