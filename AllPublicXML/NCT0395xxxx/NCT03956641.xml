  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adaptated Physical Activity (APA) during treatment of cancer is one of the actual global
      health recommendation because of the benefits observed in several parameters evaluated in
      many clinical studies. A best knowledge of the physical and medical characteristics of
      patients, including type of cancer and type of treatment, is primordial to optimize the
      patient care and the effectiveness of APA programs.

      Descriptive, explorative and prospective study of 3 different populations:

      One population with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer treated with
      multiple therapeutic lines. Two different populations of early cancer patients and treated
      with a platinum-based regimen for colon cancer and a taxane-based chemotherapy for breast
      cancer.
