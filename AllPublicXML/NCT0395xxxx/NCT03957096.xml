  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial will study SGN-CD47M to find out whether it is an effective treatment for
      different types of solid tumors and what side effects (unwanted effects) may occur. The study
      will have two parts. Part A of the study will find out how much SGN-CD47M should be given for
      treatment and how often. Part B of the study will use the dose found in Part A and look at
      how safe and effective the treatment is.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a dose-escalation study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics (PK), and antitumor activity of SGN-CD47M in adults with advanced solid
      tumors. The study will be conducted in 2 parts:

      Part A - Dose escalation: Up to approximately 25 patients will be treated to evaluate the
      safety, tolerability, and PK of SGN-CD47M, and to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
      and/or optimal dose.

      Part B - Dose expansion: Up to approximately 180 patients will be treated in expansion
      cohorts at the MTD or optimal dose to further characterize the safety, PK, and antitumor
      activity of SGN-CD47M.

      In eligible patients, standard therapies must have failed, been intolerable, or been
      considered medically inappropriate by the investigator. If the MTD is not reached in Part A,
      safety, PK, pharmacodynamic, and biomarker analyses, as well as preliminary antitumor
      activity, will be used to determine the optimal dose. Patients in Part A may continue on
      treatment until confirmed progressive disease (PD) or unacceptable toxicity, whichever occurs
      first. The dose(s) to be examined in Part B will be at or below the MTD and/or the optimal
      dose determined in Part A.
