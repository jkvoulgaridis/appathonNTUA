  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine a form of non-invasive brain stimulation applied with intensive
      therapy of the arm and hand. The goal of the study is to determine if arm and hand function
      can be improved in people with incomplete cervical spinal cord injury (neck spinal cord
      injury, tetraplegia). Participants will be assigned to receive either active or inactive
      non-invasive brain stimulation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will look at the effects of a painless, non-invasive form of brain stimulation,
      called transcranial direct current stimulation, or tDCS. tDCS is thought to increase the
      brain's ability to change. Participants will be assigned to one of two groups by chance. One
      group will receive tDCS at a level expected to increase the brain's ability to change, while
      the other group will receive tDCS at a level not thought to affect the brain's ability to
      change. All participants will receive intensive therapy of their more impaired arm and hand,
      focusing on exercises that are meaningful to him/her.

    <measure>Change in Medical Research Council Scale Upper Extremity Manual Muscle Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at immediately post-intervention, 1-month follow-up, 4-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>This evaluates the strength of various muscles in the upper extremity. Each muscle that is tested can be scored from a minimum of 0, indicating no strength, up to a maximum of 5, indicating normal strength. Scores are assigned to each side by summing the scores from each of the 41 individual muscles, with a minimum possible total score of 0 and a maximum possible total score of 205. Higher values indicate greater strength.</description>
