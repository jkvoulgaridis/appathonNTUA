  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Opioids (morphine and morphine-like substances) are often prescribed to patients to manage
      pain after an emergency department visit. In the past 20 years, opioid prescriptions have
      risen sharply, accompanied by a significant rise in opioid misuse (e.g., recreational or
      non-medical use, potentially leading to addiction or overdose). One explanation for this
      crisis is the availability and easy access of leftover opioid pills in Canadian homes,
      allowing family members (including children) and friends to take them for reasons other than
      pain relief.

      Canada has no recommendations for the dosage, duration, or quantity of opioids that
      physicians should prescribe to manage acute pain at home. Physicians are therefore left
      guessing as to how much to prescribe when a patient with a condition like a fracture or renal
      colic is discharged from the emergency department. Our preliminary study showed that
      two-thirds of the pills from the initial opioid prescription to treat acute pain actually
      remained unused and were therefore available for potential misuse.

      The investigators propose to determine how many opioid pills are consumed by patients who
      suffer from acute pain as they recover at home. The investigators will ask 2,580 patients
      (from 6 Canadian hospitals) to record their pain medication consumption in a 14-day diary.
      The investigators will also determine, their pain intensity level, whether or not they had
      new opioid prescriptions, and health services revisits. In case of missing information,
      patients will be contacted by phone at 2 weeks. The overall aim is to help emergency
      department physicians prescribe the right number of pills in order to manage patients' pain
      and at the same time reduce substantially leftovers available for potential misuse.

      Introduction

      Prescription opioid overdoses have quadrupled in the last 15 years, and are now the leading
      cause of accidental death, surpassing motor vehicle accidents. The drastic rise in opioid
      prescription rates in Canada and the US could be the driving force behind this higher
      mortality. It was shown that 71% of opioid misusers (i.e., intentional users for nonmedical
      purposes) received their drugs through the diversion of unused prescribed opioids (transfer
      of opioids to someone other than the holder of the initial prescription). Emergency
      department (ED) physicians are among the top opioid prescribers for patients under 40, and
      there are currently no prospective studies on how many opioid pills should be prescribed to
      patients discharged from the ED with common pain conditions in order to limit unused pills.
      Preliminary results from our group revealed that two-thirds of the total prescribed opioids
      were not consumed and remained available for misuse.

      Objectives

      The ultimate goal of this research program is to decrease opioid misuse by lowering the
      quantity of unused medications. The primary objective of this project is to determine the
      quantity of opioids consumed during the acute pain phase (2 weeks) by ED-discharged patients
      treated for an acute pain condition. The secondary objectives are to inventory the quantity
      of opioids prescribed and unused after ED visits, use of co-analgesics, pain intensity,
      health services revisits during the 2-week follow-up, and chronic pain prevalence at 3
      months.

      Methods

      The investigators propose a multicentre prospective observational cohort study in 2,580
      consecutive ED patients recruited from 6 Canadian hospitals. The study will include patients
      aged ≥18 years, treated for an acute pain condition present for less than 2 weeks (usual
      acute pain definition), and discharged from the ED with an opioid prescription. Pain at
      triage and at ED discharged, diagnosis, and complete pain medication prescription will be
      initially listed. Patients will complete a 14-day electronic diary using the REDCap web-based
      system to document their daily pain medication consumption, pain intensity, new opioid
      prescriptions, and health services revisits. Patients will also answer questionnaires at 2
      weeks and 3 months for our various secondary objectives. To validate the patient self-report
      opioid consumption, a randomized subset of patients will come back to the emergency for a
      follow-up visit and a manual count of the remaining opioids. As mitigation strategies
      (validated in our pilot study), non-responders to the diary will be contacted by phone at 2
      weeks to answered questions summing diary information, and paper versions will be available
      for patients without Internet access.

      Feasibility

      The investigators demonstrated the study feasibility in a successful pilot study with 627
      patients at our academic ED. Additionally, our project brings together a committed,
      multidisciplinary research team, and all proposed study sites have collaborated previously on
      large multicentre studies. Finally, all instruments have been successfully tested, allowing
      rapid study implementation.

      Impact

      Our results will determine the quantity of opioids consumed during the acute pain phase (2
      weeks) to ED-discharged patients treated for acute pain conditions. Our team members from
      relevant provincial and national stakeholders and patient associations, our strong evidence,
      and our extensive knowledge transfer strategy have the potential to impact physicians' opioid
      prescription practices. Consequently, fewer unused prescription opioids should lead to a
      substantial decrease in the currently high rate of opioid misuse.
