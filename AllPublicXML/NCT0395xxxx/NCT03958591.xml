  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite advances in diabetes management, many T2DM patients in China fail to achieve optimal
      glycemic control. One of the possible reasons is associated with the delay in therapeutic
      decision making that lags behind glycemic rise. We design this study and presume that using
      vildagliptin and metformin in combination with basal insulin as sequential treatment after
      intensive insulin therapy, might better modulate the dual islet hormone dysfunction than
      traditionally stepwise upgrading therapy pattern in patients with poorly controlled T2DM, and
      thus lead to a glucose normalization, β-cell function improvement and therapy simplification.
