  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polypharmacy, the use of multiple or inappropriate medications, has the potential to harm
      older adults by causing cognitive impairment, falls, and hospitalisations. The nurse-led
      intervention (The ADRe Profile) to review mental health medicines has demonstrated improved
      care quality by: identifying serious adverse drug reactions (ADRs); reducing prescription of
      mental health medicines; reducing the prevalence of pain and nausea; and, increasing
      non-urgent NHS contacts. The investigators will develop ADRe to encompass medicines commonly
      prescribed in primary care and evaluate intervention implementation in care homes in Aneurin
      Bevan University Health Board.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will introduce medicines' monitoring using the PADRe Profile into up to 7
      care homes, each with up to 26 residents prescribed &gt;4 medicines (estimated ~90% residents).

      Each home will identify a nurse lead and a deputy. Nurses will be asked to administer the
      PADRe Profile with all patients prescribed &gt;4 medicines.

      Barriers, facilitators, and feasibility of the Profile will be explored. This will identify
      how, in which contexts medicines' monitoring can be integrated into routine care, relate the
      Profile to improved processes and outcomes of care, and inform implementation strategies (see
      logic model in cited papers).

      Data collection:

        -  Record review before and after each of 3 administrations of the intervention to identify
           clinical and prescription changes. Narrative accounts of problems causing moderate or
           severe harm will be prepared.

        -  Serial interviews and debriefs with nurses: three per nurse.

        -  Stakeholder interviews with patients, participating pharmacists and prescribers for an
           overview of implementation.

    <description>PADRe asks nurses to systematically check patients for the manifestation of itemised adverse side effects or undesirable effects of their primary care medicines, as listed in the BNF and manufacturers' Summaries of Product Characteristics (SmPCs), and seminal texts documenting known ADRs. Nurses are asked to share the identified problems with prescribers and pharmacists overseeing medicines charts. A full description is published (references below).</description>
