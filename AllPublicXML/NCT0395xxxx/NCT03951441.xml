    <measure>Selective Control Assessment of the Lower Extremity</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>SCALE examines SVMC in children with spastic CP. The SCALE tool assesses hip, knee, ankle, subtalar, and toe joints bilaterally.The SCALE tool assigns each joint a score from 0 to 2 points: 2 points, normal; 1 point, impaired; and 0 points, unable. The SCALE score is the sum of scoresfor each joint and assumes a 10 point maximum per limb.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The GMFCS describes gross motor function in children with CP. It focuses on self-initiated movements, in particular sitting and walking. It is an age-related five-level system in which level I represents the least limitation and level V the most.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Gross Motor Function Measurement (GMFM)</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Gross Motor Function Measurement evaluates motor functions in children with Cerebral Palsy. There is 88 items under 5 subdimensions (lying and rolling, sitting, crawling and kneeling, standing, walking-running-jumping. GMFM has a 4-point scoring system for each item. The higher the child gets, the more successful the child is in gross motor functions.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Tone of lower extremity muscles will be assessed with Modified Ashworth Scale. The spasticity of each muscle ranged between 0 to 5. 0 means no increase in muscle tonus while 5 means that the joint is rigid due to the increase in excess tonus.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Physicians' Rating Scale (PRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Physicians' Rating Scale is an observational tool that has been used to evaluate gait. PRS is assesses gait in the sagittal plane.</description>
