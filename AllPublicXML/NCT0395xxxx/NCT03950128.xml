  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of a mindfulness-based skills training
      (MBST) to a psychoeducational intervention at reducing dating violence in a sample of college
      students. The MBST focuses on improving college students' abilities to manage emotionally
      charged states during conflict with their romantic partners by teaching them
      mindfulness-based skills. The psychoeducational intervention uses the Love is Not Abuse
      curriculum. Treatment groups are randomly assigned and are compared using a two-armed
      parallel design.

      88 college students currently in a dating relationship were recruited through Kent State
      University's subject pool. All participants completed a baseline assessment online where
      self-reported data was collected on demographics, dating violence (during the past month),
      emotion regulation, mindfulness skills, and other potential covariates. Participants were
      then randomized into either the MBST intervention or the psychoeducational intervention. All
      participants completed three 50-minute sessions over the course of three weeks with assigned
      homework between sessions. Daily diary data was collected, assessing knowledge and use of
      skills learned in the sessions. Follow-up data was collected online 11 weeks following
      baseline (dating violence (during the last month), emotion regulation, mindfulness skills).

      It was hypothesized that the MBST intervention would be more effective at reducing dating
      violence as compared to the psychoeducational intervention.

    <time_frame>Baseline (4th week of semester) and Follow-up (11 weeks after baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>A 35-item self-report measure of physical, verbal, and sexual dating violence.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Kentucky Inventory of Mindfulness Skills (KIMS; Baer, Smith, &amp; Allen, 2004)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (4th week of semester) and Follow-up (11 weeks after baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>This self-report measure has a total of 39 items with four subscales that assess: observing (e.g., I notice when my moods begin to change), describing (e.g., I'm good at finding the words to describe my feelings), accepting without judgment (e.g., I criticize myself for having irrational or inappropriate emotions [reverse scored]), and acting with awareness (e.g., When I'm doing something, I'm only focused on what I'm doing, nothing else).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS; Gratz &amp; Roemer, 2004)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (4th week of semester) and Follow-up (11 weeks after baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>This self-report measure asks participants to indicate how often a series of items applies to them (36 items total), rated on a 5-point scale (1 = almost never, 2 = sometimes, 3 = about half of the time, 4 = most of the time, 5 = almost always). The six subscales are: lack of emotional awareness (e.g., &quot;When I'm upset, I take time to figure out what I'm really feeling&quot; [reverse scored]), lack of emotional clarity (e.g., &quot;I have difficulty making sense out of my feelings&quot;), nonacceptance of emotional responses (e.g., &quot;When I'm upset, I become angry with myself for feeling that way&quot;), impulse control difficulties (e.g., &quot;When I'm upset, I lose control over my behaviors&quot;), limited access to emotion regulation strategies (e.g., &quot;When I'm upset, believe that wallowing in it is all I can do&quot;), and difficulties engaging in goal-directed behavior (e.g., &quot;When I'm upset, I have difficulty thinking about anything else&quot;).</description>

    <measure>3. Intimate Partner Violence Attitudes Scale-Revised (IPVAS-R; Fincham, Cui, Braithwaite, &amp; Pasley, 2008)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (4th week of semester) and Follow-up (11 weeks after baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>This self-report measure asks participants to indicate how strongly they agree or disagree with a series of 17 statements on a five-point Likert scale (1 = Strongly disagree, 5 = Strongly agree). There are three subscales: abuse (e.g., &quot;During a heated argument, it is okay for me to bring up something from my partner's past to hurt him or her&quot;), control (e.g., &quot;It is okay for me to tell my partner not to talk to someone of the opposite sex&quot;), and violence (e.g., &quot;It would never be appropriate to hit or try to hit one's partner with an object&quot; [reverse scored]).</description>

    <description>This intervention teaches students mindfulness-based skills to help manage their emotions when resolving conflict with their partners. The skills followed the &quot;ABCDE&quot; acronym. ABCDE stands for awareness, breathing, checking in with your feelings and thoughts, describing your experience, and expressing what you want to change. Students learned about the skills and had opportunities to practice them as well.</description>
