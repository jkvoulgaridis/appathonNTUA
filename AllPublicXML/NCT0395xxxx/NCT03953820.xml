      Randomized, multiple centers, single-dose, open-label, two-period, two-treatment,
      two-sequence crossover study under fed conditions. Each subject will receive both DBF and DRG
      administered according to weight category. DBF will be administered according to the
      currently recommended dose regimen (derived by Aquestive from population PK modeling in
      healthy volunteers). DRG will be administered depending on weight category according to the
      current product labeling for Diastat®.
