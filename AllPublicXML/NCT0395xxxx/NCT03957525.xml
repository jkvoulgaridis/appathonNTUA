  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Does the introduction of a preparatory virtual reality (VR) program that is used in the home
      environment, have an effect on the anxiety level of children immediately before surgery,
      prior to administration of preoperative sedatives?

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 60% of children who require elective surgery report significant anxiety in the
      preoperative setting. Severe perioperative anxiety of a child poses a major challenge for the
      surgeon, since it is often accompanied by adverse behavioral and emotional reactions and
      associated with a complicated operative and postoperative course.

      The investigators have made the personal experience that informing the children ahead of time
      about what to expect in the hospital, decreases child anxiety and increases parent
      satisfaction.

      There is considerable debate on the best way how to inform children about what to expect
      during their hospital stay. The investigators had a virtual reality application developed
      that introduces the children to several aspects of the hospital environment. Therefore, these
      children now ahead of time what they will experience during their hospital stay.

      The aim is to evaluate the effect of this preparatory virtual reality application on the
      anxiety level of children immediately before surgery.

    <description>Perioperative anxiety level of children as measured by the Visual Analog Scale for Anxiety (VAS-A), immediately before surgery, prior to administration of preoperative sedatives (T2).
The VAS-A scale consists of a 10 cm long, horizontal line, supplemented by two labels: &quot;no anxiety or fear&quot; at the left end, &quot;worst possible anxiety or fear&quot; at the right end of the scale.</description>

    <description>The investigators want to evaluate to which extent the VR program is able to improve the patient and parent's level of preparedness for surgery. Unfortunately, there are currently no validated outcome measures available covering these issues. Therefore, we developed a questionnaire assessing the level of preparedness related to seven aspects of the hospital stay, which are particularly illustrated by the VR program.</description>
