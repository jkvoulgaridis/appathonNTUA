  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current project will examine effectiveness of an intervention based on the concept of the
      social regulation of emotion. The intervention is designed to improve well-being in
      individuals with MS by leveraging participants' existing social support. Effectiveness will
      be tested on a sample of 42 individuals with MS, half of whom will receive the intervention
      and half of which will receive an inactive control. Investigators will document changes
      resulting from treatment on self-reported levels of stress, depression, and quality of life.
      Intervention evaluation will expand scientific knowledge of emotion regulation disruption in
      MS, and potentially identify a novel and highly efficient means of treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a progressive and debilitating neurological disease which not only
      affects a patient's physical health, but also adversely affects their mental health.
      Depressed mood is common in MS, and poor mental health in individuals with MS has
      wide-ranging consequences on social relationships and community integration. The
      preponderance of negative emotions and sparsity of positive emotions in MS are attributable
      in part to ineffective emotion regulation strategies. Thus, the clinical trial seeks to
      evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention which instructs individuals on using the social
      regulation of emotion.

      The social regulation of emotion occurs when a one's emotional state benefits from an
      interaction with another person, such as when seeking comfort from a trusted friend. The
      current intervention was designed to leverage existing social relationships for emotional
      support in a manner which should strengthen the perception of social support and also
      reinforce existing relationships. The primary goal of this trial is to examine changes in
      mental well-being after treatment.

    <description>Participants in the experimental group will receive training in utilizing social regulation of emotion strategies in an individualized format. They will meet with an interventionist for 5 weeks (1 in-person session and 4 telephone sessions) for 1-1.5 hours each week, and keep a journal documenting their emotion challenges and regulation strategy use.</description>

    <description>Participants in the control group will not receive training in utilizing social regulation of emotion strategies. While they will still meet with the interventionist on the same schedule and for approximately the same length of time, they will simply be asked to report the emotion regulation strategies that they naturally employ. They will also keep a journal documenting their emotion challenges and regulation strategy use.</description>
