  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exercise has been shown to improve health in patients with schizophrenia. However, it remains
      unclear which modality of exercise reports better benefits.

      Aim: To compare the effects of different modalities of exercise training on psychological and
      physiological variables in schizophrenia.

      Exercise has been shown to improve psychological, physiological, and biological correlates in
      patients with schizophrenia. However, it remains unclear which modality of exercise reports
      better health benefits.

      Aim: To compare the effects of three different modalities of exercise (aerobic, strength,
      aerobic-strength) on psychological and physiological variables in patients with
      schizophrenia.
