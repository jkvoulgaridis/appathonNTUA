  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and descriptive efficacy of BIIB017 in
      pediatric participants with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and to assess the
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of BIIB017 in pediatric participants with RRMS in Part 1. In Part 2,
      the study will evaluate the long-term safety of BIIB017 and further describe safety and the
      long-term multiple sclerosis (MS) outcomes after BIIB017 treatment in participants who
      completed the study treatment at Week 96 in Part 1 of the study.

    <measure>Part 1: Annualized Relapse Rate (ARR) at Week 96</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 96</time_frame>
    <description>A multiple sclerosis (MS) relapse is defined as the onset of new or recurrent neurologic symptoms not associated with fever or infection, lasting at least 24 hours, and accompanied by new objective neurological findings. ARR is calculated as the total number of relapses in each treatment group adjusted for the duration of study treatment in person-years.</description>

    <time_frame>From Week 96 to Week 196</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, is a life-threatening event, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in a significant disability/incapacity or congenital anomaly, or is a medically important event.</description>

    <measure>Part 1: Change from Baseline in Cognition at Weeks 24, 48, 72 and 96 as Measured by the Symbol Digit Modality Test (SDMT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 24, 48, 72 and 96</time_frame>
    <description>The SDMT measures the time to pair abstract symbols with specific numbers. The test requires elements of attention, visuoperceptual processing, working memory, and psychomotor speed. The score is the number of correctly coded items from 0 (worst) to 110 (best) in 90 seconds. The total score provides a measure of the speed and accuracy of symbol-digit substitution. Higher scores indicate better performance.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 48 and 96</time_frame>

    <measure>Part 1: Change from Baseline in the Quality of Life as Measured by the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) at Weeks 24, 48, 72, 96 and 100</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 24, 48, 72, 96 and 100</time_frame>
    <description>The PedsQL consists of 23 items in four generic score scales: physical functioning, emotional functioning, social functioning, and school functioning that measures health related quality of life. The questionnaire asks how much of a problem each item has been during the past month. Each item is answered on a scale of 0 (never) to 4 (almost always) then the scores are transformed to a 0 to 100 scale, so that higher scores indicate better heath related quality of life.</description>

An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

        Part 1:

          -  Must have a diagnosis of RRMS as defined by the revised consensus definition for
             pediatric MS.

          -  Must have an EDSS score between 0.0 and 5.5.

          -  Must have experienced &gt;= 1 relapse in the 12 months prior to randomization (Day 1) or
             &gt;= 2 relapses in the 24 months prior to randomization (Day 1) or have evidence of
             asymptomatic disease activity (Gd-enhancing lesions) on brain MRI in the 6 months
             prior to randomization (Day 1).

        Part 2:

        • Participants who completed the study treatment in Part 1 (Week 96 Visit), as per
        protocol.

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

        Part 1:

          -  Primary progressive, secondary progressive, or progressive relapsing. These conditions
             require the presence of continuous clinical disease worsening over a period of at
             least 3 months. Participants with these conditions may also have superimposed relapses
             but are distinguished from relapsing participants by the lack of clinically stable
             periods or clinical improvement.

          -  History of severe allergic or anaphylactic reactions or known drug hypersensitivity.

          -  Known allergy to any component of Avonex or BIIB017 formulation.

          -  Occurrence of an MS relapse that has occurred within 30 days prior to randomization
             (Day 1) and/or the participant has not stabilized from a previous relapse prior to
             randomization (Day 1).

          -  Any previous treatment with PEGylated human IFN β-1a.

        Part 2:
