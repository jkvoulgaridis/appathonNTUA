  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Open-label study to investigate the effects of Orkambi in CF patients homozygous for the
      F508del mutation by functional respiratory imaging. Primary endpoints in this study are the
      changes in Specific airway volumes (siVaw) and Specific Airway resistance (siRaw). A total of
      20 ORKAMBI-naive patients with Cystic Fibrosis, homozygous for the F508del mutation will be
      included in this open label study and will be followed through 3 months of treatment. The
      treatment will be started after all assessments are performed at visit 1. After the start of
      the treatment some baseline measurements will be repeated throughout the 3-month treatment
      period. The patient will be asked to visit the hospital monthly. All study visits should be
      scheduled around the same time.
