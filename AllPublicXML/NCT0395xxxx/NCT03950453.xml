  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the mediator/moderator variables of family composition, food
      insecurity, adversity and emotion regulation for effects on parent stress, parenting, health
      behaviors and child obesity risk.

      This is a 5-year interdisciplinary project to assess a 12-week Parenting Mindfully for Health
      (PMH) + nutrition and physical activity counseling (N) versus contact control intervention
      (C) + nutrition and physical activity counseling (N), to examine short-term and long term
      enduring effects of PMH+N to promote healthy eating and physical activity in parent and
      child, and prevent childhood obesity risk in 2-5 year olds, via changes in parent stress and
      parenting.
