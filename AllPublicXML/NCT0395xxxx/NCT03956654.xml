      The RibOB study is a prospective, open lable, single arm trial which will evaluate the
      clinical efficacy, overall safety and tolerability of ribociclib in combination with
      letrozole in older women (≥70 years) with HR+/HER2- aBC and no prior hormonal treatment for
      advanced disease (as per approved indication).

      The RibOB study is an observational prospective, open lable single arm phase IV trial which
      will evaluate the clinical efficacy, overall safety and tolerability of ribociclib in
      combination with letrozole in older women (≥70 years) with HR+, HER2- advanced breast cancer
      and no prior hormonal treatment for advanced disease as per the indication approved by the
      European Medicines Authority (EMA) and as made available by Belgian national authorities in
      the national health care system. A total of maximum 150 patients will be enrolled for
      treatment with Letrozole (2.5 mg once daily) + ribociclib 600 mg (day 1 to 21 in a 28 day
      cycle), which will continue until disease progression, intolerable toxicity or
      patient/physician decision to withdraw. During the study, patients will be continuously
      evaluated for disease progression as per national standard of care (approximately every 12
      weeks radiologically); for safety; and for quality of life and geriatric assessment
      components including functional status with QoL assessment and CGA at 3 months (+/- 2 weeks)
      and at 1 year (+/-2 weeks).

      Blood samples will be collected at T0 (i.e. at the time of inclusion of the patient), at T1
      (i.e. at day 15 of the first treatment cycle) and at T2 (after 3 months) and in addition to
      routine laboratory exams, blood drawn will be processed and frozen for future translational
      research exploring biological aging markers (as predictive markers of functional decline and
      survival) and biomarkers of response prediction. The central biobanking laboratory in Leuven
      will provide complete blood sampling sets per patient, containing 3 subsets (one for each
      time point) with all blood tubes, pre-printed labels and serum/plasma aliquot vials required
      at that time point, as well as disposable Pasteur pipettes for serum/plasma transfer.

          -  Advanced breast cancer (defined as locoregionally recurrent or metastatic not amenable
             to curative therapy).

          -  Histologically and/or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of estrogen-receptor positive
             and/or progesterone receptor positive breast cancer by local laboratory (defined as ER

             status of 0, 1+ or 2+. If IHC is 2+, a negative in situ hybridization (FISH, CISH, or
             SISH) test as determined by local laboratory testing according to ASCO-CAP guidelines
             is necessary.

          -  Patient has adequate bone marrow and organ function as defined by the following
             laboratory values (as assessed by local laboratory), preferably tested a maximum of 14
             days before enrolment:

          -  Patient has signed informed consent obtained before any trial-related activities and
             according to local guidelines.

          -  Subjects must be able to communicate with the investigator and comply with the
             requirements of the study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has a known hypersensitivity to any of the excipients of ribociclib or
             letrozole.

             modifying agents).

          -  Patient with central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or documented meningeal
             carcinomatosis unless they meet ALL the following criteria:

          -  At least 4 weeks from prior therapy for CNS disease completion (including radiation
             and/or surgery) to starting the study treatment;

          -  Clinically stable CNS lesions at the time of study treatment initiation and not
             receiving steroids and/or enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic medications for the

             brain disease status is not necessary).

          -  Patient has any other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition that
             would, in the investigator's judgment, cause unacceptable safety risks, contraindicate
             patient participation in the clinical study or compromise compliance with the
             protocol: (e.g. chronic pancreatitis, chronic active hepatitis, active untreated or
             uncontrolled fungal, bacterial or viral infections, etc.).

          -  Patients who already have or who are at significant risk of developing QTc
             prolongation are not eligible for the study. This includes patients:

          -  with long QT syndrome;

          -  with uncontrolled or significant cardiac disease, including recent myocardial
             infarction, congestive heart failure, unstable angina and bradyarrhythmias;

          -  with electrolyte abnormalities (potassium, magnesium, sodium and calcium) that are NCI
             CTCAE 4.03 grade 2 or higher (for details, see table 10 ). Note: phosphate testing is
             not mandatory, but should the investigator consider measuring it before enrolment, the
             same rules may be applied
