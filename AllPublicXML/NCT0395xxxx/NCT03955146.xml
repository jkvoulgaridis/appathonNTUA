  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3 trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 30 mg/kg intravenous (IV)
      infusions of pamrevlumab administered every 3 weeks as compared to placebo in subjects with
      Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center trial to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of pamrevlumab in subjects with idiopathic pulmonary
      fibrosis (IPF) over a 52 week period.

      Subjects who are not being treated with approved IPF therapies (i.e., nintedanib or
      pirfenidone) may be eligible for screening. Examples of reasons subjects may not be treated
      with approved IPF therapies include but are not limited to:

        -  Intolerant or not responsive to approved IPF therapies

        -  Ineligible to receive these therapies

        -  Subject voluntarily declines to receive approved IPF therapies after being fully
           informed of the potential benefits/risks

      NOTE: No subject should discontinue an approved IPF therapy for the purpose of enrolling in
      this study.

      Approximately 340 eligible subjects will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio to Arm A or Arm B,
      respectively:

      Arm A: pamrevlumab, 30 mg/kg IV, Day 1 and every 3 weeks thereafter

      Arm B: Matching placebo IV, Day 1 and every 3 weeks thereafter

      Screening period: Up to 6 weeks Treatment period: 48 weeks Follow-up period/final assessment:
      4 weeks (Week 52 [+7 Days])

      During the treatment period, co-administration of an approved IPF therapy (i.e., pirfenidone
      or nintedanib) is acceptable if clinically indicated in the Investigator's opinion, provided
      that the Investigator assesses the potential risks/benefits of combining approved IPF
      therapies with blinded study treatment.

      Subjects who discontinue study treatment for any reason should be encouraged to remain in the
      study and be followed for all study visits and assessments.

      Subjects who complete the study will be eligible for an open-label, extension with
      pamrevlumab.

The responses to all items are summed up to provide the overall score that can range from 0 (best outcome) to 120 (worst outcome).</description>

    <description>The LCQ is a self-reporting quality of life measure of chronic cough. It consists of 19 items with a 7 point likert response scale (range from 1 to 7). Each item is developed to assess symptoms during cough and impact of cough on three main domains: physical, psychological and social. Scores are calculated as a mean of each domain and the total score is calculated by adding every domain score.</description>
