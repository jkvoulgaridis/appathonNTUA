  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the relative bioavailability of JNJ-64417184,
      formulated as a test formulation (tablet) compared to a reference formulation (suspension),
      administered orally in a fasted state, in healthy participants.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy on the basis of physical examination, medical and surgical history, and vital
             signs performed at screening. If there are abnormalities, the participant may be
             included only if the investigator judges the abnormalities to be not clinically
             significant or to be appropriate and reasonable for the population under study. This
             determination must be recorded in the participant's source documents and initialed by
             the investigator

          -  Healthy on the basis of clinical laboratory tests performed at screening. If the
             results of the hematology, biochemistry, blood coagulation, or urinalysis are outside
             the normal reference ranges, the participant may be included only if the investigator
             judges the abnormalities or deviations from normal to be not clinically significant or
             to be appropriate and reasonable for the population under study. This determination
             must be recorded in the participant's source documents and initialed by the
             investigator

          -  Must have a normal 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) (triplicate) at screening,
             including: normal sinus rhythm (heart rate between 45 and 100 beats per minute [bpm],
             extremes included); QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) according to Fridericia
             (QTcF) less than or equal to (&lt;=) 450 milli second (ms) for male participants and
             &lt;=470 ms for female participants; QRS interval less than (&lt;) 120 ms; PR interval &lt;=200
             ms. If the results of the ECG are outside the normal ranges, the participant may be
             included only if the investigator judges the deviations from normal ECG to be not
             clinically significant or to be appropriate and reasonable for the population under
             study. This determination must be recorded in the participant's source documents and
             initialed by the investigator

          -  Female participant must have a negative highly sensitive serum beta human chorionic
             gonadotropin (beta hCG) pregnancy test at screening and on Days -1, 7, and 14 (except
             for postmenopausal female participants)

          -  Female participant must agree not to donate eggs (ova, oocytes) for the purposes of
             assisted reproduction during the study and for at least 90 days after the last study
             drug intake

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Past history of cardiac arrhythmias (example, extrasystoli, tachycardia at rest),
             history of risk factors for Torsade de Pointes syndrome (example, hypokalemia, family
             history of long QT Syndrome)

          -  Current human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-type 1 (HIV-1) or HIV-2 infection
             (confirmed by antibodies) at screening

          -  History of hepatitis A, B, or C infection, or current hepatitis A infection (confirmed
             by hepatitis A antibody immunoglobulin M [IgM]), or hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection
             (confirmed by hepatitis B surface antigen), or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection
             (confirmed by HCV antibody) at screening

          -  A history of clinically significant drug allergy such as, but not limited to,
             sulfonamides and penicillins, or drug allergy witnessed in previous studies with
             experimental drugs

          -  Known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to JNJ-64417184 or any of its
