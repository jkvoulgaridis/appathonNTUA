  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The specific aim of this project is to demonstrate that the decisional analysis/craving
      regulation aspects of CBT reduce cocaine self-administration in subjects with cocaine use
      disorder through diminished craving responses. Thirty non-treatment seeking human subjects
      meeting diagnostic criteria for cocaine use disorder will complete an outpatient, crossover,
      placebo-controlled study consisting of 1 practice and 9 experimental sessions. In each
      experimental session, the reinforcing effects of intranasal cocaine will be determined under
      one of three regulation of craving conditions that simulate CBT decisional analysis (i.e.,
      negative instruction, positive instruction or a neutral &quot;look&quot; condition). After sampling the
      dose of cocaine available in each session, subjects will complete the craving manipulation
      assigned to that session, they will then rate their craving and finally they will have the
      opportunity to earn the sampled dose in a progressive-ratio procedure. We hypothesize that
      focusing on the negative effects of cocaine use will decrease craving and reduce cocaine
      self-administration relative to the positive and &quot;look&quot; conditions, and that craving will be
      positively correlated with self-administration outcomes.

    <measure>Number of Times Cocaine Was Selected</measure>
    <time_frame>One test for each of the craving manipulations for placebo and each cocaine dose level over approximately two weeks of participation.</time_frame>
    <description>The reinforcing effects of cocaine will be determined using a modified progressive ratio procedure (Stoops et al., 2010) in which subjects can make 5 choices for each available cocaine dose. Reinforcing effects are measured for each cocaine dose during across the craving manipulation conditions.</description>

    <measure>Cocaine Craving</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured for each of the craving manipulations for placebo and each cocaine dose level over approximately two weeks of participation.</time_frame>
    <description>Cocaine craving will be assessed using a 10 point craving questionnaire that asks subjects to rate how much they are craving cocaine at that moment. The minimum craving score is 0 (i.e., no craving), the maximum craving score is 10 (i.e., highest craving).</description>
