      We aimed to establish the effects of sarcopenia on postoperative complications among patients
      undergoing surgical treatment for gastric cancer

    <textblock>
      Among gastrointestinal disease, gastric cancer is a malignancy which is diagnosed
      predominantly in advanced stages, mostly accompanied with malnutrition when diagnosed, has
      aggressive behavior with poor oncological outcomes. The only option for curative treatment is
      surgical resection in this malignancy; however, the surgical procedure itself causes high
      morbidity and mortality rates. Therefore, physicians combine various treatment modalities and
      risk assessment to decrease complication and mortality rates.

      Sarcopenia is a syndrome characterized by progressive and generalized loss of skeletal muscle
      mass and strength with a risk of adverse outcomes such as physical disability, poor quality
      of life, and death. For the diagnosis of sarcopenia, using the presence of both low muscle
      mass and decreased muscle function (strength or performance) is recommended. Previous studies
      showed that colorectal or pancreatic cancer accompanied with sarcopenia has adverse effects
      on not only for short term and also for long term outcomes. The majority of studies regarding
      gastric cancer was published from Eastern countries owing to their high incidence. There are
      few studies from western countries which are mostly retrospective and does not meet the
      diagnostic criteria of sarcopenia. In the western population, there is no high-quality
      evidence so far regarding the impact of sarcopenia on early outcomes of gastric cancer
      surgical treatment.
