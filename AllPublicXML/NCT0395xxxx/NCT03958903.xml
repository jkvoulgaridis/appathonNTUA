  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to specifically examine the in vivo electrophysiology and effects of direct
      stimulation of the human amygdala during conditioned and evoked fear. Investigators will also
      examine amygdala electrophysiology and the effects of stimulation during tasks to examine the
      effects of reward on fear memory.

      This study will recruit subjects with a history of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) who have
      undergone neurosurgical implantation with FDA-approved, NeuroPace RNS devices for treatment
      of seizures. These patients provide a unique cohort with (Responsive Neurostimulation) RNS
      devices capable of both recording and stimulating the amygdala during performance of
      fear-based, behavioral tasks.
