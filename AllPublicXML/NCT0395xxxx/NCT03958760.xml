  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The heavy disease burden is mainly due to diabetic complications. Diabetes is a major risk
      factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD).China has been the
      largest absolute disease burden of diabetes in the world recently1. Diabetic patients with
      established CVD or CKD are bringing growing pressure upon our nation's healthcare
      expenditure1. However, the characteristic profile of Chinese diabetic patients who has CVD,
      CKD or at high risk of CVD remains unclear thus is in urgent need for in-depth
      investigation.In current China, however, the information regarding diabetes or non-diabetes
      patients who also had other comorbid conditions (e.g. established CV diseases, CKD or at high
      risk for such problem), is limited; the patient characteristics, treatment patterns and
      economic burden may not be fully understood.Therefore, based on Fuzhou regional database, the
      investigators will describe the demographic, clinical characteristics, treatment, and
      economic burden of disease of Chinese diabetic/non-diabetic patients with/without established
      CV disease, CKD, or at high CV risk including hypertension and hyperlipidaemia. And the
      investigators believe that the resulting findings will inform a comprehensive group of
      evidence users to achieve better healthcare for diabetes patients with established or at high
      risk of CVD or CKD.

      The study aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics, treatment, and economic burden
      of disease of Chinese diabetic/non-diabetic patients with/without established cardiovascular
      disease, chronic kidney disease, or at high cardiovascular risk, including:

        1. estimate the proportion of Chinese diabetic/non-diabetic patients with established
           cardiovascular disease, CKD, or at high cardiovascular risk including hypertension and
           hyperlipidaemia;

        2. describe the demographic and clinical characteristics of Chinese diabetic/non-diabetic
           patients with/without established cardiovascular disease, CKD, or at high cardiovascular
           risk;

        3. investigate the treatment patterns of Chinese diabetic/non-diabetic patients
           with/without established cardiovascular disease, CKD, or at high cardiovascular risk;

        4. examine economic burden of disease of Chinese diabetic/non-diabetic patients
           with/without established cardiovascular disease, CKD, or at high cardiovascular risk;

        5. explore the trends of clinical characteristics, treatment pattern, economic burden of
           inpatients over time (2008, 2013, and 2018 separately);
