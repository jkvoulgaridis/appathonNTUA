      This study focuses on menthol (n = 125) and non-menthol (n = 125) smoking young adults (YAs;
      defined here as ages 18 to 24) who started smoking in the past 6-months.

      The study will occur in three phases.

      In session 1 of Phase 1, participants will engage in ad libitum smoking session of one's
      preferred cigarette brand (menthol or non-menthol). In session 2, participants will take
      several puffs each of a commercially available menthol and non-menthol cigarette (i.e., Camel
      Crush) and complete a complete a series of pre-post smoking questionnaires, and in Session 3
      participants will complete a computerized task to measure perceptions of cigarette smoking.
      For the computerized task, participants will be able to &quot;win&quot; points toward earning puffs of
      a cigarette and will be able to smoke puffs earned. Participants will be asked to abstain
      from smoking for at least 12 hours before each in-person visit.

      Phase 2 participants will engage in 14 days of surveys they will complete on their cell to
      measure different aspects of smoking behavior. These surveys will happen twice a day at
      random times.

      For phase 3, participants will complete an assessment of smoking behavior and related factors
      6-months after the baseline assessment either in-person, in the laboratory, or via telephone
      or online (if in-person follow-up is not viable).
