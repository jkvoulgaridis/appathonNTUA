      The investigator's aim is to compare the efficacy of 3 levobupivacaine solutions with
      different density on spinal anesthesia for caesarean delivery.

    <textblock>
      Patients scheduled for elective caesarean delivery were separated into 4 groups. Spinal
      anesthesia was performed with one of the following regimens.

      Group 1: Levobupivacaine 8 mg + 20 mcg Fentanyl Group 2: Levobupivacaine 8 mg + 20 mcg
      Fentanyl + 40 mg Dextrose Group 3: Levobupivacaine 8 mg + 20 mcg Fentanyl + 60 mg Dextrose
      Group 4: Levobupivacaine 8 mg + 20 mcg Fentanyl + 80 mg Dextrose After anesthesia induction
      motor block was evaluated via bromage scale and sensory block via pinprick test every 3
      minutes for the first 15 minutes, and every 5 minutes up to 60 minutes. Maximum sensory block
      level, time to reach maximum block level, time needed to achieve T10 sensory level were
      recorded.

      Baby delivery time, and operation duration were also recorded. Time to two segment regression
      of maximum sensory block, motor block recovery time and time to S2 regression of sensory
      block will be recorded.

      Hemodynamic data, nausea vomiting, were also recorded throughout surgery at the same
      evaluation periods and postoperative period.

      The surgeon will also evaluate the abdominal relaxation surgical block quality as good,
      medium and poor.

      The patient will evaluate spinal block analgesia quality as good, medium or poor.

      Pain scores are going to be evaluated by VAS at the beginning, uterine incision and during
      abdominal closure. Time for first analgesic requirement and postoperative pain is also going
      to be evaluated by VAS.
