  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a well-documented increased risk for disordered mineral bone homeostasis in Kidney
      Transplant Recipients (KTRs) when compared to the general population, leading to a markedly
      increased risk for fragility fractures and their associated morbidity and mortality. A more
      uniform and rigorous evaluation of bone and mineral homeostasis,than is afforded to patients
      under &quot;normal care&quot;, will result in better clinical outcomes in KTRs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim is to comprehensively characterize the mineral metabolism and skeletal phenotype in
      kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) to being to identify risk factors for post-kidney
      transplant mineral bone disease (PKT-MBD); and to evaluate whether treatment of abnormalities
      in these parameters will improve skeletal health as quantified by bone mineral density (BMD),
      bone turnover markers (rate of skeletal remodeling) and Osteoprobe (a direct index of bone
      quality using reference point indentation technology.

    <measure>Change in bone turnover marker carboxy-terminal collagen crosslinks (CTx)</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>In the intervention group changes in measures of mineral metabolism (serum calcium, phosphorus, PTH and 25 OH vitamin D levels), changes in bone turnover markers, BMD and bone quality markers will be compared to baseline results. The primary outcome variable will be the change in serum CTx from baseline. CTx is a marker of bone resorption and rates of resorption predict bone loss and fracture risk.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Variance in bone loss</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>the changes in PTH, CTx, Procollagen Type 1 N-Terminal Propeptide (P1NP), Trabecular Bone Score (TBS) and Bone Material Strength Index (BMSi) will be correlated with changes in bone mineral density (BMD) in a multiple regression model to determine their contributions to the variance in rates of bone loss. This will serve to inform our planned prospective study in terms of what measures to follow.</description>

    <description>The participants will be evaluated for a) Mineral metabolism: blood calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone (PTH), 25(OH) vitamin D; b) Bone turnover markers: bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, cross-linked C-telopeptide of type I collagen (CTx), and N-terminal propeptide of type I collagen (PINP); c)Bone Mineral Density using a Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry which is the standard method by which bone mass is measured clinically.</description>

    <description>The Control Cohort is essentially an historical control group who will have received standard of care for the 18 months ending just prior to the enrollment of our Intervention Cohort. We cannot use a coincident Control Cohort because knowledge of the additional data to be collected in the Control Cohort will undoubtedly influence their care by their attending nephrologists and surgeons.</description>
