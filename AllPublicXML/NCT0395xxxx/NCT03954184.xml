      This research will test a technology adoption framework to increase use of the A-CHESS
      smartphone app. The project, based in Iowa, will compare a control condition (using a typical
      product training approach to software implementation that includes user tutorials and
      instruction on administrative and clinical protocols, followed by access to on-line support)
      to the typical product training combined with NIATx-TI.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patient-centered e-health has failed to achieve its promise despite considerable consumer
      interest in technology and research supporting its potential. E-health adoption rates in
      healthcare are poor, with specialty substance use disorder (SUD) treatment having the lowest
      technology adoption rate of any sector.1 Implementation science can address this emerging gap
      in the e-health field by augmenting existing models, that explain organizational and
      individual e-health behaviors retrospectively, with prospective models that can guide
      implementation. The organizational planning discipline, with its decades of research, could
      provide a cross-disciplinary &quot;jump start&quot; to developing an e-health implementation model for
      health organizations.2, 3 Henry Mintzberg, a respected pioneer in this field, describes 2
      beneficial approaches to planning: the deliberate approach, which is grounded in
      pre-implementation planning, and the emergent approach that is grounded in adapting to the
      environment as the plan is implemented.4 The proposed e-health implementation model, called
      the Network for the Improvement of Addiction Treatment-Technology Implementation (NIATx-TI)
      Framework, incorporates both approaches.

      NIATx-TI was piloted in the Iowa Rural Health Information Technology Initiative (IRHIT) with
      14 of Iowa's 105 SUD treatment sites and resulted in a 2-fold increase in patients receiving
      distance treatment. The framework's deliberate component includes using an organizational
      technology assessment5 and patient simulation.6 These tools identify and address assets and
      barriers to incorporate into the technology's implementation protocol. The framework's
      emergent component includes using a project team to uncover and prioritize implementation
      barriers as they arise, develop changes to address identified barriers, and monitor selected
      adoption measures, while receiving monthly coaching.

      This project, based in Iowa, will compare a control condition (using a typical product
      training approach to software implementation that includes user tutorials and instruction on
      administrative and clinical protocols, followed by access to on-line support) to the typical
      product training combined with NIATx-TI. While e-health spans many modalities and health
      disciplines, this project will focus on the implementing Addiction Comprehensive Health
      Enhancement Support System (A-CHESS), an evidence-based SUD treatment recovery app developed
      by our Center for a disease that affects 21.5 million and kills 136,000 Americans annually:
      substance use disorder.7 A mobile app was selected, as opposed to another e-health
      technology, because of the near ubiquitous daily use of mobile technology and because mobile
      e-health adoption requires supportive participation of both health centers and patients.
