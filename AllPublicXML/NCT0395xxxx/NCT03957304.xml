  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The most common injury prompting an emergency department (ED) visit in children is a cut
      (laceration) that requires repair using stitches or skin glue. Despite anesthetic (freezing),
      laceration repair is often very distressful because in young children, most occur on the
      face. There is currently no effective drug to relieve the distress of laceration repair in
      children. The goal is to find a safe and effective drug to reduce distress in children
      undergoing laceration repair. Dexmedetomidine is a new drug that safely provides mild
      sedation and can be given as a painless nasal spray. Intranasal dexmedetomidine (IND) has
      been shown to reduce distress in children undergoing painful procedures such as dental work
      and intravenous insertion. However, no large study has explored IND for laceration repair. In
      order for research to change the way we care for children, a large study that enrolls
      children across many paediatric EDs needs to be performed. The first step is to conduct a
      smaller study to identify the safest and most effective dose. The proposed study plans to
      enroll 54 children age 1-10 years who require laceration repair.

      Design: This study will be designed as a phase II single-arm 3+3 dose-escalation pilot study.

      Protocol: Sedation will be measured using the Dartmouth Operative Conditions Scale (DOCS), an
      instrument validated for video scoring of children undergoing painful procedures. The DOCS is
      scored from -4 to +4 easily by non-medical personnel and assesses over sedation and under
      sedation. Adequate sedation is a score from -2 to +2. Participants will be consecutively
      assigned to increasing doses of IND from 1-4 mcg/kg. Three participants will receive each
      dose level. If all three are adequately sedated, without requiring additional sedation and
      are compliant with IND sprays, the dose will be escalated for the next three participants. If
      one participant is either not adequately sedated, requires additional sedation, or is
      non-compliant with IND, three additional participants are treated at this dose. If &gt; 2
      participants are either not adequately sedated, require additional sedation, or are
      non-compliant with IND, the prior dose will be defined as the optimal phase II dose and
      recruitment will cease. The optimal phase II dose will be defined as the dose in which (i)
      five of six participants achieve adequate sedation (DOCS -2 to +2) for the measurement period
      (every 30 seconds from the start of preprocedural positioning to tying of the last suture)
      AND (ii) no additional sedation is required AND (iii) participants are compliant with IND.
      Serious adverse events as defined by the Quebec Guidelines on paediatric procedural sedation.
      Data will be reviewed after each dose by a data safety monitoring board, who will confirm it
      is safe to escalate. Permissible co-interventions include topical and subcutaneous
      anesthetic, oral or IV analgesics, non-pharmacologic strategies for pain and distress.

      Screening and Enrollment: Participants will be consecutively screened for eligibility during
      the hours of study recruitment.

      Sample Size: This was calculated using the Bayesian continual reassessment method (20). Based
      on an adverse event rate of 10%, 4 dosing levels, an odds ratio for the effect size of 1.8,
      and a phase II trial accuracy level of 60%, an estimated a sample size of 54 participants was
      calculated.

    <masking_description>Blinding of dose levels will not be possible so outcome assessors will be blinded by virtue of being remote from the clinical encounter. Furthermore, video segments will commence immediately after intranasal sprays are given so outcome assessors will not see what volume is administered. Two independent assessors will score each video and an interrater agreement (kappa) will be calculated.</masking_description>

For each item, parents are asked to compare their child's behavior before hospitalization to their current behavior (post-hospitalization) on a Likert-type scale using the following five response options: much less than before (1), less than before (2), same as before (3), more than before (4), and much more than before (5), producing a range from 27-135 with higher scores indicating greater severity of maladaptive behaviors.</description>
