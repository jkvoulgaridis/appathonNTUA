      -  Review the outcomes of the Endovascular management of pediatric intracranial
           arteriovenous shunts.

        -  Give an effective treatment for pediatric intracranial arteriovenous shunts and can
           detect the best method could be used and assess safety and efficacy of different
           endovascular techniques in treatment of different AV shunts.

        -  Improve the outcome of these patients and decease rate of recurrence and complications.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intracranial arteriovenous shunts (ICAVS) in young children are characterized by frequent
      high‐flow fistulas. In association with high‐flow fistulas and the physiological condition of
      the developing brain and heart, each ICAVS type tends to present at a certain age with unique
      symptoms.

      Vein of Galen aneurysmal malformation (VGAM) and dural sinus malformation with arteriovenous
      (AV) shunt tend to present in the neonate with high output cardiac failure. In infancy, VGAM,
      pial arteriovenous fistula (AVF) and infantile dural AVF (DAVF) tend to present with
      hydrodynamic disorder such as macrocephaly, ventriculomegaly, prominent facial veins, and
      developmental delay.

      Pial AVF, AV malformation, and infantile DAVF can present with focal neurological signs such
      as seizure or hemorrhage at older ages they are in the subpial space, as opposed to VGAM or
      DAVF, which are extrapial in location and tend to present with systemic symptoms .

      Endovascular treatment is currently the first choice of treatment for most pediatric ICAVS.
      The treatment goal should be defined on a patient‐by‐patient basis, according to the unique
      physiological condition of the child.

0 - No symptoms.
- No significant disability. Able to carry out all usual activities, despite some symptoms.
- Slight disability. Able to look after own affairs without assistance, but unable to carry out all previous activities.
- Moderate disability. Requires some help, but able to walk unassisted.
- Moderately severe disability. Unable to attend to own bodily needs without assistance, and unable to walk unassisted.
- Severe disability. Requires constant nursing care and attention, bedridden, incontinent.
- Dead.</description>
