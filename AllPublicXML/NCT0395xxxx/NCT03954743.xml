  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to complete the total safety database size for GlaxoSmithKline
      Biologicals' (GSK's) human rotavirus (HRV) vaccine (ROTARIX) across the Porcine circovirus
      (PCV)-free development plan.

      This study will use a purposely selected lot for PCV-free liquid HRV vaccine that is in the
      upper range of the usual release potencies. The PCV-free liquid HRV vaccine lots used will be
      stored frozen in order to keep the titre stable until administration during the study.

      As the liquid formulation of ROTARIX is not licensed in the US, the lyophilized formulation
      of the vaccine will be used as a control in all phase III studies as part of the PCV-free
      development plan.

    <masking_description>Data will be collected in an observer-blind manner.

    <measure>Percentages of subjects with any solicited general adverse events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>During the 8-day follow-up period (Day 1-Day 8) after each vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed solicited general AEs are fever, irritability/fussiness, diarrhea, vomiting, loss of appetite and cough/runny nose. Any = occurrence of AE regardless of intensity grade or relation to vaccination.</description>

    <description>An unsolicited AE is defined as any AE reported in addition to those solicited during the clinical study and any 'solicited' AE with onset outside the specified period of follow-up for solicited AE. Potential unsolicited AEs include medically attended visits (defined as symptoms or illnesses requiring hospitalization, or emergency room visit, or visit to/by a health care provider), or AEs that were of concern to the parent(s)/Legally acceptable representative [LAR(s)]. Any = occurrence of AE regardless of intensity grade or relation to vaccination.</description>

    <time_frame>Throughout the study period (Dose 1 [Day1] up to study end [Month 7-8])</time_frame>
    <description>An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization and/or results in disability/incapacity. Any = occurrence of SAE regardless of intensity grade or relation to vaccination.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        All subjects must satisfy all the following criteria at study entry:

          -  Subjects' parent(s)/LAR(s) who, in the opinion of the investigator, can and will
             comply, with the requirements of the protocol (e.g. completion of the diary cards,
             return for follow-up visits).

          -  Written or witnessed/thumb printed informed consent obtained from the parent(s)/LAR(s)
             of the subject prior to performance of any study specific procedure.
