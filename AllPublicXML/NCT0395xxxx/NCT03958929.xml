      Overall Objective: This study will assess whether an educational video is effective in
      increasing patient satisfaction with glaucoma surgery.

        1. Investigate the impact of educational interventions on glaucoma patients' surgical
           satisfaction.

        2. Investigate the post-operative satisfaction of rural glaucoma patients in county
           hospitals

        3. Investigate the difference in postoperative satisfaction between urban and rural
           glaucoma patients in urban hospitals

        4. Investigate other factors that influence postoperative glaucoma satisfaction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in China, as elsewhere in the world.
      In Chinese rural settings, where topical glaucoma medication is unlikely to be a practical
      and sustainable option, surgery is the primary treatment modality for glaucoma.

      However, it is known that vision is quite likely to decline in the short to medium term after
      glaucoma surgery, and there are concerns that dis-satisfaction resulting from such vision
      changes might lead to negative social marketing, affecting uptake not only of glaucoma
      surgical care but other eye operations (principally cataract) as well. We propose to test the
      impact on post-operative satisfaction of a multi-media educational intervention designed to
      give patients a realistic expectation of their post operative course: glaucoma surgery is
      being performed NOT to improve vision, but do protect it from future harm, and vision may in
      fact decline for several weeks post operatively.

      A randomized controlled design will be used, and subjects undergoing glaucoma surgery will be
      enrolled at 4 rural county hospitals in rural Guangdong province, and randomized to receive
      the intervention or usual care. The principal outcome will be subjective satisfaction on a
      previously-tested questionnaire instrument, administered pre-operatively and post-operatively
      on two occasions in the first month following surgery. Patients not returning
      post-operatively to the surgical facility will be contacted by telephone for administration
      of the questionnaire. Other facility- and patient-related clinical and personal factors
      expected to influence satisfaction will also be recorded, and adjusted for in all analyses.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The mean satisfaction outcome over two follow-up visits</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day, 1 week</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome is the mean satisfaction score calculated by adding up the satisfaction scores at two follow-up visits: 1 day and 1 week after surgery and dividing the total by the number of scores. The satisfaction score will be assessed as a cumulative score.
Composite outcome, in which multiple end points are combined, are frequently used as primary outcome measures in randomized trials and are often associated with increased statistical efficiency, although such measure may prove challenging for the interpretation of results.

    <description>The measurement method: questionnaire.
Mean knowledge scores is calculated by adding up the scores at two follow-up visits: 1 day and 1 week after surgery and dividing the total by the number of scores. Knowledge scores will be assessed as a cumulative score, and will be compared with the baseline pre-operative score.</description>
