  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to determine the safest maximum dose of an amino acid,
      citrulline, which will be used as potential treatment for adult patients with a disorder of
      energy metabolism called Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy, Lactic Acidosis, and Stroke-like
      episodes (MELAS). Once established, this dose will be used in a future clinical trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The human body is made of many cells and each cell contains many mitochondria. Mitochondria
      are called the powerhouses of the cell, because they produce the energy needed for a cell to
      be healthy and function the way it is meant to.

      Diseases of the mitochondria affect the way the tissues and cells of the body make and use
      energy, and can affect almost all the different organs of the body like the brain and the
      muscles.

      MELAS syndrome is one of the mitochondrial diseases; patients with this disease have
      different complications including stroke like episodes, headache, muscle weakness, fatigue,
      and hearing loss. One of the factors contributing to complications seen in patients with
      MELAS syndrome, in particular the stroke like episodes, is decreased amount of an element
      called nitric oxide. This element is made in the bodies from an amino acid called arginine.
      Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins. Proteins make the muscles in the bodies, and
      they are present in meat, chicken and fish.

      In this study, the highest acceptable dose of an amino acid called citrulline will be
      established in participants who have a mitochondrial disorder. Previous research conducted by
      several groups including Baylor College of Medicine has determined that there is a deficiency
      of a compound called nitric oxide in patients affected with MELAS.

      The lack of nitric oxide could cause constriction of blood vessels in the brain making it
      easier for these patients to have a metabolic stroke. The amino acid citrulline is a
      foundation for nitric oxide. In earlier studies, the investigator has found that there is
      more production of nitric oxide in the body when participants affected with MELAS take
      L-citrulline.
