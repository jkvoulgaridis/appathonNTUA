      The Cardiovalve system is a replacement valve delivered through a transfemoral access and
      transseptal approach and is intended for symptomatic patients with Mitral regurgitation for
      whom surgical options are not feasible.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of the CardiovalveSystem with its
      associated procedure, and observe the device performance in reducing mitral regurgitation
      Data collected in this clinical study will include 30-day safety and performance of the
      device and delivery system, and long-term clinical outcomes over a follow-up of 2 years.
