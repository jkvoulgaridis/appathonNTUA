  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project rolls out combined innovative low‐tech thermotherapy with heat packs and WHO
      recommended wound management in a Buruli ulcer (BU)‐endemic district of West Africa. It
      addresses three key areas of considerable clinical and public health importance in the
      region:

        -  to better help people managing the disabling disease BU that primarily affects children
           in West Africa

        -  to implement WHO recommended general wound management for all types of wounds with tools
           available at the peripheral level of the health care system

        -  to prevent systemic life threatening sequelae (e.g. sepsis and rheumatic fever) and
           permanent local damage (e.g. motor and sensory disability) by early recognition and
           treatment of wounds at the community level. The project translates available research
           findings already validated on the secondary health care level into clinical practice at
           the periphery (primary health care level). The string of the investigator's previous
           work from the development of the BU thermotherapy‐wound management-package to the proof
           of its efficacy provides all necessary skills, tools and documents to immediately
           proceed into practical community application.

      Operational endpoints are

        -  coverage and quality of WHO recommended wound management training of health care
           personnel at the primary health care level (health posts);

        -  coverage, success rate and quality of care for patients with BU and other wounds;
           denominator controlled at health post level and high‐quality Health and Demographic
           Surveillance Systems (HDSS) data.

      The project is embedded into a stable multidisciplinary working environment at Côte d'Ivoire,
      including an HDSS with a longstanding record of partnership and successful community‐based
      operational research.

      The project builds on the principles laid out by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and
      Universal Health Coverage (UHC) and

        -  targets all patients with a broken down skin barrier independent of the cause (patient
           centred health care)

        -  brings diagnosis and treatment close to the community

        -  educates and trains both community members and health care workers

        -  measures the health intervention outcome The project is fully in line with the new
           integrated strategy for the skin NTDs of WHO's Department of Control of NTDs (WHO/NTD).

      Overall goal of the study To contribute to a better understanding of the clinical
      epidemiology of wounds and wound healing and to improve wound management in settings with
      limited resources at the community level, the primary and secondary level of the health care
      services.

      Study objectives Main study

        -  To measure the proportion of wounds healed (defined as wound closed) at each cycle of
           clinical diagnosis and the corresponding presumptive treatment

        -  To describe the clinical epidemiology of wounds presented (presumptive clinical and
           confirmed diagnoses)

        -  Coverage and quality of wound management training of health care personnel at the
           peripheral health care level (health posts); Substudy 1

        -  To measure the effectiveness and acceptability of thermotherapy of patients with early
           BU (&lt; 2cm) treated at health post level with the following outcomes:

             -  Primary endpoints absence of clinically BU specific features' according to WHO
                guidelines or 'wound closure' within 6 months after completion of heat treatment
                (&quot;primary cure&quot;) and 'absence of BU recurrence for 12 months after completion of
                heat treatment' (&quot;definite cure&quot;).

             -  Secondary outcomes rates of withdrawal for low compliance consent withdrawal rating
                of thermotherapy by health staff Substudy 2

        -  To measure the frequency and the severity of skin lesions (broken skin barrier) in the
           community and the health services

        -  To investigate the determining factors of community and health services‐based wound
           management

        -  To measure the impact of the wound management intervention (main study and substudy 1)
           on the frequency, spectrum and severity of wounds including systemic complications in
           the community and at the 7 health posts / district hospital (HDSS‐based) compared to the
           baseline study before the intervention and over time after the implementation of the
           intervention.

      Target Population The target population are approximately 43,000 people of the Taabo HDSS
      which is surveyed longitudinally for key demographic, health and socioeconomic indicators
      since 2008 (12, 13, 14). This provides ideal conditions to implement the intervention and
      assess the impact through operational endpoints. The health centres and the district hospital
      involved are part of the public health system. There is one district hospital and the seven
      health posts within the Taabo DHSS.
