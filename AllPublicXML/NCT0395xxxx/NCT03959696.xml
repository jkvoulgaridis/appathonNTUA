  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to examine the impact of different interventions designed to help
      individualize colorectal cancer (CRC) screening decisions in adults aged 76-85. Clinicians
      will be assigned by chance to one of two arms. In the Intervention arm, clinician
      participants will complete a training course and will also be notified of patients in the
      target age group who are due for a discussion about CRC screening. In the Comparator arm,
      clinician participants will be notified of their patients in the target age group with an
      upcoming visit who are due for a discussion about CRC screening. The investigators expect
      that patients seen by clinicians in the intervention arm will report more involvement in the
      decision making process, be more knowledgeable about the risks and benefits of CRC screening,
      and will have better quality decisions. Further, the investigators expect that the physicians
      in the intervention arm will have greater confidence in and demonstrate more skills for
      conducting shared decision making conversations as compared to those in the control arm.

      This study will advance understanding of how to engage and inform older adults in decisions
      about whether to continue or stop colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. The study will randomly
      assign about 50 primary care clinicians from 5 different sites to one of two different arms.
      In the Intervention arm, clinician participants will complete a training course and will also
      be notified of patients aged 76-85 with an upcoming visit who are due for a discussion about
      CRC screening. In the Comparator arm, clinician participants will be notified of their
      patients in the target age group with an upcoming visit who are due for a discussion about
      CRC screening. The study staff will collect surveys from about 500 eligible patients of
      participating physicians shortly after their visit to determine the impact of the
      intervention on patient-reported measures including the amount of shared decision making,
      knowledge, and preferences for cancer screening. Study staff will follow patients to track
      colorectal cancer screening tests in the 12 months following the visit and will survey
      patients again at 12 months to examine any barriers to follow through with their preferred
      approach. The study will also assess physician's ability to demonstrate shared decision
      making skills for cancer screening decisions in simulated patient interactions. Caregivers,
      if identified by a patient participant, will also complete a short survey evaluating the
      visit.

    <ipd_description>To promote research replicability, transparency and future use of the data, de-identified data sets of the patient and clinician survey data will be created and will be available, by request, to outside researchers.
After the main manuscripts have been published, de-identified data sets will also be deposited in an open access service such as, ICPSR (https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/). Before a dataset is made available for access, ICPSR completes a detailed review of all datasets to assess disclosure risk. If necessary, ICPSR modifies data to reduce disclosure risk or limits access to datasets for which modifying the data would substantially limit their utility or the risk of disclosure remains high. No information that contains identifiers or that could be used to link an individual to the data will be included in the de-identified data set.</ipd_description>

    <ipd_access_criteria>The PI will share a de-identified data set with outside investigators at no cost, according to approved Partners and Massachusetts General Hospital policies for data sharing. Investigators from other sites will be able to request the data and will be required to complete a data use agreement that ensures that all local Institutional Review Board requirements are met before using the data, that they will not attempt to identify any data in the dataset, and that they will not share the data set with anyone outside their project team.
On ICPSR, individuals must register and agree to ICPSR's Responsible Use statement prior to accessing datasets.</ipd_access_criteria>
