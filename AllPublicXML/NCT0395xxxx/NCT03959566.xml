    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label, randomized, controlled, multi-center Phase IIB dose-finding
      trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and
      exposure-response-relationship of different doses of sutezolid (STZ) in combination with
      bedaquiline, delamanid and moxifloxacin in adults with newly diagnosed, uncomplicated, smear
      positive and drug sensitive pulmonary tuberculosis. Participants will be randomized to one of
      five arms containing bedaquiline, delamanid and moxifloxacin with different doses of STZ
      (0mg, 600mg once daily (OD), 1200mg OD, 600 mg twice daily (BD), 800 mg BD). Study treatment
      duration will be three months, followed by a follow-up period of 2 weeks.

      The primary objective is to identify the optimal dose of sutezolid to be used in subsequent
      studies that provides the best efficacy at acceptable safety of the drug by describing the
      safety, tolerability and exposure toxicity relationship of sutezolid (and its main
      metabolite) given over three months, in combination with standard-dose bedaquiline, delamanid
      and moxifloxacin, compared to standard-dose bedaquiline, delamanid and moxifloxacin alone.

      This open-label Phase IIB dose-finding, randomized, controlled study with a duration of three
      months of experimental therapy in adult patients with newly diagnosed, smear positive,
      uncomplicated, drug sensitive pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) will be carried out to evaluate the
      safety, efficacy, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and exposure/response-relationship of
      different doses of sutezolid in combination with bedaquiline, delamanid and moxifloxacin
      (BDM).

      Participants will be randomized to one of five arms containing bedaquiline, delamanid and
      moxifloxacin with different doses of STZ (0mg, 600mg OD, 1200mg OD, 600 mg BD, 800 mg BD).
      Study treatment duration will be three month, followed by a follow-up period of 2 weeks.

      A total of 75 male or female subjects, aged between 18 and 65 years with newly diagnosed,
      drug sensitive, uncomplicated, smear-positive, pulmonary TB will be included and randomized
      to one of five arms containing BDM with different doses of STZ:

        -  Arm 1 (U0): Bedaquiline, delamanid, moxifloxacin

        -  Arm 2 (U600): Bedaquiline, delamanid, moxifloxacin, sutezolid 600 mg OD

        -  Arm 3 (U1200): Bedaquiline, delamanid, moxifloxacin, sutezolid 1200 mg OD

        -  Arm 4 (U600BD): Bedaquiline, delamanid, moxifloxacin, sutezolid 600 mg BD

        -  Arm 5 (U800BD): Bedaquiline, delamanid, moxifloxacin, sutezolid 800 mg BD

      A sub-study will assess CYP P450 3A4 enzyme induction potential using the probe drug
      midazolam, given to participants in arm 5.

      Using PK data and data from primary efficacy and safety objectives, we will develop an
      exposure-response and a population PK-model for sutezolid and its main metabolite to support
      the main objective, selection of a dose for subsequent studies.

    <intervention_model_description>75 participants will be randomized to one of five arms (15 participants per arm) to receive study medication containing bedaquiline, delamanid, and moxifloxacin with different doses of sutezolid, ranging from 0mg sutezolid up to 800mg sutezolid twice a day. Participants will be randomised and stratified by site and HIV status.
Participants will visit the study clinic on a weekly basis for sputum collection, safety monitoring and receipt of study medication.
After the completion of three months of experimental treatment participants in the experimental arms will be handed over to government TB programmes to complete their course of anti-TB treatment.</intervention_model_description>

          5. A chest X-ray (no older than 2 weeks) which, in the opinion of the Investigator, is
             consistent with TB.

          6. Sputum positive on microscopy from concentrated sputum for acid-fast bacilli on at
             least one sputum sample (at least 1+ on the International Union Against Tuberculosis

          7. The participant is willing to forgo consumption of foods high in tyramine for the
             period of taking study medication

          8. The participant is either unable to conceive/father children AND/OR his/her partner is
             unable to conceive/father children AND/OR they will be using effective methods of
             contraception, as defined below:

             a. Non-childbearing potential: i. Female participant/sexual partner of male
             participant - bilateral oophorectomy, and/or hysterectomy or bilateral tubal ligation
             more than 12 months ago and/or has been postmenopausal with a history of no menses for
             at least 12 consecutive months ii. Male participant/sexual partner of female
             participant - vasectomised or has had a bilateral orchidectomy minimally three months
             prior to screening b. Effective contraception methods: i. Female participants: two
             methods, including methods that the patient's sexual partner(s) use. At least one must

             the last dose of STZ.

        (Note: hormone-based contraception alone may not be reliable when taking RIF during
        continuation Phase; therefore, hormone-based contraceptives alone cannot be used by female
        participants/female partners of male participants to prevent pregnancy).

                  or cardiac-related cause

               9. Alcohol or other drug abuse that is sufficient to significantly compromise the
                  safety or cooperation of the patient, that includes substances prohibited by the
                  protocol or has led to significant organ damage at the discretion of the
                  investigator.

          8. Any of the following laboratory findings at screening:

               1. Serum amino aspartate transferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT)

                  lower than 30 ml/min

               5. serum albumin &lt; 2.8 mg/dl

               6. haemoglobin level &lt;7.0 g/dl

               8. serum potassium below the lower level of normal for the laboratory

               9. serum creatine phosphokinase &gt; 5x ULN

              10. blood glucose at screening of less than 70mg/dL (3.9mmol/L)

          9. ECG findings in the screening ECG: (one or more):

               1. Fridericia corrected QT (QTcF) interval of &gt;0.450 s

               2. Atrioventricular (AV) block with PR interval &gt; 0.20 s,

               3. QRS complex &gt; 120 milliseconds

               4. any other changes in the ECG that are clinically relevant as per discretion of
                  the investigator

         10. Restricted medication:

               1. Treatment with any other investigational drug within 1 month prior to enrolment
                  or enrolment into other clinical (intervention) trials during participation.
