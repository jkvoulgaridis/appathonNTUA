  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adolescence is a period of many physical, mental, emotional, and social changes. It is also
      associated with risk behaviour conducts. Nonetheless, not all youths under disadvantage,
      adversity, or exposure to risk factors experience negative mental health outcomes. The
      concept of RESILIENCE provides one possible explanation for the ability of some individuals
      to maintain positive mental health. Resilience is thus the ability of an individual or
      community to adapt to life challenges or adversities while maintaining mental health and
      well-being. The increasing prevalence of mental disorders amongst children (around 10-20% of
      young people) makes positive mental health promotion in schools necessary through
      intervention programmes. UPRIGHT (Universal Preventive Resilience Intervention Globally
      implemented in schools to improve and promote mental Health for Teenagers) is a research and
      innovation project funded by the European Union´s Horizon 2020 programme (No. 754919).
      UPRIGHT general aim is to promote mental well-being and prevent mental disorders in youth by
      enhancing resilience capacities. It has been designed as a whole school approach addressing
      early adolescents, their families and the school community to finally create a real mental
      well-being culture at schools.

  <detailed_description>

      The operational objectives of UPRIGHT are:

        -  to co-create (involving adolescents, families, school staff, clinicians, policy makers)
           an innovative resilience holistic program in schools for the promotion of mental health
           in youth between 12 and 14 years;

        -  to deploy an intervention in five different pan-European regions;

        -  to better understand the natural history of mental disorders according to the resilience
           level and provide evidence of specific resilience factors promoting positive mental
           well-being longitudinally;

        -  to demonstrate the effectiveness and predict future impact of an intervention in terms
           of improvement of quality of life, mental well-being, and academic performance, and a
           reduction of absenteeism and bullying cases;

        -  to transfer the programme to Europe and beyond by disseminating the results and enabling
           innovative action plans for mental well-being in the youth.

      The UPRIGHT programme´s conceptual framework is structured in four different domains
      including skills for coping, efficacy, social and emotional learning and mindfulness
      practice. The intervention was developed by an innovative co-creation process (co-design,
      co-production and co-customization) participating five European regions representative of the
      cultural and socioeconomic variability (Lower Silesian in Poland, Basque Country in Spain,
      Trento in Italy, Denmark and Reykjavik capitol area in Iceland).

Teachers will be trained by the UPRIGHT team at the beginning of the school year (3 months) and families will have a combination of face to face training and online training throughout the UPRIGHT platform.</description>

    <description>The UPRIGHT intervention design consists of two different phases consecutively implemented in two school years: intensive phase and follow-up phase. During the intensive phase, all stakeholders are trained in the UPRIGHT programme (18 skills). The follow-up phase intends not only to maintain the effect of the intensive training in youths, but also to boost the positive mental health atmosphere created in the whole school. To do so, different collective activities will be organized at school level such as celebration of thematic days, activities with the community, and outdoor/indoor activities.</description>
