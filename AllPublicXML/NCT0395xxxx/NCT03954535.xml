  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The planned randomized clinical trial will longitudinally test a tailored, web-based drug
      abuse prevention program with a nationwide sample of 15- to 17-year-old sexual minority youth
      (youth who identify as gay, lesbian, bisexual, or unsure of their sexual orientation).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The randomized controlled trial will include at least 890 sexual-minority youth from the
      United States. Study participants will be 15- to 17-year-old youth recruited from
      Facebook/Instagram. All youth will complete pretest measures online. Intervention-arm youth
      will then interact with the 9-session program; youth in the control arm will have access to
      an attention-placebo website. All youth will then complete posttest measures (immediately
      following intervention completion and estimated to be approximately 5 months after study
      onset) and 1-, 2-, and 3-year follow-up measures.

      Across posttest and annual follow-up measurement occasions, data analyses will examine rates
      of 30-day drug use between study arms. The investigators will also examine intervention
      effects on mediator variables associated with drug use and assess the extent to which changes
      in mediator variables explain differences in drug use between arms.

      Youth assigned to the intervention arm will have access to 9 intervention sessions delivered
      online. The sessions will be housed on a website with entertainment features youth seek: life
      hacks, features on LGBTQ leaders, fortunes, horoscopes, inspiring quotes, and health-related
      resources.

      To ensure that youths' expectations for study participation are equivalent across arms and to
      account for the non-active components of the experimental intervention, the investigators
      designed the attention-placebo arm. Youth assigned to the attention-placebo arm will have
      access to the website with entertainment features: life hacks, features on LGBTQ leaders,
      fortunes, horoscopes, inspiring quotes, and health-related resources.
