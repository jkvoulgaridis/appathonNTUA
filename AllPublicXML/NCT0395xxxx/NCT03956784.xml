  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative management in digestive surgery has been modernized thanks to improved
      rehabilitation measures. These measures include an earlier refeeding, mobilization,
      restriction of infusions (out of a total of 22) and showed their benefit in colorectal,
      gastric and bariatric surgery. It is thus possible to perform sleeve gastrectomy, bypass,
      restorations of digestive continuity and colectomies with early discharge or one day surgery.

      The most serious complications (fistula, sepsis) occur in the first 10 days postoperatively
      with an average readmission rate of 10%. Their screening is based on clinical signs
      (tachycardia, pain) or biological (C-Reactive Protein (CRP) assay on Day 3 or Day 4). It is
      important to manage these complications early so that their morbidity is lower, resulting in
      shorter stays and less severity.

      The monitoring and safety of patients discharged early are therefore essential and for the
      moment poorly codified, ranging from simple nursing to follow-up via a health provider.
      Recently, coordination structures including nurse platform and smartphone follow up app have
      emerged. Thanks to this system, the patient collects his own history and biological results
      which allows him to be monitored continuously, as in the hospital. In case of no filling or
      sign of complication, the nurse platform contacts the patient.

      This connected follow-up would make it possible to reinforce the safety of the patient
      discharged early after a complex digestive procedure performed on an outpatient basis. Its
      benefit has been poorly evaluated but it is however more and more used by surgeons convinced
      of its interest especially as it goes in the direction of the development of the outpatient
      activity requested by the High Authority of Health with economic benefits interesting also
      the administration of the care structures.

      The purpose of the investigator's study is to evaluate the impact of e-assessed follow-up
      during 10 days after surgery compared to a conventional follow-up. The hypothesis is that
      this connected follow-up would allow earlier detection of complications requiring
      rehospitalization (within 48 hours), resulting in faster and less severe treatment.

This questionnaire consists of 36 items exploring 5 dimensions or subscales: symptoms, physical condition, emotions, social integration and the effect of any medical treatment. For each item, 5 responses will be proposed to the patients and for each answer, a score ranging from 0 to 4 (highest score = 144) will be assigned. A high score defines a more favorable health state.</description>

    <description>Clinical questionnaire: self-evaluation of pain (0 to 10), resumption of transit, bleeding, fever, pulse. In case of no filling, the patient is contacted.
An automatic alert system is defined and divide the patient according to three situations:
Normal situation
Situation requiring the nurse to call back the patient and contact the surgeon if the assessment requires medical advice
Disturbing situation requiring contact of the first-line surgeon if a potentially serious event is suspected. Each speaker's place is described for each item in the detailed protocols
Biological questionnaire:
Biological monitoring (blood count, Ionogram, C-Reactive Protein, urea, creatinine) is performed on D1, D3 and D7.
All information is accessible in real time by the surgeon who receives notifications by email and on his smartphone in case of clinical or biological abnormality on patient monitoring.</description>

    <description>An information sheet on the clinical parameters to be monitored will be given to patients and will include the following information:
Immediate complications and warning signs:
Tachycardia&gt; 120 bpm
Dyspnea
Rectorragies and / or melena
Vomiting with or without presence of blood
Major abdominal pain (visual analogue scale&gt; 6/10)
Fever&gt; 38
Management to deal with complications: call the service and / or the surgeon
Actions to be performed by the patient after the exit:passage of the nurse during 10 days for anticoagulant morning and evening (identical in both study groups)
Each patient will be given a prescription to perform a C-Reactive Protein assay on D1, D3 and D7, similarly.</description>
