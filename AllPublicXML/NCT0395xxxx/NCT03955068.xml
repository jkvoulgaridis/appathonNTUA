    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to test the feasibility of implementing a strict classic ketogenic diet
      among a population of children with recurrent or progressive and refractory brain tumors.
      Eligible participants will be admitted to the neurosciences floor for 5 days to begin the
      ketogenic diet either orally, by gastrostomy tube or via nasogastric tube. During the
      inpatient stay, they will be extensively educated on the diet restrictions and rules.
      Participants will then continue on the diet at home returning about 17 times over the next 12
      months. Daily logs will be kept tracking diet changes, bowel movements and urine ketones.
      Blood will be collected during the inpatient stay and at all visits for both standard
      clinical care and research testing.

      Primary Objective is to determine the feasibility (safety and tolerability) of a strict
      classic ketogenic diet among a population of children with recurrent or progressive and
      refractory brain tumors.

      Secondary Objectives are: (1) to determine the objective response rate (complete response +
      partial response) to a strict classic ketogenic diet among children with recurrent or
      progressive and refractory brain tumor; (2) to estimate the time interval to tumor
      progression (Progression-Free Survival), time to treatment failure (Event-Free Survival), and
      time to death (Overall Survival) after initiation of a strict classic ketogenic diet among a
      group of pediatric patients with recurrent or progressive and refractory brain tumors; and
      (3) to describe and characterize tolerability and toxicities from a strict classic ketogenic
      diet among children with recurrent or progressive and refractory brain tumors.

      Exploratory Objective: Identify biomarker correlates, including MR spectroscopy and
      metabolites of tumor response to a strict classic ketogenic diet.

    <description>The classic ketogenic diet is individually calculated for each patient based on age, weight, and nutritional needs. The diet is typically administered from a 2:1 to 4:1 ratio; this means 2 to 4 parts of fat to 1 part of both protein (calculated based on RDA and whatever remaining portion of carbohydrates. The basis of calculations is first on the amount of required protein needed to meet RDA to insure adequate growth. Fine tuning of ketogenic diet therapy is based on serum beta-hydroxybutyrate levels (target levels of 3.5-6.5 mmol/L), tolerance of the diet, and response to treatment.</description>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age: Patients must be &lt; 21 years of age inclusive at the time of enrollment on this
             protocol.

          -  Histologic Diagnosis: Histologically proven, primary brain tumor that is recurrent or
             progressive and refractory (nonresponsive) to standard, accepted therapy. A
             histopathologic diagnosis from either the initial presentation or at the time of
             recurrence is required for all subjects, except for diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma
             (DIPG).

          -  Measurable Disease: Patients must have radiographically documented measurable tumor as
             assessed by RANO or RAPNO criteria.

          -  Cranial and Spinal MRI: To document the degree of residual tumor, all patients must
             have an MRI of the brain with and without gadolinium performed within 2 weeks prior to
             study enrollment. For patients who undergo a tumor debulking surgery at the time of
             recurrence/progression, the following must be obtained:

          -  Cranial pre-operative MRI scan with and without contrast.

          -  Cranial post-operative MRI scan with and without contrast within 28 days following
             surgery. If possible, post-operative MRI should be performed within 48 hours of
             surgery, prior to the onset of edema or post-operative surgical enhancement, which can
             make measurements of residual tumor difficult.

          -  Performance Level: Patients must have a performance status of &gt; 50. Use Karnofsky
             score for patients &gt; 16 years of age and Lansky score for patients â‰¤ 16 years of age.

          -  Life Expectancy: Patients must have a life expectancy of &gt; 8 weeks.

          -  Prior Therapy: Patients must have fully recovered from the acute toxic effects of all
             prior chemotherapy, immunotherapy, biologic therapy, or radiotherapy prior to entering
             this study

          -  Growth factor(s): Must not have received within 1 week prior to entry onto this study.

          -  Other anti-cancer or experimental agents or therapies are not permitted. Homeopathic
             medicines are not permitted. Multivitamins are permitted.

             the dietary protocol.

          -  Patients must be able to eat by mouth or must be willing to have a nasogastric tube
             (NGT) if gastrostomy tube is not already present.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding. Female patients of childbearing potential must have
             negative pregnancy test result within the previous 14 days..

          -  Sexually active patients of reproductive potential are not eligible unless they have
             agreed to use an effective contraceptive method for the duration of their study
             participation.

          -  Other Exclusionary Criteria: Disorder of B-oxidation, as measured by plasma
             aceyl-carnitine, Uncontrolled infection, History of nephrolithiasis, Diagnosis of
             diabetes mellitus that is being treated by medication.

          -  The following medications are excluded: Steroids: Therapeutic systemic doses of
             steroids must be stopped greater than 2 weeks prior to admission to the hospital to
             start the diet. A steroid washout of 1 week is acceptable for patients with DIPG.
             Concomitant chemotherapy drugs and homeopathic drugs are not permitted.
