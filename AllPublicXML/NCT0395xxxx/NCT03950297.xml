    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human (FIH), open-label, phase 1 dose-escalation study of 609A, a
      recombinant monoclonal anti-PD-1 antibody product, in subjects with Locally
      advanced/Metastatic Solid Tumors, who must have received, or be intolerant to all available
      approved or standard therapies known to confirm clinical benefit, or for whom no standard
