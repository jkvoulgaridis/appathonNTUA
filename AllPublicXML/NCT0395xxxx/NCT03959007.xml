  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with acute leukemia or received SCT are hospitalized in protected area, at least for
      28 days. In this area, there is some rules like: controlled-visit, protective-clothing….so
      patient are in social and familial isolation condition.

      During their hospitalization, patients are confront to aggressive treatment and psychological
      distress related to potentially death.

      Emergency hospitalization, illness, controlled environment, aggressive treatment and
      potential complications place patients in a context of anxiety-provoking.

      Aesthetic therapy is a new supportive care in cancer therapy access on improving well-being,
      relaxation and body image.

      This supportive care is already used in cancerology department, particularly in breast cancer
      patients.

      In our department, a few patient received aesthetic care during their hospitalization and
      they appreciated these sessions and impact on well-being was immediately.

      Moreover only 6 sessions was proposed and effect on anxiety wasn't measurable Aesthetic care
      improve well-being but impact on anxiety is unknown. In this study we evaluate the impact off
      socio aesthetic on the quality off life and anxiety. We evaluate this impact by 3
      questionnaires at 3 times during hospitalization.
