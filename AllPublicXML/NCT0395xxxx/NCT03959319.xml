      Specific Aims Significance: Intra-articular, prearthritic hip disorders (PAHD) result in
      substantial dysfunction in young adults and are proposed precursors to hip osteoarthritis
      (OA). Our long term goal is to develop effective treatment strategies for people with PAHD
      that will improve function, decrease pain and prevent or delay the onset of OA. The purpose
      of this study is to compare movement pattern training (MoveTrain) and manual therapy
      (ManTher) in their effect on post-treatment, patient-reported outcomes and targeted
      impairments thought to contribute to PAHD.

      Innovation: A clear need exists to rigorously assess treatment strategies for PAHD, therefore
      we propose to assess the effect of two rehabilitation strategies that target two distinct
      mechanisms. MoveTrain is designed to reduce stresses on the hip joint by optimizing the
      biomechanics of functional tasks through task-specific instruction. Previously, we
      demonstrated that MoveTrain resulted in improvement in patient-reported outcomes, however
      comparison to other approaches is needed. ManTher is believed to impart a neurophysiological
      response within the peripheral and central nervous system that reduces pain and improves
      mobility. While ManTher has been shown to be effective in reducing pain in patients with hip
      OA, little has been reported in PAHD. This study will address APTA's Research Agenda item II.
      &quot;to determine effectiveness and efficacy of interventions provided by physical therapists
      across relevant domains of health&quot; and item II.16, &quot;to identify contextual factors (e.g.
      personal and environmental) that affect prognosis&quot;.

      This pilot study will collect sufficient data to power a future study that will determine the
      efficacy of MoveTrain compared to ManTher for people with PAHD. Participants with PAHD will
      be randomized into one of two treatment groups, MoveTrain or ManTher. The Hip disability and
      Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS)68 will be the primary outcome measure. A measure of hip
      adduction motion during functional tasks and quantitative sensory assessment (pain pressure
      threshold and temporal summation) will be the secondary measures used to assess the effect of
      respective treatment on the impairments thought to contribute to PAHD, thus addressing the
      mechanisms of pain. Upon completion of this study, we will be positioned to implement a large
      RCT to definitively assess the efficacy of MoveTrain and ManTher to improve PAHD.

      Specific Aims: To obtain preliminary estimates of effect sizes for planning the future
      definitive randomized clinical trial,

      Aim 1 (Function): we will compare post-treatment improvements in hip-specific,
      patient-reported outcomes among the two treatment groups. After treatment completion:

      H1.1: both groups will show improvements in outcomes, but the MoveTrain group will
      demonstrate greater improvement in function (HOOS Activities of Daily Living) and symptoms
      (HOOS Symptoms) compared to the ManTher group.

      Aim 2 (Mechanism): we will compare pre- and post-treatment measures in lower extremity
      movement patterns during functional tasks (MoveTrain) and quantitative sensory testing
      (ManTher). After treatment completion:

      H2.1: the MoveTrain group will demonstrate a greater reduction in peak hip adduction angle
      during functional tasks compared to ManTher.

      H2.2: the ManTher group will demonstrate a greater increase in pain pressure threshold
      (improvement) and greater decrease in temporal summation (improvement) compared to MoveTrain.

      Aim 3 (Prognosis): we will determine the association among personal factors at baseline
      (demographic and psychosocial) and treatment prognosis (improvement in HOOS).

      H3.1: High BMI, depressive symptoms (PROMIS depression score) and more severe symptoms linked
      to central sensitization (Central Sensitization Index) will be associated with less
      improvement in HOOS after treatment.

      Impact: The lack of evidence related to rehabilitation for those with PAHD leads to
      heterogeneous rehabilitation programs that are difficult to study and compare. Our line of
      research will improve our understanding of each proposed treatment and its effect on patient
      function and each treatment's targeted impairment. This improved understanding will lead to
      the development of treatment strategies that will ultimately result in comparative
      effectiveness studies of surgical and non-surgical treatment.

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will complete self-report questionnaires and participate in a clinical examination that will include movement pattern, range of motion and quantitative sensory assessment. Participants will be randomized into one of two treatment groups, movement pattern training (MoveTrain) or manual therapy (ManTher). Both groups will participate in 10 supervised sessions within a 12 week time frame. MoveTrain will include task-specific training to optimize biomechanics during daily tasks and patient-specific tasks including work and fitness. ManTher will include select manual techniques including joint and soft tissue mobilization. Both groups will receive a home exercise program. At 13 weeks after enrollment, participants will return for testing to assess post-treatment improvements in primary and secondary outcomes. We also obtain 6 and 12 month questionnaires to assess patient outcomes.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Focus will be on task-specific training to improve lower extremity movement patterns during basic daily tasks, such as sit to stand and stairs, and reported patient-specific tasks. Patient education will include instruction in abnormal movement patterns and methods to optimize movement patterns during each task. Tasks will be prioritized based on patient-report of activity limitations during the baseline examination. For example, during the first visit, the treating physical therapist will begin with the daily and patient-specific tasks that the patient reported as being most bothersome. Exercises will include repeated practice of functional tasks using optimized movement patterns. Based on the participant's performance, the difficulty of the task-specific activities will be progressed by varying the repetitions performed, increasing the load or changing the support surface. The home program will consist of repeated practice of tasks performed during the supervised sessions.</description>

    <description>Focus will be on reducing pain and improving pain-free range of motion using manual techniques provided by the physical therapist and exercise performed in the home program. Patient education will include instruction to the benefits of manual therapy and the proposed effects on pain and joint mobility. Joint mobilizations to be used with each patient will be prioritized based on the restrictions, defined as stiffness or pain that is limiting joint range of motion, noted on the patient's baseline examination. For example, during the first visit, the treating physical therapist will begin with the two most restricted motions noted in the baseline exam and perform a standard assessment to determine treatment parameters. The home program will include joint range of motion and stretching exercises to complement techniques performed during the supervised sessions.</description>
