      The aim of the study is to compare the effectiveness and opioid sparing effects of TAP and
      OSTAP in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy were separated into 3 groups. Group 1:
      Received TAP block Group 2: Received OSTAP Group 3: No Block Standard General Anesthesia was
      induced and maintained in all patients. At the end of the operation patient controlled
      analgesia with morphine was applied to all patients.

      Pain scores were evaluated at 0,2,4,6,12,24 hours postoperatively. Total morphine consumption
      and pain scores were compared.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in postoperative pain scores throughout time evaluated by VAS</measure>
    <time_frame>Pain scores will be recorded for 24 hours postoperatively. The first measure will be taken immediately after surgery (time 0) and then at 2. 4. 6. 12. 24. hours.</time_frame>
    <description>Pain scores are going to be evaluated via VAS score. The VAS score will be scored between 0-10. 0 points is defined as no pain and 10 points is the most severe pain imaginable by the patient. A higher VAS score reflects a poor pain control.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in opioid Sparing effect measured through morphine amount delivered by a patient controlled analgesia device.</measure>
    <time_frame>The amount of Morphine demanded by the patient will be recorded for 24 hours postoperatively. The first measure will be taken immediately after surgery (time 0) and then at 2. 4. 6. 12. 24. hours.</time_frame>
