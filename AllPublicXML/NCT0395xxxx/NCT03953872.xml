  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A cohort of hypertension patients undergoing elective non-cardiac surgery was constructed to
      investigate current status of antihypertensive drug treatment in non-cardiac surgical
      population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Perioperative changes in blood pressure (BP) are associated with perioperative risks.
      However, there is little information regarding the current status of antihypertensive
      treatment in non-cardiac surgical population. A cohort of 351 hypertension patients aged
      between 18 to 85-year old undergoing elective non-cardiac surgery was constructed to
      investigate the application of antihypertensive drugs, systemic involvement, perioperative
      hemodynamics and internal environment to grasp the perioperative impact of different
      antihypertensive drugs, and to further provide a reference for the preoperative
      antihypertensive strategy of surgery patients.
