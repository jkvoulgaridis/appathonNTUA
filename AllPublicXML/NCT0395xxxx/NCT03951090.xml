      This study prospectively evaluates the impact of geriatric assessment reporting in real-time

      This study evaluates the impact of geriatric assessment reporting in real-time (GARRT) on key
      hospital based outcomes in non-electively hospitalized older (&gt; 70 years) adults with cancer.
      Participants will be randomly assigned to the GARRT group, or the control group. All
      participants will fill out user friendly questionnaire called the geriatric assessment. The
      results of the geriatric assessment will be given to the physicians of participants in the
      GARRT group in real-time. The physicians of participants in the control group will not
      receive real time results.

      This study will compare the referral rates of participants in each group to determine if
      providing real-time results of the geriatric assessment impact referral rates.
