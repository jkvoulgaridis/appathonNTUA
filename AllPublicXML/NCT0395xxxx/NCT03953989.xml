  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To demonstrate the efficacy of ranolazine in improving coronary microvascular and diastolic
      dysfunction in patients affected by HCM evaluating changes in maximum (i.e. during
      dipyridamole-induced coronary vasodilatation) myocardial blood flow (MBF) measured by PET at
      baseline and after 4 months of treatment with ranolazine in patients with non obstructive
      HCM.

      This pilot study aimed at assessing the effects of treatment with ranolazine, on top of
      optimal standard medical therapy (according to international guidelines), on microvascular
      dysfunction using PET in patients with HCM.

      Thirty months of enrolment are foreseen. Patients enrolled in the study, at the end of the
      titration phase will be treated with ranolazine 750 mg or 500 mg, 1 oral tablet twice a day
      for 4 months on top of standard of care treatment. Visit 0,1,2,3 may be performed 3 days
      before or 3 days after the planned date. Visit 4 and final PET scan may be performed 15 days
      before or 15 days after the planned date.

      This is a superiority study. The sample size calculation is based on the ANOVA model, but the
      statistical analysis will be performed applying the ANCOVA model for the absence of data on
      the correlation between basal and end of study values of the primary variable studied. As
      previously reported (Camici et al. J Am Coll Cardiol 1991; 17:879-86) maximum (i.e. during
      dipyridamole stress) MBF is severely blunted in HCM (1.63±0.58 mL/min/g) compared to control
      subjects (2.99±1.06 mL/min/g). For the primary end-point of the study using a two-sided test
      at 5% significance level, with a power of 90% and a SD of ± 0.7 mL/min/gr, in order to detect
      a change of 0.5 mL/min/gr in maximum MBF before and after treatment, 24 patients valid per
      protocol are required.
