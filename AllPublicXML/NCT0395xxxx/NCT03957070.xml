      Evaluate the feasibility of the Liver Incyte system for liver elasticity measurement in
      healthy volunteers and patients with liver fibrosis. To evaluate the discriminatory ability
      of elasticity measurements generated by Liver Incyte for healthy volunteers versus patients
      with liver fibrosis in comparison to FibroScan measurements.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective, open label, feasibility and validation study of the Liver Incyte
      system in patients with liver fibrosis (Cohort 1, n = 150) and healthy volunteers (Cohort 2,
      n = 50), for a total of 200 participants. The physician operator of the FibroScan, and the
      operator of the Shear wave vibro-elastography (S-WAVE) system, will not be blinded to the
      clinical diagnoses of the patients. All patients will undergo the testing with both FibroScan
      and Liver Incyte system at a single in-clinic visit.

      The liver stiffness of each participant will be assessed with the Liver Incyte Model B device
      and with FibroScan. The elasticity measurements from these two devices will be the primary
      outcome measure.

      The Liver Incyte system is designed as two models with differences in the ultrasound
      components only, description of the two models is below. Two sub-studies are included in this
      design as exploratory objectives. Model B will be utilized at all study sites and all study
      participants. Participants at the LAIR study site will also be evaluated using Model A, as
      well as Model B, for verification and to confirm consistency between designs. Participants
      will have the option to participate in the Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE) and Proton
      Density Fat Fraction (PDFF) portion of the study. MRE/PDFF is an optional procedure, which
      makes up a sub-study for this trial, this would require approximately 1 hour, and is open to
      any participant who is willing and has time for the extra study visit. The results of the
      MRE/PDFF sub-study will be included as an exploratory objective.

    <description>The discriminatory ability of elasticity measurements generated by Liver Incyte for healthy volunteers versus patients with liver fibrosis in comparison to FibroScan measurements.
An receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve using final Liver Incyte elasticity measurement as a predictor of healthy versus fibrotic (HCV/NASH) will be constructed with accompanying 95% confidence interval for the area under the curve (AUC). The AUC and 95% confidence intervals for the FibroScan device will be calculated.</description>
