    <textblock>
      To observe the clinical efficacy and safety of three methods for the treatment of primary
      dysmenorrhea. Establish an integrated biomarker index system for the evaluation of the
      efficacy of traditional Chinese medicine, western medicine and Low-level Light Therapy for
      the treatment of primary dysmenorrhea, and further explore the mechanism and therapeutic
      material basis of the three treatment methods for the treatment of primary dysmenorrhea

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      480 women clinically diagnosed of primary dysmenorrhea will be enrolled from nationwide
      multi-centers. Blood samples were collected from 480 patients before and after treatment (1
      experimental group, 3 control groups, treatment cycle of 3 menstrual cycles, follow-up cycle
      of 5 menstrual cycles), Metabonomics study, and integration of clinical sample information
      (Serum biochemical indicators, imaging indicators, etc.), through bioinformatics to establish
      a comprehensive biomarker index system for the evaluation of the efficacy of traditional
      Chinese medicine, Western medicine and Low-level Light Therapy instrument Methods for the
      treatment of primary dysmenorrhea and its therapeutic basis.

    <measure>Visual Analogue Scale,VAS</measure>
    <time_frame>about 30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Visual Analogue Scale/Score (VAS): Draw a 10 cm horizontal line on the paper. The degree of pain is indicated by the line segment，One end of the horizontal line is 0, indicating no pain; the other end is 10, indicating severe pain; the middle part indicates different degrees of pain（the mild pain is 1-3, the moderate is 4-6, the severity is 7-9），The patient chooses the value that can represent the degree of pain.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire-2, SF-MPQ-2</measure>
    <time_frame>about 30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire-2(SF-MPQ-2), By this scale, we can evaluate the different types of pain and the emotional effects of PD. It has 22 entries. These 22 entries include: Jumping pain, shooting pain, knife-like pain, sharp pain, cramping and dragging pain, constant biting pain, hot burning pain, sore pain, falling pain, slightly pressing pain, tearing pain, exhaustion - weakness, disgusting, fear, Torture - punishment, electric shock, cold pain, puncture pain, pain caused by gentle touch, itching, pin and needles pain, numbness. Each entry scored &quot;0~10&quot; points, the minimum score is 0,the maximum score is 10,a total of 11 levels. &quot;0&quot; indicates that never have this pain or symptom, &quot;10&quot; represents that this pain or feel is severe,&quot;1-9&quot; indicates different degrees of this type of pain or symptom. At last, Calculate the total score of all 22 items.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>the COX menstrual symptom scale，CMSS</measure>
    <time_frame>about 30 days</time_frame>
    <description>the COX menstrual symptom scale (CMSS), this score evaluate the level of PD from the two aspects of dysmenorrhea symptoms: the duration and severity , It has 17 entries including: cramps , nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, headaches, backaches, leg aches, dizziness, weakness, diarrhea, facial blemishes, abdominal pain, flushing, general aching, depression, irritability, nervousness. Each entry scored &quot;0~4&quot; points, different score represents different duration or severity of corresponding symptoms : for the duration, 0 indicates never have this symptom, 1 means lasting less 3 hours, 2 means lasting 3~7 hours, 3 means 7~24 hours, 4 means more than 24 hours. as for the severity,0 indicates no pain; the mild is 1, the moderate is 2, the severity is 3, the extreme severity is 4. Then, Calculate the score of the duration and severity of all 17 items respectively, lastly, sum the total score of the duration and severity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Menstrual flow graph analysis table</measure>
    <time_frame>about 30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Through this form, we can know about the menstrual period and menstrual flow before and after treatment:
Mild: blood stained area ≤ 1/3 of the entire sanitary napkin area; Moderate: blood stained area accounts for 1/3-3/5 of the entire sanitary napkin area; Severe: The blood stained area is basically the entire sanitary napkin. Blood clot area &lt;1 dollar coin, which is a small blood clot; The blood clot area is ≥1 yuan coin, which is a large blood clot. fill in the number of sanitary napkins used in the appropriate space according to the degree of blood stain or the amount of the blood clot on each sanitary napkin discarded.</description>

    <measure>Uterine artery Pulsation index</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Determination of uterine artery hemodynamics, can reflect the state of uterine blood circulation, the higher the uterine artery pulsation index, the decrease of blood flow, the lower the uterine artery pulsation index, the increase of blood flow or neo-vascularization</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Uterine artery Resistance index</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Determination of uterine artery hemodynamics, can reflect the state of uterine blood circulation, the higher the uterine artery resistance index, indicating less blood supply to uterine, the lower the uterine artery resistance index, the increased blood supply to uterine.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Uterine artery Systolic peak and diastolic peak ratio</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The greater the ratio of uterine artery systolic peak to diastolic peak, indicating that the end-diastolic blood flow velocity is small and the peripheral resistance is large; conversely, the blood flow velocity is large and the peripheral resistance is small.</description>
