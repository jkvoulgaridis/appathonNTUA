    <textblock>
      This is a prospective observational study to the aim of investigating the effectiveness and
      safety of integrative Korean medicine treatment (generally consisting of herbal medicine,
      Chuna manual medicine, bee venom pharmacopuncture and pharmacopuncture, acupuncture,
      electroacupuncture, and cupping) in cervical disc herniation patients with neck pain or
      cervical radiculitis diagnosed by cervical MRI and clinical symptoms including cervical
      radiculopathy at 4 locations of Jaseng Hospital of Korean Medicine (Gangnam, Bucheon,
      Daejeon, Haeundae) as assessed through of pain, functional disability, work loss, and quality
      of life patient-reported outcomes with a 5-year follow-up period

    <description>The Short Form (36) Health Survey is a 36-item, patient-reported survey of patient health. The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.</description>
