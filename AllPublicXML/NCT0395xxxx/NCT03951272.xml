          4. Patients are willing and able to sign Informed Consent Form (ICF) to join this
             clinical trial.

        Related to lesions:

          1. Target lesion is cerebral and cerebellum dura mater defect closure, intracranial
             hypertension remission;

          2. Surgical wound classification is Class I/sterile operation and risk index category
