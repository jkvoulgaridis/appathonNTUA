  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study aiming to assess the shape of the neck in adults. In addition the
      study will look at the shape of the neck in a spinal collar and the comfort while wearing a
      spinal collar.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to compare baseline scans of the neck in those aged 18yrs and older to
      a second neck scan where the participant is wearing a spinal collar. Experts will analyse the
      scans for measurements of angulations. In addition the study will collect demographic data
      and results from a validated patient questionnaire assessing comfort wearing the spinal
      collar.

      The hypothesis:

        1. The shape of the neck is different when comparing the young and old populations

        2. The spinal collar does not alter the shape of the spine

        3. The spinal collars are uncomfortable in the elderly population

             unable to hear the researcher with hearing aids if required. Severe visual impairment
             will be defined as being unable to read the patient information sheet even with visual
             aids.

          4. Persons unable to understand the information leaflet in English.

          5. Those with current neck pain, known previous C-spine injury or known medical condition
             affecting the spine.

          6. Persons who do not pass the safety questionnaire to undergo an MRI scan

          7. Persons who are unable to tolerate an MRI scan due to claustrophobia

          8. Persons who are unable to transfer to the scanner table independently

          9. Persons unable to lie flat and still for 10 minutes

         10. Persons who do not give consent to the GP (General Practitioner) being informed of
