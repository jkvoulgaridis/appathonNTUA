  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study involves a two-part design. Part 1 is designed to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of the 4 drug (HLX10+HLX04+carboplatin+pemetrexed). Part 2 is a randomized,
      open-label study, which will evaluate the safety and efficacy of HLX10 in combination with
      carboplatin+pemetrexed with or without HLX04(biosimilar of avastin) compared with treatment
      with carboplatin+pemetrexed in 1st line Stage IIIB/IIIC or IV non-squamous NSCLC.
      Participants will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to Arm A
      (HLX10+HLX04+Carboplatin+Pemetrexed), Arm B (HLX10+Carboplatin+Pemetrexed), or Arm C
      (Carboplatin+Pemetrexed).
