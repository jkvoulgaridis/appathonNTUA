  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In order to evaluate the efficacy of Serenno Medical Automatic Urine Output measuring device
      we will perform a non inferiority of study device in compare with Urinometer (with acceptance
      of 3% standard deviation), in patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit after cardiac
      surgery.

      Secondary endpoints are to attribute and Identify urine output changes prior to early stage
      acute renal failure, and identifying urine output changes prior to fluid overload or
      dehydration.
