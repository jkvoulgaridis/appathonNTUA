  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The sudy purpose is to investigate efficacy and safety of percutaneous endovascular aortic
      aneurysm repair using INCRAFT stent graft for Korean patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm.
      This study is designed as an investigator-initiated, multi-center, single-arm, prospective
      registry study. A total of 100 patients who meet all inclusion criteria, but none of
      exclusion criteria will be enrolled after the implantation of INCRAFT stent graft. The
      primary efficacy outcome is technical success defined as successful deployment of the
      stent-graft with no type I/III endoleak, unintentional coverage of visceral aortic branches
      or internal iliac arteries at the end of the procedure, and with successful removal of the
      delivery system. The primary safety outcome is major vascular complications at 30 days
      including. The study subjects will be followed for 12 months.
