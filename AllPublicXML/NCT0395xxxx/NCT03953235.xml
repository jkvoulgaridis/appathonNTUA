  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the dose, safety, immunogenicity and early clinical
      activity of GRT-C903 and GRT-R904, a neoantigen-based therapeutic cancer vaccine, in
      combination with immune checkpoint blockade, in patients with advanced or metastatic
      non-small cell lung cancer, microsatellite stable colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, and
      shared neoantigen-positive tumors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tumors harboring non-synonymous deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) mutations can present peptides
      containing these mutations as non-self antigens in the context of HLA on the tumor cell
      surface. A fraction of mutated peptides result in neoantigens capable of generating T-cell
      responses that exclusively target tumor cells. Some of these tumor-specific neoantigens are
      known or expected to be common across a subset of patients and are called shared neoantigens.
      This study aims to target shared neoantigens using a heterologous prime/boost therapeutic
      vaccine approach (GRT-C903 first followed by GRT-R904) in combination with checkpoint
      blockade to stimulate an immune response. This study will explore the safety and early
      clinical activity of this neoantigen-based immunotherapy intended to induce T-cell responses
      specific for the shared neoantigens contained within the therapeutic vaccine. Phase 1 will
      test multiple doses and combinations with checkpoint blockade and Phase 2 will test for early
      signs of clinical activity using a vaccine regimen based on Phase 1 data.
