  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 2016, the number of discoveries of HIV seropositivity is estimated at about 6000 in
      France. Men who have sex with men (MSM) account for 44% of these infections (68% in the
      Occitanie region). For the past ten years, there have been new practices of sexual drug use
      among MSM referred to as Chemsex. These practices expose to sexual risks but also to those
      related to the consumption of drugs making this population more at risk to get infectious
      contaminations. In the &quot;PREVAGAY study&quot; conducted in Montpellier in 2015, about 30% of MSM
      included said they had consumed at least one psychoactive product before or during sex during
      the last 12 months. In addition, this percentage was significantly higher among HIV-positive
      men (51% versus 24% of HIV-negative men) and 1% (N = 9) had practiced Slam (Sexual
      Injection). The results of this study also showed that PreP (Prophylaxis Pre-exposure to HIV)
      was known by 52% of MSM included and 4% (N = 4) had already used it in the last 12 months.
      Several observations are needed: many ChemSex users do not use the PreP despite the fact that
      its effectiveness has been proven in many studies.

      The social sciences have been studying the HIV epidemic since its emergence. In the era of
      HIV chronic disease, the sociologist Gabriel Girard wanted to question the pessimistic
      observation of epidemiological studies in his thesis work. Some contradictory logics explains
      this epidemiology of HIV which is maintained, particularly in Montpellier despite the arrival
      of the PreP.

      The main objective of our study is to explore the reflexive logic structuring the report to
      HIV prevention by MSM practicing ChemSex in Montpellier, in the context of the appearance and
      dissemination of the PreP.
