  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the proposed study, the investigators will aim to develop and pilot a Magnetic Resonance
      (MR) imaging protocol and assess its ability to achieve the following: quantification of
      tumour burden and bone loss, detecting longitudinal changes in tumour load with therapy and
      detecting longitudinal changes in microarchitecture with therapy. The investigators also aim
      to investigate whether bone loss is better, worse or the same with different imaging
      techniques. This will be investigated by correlating the DXA imaging data with
      Diffusion-Weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DWMRI) to see if it is possible to achieve
      quantifiable data of bone density.

      In the proposed study, the investigators will aim to develop and pilot a Magnetic Resonance
      (MR) imaging protocol and assess its ability to achieve the following: quantification of
      tumour burden and bone loss, detecting longitudinal changes in tumour load with therapy and
      detecting longitudinal changes in microarchitecture with therapy. The investigators also aim

      techniques. This will be investigated by correlating the DXA imaging data with
      Diffusion-Weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DWMRI) to see if it is possible to achieve
      quantifiable data of bone density.

      Using the expertise of the Oxford Centre For Clinical Magnetic Resonance Research (OCMR) for
      imaging protocol development, and the new Fine Structural Analysis (FSA, Osteotronix Ltd,
      formerly Acuitas Medical) bone density quantification MRI method (Rafferty et al 2016), the
      investigators will test a single protocol which combines three emerging experimental imaging
      sequences into a simple, non‐invasive whole body imaging protocol to quantify disease burden
      and bone disease. This has never been done before; if shown to be feasible, such a method
      would have two important applications: to precisely guide commissioned therapies in the
      clinic, so improving patient management; and as an exciting, novel research tool for the
      longitudinal combined assessment of tumour burden and cancer‐induced bone disease in response
      to therapy.

      The investigators hypothesize that this imaging tool will be superior to the combined current
      standard-of-care investigations in the quantification of tumour burden and bone loss. There
      are currently no tools available for quantifying structural changes to bone and overall bone
      loss in myeloma.

    <description>All imaging will be repeated at 6 months. The scans will be analysed to see the difference in number of tumour sites before and after therapy (at baseline and at six months). Scans at both time points will be compared to see the difference in ADC, total spinal 'hole' volume, total spine 'collapse' volume and the trabecular wall thickness.</description>

The EQ-5D assess the mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety and depression via 3 options ranging from 'no problems' to 'unable to do/extreme pain/anxious'. The second part of the EQ-5D assess health on a scale where 100 is the best and 0 is the worst.</description>
