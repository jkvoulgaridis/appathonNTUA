  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The benefits of Therapeutic Patient Education (TPE) have long been proven, but its
      implementation remains insufficient. It is only accessible to a part of the population and is
      too often limited to the acquisition of knowledge. TPE consists of supporting the patient in
      making decisions about his or her health, managing his or her life with the disease and
      treatment through the acquisition or maintenance of skills.

      Simulation is a pedagogical method of creating fictional or reconstructed environments in
      order to develop skills, know-how and abilities for which direct instruction is impossible
      for ethical, economic or technical reasons. To date, it is recommended for the development of
      caregiver skills, and has been the subject of two studies among family caregivers. It seems
      likely that simulation will add value to the methods currently used in TPE.

      To our knowledge, no studies have been conducted on simulation-based TPE (S-TPE) with
      patients.

      A consensus conference, which is a rigorous method of comparing the opinions of experts in
      TPE, simulation, patient experts and caregivers, was held in order to determine the learning
      that could be developed through simulation and the conditions of use. However, since the
      patient is a specific type of learner, we hypothesize that there may be some additional
      conditions for the use of S-TPE. And the value of this approach remains to be demonstrated.
      Since the use of S-TPE has never been studied with patients, a feasibility test would make it
      possible to evaluate, in the context of care, the possibility of its use and its acceptance
      by both patients and caregivers. This is necessary before considering a multicenter trial
      that demonstrates an interest in developing patient skills. It was decided to carry out this
      study in patients with diabetes, a condition for which TPE is a precursor. Caregivers will be
      able to objectify the advantages and limitations of using S-TPE.
