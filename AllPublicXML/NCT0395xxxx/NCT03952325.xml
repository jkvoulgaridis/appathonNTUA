  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CONTESSA TRIO is a 2-cohort, multicenter, Phase 2 study of tesetaxel, an investigational,
      orally administered taxane. In Cohort 1, approximately 90 patients (with potential expansion
      to up to 150 patients) with locally advanced or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer
      (TNBC) who have not received prior chemotherapy for advanced disease will be randomized 1:1:1
      to receive tesetaxel plus either: (1) nivolumab; (2) pembrolizumab; or (3) atezolizumab. The
      dual primary endpoints for Cohort 1 are objective response rate (ORR) and progression-free
      survival (PFS). In Cohort 2, approximately 40 elderly patients (with potential expansion to
      up to 60 patients) with HER2 negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (MBC) who
      have not received prior chemotherapy for advanced disease will receive tesetaxel monotherapy.
      The primary endpoint for Cohort 2 is ORR.

      CONTESSA TRIO is a 2-cohort, multicenter, Phase 2 study of tesetaxel, an investigational,
      orally administered taxane.

      Cohort 1:

      Approximately 90 patients (with potential expansion to up to 150 patients) with locally
      advanced or metastatic TNBC who have not received prior chemotherapy for advanced disease
      will be randomized 1:1:1 to receive tesetaxel dosed orally at 27 mg/m2 once every three weeks
      (Q3W) plus either:

        -  Nivolumab at 360 mg by intravenous infusion Q3W;

        -  Pembrolizumab at 200 mg by intravenous infusion Q3W; or

        -  Atezolizumab at 1,200 mg by intravenous infusion Q3W.

      Nivolumab and pembrolizumab (PD-1 inhibitors) and atezolizumab (a PD-L1 inhibitor) are
      immuno-oncology (IO) agents approved for the treatment of multiple types of cancer. One of
      these agents, atezolizumab, in combination with the intravenously delivered taxane,
      nab-paclitaxel, was recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a
      first-line treatment for patients with metastatic TNBC. Patients with central nervous system
      (CNS) metastases are eligible. The dual primary endpoints for Cohort 1 are ORR and PFS.
      Secondary endpoints include duration of response (DoR) and overall survival (OS).

      Cohort 2:

      Approximately 40 elderly patients (with potential expansion to up to 60 patients) with HER2
      negative MBC who have not received prior chemotherapy for advanced disease will receive
      tesetaxel monotherapy dosed orally at 27 mg/m2 Q3W. Patients with CNS metastases are
      eligible. The primary endpoint for Cohort 2 is ORR. Secondary endpoints include PFS, DoR and
      OS.
