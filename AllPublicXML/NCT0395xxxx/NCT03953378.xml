  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective study to investigate the correlation between CD39/CD73 expression by the
      different T lymphocyte subpopulations in the blood and synovial fluid (if available) into
      patients with chronic inflammatory rheumatism RA and PsA types, with the rheumatic activity,
      the background therapy (with Methotrexate (MTX)) and the response to this treatment.

    <textblock>
      Th1.17 compose a recently described subset of highly polyfunctional and thus potentially more
      harmful CD4+ effector T cells (Teff) than classical Th17 as they co-produce interferon-γ
      (IFN-γ) and interleukin-17A (IL-17A). For this reason, Th1.17 rise increasing interest in RA
      and PsA since they seem involved in their pathophysiology. Hyper activation of Teff in RA and
      PsA results partly from a deficiency in regulatory mechanisms of Teff's pro-inflammatory
      functions. The ecto-nucleotidase CD73 delineates Teff enriched in Th1.17 features and acts as
      a regulatory mechanism for these pro-inflammatory cells. Considering that MTX, usually used
      as first line treatment of RA and PsA, increases extracellular concentrations of adenosine
      monophasphate (AMP) and immunosuppressive adenosine, the investigators hypothesized that
      CD4+CD73+ T cell effector population enriched in Th1.17 and Th17 cells may participate in the
      pathogenicity of RA and PsA but also in the resistance to MTX treatment through the specific
      expression of CD73 essential for Ado generation and which is down-regulated on proliferating
      T cells.

    <description>Collection of venous blood (16 mL) and synovial fluid (when available) samples, for each patient, at inclusion and in the frame of the usual medical follow-up at 3 months and between 6 and 12 months, before the onset of MTX (untreated patients) or during the course of MTX treatment (MTX-treated patients).
Collection of anonymous healthy donors blood samples, age- and sex-matched, obtained from the Etablissement Français du Sang.
Multi-parametric Flow Cytometry analysis was performed on these samples to assess CD73 expression on total memory T cells and within T helper lymphocyte subsets, their cytokine production and AMPase functions. For FoxP3 intracellular staining, cells were treated using the FoxP3 Fixation and Permeabilization kit (Life Technologies), according to manufacturer instructions. Stainings were analyzed on a LSR-Fortessa™ (BD Biosciences) with conserved settings throughout the entire study and data were analyzed using FlowJo™ Software (Tree Star v10.4).</description>
