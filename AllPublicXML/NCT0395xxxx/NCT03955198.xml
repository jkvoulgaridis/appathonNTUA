  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a phase II, multicenter, randomized and comparative study designed to evaluate
      whether the combination of hypofractionated stereotactic radiation therapy with the
      anti-PD-L1 Durvalumab in patients with brain metastases from NSCLC (Non-Small-Cell Lung
      Carcinoma) improves brain tumor control compared to hypofractionated stereotactic radiation
      therapy alone.

      Patients will be assigned in one of the two following arms:

        -  Arm A (control arm): radiotherapy alone

        -  Arm B (Experimental arm): combined treatment radiotherapy with anti-PD-L1 durvalumab

      Total duration of treatment will be 12 months (at maximum in the experimental arm).

      Patients will be followed for a maximum of 2 years following the date of randomization.
