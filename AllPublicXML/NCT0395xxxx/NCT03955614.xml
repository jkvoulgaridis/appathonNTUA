  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The widely varied practice of surgery, alongside rapidly expanding specialised knowledge and
      evolving technology as well as the fast turnover of operating theatre staff means they often
      face unfamiliar operations, techniques and equipment. To the investigator's knowledge, there
      is no formal induction for the work undertaken specifically within the operating theatre.

      Many studies have shown that standardised practices, formal training and mental rehearsal
      improve surgical performance.

      In this context, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is expected to have vast applications in
      surgery, particularly through standardisation, clinical decision and training support as well
      as patient-centred care optimisation.

      Digital SurgeryTM developed GoSurgeryTM software to consolidate induction processes, support
      training and achieve standardised surgical practices, ultimately improving surgical
      performances and patient outcomes.

      GoSurgeryTM allows surgeons to prepare step-by-step standardised workflows of procedures,
      including equipment, tips and warnings.

      In preparation for surgery, workflows can used by operating team staff as a form of induction
      and mental rehearsal. During the surgery, using pedal-controlled tablets, relevant
      information for each step of the procedure is presented. GoSurgeryTM has developed AI
      computer vision to recognise the steps and automatically present the workflows without
      user-intervention.

      After the surgery, the AI will allow surgeons to review their performances uploaded onto a
      personal virtual Hub and compare timing of steps to their previous repository of cases, as
      well as giving them the ability to share any interesting or difficult cases, supporting
      learning opportunities and monitoring of progression.

      This feasibility study sets the bases to test the ability of GoSurgeryTM to improve induction
      processes, team performance, surgical training and patient outcomes.

      The research will compare preparedness and performance of operating staff with/without the
      use of GoSurgeryTM, through questionnaires, observational team assessments, technical
      measures and patient outcomes.

      Data will be collected at Imperial College Trust, Chelsea and Westminster Hospital and
      University College Hospital on patients undergoing general surgery. Anonymised images of
      keyhole surgery shall be analysed in collaboration with Digital SurgeryTM to develop the AI
      computer vision software.

    <textblock>
      Primary emergency and elective general surgery procedures at St Mary's Hospital, Imperial
      College Healthcare Trust, Chelsea and Westminster University Hospital Trusts and University
      College London University Hospital, under the care of participating surgical teams shall be
      considered.

      The study will be set up as a sequential cohort study, comparing the performance of surgical
      teams, before and after the introduction of GoSurgeryTM software.

      We will include three Bariatric teams from St Mary's, University Hospital and Chelsea and
      Westminster Hospitals.

      In the three cohorts, videocameras and microphones will be positioned in the operating
      theatre in order to capture all events and conversations taking place from the beginning to
      the end of each case.

      As is routine surgical practice, once the patient has been prepared for surgery, the keyhole
      (laparoscopic) camera will be connected to the laparoscopic stack to be projected onto the
      operating room screens. Recording will be started at the time of inserting the camera into
      the patient's abdomen, as is protocol.

      in the intervention phase, GoSurgeryTM workflows will be made available to the intervention
      group for preparation before the cases and will be displayed within the operating theatre
      during the operation.

      They will be controlled though pedals that allow to move backwards and forwards through the
      workflow.

      When using GoSurgeryTM with visual recognition software, the keyhole video footage shall be
      directly extracted using local transfer over a closed wired network.

      This video shall be fed into the visual recognition software algorithm. The software shall
      then recognise the specific part of the procedure being performed and display the relevant
      information on dedicated screens showing different views for different members of the team,
      eg surgeon view or scrub nurse view. Videos will be used to train the machine learning
      software to recognise the different steps of different operations so that it may then replace
      the pedal controls.

      Members of the surgical team shall be asked to complete questionnaires before and/or after
      the cases.

    <measure>Does GosurgeryTM affect teamwork?</measure>
    <time_frame>audio-video recordings of the operation shall be taken lasting the entire duration of the case from when patient enters anaesthetic room to when they exit they operating theatre. they will be scored within 1-3 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The Observational Teamwork Assessment for Surgery (OTAS) will be measured for each case, this is an assessment instrument which is used to evaluate quality of teamwork in clinical settings.OTAS distinguishes between three phases of surgery: Pre-operative, intra-operative and post-operative; and the three core operating theatre sub-teams: surgical, nursing and anaesthetic.
OTAS evaluates 5 teamwork behaviours:
Communication, Coordination, Cooperation /Back up behaviour, Leadership, Team Monitoring/ Situational Awareness.
In total OTAS generates 45 behavioural evaluations per observed surgical procedure: 5 behaviours x 3 sub-teams x 3 operative phases. These evaluations are expressed on a 0 to 6 anchored scale, with higher scores indicating higher quality teamwork.</description>

    <description>Members of the surgical team will be asked to fill out study-specific questionnaires including open questions and Likert-Style questionnaires relating to their perceived learning experience (Strongly Disagree, Tend to Disagree, Neither Agree nor Disagree, Tend to Agree, Strongly Agree).
The questionnaire will take approximately 5 minutes to complete. Operating theatre staff questionnaires will be handed out in the interventional phases after the first 3 lists and then after the 5th list and the last list.</description>

    <measure>Does GoSurgeryTM affect delays in the operating theatre?</measure>
    <time_frame>After the surgery, within 1-24 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Audio-video recordings of the surgery will be examined to measure timing of each operative step and to identify if any delays were incurred.

    <measure>Does GoSUrgeryTM affect mental demand overtime when operating?</measure>
    <time_frame>After operative cases as detailed above throughout 3 phases, approximately 4-6 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Members of the surgical team will be asked to fill out a validated SURG-TLX questionnaire assessing mental demands.
The Surgery Task Load Index (SURG-TLX) is a multidimensional rating scale that has six bipolar dimensions: Mental demands, Physical demands, Temporal demands, Task complexity, Situational stress, Distractions. These are weighted from low to high on a numerical scale, with high signifying higher perception and low lower perception, as well as in a pairwise comparisons of applicability.
The weighted scales are utilised to calculate a total workload score as well as being used individually to score each domain.
During all 3 phases, we will ask SURG-TLX questionnaire to be completed after first 3 cases of each type of surgery (eg first three sleeve gastrectomies).</description>
