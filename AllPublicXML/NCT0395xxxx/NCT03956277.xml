  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, non-randomized, non-blinded feasibility study to evaluate the
      performance, safety and tolerability of the Percutaneous Ultrasound Gastrostomy (PUG)
      procedure that utilizes a novel device in conjunction with widely available ultrasound
      technology. The procedure will be performed in 40eligible subjects. Patients will be followed
      for 2 days following performance of PUG to assess for potential complications. If the patient
      remains hospitalized they will be assessed through Day30 for potential complications.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  •Written informed consent must be obtained before any study-specific assessment is
             performed •Male or female ≥18 years of age•BMI between 20 and 30•Indication for
             gastrostomy tube placement determined to be present by the primary clinical care
             team•Patient determined to be an appropriate candidate for PEG or PUG by the study
             team•Women of childbearing potential must have negative serum or urine pregnancy test
             duringthe current hospitalization

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  •BMI &lt;20 or &gt; 30•Temperature ≥ 38 C •Systolic BP &lt; 100 or &gt; 180 mmHg•Heart Rate &lt; 50
             or &gt; 110•Presence of a contraindication to being in proximity to a magnet (e.g.
             pacemaker).•History of prior gastrostomy or gastrectomy (partial or
             complete).•Patients with hematocrit &lt;25%, or a history of blood transfusion within the
             14 days prior to screening, or active life-threatening GI bleeding. •Pregnant or
             nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a female after
             conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a positive hCG
             laboratory test. •Involvement in other investigational trials within 30 days prior to
             screening.•Any other medical condition(s) that may putthe patient at risk or influence
             study results in the investigator's opinion, or that the investigator deems unsuitable
             for the study.
