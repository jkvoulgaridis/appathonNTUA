  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this program of research is to refine and test the feasibility and
      acceptability of a newly developed mobile device-delivered app, called Mobile After-Care
      Support (MACS), to improve patients' coping and treatment adherence following a
      hospitalization related to their psychotic-spectrum disorder. The purpose of the proposed
      project is to establish the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effects of the app.
      To achieve the specific aims, the investigators will conduct a pilot randomized clinical
      trial (n = 60), with two treatment arms: MACS vs. a mobile app attention control condition.

    <measure>Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The Client Satisfaction Questionnaire is a self-report measure of patient satisfaction with treatment. The total score (sum of items) will be used and ranges from 8 to 32 with increased scores indicating greater satisfaction with treatment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The interviewer-rated Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale is a measure of psychiatric symptom severity. The total score (sum of items) will be used to assess overall severity with scores ranging from 18 to 126 and higher scores indicating greater severity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Brief Adherence Rating Scale (BARS)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The Brief Adherence Rating Scale assesses the percentage of missed medication doses over the past month. The total adherence score ranges from 0% to 100% and higher scores indicate greater adherence.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Brief Cope Inventory (Brief COPE)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The Brief Cope Inventory is a 28 item self-report measure of coping skills. The mean values will be used for the subscale scores of emotion-focused strategies, problem-focused strategies, and dysfunctional coping strategies. Mean scores for each subscale range from 1-4 with higher scores indicating greater use of the coping strategies.</description>
