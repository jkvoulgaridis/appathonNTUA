  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The sensory recovery of the breast remains an undervalued aspect of breast reconstruction and
      surgical reinnervation is not regarded as a priority by most reconstructive surgeons. A
      prospective study was conducted of all patients who underwent either innervated or
      non-innervated lateral thigh perforator (LTP) flap breast reconstruction in Maastricht
      University Medical Center and returned for follow-up between February 2016 and April 2019.
      Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments were used for sensory testing of the breast.

    <description>The sensory recovery of the breast to touch was tested at different follow-up moments after the initial surgery. Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments were used for sensory testing. Nine areas of the breast, indicating native skin and flap skin, were tested. Mean monofilament values were calculated for each area and compared between groups.</description>

        In this prospective study, patients who underwent an innervated or non-innervated LTP flap
        breast reconstruction between December 2014 and August 2018 at Maastricht University
        Medical Center in the Netherlands were included if they returned for follow-up between
        February 2016 and April 2019.
