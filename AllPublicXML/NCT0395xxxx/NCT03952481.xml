      The purpose of this study is to assess the duration of time (in weeks) for improvement in
      objective dry eye markers for people who are placed on lifitegrast 0.5% (XiidraÂ®), an
      FDA-approved therapy for dry eyes.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The change in proportion of subjects demonstrating improved tear film osmolarity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4</time_frame>
    <description>Improved tear film osmolarity will be defined as an osmolarity reading of less than or equal to 308 mOsm/L or an inter-eye difference osmolarity reading of less than or equal to 8 mOsm/L.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The proportion of subjects demonstrating normal Matrix Metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9).</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Normal MMP9 is determined by 2 blinded investigators who each independently read the test result as negative and who are in agreement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The proportion of subjects demonstrating normal Tear Break-Up Time (TBUT).</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Greater than 10 seconds is normal, 5 to 10 seconds is marginal, and less than 5 seconds is low.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The proportion of subjects demonstrating normal corneal fluorescein staining.</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Corneal staining will be assessed using the National Eye Institute Scale for corneal staining.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The proportion of subjects demonstrating improvement in their symptoms as measured by the modified SANDE Questionnaire.</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>A modified SANDE Questionnaire uses a visual analogue scale at the Baseline Visit to measure the frequency and severity of subject's dry eyes symptoms. Subsequent visit Questionnaires will use a visual analogue scale to measure the change in symptoms compare to the results of the prior visit.</description>
