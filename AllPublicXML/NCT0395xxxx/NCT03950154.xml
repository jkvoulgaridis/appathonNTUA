    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effect and safty of PD-1 monoclonal antibody-activated autologous
      peripheral blood lymphocyte (PD1-T) combined with XELOX and bevacizumab in the first-line
      treatment of recurrent and metastatic colorectal cancer. Half of participants receive PD1-T

             be in the normal range.

          8. The toxicity and side effects of previous chemotherapy will must be alleviated to
             grade 1 or below (except hair loss).If the subjects received major surgical treatment
             or radiotherapy of &gt; 30 Gy, they must recover from the toxicity or complications of
             these interventions, that is, they can be enrolled after 6 months.

             period; serum or urine pregnancy test results must be negative during screening and
             the whole study period.
