  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study investigators want to learn more about the underlying biological clock and to see if
      the timing of that clock can be estimated from a single blood sample.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is an urgent need for a practical way to assess circadian timing accurately in both
      general and sleep medicine. The study is designed to assess the levels of different
      biomarkers in the blood taken from frequent samples across three separate sleep-wake
      conditions - Conventional/Normal sleep-wake conditions (baseline), extended wake/acute sleep
      deprivation (constant routine), and during irregular sleep-wake conditions (inverted day).
      Participants will be asked to complete medical, psychological, and sleep-wake evaluations
      prior to the study. Upon completion of screening, if eligible, participants will stay 7
      consecutive days and nights in the sleep research laboratory within the hospital.

      A genetic blood sample will be collected from each participant. Candidate circadian or sleep
      genes will be directly sequenced in order to identify polymorphisms or mutations that
      associate with circadian or sleep phenotypes. Researchers may also conduct genome wide
      analysis on the DNA sample.
