  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the influence of motor imagery and the observation of actions on pain
      perception. Participants in this study are asymptomatic subjects who will perform an IM and
      AO protocol of an aerobic exercise.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Motor Imagery (MI) is defined as a dynamic mental process that involves the representation of
      an action, in an internal way, without its actual motor execution. The Action Observation
      (AO) evokes an internal, real-time motor simulation of the movements that the observer is
      perceiving visually. Both mental processes trigger the activation of the neurocognitive
      mechanisms that underlie the planning and execution of voluntary movements in a manner that
      resembles how the action is performed in a real manner. The phenomenon of exercise-induced
      hypoalgesia is well known. This is why it has been suggested that these techniques could
      produce pain modulation similar to that produced by real exercise.

    <measure>Pain pressure threshold</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline and immediately post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Pressure Pain Threshold (PPT) is one of these tests and it is defined as the minimum force applied which induces pain. The measurement shall be carried out by using an algometer (pressure device that induces mechanical stimuli) is to standardize the amount of pressure applied in the neck region. The reliability of pressure pain thresholds according to raters or measurement frequencies is relatively high</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual and Kinesthetic Motor Imagery Ability</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately before the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Visual and Kinesthetic Motor Imagery Ability will be measured with Movement Imagery Questionnaire-Revised (MIQ-R). MIQ-R has four movements repeated in two subscales, a visual and a kinesthetic one. Additionally, a score between 1 and 7 is assigned, with 1 representing difficulty in picturing the motor image or difficulty in feeling the movement previously made, and 7 representing the maximum ease. The internal consistencies of the MIQ-R have been consistently adequate with Cronbach's α coefficients ranging above 0.84 for the total scale, 0.80 for de visual subscale and 0.84 for the kinesthetic subscale (Campos &amp; González, 2010).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The degree of physical activity</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately before the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The degree of physical activity was objectified through the The International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) questionnaire, which allows the subjects to be divided into three groups according to their level of activity, which can be high, moderate, and low or inactive. The IPAQ consists of 7 questions about the frequency, duration and intensity of activity (moderate and intense) performed in the last seven days, as well as walking and sitting time on a workday. The IPAQ scoring protocol assigns the following MET values to walking, moderate, and vigorous intensity activity: 3.3 METs, 4.0 METs, and 8.0 METs, respectively.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Kinesiophobia</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately before the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Fear of movement or kinesiophobia will be quantified with the Spanish version of the Kinesiophobia Tampa Scale (TSK-11). This instrument demonstrates reliability and validity in patients with chronic pain, being shorter than the original scale. The total score ranges from 11 to 44 points, with the highest scores indicating greater fear of a new injury due to movement</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Electrodermal Activity</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in electrodermal activity after 5 minutes post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Electrodermal Activity will be measured through the use of two electrodes that recorded changes in conductance through the skin located at the back of the dominant hand</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Respiration Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in electrodermal activity after 5 minutes post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Respiration Rate will be measured through a pressure transducer located in the centre of the chest, where it was fixed by a strap</description>

    <measure>Respiration Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in electrodermal activity after 5 minutes post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Heart Rate will be measured by three electrodes located in the left area of the chest. One of the electrodes was placed in the middle zone while a second electrode was positioned on the lateral side, and a third one on the lower left side, below the first electrode.</description>
