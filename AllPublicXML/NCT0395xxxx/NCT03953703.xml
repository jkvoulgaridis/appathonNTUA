    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effectiveness of levocarnitine in the treatment of dry eye in adults
      with Sjogren's syndrome. This will be a crossover study design with all participants
      receiving both levocarnitine and placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A phenome wide association study (PheWAS) was conducted for variants in the SLC22A5 gene
      encoding the OCTN2 protein. OCTN2 is a cell membrane protein that transports carnitine into
      the cell. The carnitine supplement levocarnitine, FDA approved for human use and with a
      favorable safety profile, was identified for repurposing. SLC22A5/OCTN2 are a class of sodium
      ion dependent, high affinity transmembrane proteins expressed in the heart, liver, muscle,
      and kidney among other tissues. The screen identified &quot;sicca syndrome&quot; (OR 4.56; P = 5.6E-04)
      as well as various other eye diseases as the most significantly associated phenotypes. Sicca
      syndrome is defined as dryness of the exocrine glands, particularly the eyes
      (keratoconjunctivitis sicca) and mouth (xerostomia). This condition is most often caused by
      Sjogren's syndrome (SjS), a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by lymphocytic
      infiltration of the lacrimal and salivary glands.

      Interestingly, carnitine is present in considerable quantities in the tears of normal,
      healthy eyes, and studies have shown a decrease in the tear carnitine levels of dry eye
      patients. Furthermore, eyedrop preparations containing l-carnitine have shown benefit in dry
      eye disease. The overall hypothesis is that OCTN2 dysfunction underlies keratoconjunctivitis
      sicca in SjS patients and that oral supplementation with levocarnitine may be beneficial.

    <measure>Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) was developed by the Outcomes Research Group (Allergan Inc.) in 1997 as an assessment of symptoms (functional, limitations, and environmental) of dry eye disease and their effect on vision. It is a 12-item list, with each item compromised of a five category Likert-like response option (see Appendix D). of 24 different clinical and laboratory variables/disease descriptors, comprising nine organ systems. Scores of the descriptors range from 1 to 8, and the total possible score for all descriptors is 105. Regression models are applied to assign relative weights to each parameter.</description>

    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The EULAR Sjogren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI) is a systemic disease activity index that was designed to measure disease activity in patients with primary SjS developed in 2009. It is a score than has been developed by consensus of experts from European and North American countries and it supported by the EULAR. The ESSDAI includes 12 domains (cutaneous, renal, articular, muscular, peripheral nervous system, hematological, glandular, constitutional, lymphadenopathic, biological) each of which is divided into 3-4 levels of activity.</description>

    <description>The EULAR Sjogren's Syndrome Patient Reported Index (ESSPRI) is a patient-administered questionnaire to asses patients' symptoms.

    <measure>EULAR Sicca Score</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The EULAR sicca score is a measure of overall severity of dryness experienced by the patients. Ocular, oral, cutaneous, nasal, tracheal, and vaginal dryness is reported on a scale of 1-10. The final ESS score is calculated as follows: (2 x oral dryness + ocular dryness) / 3.</description>

    <description>The Schirmer's tear test is used to determine if the tear glands produce enough tears to keep the eyes moist. Strips of filter paper are placed within the lower eyelid for a period of time. Wetting of the filter paper is measured in millimeters.</description>

    <measure>Fluorescein staining</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Staining with fluorescein is used to characterize dry eye disease, assess severity, and monitor response to therapy. It is graded using the Oxford scale which consists of a chart containing a series of panels labeled A-E in order of increasing severity. Staining is represented by punctate dots, and the number of dots increases by one log unit from panel A to B and by 0.5 log units between panels B to E. To grade, comparisons are made between the panels and the appearance of staining on the conjunctiva and cornea of the patient.</description>
