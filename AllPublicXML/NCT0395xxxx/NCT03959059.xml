      The study is to prospectively assess the outcome of PKP assisted with and without MR
      technology in treatment of OVCF with IVC. Forty cases of OVCF with IVC undergoing PKP were
      randomized into a MR technology assisted group (group A) and a traditional C-arm fluoroscopy
      group (group B). Both groups were performed PKP and evaluated by VAS scores, ODI scores,
      radiological evidence of vertebral body height and kyphotic angle(KA) at pre-operation and
      post-operation. The volume of injected cement and Operation time was recorded. And whether
      cement touching both endplates or not(non-PMMA-endplates-contact, NPEC) in radiological
      evidence were also recorded postoperatively. The clinical outcomes and complications were
      evaluated afterwards. All patients received 10 to 14 months' follow-up, with an average of 12
      months.

    <measure>Oswestry Disability Index</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Oswestry Disability Index is for movement function, Questionnaire examines perceived level of disability in everyday activities of daily living. The ODI score (index) is calculated as: For example: If all 10 sections are completed, the score is calculated as follows: if 16 (total scored) out of 50 (total possible score) x 100 = 32%; If one section is missed (or not applicable), the score is calculated: If 16 (total scored) / 45 (total possible score) x 100 = 35.5%.</description>
