    <textblock>
      Introduction:

      Major depression is a highly prevalent pathology that is currently the second most common
      cause of disease-induced disability in our society. The onset and continuation of depression
      may be related to a wide variety of biological and psychosocial factors, many of which are
      linked to different lifestyle aspects. Therefore, health systems must design and implement
      health promotion and lifestyle modification programs, taking into account personal factors
      and facilitators. The main objective of this work is to analyze the utility and
      cost-effectiveness of an adjunctive treatment program for subclinical, mild or moderate
      depression in Primary Care patients, based on healthier lifestyle recommendations. Secondary
      objectives include the analysis of the effectiveness of the intervention in comorbid chronic
      pathology and the measurement of the influence of personal factors on lifestyle modification.

      Methods and analysis:

      A randomized, multicenter pragmatic clinical trial with 3 parallel groups consisting of
      primary healthcare patients suffering from subclinical, mild or moderate depression. The
      following interventions will be used: 1. Usual antidepressant treatment with psychological
      advice and/or psychotropic drugs prescribed by the General Practitioner (treatment-as-usual,
      TAU). 2. TAU + Lifestyle Modification Program (LMP). A program to be imparted in 6 weekly
      90-minute group sessions, intended to improve the following aspects: behavioral activation +
      daily physical activity + adherence to the Mediterranean diet pattern + sleep hygiene +
      careful exposure to sunlight. 3. TAU + LMP + ICTs: healthy lifestyle recommendations (TAU+LMP
      intervention) + monitoring using ICTs (a wearable smartwatch). The primary outcome will be
      the depressive symptomatology and the secondary outcomes will be the quality of life, the use
      of health and social resources, personal variables related to program adherence (patient
      activation in their own health, self-efficacy, sense of coherence, health literacy and
      procrastination) and chronic comorbid pathology. Data will be collected before and after the
      intervention, with 6- and 12-month follow-ups.

    <measure>Beck II Self-Applied Depression Inventory (BDI-II)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline, immediately after the intervention and at six and 12-month follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome will be measured using the BDI-II (Beck et al., 1996). This is a self-report inventory for measuring the severity of depression, consisting of 21 multiple-choice questions with each answer being scored on a scale ranged from 0 to 3. It was translated and validated into Spanish with a reliability of .89 (Sanz et al., 2005). The standardized cutoffs are: 0-13: minimal depression; 14-19: mild depression; 20-28: moderate depression; 29-63: severe depression.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Comorbidity with chronic diseases</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline, immediately after the intervention and at six and 12-month follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>Comorbidity with chronic diseases will be determined according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) (WHO, 2010): diabetes (glucose concentration (mg/dl), glycated hemoglobin (%), creatinine), arterial hypertension and diseases of lipid metabolism. In patients with chronic heart disease, coagulation variables will be added. They will be collected from the last blood test or control measurements of the clinical history, taken by their general practitioner (GP) or nurse (assuming they were taken over the past 3 months). Otherwise, their GP will be asked for a blood control test. It is estimated that approximately 50% of these patients will present some comorbidity (Katon, 2003). Anthropometric measures will also be collected (weight, size and perimeter of the waist).</description>

    <measure>European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline, immediately after the intervention and at six and 12-month follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>Health-related quality of life will be measured using the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D) (Brooks &amp; De Charro, 1996; The EuroQol Group, 1990). EQ-5D scores will be used to calculate the quality-adjusted life year (QALY) during the monitoring period by adjusting the length of time affected by the health result by the utility value. It contains five health dimensions (mobility, selfcare, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression) and each of these has three levels (no problems, slight problems or moderate and severe problems). The EQ records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale of 20 centimeters (VAS). The VAS can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome that reflect the patient's own judgment. Patients mark the point on the vertical line that best reflects their assessment of their current global health status (Badia, Roset, Montserrat, Herdman, &amp; Segura, 1999).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical activity questionnaire (IPAQ-SF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline, immediately after the intervention and at six and 12-month follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>Physical activity will be measured using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form (IPAQ-SF) (Kim, Park, &amp; Kang, 2013). It assesses the levels of habitual physical activity over the last 7 days. It has 7 items and records the activity of four intensity levels: vigorous-intensity activity, moderate-intensity activity (walking and sitting). We will use the validated Spanish version (Roman-Viñas et al., 2010). IPAQ-SF has acceptable validity for the measurement of total and vigorous physical activity and poor validity for moderate activity and good reliability (Kurtze, Rangul, &amp; Hustvedt, 2008).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline, immediately after the intervention and at six and 12-month follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>Measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) (Buysse, Reynolds, Monk, Berman, &amp; Kupfer, 1989). To measure sleep quality and patterns in adults. It differentiates between &quot;poor&quot; and &quot;good&quot; sleep by measuring seven domains: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleep medication, and daytime dysfunction over the past month. It consists of 19 self-applied questions and 5 questions that request the evaluation of the patient's bedmate or roommate (these are not scored). Answers range from 0 (no difficulty) to 3 (severe difficulty). The overall score ranges from 0 to 21 points. In its Spanish version, the Cronbach's alpha coefficient is .81, sensitivity of 88.63% and specificity of 74.99%. We will use the validated Spanish version (Royuela Rico &amp; Macías Fernández, 1997).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Activation Questionnaire (PAM) in relation to the management of their health</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline, immediately after the intervention and at six and 12-month follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>Measured using the Patient Activation Questionnaire (PAM) with regard to the management of their health. It evaluates the patient's perceived knowledge, skills, and confidence to engage in self-management activities. It has 13 items, a Likert scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree). The resulting score (between 0 and 100) places the individual at one of four levels of activation, each of which reveals insight into a range of health-related characteristics, including behaviors and outcomes. Higher scores indicate higher levels of activation (Hibbard et al., 2004). This scale is only validated in Spanish for chronic patients. It had an item separation index for the parameters of 6.64 and a reliability of .98 (Moreno Chico, González de Paz, Monforte Royo, Navarro Rubio, &amp; Gallart Fernández Puebla, 2018).</description>

    <measure>Social support questionnaire (MOS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline, immediately after the intervention and at six and 12-month follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>It will be measured by the Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey (MOS-SS) (Sherbourne &amp; Stewart, 1991). It is a self-report instrument consisting of four subscales (emotional/informational, tangible, affectionate, and positive social interaction) and an overall functional social support index. It has a good reliability (Cronbach's alpha ≥ .91) and is quite stable over time. It has 19 items, a five-point Likert scale. Higher scores indicate more support. We will use the Spanish validated version (de la Revilla-Ahumada L, Luna del Castillo J, &amp; Bailón Muñoz E, 2005).</description>

    <description>Measured using by the Self-Efficacy Scale (Sherer et al., 1982). To measure General Self-Efficacy subscale (17 items including individuals' beliefs in their ability to perform well in a variety of situations) and Social Self-Efficacy subscale (6 items). It contains 23 items that are rated on a 14-point scale (ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree). Higher scores indicate higher levels of self-efficacy. It has a Cronbach coefficient alpha of .86 for General Self-efficacy subscale and .71 for the Social Self-efficacy subscale. The unpublished Spanish version was translated by Godoy in 1990 (Lopez-Torrecillas, García, Cañadas, Ramirez Ucles, &amp; de la Fuente, 2006).</description>
