  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is looking to find out if the combination of Ipatasertib with Aromatase
      inhibitor or Fulvestrant can be an effective treatment for breast cancer.

  <detailed_description>

      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational
      drug and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drug to use for
      further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.

      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved ipatasertib as a treatment for
      any disease.

      The FDA has approved fulvestrant, the aromatase inhibitors, and palbociclib as treatment
      options for this disease.

      This research study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of ipatasertib in combination
      with an aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant with or without palbociclib.

      Resistance to standard of care treatment for people with your type of cancer is common.
      Stopping (inhibiting) an enzyme called Akt in the cancer cells may overcome resistance to the
      standard of care treatment. Ipatasertib is a type of inhibitor that is believed to work by
      inhibiting Akt. Through the different combinations of ipatasertib and the standard of care
      drugs, the chance of cancer cells becoming resistant to the standard of care drugs may
      decrease, causing the cancer cells to stop growing and spreading.

    <description>Letrozole is an aromatase inhibitor. This means it blocks the enzyme aromatase (found in the body's muscle, skin, breast and fat), which is used to convert androgens (hormones produced by the adrenal glands) into estrogen. In the absence of estrogen, tumors dependent on this hormone for growth will shrink.</description>

    <description>Palbociclib (Ibrance®) is a drug that can be used along with an aromatase inhibitor to treat women with advanced hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. Palbociclib is a reversible small molecule cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor. The drug blocks proteins in the cell called cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4 and CDK 6. In hormone positive breast cancer cells, blocking these proteins helps stop the cells from dividing to make new cells. It helps prevent the cells from moving from G1 to S cell cycle phase in the division process. This slows cancer growth.</description>

             month, and patient is not actively taking steroids.

          -  Participants who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not

          -  Treatment with strong CYP3A inhibitors or strong CYP3A inducers within 14 days or 5
             drug-elimination half-lives, whichever is longer, prior to initiation of study
             treatment. Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important
             to regularly consult a frequently-updated list such as
             http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/table.aspx; medical reference texts such as
             the Physicians' Desk Reference may also provide this information. As part of the
             enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of
             interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be
             prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal
             product.

          -  Uncontrolled inter-current illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements. Patient has impairment of gastrointestinal (GI) function or GI
             disease that may significantly alter the absorption of the study drugs (e.g.,
             inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative diseases, uncontrolled nausea, vomiting,
             diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome, or small bowel resection).

          -  Clinically significant, uncontrolled heart disease and/or cardiac repolarization
             abnormality including any of the following:

               -  History of angina pectoris, symptomatic pericarditis, coronary artery bypass
                  graft (CABG) or myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to study entry.

               -  Documented cardiomyopathy.

               -  History of cardiac failure, significant/symptomatic bradycardia, Long QT
                  syndrome, family history of idiopathic sudden death or congenital long QT
                  syndrome or any of the following:

               -  Known risk to prolong the QT interval or induce Torsade's de Pointes.

                  unreadable or not interpretable) or QTcF &gt;450 screening ECG (based on a mean of 3
                  ECGs).

          -  HIV-positive participants on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible. These
             participants are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with
             marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in participants
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.

          -  History of Type I or Type II diabetes mellitus requiring insulin. Patients who are on
             a stable dose of oral diabetes medication ≥ 2 weeks prior to initiation of study
             treatment are eligible for enrollment. Patients must meet the laboratory eligibility
             criteria for fasting blood glucose and hemoglobin A1c as outlined in the inclusion
             criteria.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the safety of study medications is
             not established in pregnant women.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of
             becoming pregnant, unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception
             throughout the study and for 8 weeks after study drug discontinuation. Women are
             considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12
             months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g.
             age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral
             oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago.
             In the case of bilateral oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the
             woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not
             of child bearing potential. Highly effective contraception methods include:

          -  Total abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the
             patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation
             methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception

          -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without
             hysterectomy), total hysterectomy, or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking
             study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of
             the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment

          -  Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or placement of
             an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS), or other forms of hormonal
             contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate &lt;1%), for example hormone
             vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception.

          -  In case of use of oral contraception, women should have been stable on the same pill
             for a minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment. Note: While oral
             contraceptives are allowed, they should be used in conjunction with a barrier method
             of contraception due to unknown effect of drug-drug interaction.

          -  For Arm A only: patients who have received prior fulvestrant.

          -  For Arm C only: h/o of intolerable toxicity to CDK 4/6 inhibitor resulting in
             treatment discontinuation due to toxicity
