  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a feasibility study or pilot study, that is a clinical investigation to acquire
      the preliminary information on a motorized exoskeleton (BRIDGE / EMPATIA exoskeleton) for the
      movement of the upper limb in order to develop it, including design changes. The primary
      objective of the clinical trial is to assess the fit, safety and usability of the device in
      supporting the execution of daily activities for patients suffering from muscular dystrophy.
      The risk analysis for the BRIDGE / EMPATIA device does not present particular criticalities
      that preclude the use of the device in the target population. In any case, during the trial
      eventual adverse events are recorded for the verification of safety..

    <measure>Performance of Upper Limbs scale (PUL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline PUL without the exoskeleton and PUL wearing the exoskeleton within 15 days.</time_frame>
    <description>The PUL includes 22 items with an entry item to define the starting functional level and 21 items subdivided into shoulder level (4 items), middle level (9 items) and distal level (8 items). For weaker patients, a low score on the entry item means high-level items do not need to be performed. Each dimension can be scored separately with a maximum score of 16 for the shoulder level, 34 for the middle level and 24 for the distal level. A total score can be achieved by adding the three level scores, with a maximum global score of 74. The lower the score, the higher the disability.

    <measure>ABILHAND</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline PUL without the exoskeleton and PUL wearing the exoskeleton within 15 days.</time_frame>
    <description>Self-administered questionnaire aimed at measuring manual ability in daily life. Patients are asked to answer 14 questions plus 4 items differentiated with respect to the age of participant (older or younger than 15 years). Overall, the Abilhand questionnaire has 22 items. For each item, the participant has to answer if the presented action is &quot;impossible&quot;, &quot;difficult&quot; or &quot;easy&quot; to be performed in his/her opinion. A three-level scale is used to calculate a total score according to the answer given: &quot;impossible&quot; (0 points), &quot;difficult&quot; (1 point) and &quot;easy&quot; (2 points). The higher the score, the easier the perception of self-ability. Data are converted to a probabilistic model through the Rasch model, which estimates the item difficulty and a patient's manual ability on a standard linear scale, within a probabilistic framework.

    <measure>Technology acceptance model (TAM) questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 15 days from the baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The technology acceptance model (TAM) is an information systems theory that models how users come to accept and use a technology. A dedicated TAM has been developed, and administered to the patients in the form of 26 questions on the evaluation of different aspects of the device (e.g., saefty, confort, etc.). For each item, the patient has to provide a score from 1 to 5, where 1 is completely disagree and 5 is completely agree. The higher the score, the better the technology acceptance.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>System usability scale (SUS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 15 days from the baseline</time_frame>
    <description>It is a ten-items scale giving a global view of subjective assessments of usefulness as a combination of effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction. Each item score contribution ranged from 1 to 5. For items 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 (the positively worded items) the score contribution was the scale position given by the subject minus 1. For items 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 (the negatively worded items), the contribution was equal to 5 minus the scale position. Then, the scores were summed and multiplied by 2.5 to obtain the overall value of SUS. Scores can range from 0 to 100. SUS is evaluated according to Bangor research guidelines (Bangor et al., An Empirical Evaluation of the System Usability Scale, International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction, 2008, 24:574-594): scores in the ranges [55, 75], [75.1, 87.5] and [87.6, 100] indicated respectively &quot;good&quot;, &quot;excellent&quot; and &quot;very excellent&quot;.
