  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With obesity on the rise worldwide more and more young women are also affected, leading to a
      higher prevalence of obese pregnant women and pregnant women with diabetes.

      Children of these women are in risk of developing obesity during childhood which again leads
      to overweight during adult life resulting in life-style related diseases such as diabetes and
      cardio-vascular disease.

      Overweight and diabetic women are currently advised to substitute sugar sweetened beverages
      with artificially sweetened beverages to lower caloric intake and avoid fluctuations in blood
      glucose to avoid complications during pregnancy for both mother and child.

      Recent studies suggest that high intake of artificial sweeteners during pregnancy increases
      the risk of the child developing obesity. If this is indeed true, the current guidelines have
      the opposite of the wanted and children already in risk of overweight are exposed to extra
      risk.

      To investigate if artificial sweeteners can affect the foetus, the investigators wish to
      examine whether artificial sweeteners can cross the placenta.

      The study is a clinical trial in which 40 women will be enrolled. 30 participants will drink
      a diet soft drink 2 hours before a caesarean section and 10 controls will refrain from
      intake. After birth the investigators will obtain a blood sample from the mother and from the
      umbilical cord and a placental biopsy and measure the contents of artificial sweeteners.
      Furthermore, the investigators will obtain a sample of amniotic fluid to examine if the
      sweeteners are excreted into the amniotic fluid.

      The results ultimately have the potential to change the current guidelines on diet for
      overweight and diabetic women during pregnancy.

    <intervention_model_description>We wish to conduct an interventional, open-label study in which 40 women undergoing planned caesarean section will be included. In the intervention-group divided between:
10 women with IUGR-child, 10 women with diabetes, 10 healthy women. We will use a control group of 10 healthy women who will refrain from intake.
The participants will drink an artificially sweetened soft drink 2 to 4 hours before planned c-section.</intervention_model_description>
