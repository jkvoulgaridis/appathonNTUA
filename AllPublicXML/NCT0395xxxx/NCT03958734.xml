  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to examine the effect of high-fat meals on the health
      of blood vessels. In addition, the study will examine how exercise/fitness/physical activity
      impacts blood vessels after consumption of a high-fat meal.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is the first in a series of studies examining the impact of high-fat meals on blood
      vessels. During the preliminary visit of this study, eligible participants' resting metabolic
      rate, arm flow mediated dilation, and leg flow mediate dilation will be measured. They will
      complete handgrip and plantar flexion exercise tasks. Finally, they will be given a physical
      activity monitor to wear for 7 days. At their first visit, participants will eat a high-fat
      meal and blood will be drawn to measure blood vessel health. They will also repeat the arm
      flow mediated dilation, leg flow mediate dilation, handgrip, and plantar flexion exercise
      tests.
