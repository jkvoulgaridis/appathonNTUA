  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since 2002, in CHU Amiens, Essure implants started to be used for women in need of voluntary
      sterilization in accordance with French national recommendations. Recently patient committees
      emerged to alert health agency and governments about various symptoms possibly link to the
      Essure implants. New studies have been launched in order to determinate if Essure implants
      were involved with the symptoms described. According to the scientific literature no solid
      link between Essure and the symptomatology was highlighted. French National College of
      Gynecologists and Obstetricians send a letter of information for patient and gynecologists.
      French National agency of medicament suspended Essure authorization in august 2017 for 3
      months. Bayer industry decided to withdraw from the market the Essure implants in autumn
      2017. Currently Essure procedures have been stopped to be used in CHU Amiens since august
      2017. But, in CHU Amiens, health institutions still have to manage patients with Essure
      implants and potential adverse effects.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if the patients treated between 2002 and 2017 with
      Essure implant present complications, had a proper follow up after the Essure implantation,
      and that the Essure implantation respected the medical guidelines in order to offer the best
      medical care with these new informations.

      Medical data from patients who received Essure procedure will be collected with medical file
      and a survey about adverse effects will be submitted to patients by phone if they agree to
      take part of the study after loyal information.
