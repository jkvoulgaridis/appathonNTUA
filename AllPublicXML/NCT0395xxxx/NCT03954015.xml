  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with suspicious breast lesion (BIRADS category 4/5) who are scheduled to undergo
      biopsy will be recruited to undergo imaging evaluation with Contrast Enhanced Dual Energy
      Mammography (CEDM), Contrast Enhanced Breast MR (CEMR) and Contrast Enhanced Ultrasound
      (CEUS).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The co-primary endpoints are to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of CEUS relative to
      pathology determined diagnosis.

        1. Positive predictive value of CEDM in detecting lesions seen on MR

        2. Estimate the negative predictive value (TN/(TN+FN)) of CEUS as an adjunct.

        3. Compare the frequency of recommendation of biopsy of MG±US vs MG±US plus CEUS as an
           adjunct based on BIRADS scores.

        4. Comparison of background enhancement seen on CEUS with that seen on CEDM and CEMR.
