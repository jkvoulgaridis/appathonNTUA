      Background:

      Aging-related progressive neurological disorders include frontotemporal dementia, Lou Gehrig
      s disease, and Alzheimer s disease. Little is known about what causes these disorders. Brain
      inflammation may be involved. Researchers want to see if scans using radioactive drugs can
      show brain inflammation.

      Objective:

      To see if the drug [11C]ER176 can show inflammation in the brain in people with certain
      progressive neurological disorders compared to healthy adults. Also to find genes that might
      be associated with or cause these disorders.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 18 and older with an aging-related neurological disorder, and healthy adults

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical exam, neurological exam,
      psychiatric history, and blood tests.

      Participants will have 2-5 visits for the first session. They will have 2 PET scans and 1 MRI
      scan. They may have 3 more sessions: 6 months to about 18 months later, 1 year after that,
      and about 30 months to 5 years after the first visit. There may be up to 20 total visits.

      For the scans, participants will lie on a bed that slides into the scanners. For the PET
      scans, a strap will fix their head in place. A radioactive drug will be injected through a
      catheter. A needle will guide a thin plastic tube into an arm vein. Additional catheters may
      be put in place to draw blood. Each PET will take 2 hours. The MRI will take 30 60 minutes.

      At each session, participants will have a brief interview, medical history, physical exam,
      blood and urine tests, heart tests, and memory and thinking tests. They may donate blood for
      DNA tests.

      Objectives

      The primary objective is to explore if human subjects with neurodegenerative diseases exhibit
      different level of neuroinflammation, as measured by brain uptake of a 3rd generation
      [11C]ER176 TSPO ligand, compared to control subjects. The secondary objectives are to
      determine, 1) if [11C]ER176 TSPO brain uptake shows disease-specific patterns across
      different neurodegenerative diseases and/or genetic mutations, and 2) if longitudinal imaging
      of individual patients shows a correlation between interval change of tracer uptake and
      disease progression.

      Study population

      Adults referred with a clinical diagnosis or with an increased risk of frontotemporal
      dementia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer s disease, other related adult-onset
      neurodegenerative disorders, or healthy control subjects.

      Design

      Participants will undergo a general and neurological exam, a standard battery of
      neuropsychological tests to measure cognitive function, blood tests for analysis of TSPO
      polymorphisms, MRI of the brain, and PET imaging with the [11C]ER176 TSPO radioligand and
      [11C]PIB amyloid radioligand. Participants will be invited to return for repeat evaluations
      approximately 1, 2, and 3-5 years after their initial evaluation.

      Outcome measures

      Brain PET and MRI scans will be co-registered for anatomic definition of regions of interest,
      and SUV will be calculated in various brain regions. [11C]ER176 PET data will be analyzed
      with compartmental modeling. [11C]PIB PET and MRI data will be adjunctly used for segregating
      the collected data by disease subtype. For the primary objective, we will compare TSPO
      radioligand uptake of healthy controls compared to subjects with neurodegenerative diseases.
      For secondary objectives, we will determine if neuroanatomical regions of tracer uptake
      differ across different neurodegenerative disease subtypes, and if interval change of tracer
      uptake correlates with disease progression in longitudinal imaging of individual subjects.
