  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this randomized controlled trial we will treat 80 patients with depression with
      intermittent theta burst stimulation in two parallel arms. Both arms are active interventions
      differing with respect to positioning of the treatment coil - one arm with neuronavigation
      and one arm with targeting according to EEG Position representing the left dorsolateral
      prefrontal cortex. Randomisation will be balanced for in- and out-patients and for the
      treatment arms.

    <textblock>
      Intermittent Theta burst Stimulation (iTBS) is a specific type of repetitive transcranial
      magnetic Stimulation (rTMS). rTMS of the left prefrontal cortex was shown to be effective in
      the treatment of Depression. Recent studies showed that iTBS probably is as effective as
      rTMS.

      One possibility to increase to efficacy of rTMS/iTBS is to use neuronavigation. With
      neuronavigation the coil Position can be targeted with an accuracy in the range of
      millimeters. Furthermore the Stimulation Position can be ensured during one single session
      and over the course of the daily Treatments.

      The aim of the present study is to investigate the benefit of neuronavigation in the
      Treatment of Depression with iTBS by using two arms one with targeting the Stimulation site
      with neuronavigation and one by using the EEG Position F3 as target by using head caps for
      marking the position.
