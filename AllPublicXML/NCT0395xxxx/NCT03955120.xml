  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of sleep disorders has achieved epidemic proportions in Western countries.
      Despite this, assessment and treatment of sleep disorders remains infrequent, unattainable,
      and often costly. Dayzz is aware of the need for easily accessible, user-friendly, and
      affordable treatment strategies for known sleep conditions. This research proposes a
      randomized controlled outcome study aimed to validate a, digitized, cost-effective mobile app
      which assesses and manages insomnia and CPAP adherence in persons with sleep apnea. The app's
      sleep training protocols recommend life-style and behavioral changes and tracks these changes
      with the aim of improving sleep and well-being. In this study, the dayzz app digital
      treatment protocol will be compared to the standard treatment for these sleep conditions by a
      sleep professional.

    <description>The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS): The ESS is a self-administered questionnaire with 8 questions. Respondents are asked to rate, on a 4-point scale (0-3), their usual chances of dozing off or falling asleep while engaged in eight different activities. The ESS score (the sum of 8 item scores, 0-3) can range from 0 to 24. The higher the ESS score, the higher that person's average sleep propensity or their 'daytime sleepiness'.</description>

    <time_frame>3 months to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The Dayzz Sleep Questionnaire is a digitized screening measure that assesses sleep quantity and quality and presence/risk for specific sleep disorders. It is composed of some self-rated items, assessing sleep amounts, sleep quality, excessive sleepiness, and risk factors for sleep-related breathing disorders, symptoms of insomnia and sleep/wake circadian rhythms. The questions are based on the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (3rd Edition; American Academy of Sleep Medicine) diagnostic criteria for four common categories of sleep disorders: Insomnia, Insufficient Sleep Syndrome, Sleep Apnea Disorders, and Circadian Rhythm Sleep-Wake Disorders.</description>

    <description>The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) is a well-validated 7-item self-report questionnaire assessing the nature, severity, and impact of insomnia over the past month (Morin, 1993). The total score is interpreted as follows: absence of insomnia (0-7); sub-threshold insomnia (8-14); moderate insomnia (15-21); and severe insomnia (22-28).</description>

    <description>The Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire-Specific Health problem (WPAI:SHP): The WPAI is a patient-reported quantitative assessment of the amount of absenteeism, presenteeism and daily activity impairment attributable to a specific health problem (Reilly et al, 1993). WPAI:SHP outcomes are expressed as impairment percentages, with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity, i.e., worse outcomes.</description>

    <description>The Glasgow Sleep Impact Index (GSII). Administered only to the insomnia sample. The GSII is a self-report measure which asks patients to generate, and assess, three domains of measure insomnia-related quality of life impairment. These three patient-generated areas of impairment are ranked in order of concern (1-3; i.e. 1=the most concerning impairment), and then rated on a visual analogue scale with respect to impact in the past two weeks. Patients re-rate these specified areas of impairment, post-intervention, permitting both individual and group-level analyses.</description>

    <measure>Sleep Apnea-related Quality of Life-Short form (SAQLI-SF)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The SAQLI- SF (for sleep apnea sample only) measures the effects of sleep apnea on a person's quality of life. The questions represent four quality of life domains: Daily Activities, Social Interactions, Emotions,and Symptoms. Two total scores will be generated, which reflect the pre- and post-treatment quality of life. The total scores range between 1-14, with higher values representing poorer outcomes. No subscale scores are generated.</description>

    <measure>The WHO-5 Well-being Index (WHO-5)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The WHO-5 Well-being Index (WHO-5) is a short, self-administered questionnaire measuring psychological well-being. It covers 5 positively worded items, related to positive mood (good spirits, relaxation), vitality (being active and waking up fresh and rested), and general interests (being interested in things). Each of the five items is rated on a 6-point Likert scale from 0 (= not present) to 5 (= constantly present). Scores are summated, with raw score ranging from 0 to 25. Then the scores are transformed to 0-100 by multiplying by 4 which provides the total score, with higher scores meaning better well-being. The scale does not generate subscale scores.</description>

    <description>The intervention group is also provided access to the dayzz app, a personalized digital sleep training program. The sleep training begins a sleep assessment questionnaire and ongoing sleep and activity data collection which is used to tailor an individualized sleep training program including behavioral and cognitive techniques to improve the adherence to CPAP. The dayzz sleep program is composed of three main components, (1) a mobile digital program via the dayzz app, (2) guidance of a sleep trainer, and (3) an ambulatory sleep monitoring device. The intervention group meets a CPAP technician at the sleep clinic, as detailed below in the Sleep Apnea TAU group</description>

    <description>The dayzz digital sleep program provides each user with relevant educational materials (depending on their sleep condition), sleep tracking, and sleep or health-related tasks or challenges pertaining to their sleep or sleep difficulties.
Each app user is matched with a &quot;sleep trainer&quot; who will communicate with them via a &quot;chat&quot; option within the dayzz app and who will support the participants with any sleep training issues or technical aspects of all app for the duration of the treatment program.
Participants receive a wrist-worn device for monitoring sleep and activity patterns, a Fitbit fitness tracker (www.fitbit.com), to be worn for the duration of the study.</description>
