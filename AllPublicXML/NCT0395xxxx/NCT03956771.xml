  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to teach participants with a OCD diagnosis and treatment-resistance
      how to decrease the response from a brain region involved in the disease by using a technique
      called neurofeedback. While using this technique, the participants visualize their own brain
      response in a screen during a MRI exam. Participants will learn strategies to decrease brain
      responses. The neurofeedback technique is non-invasive, without known risks to participants.
      With this study, it is expect that the neurofeedback training over 2 weeks (2 sessions) will
      reduce the OCD symptoms when compared to a control intervention based on neurofeedback's
      placebo effects.

    <textblock>
      OCD individuals will be recruited at Hospital of Braga, Braga, Portugal, in collaboration
      with the Psychiatry Unit (n = 30, nonrandom convenience sample based on effect size of 0.30,
      alpha = beta = 0.05, and ANOVA repeated measures within-between interaction). Some
      participants may quit the study but sample size was predetermined considering a putative 30
      percent dropout rate. Clinical history will be assessed (sociodemographic information,
      disease onset and severity, and previous/current treatments). The participants'
      neuropsychological state, the blood hormonal levels, and brain function and structure as
      baseline measures before and after the neurofeedback intervention will be assessed. Two MRI
      neurofeedback sessions will be performed during 2 weeks (2 distinct days; 36 min per session)
      in a 3 T MRI scanner. Data analysis will be performed with a repeated measures design
      (baseline and after neurofeedback) between the groups to measure brain, blood, and
      neuropsychological changes. Patients will be supervised by a physician to track putative
      complications/adverse effects during the intervention. The participation will be immediately
      interrupted in case of adverse reactions or symptomatic worsening and a physician will follow
      the participants to provide the appropriated care.

Group 1 will receive feedback information from real activity from the target brain region, while group 2 will receive false feedback not matching real brain responses to account for placebo effects (from other participant's data).</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean change from baseline in Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale score.</measure>
    <time_frame>2-3 days before the intervention, 2-3 days after the intervention, and 3 months after the intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Psychometric scale to evaluate obsessive-compulsive symptoms. The total score ranges from 0 to 50 with the following classification: 0-7 sub-clinical symptoms, 8-15 moderate symptoms, 16-31 severe symptoms, and &gt;= 32 extreme symptoms. This scale can be divided into two subscales: compulsions subscale (score ranging from 0 to 25) and obsessions subscale (score ranging from 0 to 25). The sum of the subscales scores gives the total score of the scale. Lower total and subscale scores represent a better outcome.</description>

    <time_frame>2-3 days before the intervention, 2-3 days after the intervention, and 3 months after the intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Psychometric scale to evaluate obsessive-compulsive symptoms. The total score ranges from 0 to 72. This scale can be divided into six subscales: checking subscale (score ranging from 0 to 12), hoarding subscale (score ranging from 0 to 12), neutralizing subscale (score ranging from 0 to 12), obsessing subscale (score ranging from 0 to 12), ordering subscale (score ranging from 0 to 12), and washing subscale (score ranging from 0 to 12). The sum of the subscales scores gives the total score of the scale. Lower total and subscale scores represent a better outcome.</description>
