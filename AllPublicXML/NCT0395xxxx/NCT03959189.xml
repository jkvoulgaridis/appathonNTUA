  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants in this study will receive two treatments, placebo and ERX-963, on different
      days in a randomized fashion.

      The primary purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of ERX-963 in
      participants diagnosed with Myotonic Dystrophy, Type 1 (DM1).

      The secondary purpose is to evaluate the potential of ERX-963 treatment to reduce excessive
      daytime sleepiness / hypersomnia and improve cognitive function in DM1 participants compared
      to placebo treatment.

    <textblock>
      This study is evaluating single administration of two dose levels of ERX-963 to explore the
      relationship between dose, safety, tolerability, exposure and clinical benefit. This is a
      multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-treatment period crossover
      study in two cohorts of participants with DM1.

      Participants who have consented and meet eligibility criteria will receive two treatments,
      placebo and ERX-963, in a randomized crossover fashion with a washout period between the
      treatments. On treatment days, participants will receive treatment followed by repeated blood
      collection for pharmacokinetic analysis and administration of a battery of outcome measures
      relevant to sleep and cognition.
