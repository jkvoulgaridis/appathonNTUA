  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of the study is that in ulcerative colitis repeated flares of inflammatory
      activity, as well as mechanisms involved in resolution of the inflammatory response, may
      contribute to accumulation of damage in the colon leading to functional disturbances and
      symptoms that affect patient's functioning. The primary objective is to determine whether
      ulcerative colitis induces permanent anatomical damage, by means of magnetic resonance
      imaging.
