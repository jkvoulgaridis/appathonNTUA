  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label extension study to evaluate the long-term efficacy, safety and
      tolerability of LNP023 in subjects with C3 glomerulopathy
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this extension study is to collect and evaluate long-term efficacy, safety and
      tolerability data in eligible participants receiving open label LNP023 after completing the
      C3G proof of concept (PoC) study CLNP023X2202. Efficacy assessments at the 9 month visit of
      the extension study in combination with data from CLNP023X2202 (baseline plus 3 months of
      treatment) will afford the opportunity to evaluate the effects of LNP023 on potential
      endpoint(s) for the Phase III trial in C3G at 12 months of treatment. Longer-term efficacy
      assessments may be used as supportive information for registration purposes.
