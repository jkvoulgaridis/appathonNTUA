  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot intervention study is to test the effectiveness of a
      self-management approach (combining education- and exercise-based strategies) for improving
      arthralgia (joint pain) associated with Aromatase Inhibitors (AI) in older breast cancer
      survivors. Survivors will be recruited from local cancer clinics prior to the completion of
      primary cancer treatment, as arthralgia can occur soon after initiating AI medication.
      Participants will be randomized to one of two groups: an enhanced standard care group (AI
      prescription plus information) or a treatment group (educational classes plus group exercise
      sessions). Older survivors (≥65 years) will be targeted because they are at increased risk of
      medication complications which may impede adherence. For the baseline assessment, a
      cancer-specific geriatric assessment will be conducted and a blood sample will be collected
      to interpret the effects of the self-management study in the context of geriatric
      experiences. Additionally, there will be an assessment of knowledge, PA habits, and
      AI-related joint pain and AI adherence. These will be measured again at 4, 6 and at follow up
      at 12 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To improve AIA and AI Adherence in older survivors, it will: first, adapt an evidence-based
      intervention (AIM 1) and then; test the adapted intervention with breast cancer survivors ≥65
      years. The Investigators will educate survivors about possible AI-related side effects and
      teach survivors ways to use PA to self-manage AIA (AIM 2), and support adherence to hormonal
      therapy recommendations (AIM 3). Given evidence that survivors experience AIA soon after
      initiating hormonal therapy, potentially eligible participants would be identified early in
      the treatment process. By identifying potential participants after diagnosis or during active
      treatment, survivors would have a minimal delay in beginning the exercise intervention after
      initiating hormonal therapy (i.e. AIs). All participants will have completed surgery,
      radiation and/or chemotherapy, which is consistent with current ASCO guidelines for AI use.

      Two groups will be randomized to either an information-only group (enhanced standard care) or
      an education plus exercise group (treatment). At the initial clinical visit during the
      intervention, participants in both groups will receive printed information along with their
      AI medication prescription. The treatment group will subsequently receive a one-on-one
      exercise consultation with a certified exercise trainer (e.g ACSM or similar), followed by a
      modified version of the Fit &amp; Strong! program, which includes bi-weekly supervised exercise
      (60 minutes) and educational sessions (30 minutes).

      The exercise sessions will include light weights or resistance bands plus low-impact aerobic
      exercise, in which movements will be explained, demonstrated and modified based on the needs
      of participants. The exercise protocol will be reviewed and revised based on recommendations
      from clinical advisers. Educational materials will provide information about the purpose of
      AI medications (e.g., to reduce cancer recurrence) in layperson language and basic
      information about potential side effects. As part of in-person sessions, participants will
      develop a plan to continue exercise at home. Participants can do an activity of their choice
      (e.g., walking) and use resistance bands which will be provided for the at-home program which
      will begin after 8 weeks and will include follow up phone calls to assess progress and
      reinforce the program. Educational sessions will be modified to reflect relevant content and
      advice for older survivors beginning AIs. Assessments will be taken at 4 and 6 months, with
      follow up at 12 months.

      For convenience of participants, sessions will take place on the Hershey Medical Campus.

    <measure>Brief Pain Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in pain experience from baseline at 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Brief Pain Inventory - Short Form (BPI-sf) is a 9 item self-administered questionnaire used to evaluate the severity of a patient's pain and the impact of this pain on the patient's daily functioning. The patient is asked to rate their worst, least, average, and current pain intensity, list current treatments and their perceived effectiveness, and rate the degree that pain interferes with general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other persons, sleep, and enjoyment of life on a 10 point scale. The BPI-sf is a modification of the Brief Pain Inventory - Long Form, which includes additional questions on demographics (date of birth, marital status, education, employment), pain history, aggravating and easing factors, treatment and medication, pain quality, and response to treatment.</description>

    <measure>The Exercise Self-efficacy Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Single Measure (Repeated at 4, 6 and 12 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The Exercise Self-Efficacy Scale assesses an individual's beliefs in their ability to continue exercising on a three time per week basis at moderate intensities for 40+ minutes per session in the future. For each of 8 items, participants indicate their confidence to execute the behavior on a 100-point percentage scale comprised of 10-point increments, ranging from 0% (not at all confident) to 100% (highly confident). Total strength for each measure of self-efficacy is then calculated by summing the confidence ratings and dividing by the total number of items in the scale, resulting in a maximum possible efficacy score of 100.</description>
