  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lower body positive pressure (LBPP) decreases weight bearing and ground reaction forces, with
      potentially positive effects on qualitative gait indices. However, which gait features are
      shaped by LBPP gait training in post-stroke patients is still poorly predictable. A pilot
      study on the effects of LBPP gait training on qualitative and quantitative gait indices in
      patients with hemiparesis due to stroke in the chronic phase was carried out. Twenty-five
      patients who suffered from a first, single, ischemic, supra-tentorial stroke occurred at
      least 6 months before study inclusion were provided with 24 daily sessions of LBPP treadmill
      gait training using AlterG device. These patients were compared with 25 age-matched healthy
      controls (HC), who were formerly provided with the same amount of AlterG training, and 25
      patients with the same clinical-demographic characteristics of the first group of patients,
      who previously underwent conventional treadmill gait training (TGT). Qualitative and
      quantitative gait features, including Functional Ambulation Categories, gait cycle features,
      and muscle activation patterns were analyzed before and after the training (AlterG or TGT).

    <description>All participants practiced one session a day of AlterG (for 40min), six days a week, for four weeks (for a total amount of 24 sessions). All patients were trained using BWS, and treadmill speed (S) to allow the participant to walk with the intermittent support of one physiotherapist to help with balance and coordination. A qualitative (using FAC) and quantitative (spatio-temporal parameters and dynamic electromyography) gait assessment before and after the end of the gait training was performed.</description>

    <description>All participants practiced one session a day TGT (for 40min), six days a week, for four weeks (for a total amount of 24 sessions). All patients were trained using FAC-tailored physiotherapist assistance, to allow the participant to walk with the intermittent support of one physiotherapist to help with balance and coordination (FAC 2), with the visual supervision of one physiotherapist (FAC 3), or independently without using the handrails (FAC 4). Physiotherapist assistance, and S were checked and adapted to subjects' progresses across the AlterG sessions.</description>

A qualitative (using FAC) and quantitative (spatio-temporal parameters and dynamic electromyography) gait assessment before and after the end of the gait training was performed.The HC initially practiced the device at the same BWS and S administered to the patients. BWS and S were reduced progressively and increased, respectively, across the AlterG sessions in keeping with patients progresses.</description>
