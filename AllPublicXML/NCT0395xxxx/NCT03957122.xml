    <textblock>
      In the first visit a magnetic resonance imaging measurement will be done for the use of a
      neuronavigation System with the aim to control for stable coil position over the course of
      the trial. EEG positions CP5/CP6 will be used for positioning the coil. Two test sessions
      will examine the temporary reductions in tinnitus loudness after 1Hz, 10Hz, 20Hz and 0.1Hz
      rTMS as control condition over left and right temporo-parietal junction accompanied by
      electroencephalography. For the two-week treatment three arms will be evaluated: standard
      treatment (1Hz left-sided) in the groups with and without temporary reductions in test
      sessions and the best protocol as elicited in test sessions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in chronic tinnitus is
      moderate. So far single sessions and daily treatment of rTMS were rarely combined. Thus it is
      not clear if temporary reductions in tinnitus loudness as elicited by short single rTMS
      sessions can be transferred to daily rTMS treatment. Thus, the aim of the study is to
      investigate the efficacy and reliability of single sessions of rTMS in chronic tinnitus with
      respect to temporary reductions in tinnitus loudness accompanied with resting state
      electroencephalography measurements to investigate the neurophysiological correlates of
      tinnitus reductions. Two test sessions within one week will be done on the left and right
      temporoparietal junction using 1Hz, 10Hz, 20Hz and 0.1Hz as active control condition. In the
      next step patients are divided into three arms with the aim to investigate the efficacy of
      individualized rTMS. The three arms are 1) patients with temporary tinnitus reductions in
      test sessions: treatment with the best, most reliable, controlled and most tolerable
      protocol, 2) patients with temporary tinnitus reductions in test sessions: treatment with 1Hz
      left-sided rTMS, 3) patients with no temporary tinnitus reductions in test sessions:
      treatment with 1Hz left-sided rTMS. Treatment will be done for 10 days (Monday - Friday)
      using 2000 pulses with 110% resting motor threshold. Coil position will be tracked with
      neuronavigation to ensure stable coil Position over the course of the trial.
