  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spontaneous cerebral hemorrhage is one of the main causes of death and disability all over
      the world, accounting for 20%-30% of all cerebrovascular diseases. Minimally invasive surgery
      of cerebral hemorrhage, especially puncture aspiration, can improve early and long-term
      neurological recovery in patients with cerebral hemorrhage. Until now, no standardized
      practice for minimally invasive surgery of spontaneous cerebral hemorrhage has been
      established. Hematoma puncture and drainage based on CT scans without precise localization
      and personalized approach design, which may lead to poor efficacy and high risk of
      complications. Our hospital has much experience in treating cerebral hemorrhage with
      stereotactic puncture and aspiration. So we conduct a prospective multicenter randomized
      controlled clinical trial to determine the therapeutic effects of puncture aspiration plus
      thrombolysis treatment for the perioperative and long-term recovery of patients with small to
      moderate hematoma in deep basal ganglia via computerized precision coordinates and
      personalized approach design.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of spontaneous basal ganglia hemorrhage by imaging (CT, CTA, etc.) with a
             volume &lt; 30 mL calculated by ABC/2 formula and Glasgow Coma Scale score ≥ 9.

          2. With dysfunction such as hematoma-related motor aphasia, sensory aphasia, hemiplegic
             limb muscle strength ≤ grade 3 or NIHSS score ≥ 15 points.

          3. Hematoma stability shown by a CT scan at least 6 hours after the diagnostic CT
             (hematoma volume increase &lt; 5 ml by ABC/2 formula)

          4. Diagnostic CT scan should be obtained within 24 hours after the onset of symptoms.
             Cases with unclear onset time should be excluded.

          5. Randomization within 72 hours after diagnostic CT.

          6. Surgery should be performed within 72 hours after onset.

          7. SBP &lt;180 mmHg maintained for 6 hours prior to randomization.

          8. Age between 18-70 years old.
