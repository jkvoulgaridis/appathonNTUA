  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine whether providing patients with life expectancy
      (LE) information in the form of their Prostate Cancer Comorbidity Index (PCCI) scores
      impacted their decisional conflict or anxiety about prostate cancer or death.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer were consented and randomized to receive
      standard of care counseling (SOC) versus the same counseling plus provision of their specific
      LE (PCCI). Patients were blinded to the specific content of their counseling session. After
      counseling, patients completed the Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS), Death Anxiety Scale
      (DAS), Memorial Anxiety Scale for Prostate Cancer (MAX-PC), and Patient Satisfaction
      Questionnaire (PSQ-18). Treatment preferences were assessed.

    <measure>Traditional Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>within 120 days of receiving counseling</time_frame>
    <description>This is to assess the ability to implement decisions. Each of the 16 questions range from strongly agree (a score of 1), to strongly disagree (a score of 5). The total score could be as low as 16 or as high as 80. A lower total score represents a better outcome, with a score of &lt;25 associated with the ability to implement decisions and a score of &gt;37.5 associated with decision delay and feeling unsure.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Modified 18-item Memorial Anxiety Scale for Prostate Cancer</measure>
    <time_frame>within 120 days of receiving counseling</time_frame>
    <description>This is to assess anxiety about prostate cancer. Each of the 18 questions range from not at all (a score of 1) to often (a score of 4). The total score could range from 18 to 72. A lower total score indicates less anxiety about prostate cancer and a lower score represents the better the outcome.</description>
