  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of a new curriculum on toddlers'
      self-regulation skills and healthy eating habits. The curriculum is being delivered as part
      of Early Head Start home visits and compared to the effectiveness of usual practice Early
      Head Start home visits.

    <measure>Change in children's healthy eating habits: Food diaries</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline / up to 18 months</time_frame>

    <intervention_name>Recipe 4 Success</intervention_name>
    <description>Home visitors teach parents about children's self-regulation skills and healthy eating habits. The home visitors then teach parents how to sensitively scaffold the development of their toddlers' self-regulation skills in the context of cooking and snack preparation lessons. Prior research shows that self-regulation skills in early childhood predict long-term health indicators, such as BMI. Prior research also shows that children who are involved in the preparation of healthier foods are more likely to eat them.</description>
