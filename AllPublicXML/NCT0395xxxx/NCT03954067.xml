  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of ASP9801 and to
      determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). The study will also evaluate antitumor
      activity, objective response rate, pharmacokinetics and virus shedding of ASP9801.

      Screening and enrollment are temporarily on hold due to COVID-19. The study consists of two
      parts: dose escalation and recommended phase 2 dose expansion. Each part of the study will
      include two separate groups of participants. Group A will include participants who will have
      cutaneous/subcutaneous tumors injected, and group B will include participants who will have
      visceral tumors injected. The study will consist of the following periods: screening, initial
      treatment period (two 28 day cycles), optional extended treatment period (continued 28 day
      cycles) and a follow up period (safety and survival follow up).

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered an investigational product (IP), and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of IP whether or not considered related to the IP.</description>
