  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinal orthoses have been used in the treatment of non-operative thoracic and lumbar
      fractures with much success. However, there has been increasing questioning as to wether or
      not the orthotics are necessary to have a good overall outcome. Being fitted for and
      acquiring braces are associated with great expense and increased hospital stays. The purpose
      of this study is to determine wether or not braces are required for good outcome post
      thoracic or lumbar fracture.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several tens of patient's per year come to the Emergency Department with thoracolumbar spine
      compression and burst fractures that are not indicated for surgical fixation. Currently,
      these patients are treated non-operatively through brace wear which is either custom made for
      the patient or is off-the-shelf pending location of the fracture and surgeon preference. All
      braces are through the currently contracted orthotics company. As they are non stocked in
      house, waiting for the brace requires the patients to remain on &quot;strict spine precautions&quot;
      (flat bed rest in a Miami J collar, no pillows behind the head, and logrolls for turning) for
      anywhere from 24-48 hours. No only is this incredibly uncomfortable for the patient, it is
      also extending their hospital stay for at least one day and, sometimes, up to three as they
      wait for the brace and have it adjusted to fit appropriately. The patient's all have to then
      wait to work with physical therapy and occupational therapy and, finally, have upright spine
      films taken in the brace. The braces tend to be very uncomfortably and constricting for
      patient's and significantly inhibit their daily lives. The investigators are proposing that
      these fractures can be treated without needing bracewear and will have equivalent to superior
      outcomes than results while wearing the brace.

    <measure>Oswestry Disability Index (ODI)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 month post-injury</time_frame>
    <description>Primary outcome is the ODI which is a a self-completed questionnaire over ten topics regarding pain, lifting, ability to perform activities of daily living, ability to walk, sit, stand, one's sexual function, social life, sleep quality, and ability to travel. Each category has six different statements from which the patient can choose to best describe their current status. Each question is then scored on a scale from 0-5. Scores are summed and then doubled. The index is from 0-100 with zero being no disability and one hundred being maximally disabled.</description>

    <measure>Visual analog scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Time of injury and at follow up at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>VAS is a continuous scale represented as a horizontal line with vertical dashes numbered 0-10. Each number is given a pain intensity descriptor that ranges from &quot;no pain&quot; (score of 1) to &quot;worst imaginable pain&quot; (score of 10). The patient is asked to rate the pain they are currently experiencing on that scale from 1-10</description>

    <measure>PROMIS (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System)- physical function</measure>
    <time_frame>time of injury and follow up at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>PROMIS is a U.S. NIH initiative that is an item bank of self-administered questions to measure physical function. This includes functionality of one's upper extremities (dexterity), lower extremities (mobility), neck, back, as well as ability to perform activities of daily living. This assessment measures current function rather than function over a time period. Each question has five response options ranging in value from 1-5. The total raw score for the form is the sum of the values of the response to each question. The raw score (which can range from 10 (worst) to 50 (best) is then compared to a PROMIS specific conversion chart to the appropriate T-score. A T-score of roughly 50 is considered 'average' and 'slightly sicker than the general population'.</description>
