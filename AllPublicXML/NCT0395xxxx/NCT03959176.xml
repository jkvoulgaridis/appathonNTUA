  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate whether pre-treating patients with Brimonidine 0.2% before and/or
      after dilating the pupils will help to control the changes in intraocular pressure often seen
      when using dilating drops. The study will also evaluate the effects of different sequences of
      administering dilating drops along with Brimonidine on pupil size and reactivity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intraocular pressure (IOP) can fluctuate due to various external factors such as exercise,
      medications, and eye movements. Although it is considered natural for IOP to fluctuate daily,
      prolonged increases in IOP can be harmful. Sustained elevated IOP has been linked to optic
      nerve damage and glaucoma. Mydriatic drops routinely given to dilate pupils in patients in
      need of an eye exam have been known to increase IOP. In practice, a combination of drugs are
      used to achieve pupil dilation needed for routine eye exams or in perioperative situations.
      The use of Tropicamide 1% and Phenylephrine 2.5% are known to be safe and effective options
      for dilating the pupils when used in conjunction with one another, but these drugs can
      increase IOP. Drugs such as Brimonidine, a selective alpha-2 agonist, are known to reduce IOP
      through several different methods. This study seeks to understand the effects of Brimonidine
      used along with Tropicamide and Phenylephrine to control IOP.
