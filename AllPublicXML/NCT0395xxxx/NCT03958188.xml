  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuro-endocrine tumours (NET) are the most frequent tumours of the small intestine. In spite
      of their small size, these tumours have the particularity of forming mesenteric metastasis
      and ganglionic secondary lesions along the superior mesenteric axis, which is in close
      proximity to the superior mesenteric artery (SMA).

      Surgery is the only curative treatment. The complete resection being a factor for good
      patient prognosis, risks of subsequent local complications (occlusion, bleeding) must be
      discussed. The limiting factor for resectability is arterial vascular invasion considering
      the risk of postoperative small bowel syndrome.

      At the moment, the choice of imaging examination and its protocol is not standardized, nor
      the description of the tumoral mesenteric and ganglionic extension, especially the criteria
      defining a lymph node as lymphadenopathy. In addition, the complexity of SMA's anatomy and
      the absence of criteria for arterial invasion defining arterial invasion may lead to a
      misinterpretation of the preoperative imaging , and thus to an incomplete planning of the
      surgical procedure.

      To correct this absence of radiological standardization, the investigating team has developed
      a reading grid for Computed Tomography (CT) aimed to facilitate preoperative planning of
      small bowel NET.

      The main objective of the current study is to improve the semiotic description of the
      mesenteric and ganglionic tumoral extension of small intestine NET using a technically
      optimized imaging examination and a standardized reading grid in order to plan the best
      surgical procedure which would allow maintaining a minimal length of small intestine needed
      to yield a satisfying quality of life and nutritional status.

      The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the reproducibility of the standardized
      scanner's reading grid.

    <intervention_name>Standardized computerized tomography (CT) reading grid for preoperative planning</intervention_name>
    <description>Using the standardized reading grid, the following data will be collected:
Small Intestine: tumor, parietal thickening, occlusive syndrome, proximity of the tumor with the ileocecal valve.
Mesenteric mass: presence, size, shape, contours, calcifications, enhancement, superior mesenteric arterial invasion and number of non-invaded arterial arteries.
Mesentery: moniliform venous dilatations, combed appearance.
Duodenal invasion.
Lymphadenopathies (Mesenteric, Right mesocolic and Retropancreatic): presence, size, shape, enhancement
The anonymized CT exam will be reviewed by an expert radiologist and a radiology resident from imaging department of the Hospital.</description>
