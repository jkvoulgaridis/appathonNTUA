  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a Phase I study in 12 healthy male participants to compare the pharmacokinetic
      properties of CG5503 (how it is taken up and excreted from the body) after 2 minutes
      intravenous (i.v.) infusion with and without oral co-administration of charcoal to
      investigate a potential gastrointestinal secretion of CG5503.

      During the course of the study each participant received two infusions of 40 mg CG5503
      without (treatment A) and with (treatment B) oral co-administration of charcoal. In treatment
      B, eight doses of 5 grams charcoal powder were co-administered orally at defined time points.
      The wash out phases were to be at least 4 to 14 days between the treatment periods.
