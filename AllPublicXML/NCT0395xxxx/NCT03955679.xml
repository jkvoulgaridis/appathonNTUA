      The purpose of this Cohort Treatment Protocol will allow access to AVXS-101 for eligible
      patients diagnosed with SMA.

      The requesting Physician submits a request for access to drug (often referred to as
      Compassionate Use) to AveXis which is reviewed and approved by the medical team experienced
      with the drug and indication. The requesting Physician should refer to the latest
      Investigator's Brochure (IB) or approved label for overview of drug including: nonclinical
      and clinical experience, risk and benefits.

    <description>AVXS-101 is a non-replicating recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) containing the human survival motor neuron (SMN) gene under the control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) enhancer/chicken β-actin-hybrid promoter (CB). AVXS-101 will be administered as a one-time intravenous infusion over approximately 60 minutes. Dosage will be determined by the participants weight.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with SMA must satisfy both a. and b. of the following specified criteria:

               1. Diagnosis of SMA based on gene mutation analysis with bi-allelic SMN1 mutations
                  (deletion or point mutations) and 1, 2, or 3 copies of SMN2.

               2. Either patients with onset of symptoms prior to &lt; 6 months (&lt; 180 days) of age or
                  pre-symptomatic patients, less than 6 months of age, with 1, 2, or 3 copies of
                  SMN2 who are not excluded for other reasons.

          2. Weight ≥ 2.6 kg to ≤ 13.5 kg at dosing.

          3. Patients must have a pre-treatment swallowing evaluation test performed prior to
             administration of AVXS-101.

          4. Patients must have a formal pulmonary evaluation including documentation of
             non-invasive ventilatory use prior to administration of AVXS-101. Ventilation should
             be actively managed by an appropriately trained specialist per the published standard
             of care.

          5. Up-to-date on childhood vaccinations. Seasonal vaccinations and palivizumab
             prophylaxis (also known as Synagis) to prevent respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)
             infections have been administered as recommended by the American Academy of
             Pediatrics.

          6. Parent(s)/legal guardian(s) willing and able to complete the informed consent process
             and comply with study procedures and visit schedule.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Tracheostomy.

          2. Contraindication to receiving glucocorticosteroids or their excipients.

          3. Anti Adeno Associated Virus Serotype 9 (AAV9) antibody titer &gt; 1:50 (or any value
             reported as elevated for the laboratory) as determined by Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent
             Assay (ELISA) binding immunoassay. Should a potential patient demonstrate AntiAAV9
             antibody titer &gt; 1:50, he or she may be retested and will be eligible to participate
             if the AntiAAV9 antibody titer upon retesting is ≤ 1:50.

          4. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values for troponin-I, and platelets. ALT,
             AST, bilirubin or gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) &gt; 2 x the upper limit of normal
             (ULN) prior to gene replacement therapy that in the judgment of the Treating Physician
             or AveXis would create too great a risk for the patient to be treated with AVXS-101 or
             prophylactic prednisolone. Note: Elevated bilirubin &gt; 2 x ULN if associated with
             neonatal jaundice is not considered exclusionary.

          5. Medical conditions, diagnoses (especially cardiac), or on concurrent medications prior
             to gene replacement therapy that in the judgment of the treating physician or sponsor
             would create too great a risk for the patient to be treated with AVXS-101 or
             prophylactic prednisolone.

          6. Participation or expected participation in current treatment clinical study (with the
             exception of observational cohort studies or non-interventional studies) for an
             unapproved investigational agent.

          7. Parent(s)/legal guardian(s) unwilling to keep study results/observations confidential
             or to refrain from posting confidential study results/observations on social media
             sites.

          8. Parent(s)/legal guardian(s) refuses to sign consent form.
