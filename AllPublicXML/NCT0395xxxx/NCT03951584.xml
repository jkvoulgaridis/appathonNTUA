  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSNHL) refers to idiopathic sensorineural
      hearing loss of at least 30 dB over at least three test frequencies occurring over a 72-hour
      period. Vertigo has been considered a risk factor of poor prognosis in patients with ISSNHL.
      However, the clinical outcome and development of vestibular function in these patients have
      not been reported yet. We'd like to conduct a study on the problem whether these patients
      resulted in a complete recovery of the peripheral vestibular functions or compensation of the
      central vestibular system. If the answer is the former one, these cases might be supportive
      evidence of regeneration of hair cells in vestibular disorders.

      This study is designed as a prospective cohort study with only one cohort. Enrolment and data
      collection are performed by trained research staff who are not involved in the care of the
      patients. The primary measurement is the vestibular function tests including SOT, the caloric
      reflex test, vHIT, VEMP (cVEMP and oVEMP). The secondary measurements included PTA, DHI, and
      VAS. The sample size was set at 60 patients. The continuous variables were expressed as means
      Â± standard deviation (SD) whereas categorical variables were expressed as frequency and
      percentage for data description. P &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.
