  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Opioids are commonly prescribed for surgical patients to treat moderate to severe pain after
      surgery. However, opioids can be associated with serious complications such as respiratory
      depression and death. Currently, it is not routine practice to provide standardized written
      materials to surgical patients about the risks of opioids and how to safely use opioids after
      surgery. Investigator has developed an educational pamphlet specifically for surgical
      patients to educate them about the safe use of opioids.

      The objective of this study is to determine whether the pamphlet increases surgical patients'
      knowledge about the safe use, proper storage and disposal of opioids.

      Participants presenting to the preoperative clinic will be recruited for this trial. After
      informed consent is obtained, patients will be randomized to one of 2 groups: 1) educational
      pamphlet and standard care, or 2) control group - standard care (no pamphlet) All patients
      will complete the opioid knowledge questionnaire to test baseline knowledge on opioids. If
      patient is randomized to the educational pamphlet and standard care, patient will receive the
      educational pamphlet and standard care. After the patient reviews the pamphlet, the patient
      will complete the questionnaire again. If the patient is randomized to the control group, the
      patient will receive the usual standard of care.

      All patients will be contacted by telephone 15 days and 30 days after surgery to conduct the
      follow-up.
