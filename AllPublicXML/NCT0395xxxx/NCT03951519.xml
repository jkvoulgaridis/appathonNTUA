  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In ICU and operating theatre, fluid expansion is the main hemodynamic therapeutic. The
      objective of fluid expansion is to increase cardiac output thus arterial oxygen delivery to
      match patient's oxygen consumption. To date, it has been shown that all fluid expansion
      solutions may have side effects (hydro-electrolytic disorder, renal failure, hydro-sodium
      overload, etc.) that may limit their use.

      Human digestive system physiologically ensures the absorption of oral water and hydration of
      the human body. Water is quickly absorbed by the digestive tract with a peak between 15 and
      20 minutes. It has demonstrated that oral water remains the best hydration solution that have
      an effect on plasma volume expansion and cardiovascular system during exercise. While the
      cardiovascular effect of fluid expansion by saline serum is well known (venous return,
      preload and cardiac output), that of oral water vary in the literature depending on the
      physiological state of the patient and the clinical state. Oral water can change cardiac
      output and blood pressure through various physiological effects: increased blood volume,
      recruitment of splanchnic blood volume, and peripheral vasoconstriction. Usually, ICU
      patients have feeding through nasogastric tube.

      To date, no study has studied the effect of a given amount of enteral cardiovascular system
      in ICU patients. The objective of this study is to describe the effect of oral water
      administration on the cardiovascular system of patients during the optimization and/or
      hemodynamic stabilization phase. The comparison of groups (water/ physiological saline) would
      allow us: (1) to describe the cardiovascular effects of water in the resuscitation patient,
      (2) to compare these cardiovascular effects with those of saline solution, (3) to have the
      data to design further study.
