  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Autologous Adipose-derived
      Mesenchymal Stem Cell Gel combine with High tibial osteotomy therapy in the treatment of
      cartilage damage in the knee. Investigator believe that this method will enable patients to
      recover better knee function and more repair of knee cartilage.

      The patients who will underwent high tibial osteotomy were randomly divided into the
      experimental group and the control group. Abdominal fat extraction before operation in
      experimental group to prepare Adipose-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cell Gel, while the control
      group only underwent high tibial osteotomy. One month after operation, the experimental group
      was injected with Adipose-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cell Gel into the joint cavity, and the
      control group was injected with sodium hyaluronate in the joint cavity. Two groups of
      patients were followed up.
