    <textblock>
      Wolfram syndrome (WFS; OMIM #222300) is a rare autosomal recessive disease clinically defined
      in 1938 as the combination of childhood-onset insulin dependent diabetes, optic nerve
      atrophy, diabetes insipidus and deafness. Based on early descriptions, neurological features
      were thought to appear later in the disease with death occurring in middle adulthood.
      Importantly, the major causative gene (WFS1) was identified in 1998. This discovery allowed
      researchers to determine that the WFS1 gene encodes the protein wolframin, which helps
      protect cells from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-mediated apoptosis, potentially via
      intracellular calcium homeostasis. Pathogenic mutations in WFS1 can result in death or
      dysfunction of cells that are under high ER stress, such as insulin-producing pancreatic β
      cells, causing insulin dependent diabetes. In addition, knowing the causative gene has
      allowed researchers to identify patients by their WFS1 mutation rather than the classic set
      of symptoms, leading to the increasing realization that the WFS1-related phenotype (including
      neurologic symptoms) is much more variable than previously understood. The first iteration of
      this grant (HD070855 &quot;Tracking Neurodegeneration in Early Wolfram Syndrome&quot;) contributed to
      this shift in understanding. In this time, the research team has built a successful annual
      research clinic for WFS, that has met or exceeded recruitment goals for patients and
      controls, validated a clinical severity rating scale for WFS, described an unexpectedly early
      neurophenotype of reduced balance, smell identification and ventral pons volume, identified
      alterations in traditional diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics that suggest
      hypomyelination as a pervasive neuropathological feature of WFS and provided justification
      for the selection of two primary outcomes (visual acuity and ventral pons volume) in a newly
      funded clinical efficacy study in WFS (Barrett, PI).

      In this new grant, researchers hypothesize that ER stress-related dysfunction could inhibit
      production of myelin during neurodevelopment in WFS, as active and developing
      oligodendrocytes (cells that produce myelin in the brain) are more vulnerable to ER stress
      than mature ones. However, standard DTI methods conflate inflammatory processes (which can
      also be associated with ER stress) in the extra-axonal space with metrics of axonal and
      myelin integrity, leading to potentially confounded measurements. The research team proposea
      to collect novel, validated diffusion sequences on a new state of the art MRI scanner
      (Siemens Prisma) and apply cutting-edge analysis approaches to measure white matter integrity
      throughout the brain and in the optic nerve, improving the ability to draw conclusions about
      axonal and myelin integrity over time. Researchers will assess WFS patients annually at our
      WU Wolfram Research Clinic using these methods.

      Findings from this work may indicate future targets for brain-specific intervention, identify
      outcome measures or high-risk subgroups for clinical trials targeting neurological symptoms.
      These data will also greatly expand our understanding of the cross-sectional and longitudinal
      phenotype of WFS1-mutation related disorders, rather than classically defined Wolfram
      Syndrome. Such knowledge will have a significant impact on patients and families by allowing
      physicians to provide more accurate prognoses. Finally, forms of ER stress-mediated apoptosis
      have been implicated in more common neurodegenerative, endocrine and neurodevelopmental
      diseases, which may benefit from the insights gained here.
