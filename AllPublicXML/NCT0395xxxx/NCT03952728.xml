      This study investigates whether an intensive lifestyle intervention for type 2 diabetes had
      long-term effects on Medicare enrollment, health care use, and health care spending.

      The Look AHEAD study tested whether participants with type 2 diabetes assigned to an
      intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) for weight loss exhibited reductions in cardiovascular
      morbidity and mortality, relative to a control group receiving usual care and diabetes
      support and education. During the 12-year intervention period, the ILI led to persistent
      reductions in weight, waist circumference, and hemoglobin A1c and improvements in physical
      fitness. In addition, the ILI led to reductions in hospitalizations, hospital days, and
      prescription drug spending during the intervention period (through 2012). However, the
      longer-term effects (2012 and later) on health care use and spending remain unknown.

      In an ongoing ancillary study, the researchers are investigating the effects of the ILI on
      economic outcomes, during and after the study. As a part of this study, the study team is
      linking consenting Look AHEAD participants to Medicare databases. The researchers will
      investigate the long-term effects of ILI on health care use and health care spending.

      By 2012 nearly all Look AHEAD participants were eligible for Medicare due to age (over 65).
      To the extent that Look AHEAD participants developed severe disabilities, the participants
      may have gained Medicare eligibility earlier through enrollment in Social Security Disability
      Insurance (SSDI). Thus, the researchers will also test for differences in the Medicare
      enrollment channel between ILI and control group participants, specifically whether the
      groups enrolled through SSDI at different rates.
