  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to literature, it's difficult to evaluate the impact of the visit of the child in
      ICU. Currently, no recommendations are available regarding welcome and accompany children who
      visit their relative hospitalized in ICU. Collaboration between humanities and medical
      sciences brings to this question a complementary look. Majority of studies investigated the
      question of the impact of young child ICU visit in a unidirectional linear causality scheme
      visit = psychopathological impact. The visit of the child in ICU should not be considered as
      an isolated event whose objective characteristics would be alone vectors of trauma. Contrary,
      the child visit must be apprehended in relation to the quality of the supports on which the
      child can count. The investigators hypothesize that children can overcome the visit of a kin
      hospitalized in ICU if accompanying people can support the child and contain, before and
      after the visit, the emotions of the child.

    <description>Child = A clinical interview (recorded, duration approximately 30 min) and a scale of acute stress (IES child) will be performed at 2 times (during the 7 days following the first visit of hospitalized kin and 1 month after the kin was discharged from ICU)
Accompanying parent/kin = Semi-directive interviews (recorded - duration approximately 30 min) will be performed at the same time as those of the child and will be recorded. The parent/kin will also complete a socio-demographic questionnaire of the family group and a depression anxiety scale (HADS)
Nursing staff = A semi-directive interview (recorded - duration approximately 30 min) will be performed only once (during the 7 days following the first visit to the hospitalized kin). The caregiver will also complete a socio-demographic questionnaire and a Moral Distress Scale (MDS-R)
Hospitalized parent = One month after ICU discharge, a depression anxiety scale (HADS) and an acute stress scale (IES) will be performed</description>
