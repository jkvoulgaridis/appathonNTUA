  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed as a multicenter, randomized, single blinded and placebo-controlled
      clinical trial. The aim of the study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy, safety and control
      of recurrence rate of plaque psoriasis with blood stasis syndrome, after treated with fire
      needle therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by the complex interaction
      between the immune system, related susceptibility loci, autoantigens and various
      environmental factors. In China, the prevalence is about 0.47%. Current treatment strategies
      for psoriasis mainly focus on developing new drugs that disrupt IL-23 or IL-17 cytokine, but
      this targeted therapy is not effective for all patients. A growing body of evidence indicates
      that psoriasis-related damage is not limited to the skin, but is closely related to coronary
      heart disease, stroke, metabolic syndrome, and chronic kidney disease. These comorbidities
      have, to a certain extent, increased mortality in patients with psoriasis. Traditional
      Chinese medicine (TCM) has always been used to treat patients with psoriasis in China. Blood
      stasis syndrome is one of the basic syndromes of psoriasis. which accumulates in meridians,
      viscera and limbs to form a variety of syndromes with psoriasis for a long time and is
      similar to many metabolic related diseases. Fire needle therapy is one of the traditional
      Chinese specialty treatments, which has effects of warming yang to expel cold, warming and
      activating meridian, dispersing stasis and relieving pain. Studies have shown that fire
      needle therapy of plaque psoriasis in stationary phase is effective, with fewer side effects,
      and can reduce the recurrence rate. This multicenter, randomized, single-blind,
      placebo-controlled trial will objectively and standardly evaluate the clinical effectiveness,
      safety and control of recurrence of fire needle therapy to obtain objective evidence of
      international standards and form clinical norms suitable for popularization and application.

    <measure>Psoriasis area and severity index (PASI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 56 days after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) involves grading psoriatic plaques based on erythema (E), infiltration (I), desquamation (D). Severity is graded from 0-4 for each criteria (0 - none, 1 - slight, 2 - moderate, 3 - severe, and 4 - very severe). The body is divided into 4 regions, head, upper extremities, trunk, and lower extremities, and for each region, the surface area involvement is graded on a 0-6 scale (0 - 0% involvement, 1 - &lt;10%, 2 - 10-&lt;30%, 3 - 30-&lt;50%, 4 - 50-&lt;70%, 5 - 70-&lt;90%, 6 - 90-100%).The highest potential PASI score is 72, with higher PASI scores indicating worse psoriasis.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Body surface area (BSA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 56 days after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of body surface area (BSA) involved in psoriasis is estimated by fingerprinting, where the entire palm of the patient represents approximately 1% of the total BSA. The number of handprints on psoriasis skin in a body part is used to determine the extent to which the body part is affected by psoriasis (%)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physician Global Assessment (PGA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 56 days after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Physician Global Assessment (PGA) is scored on a 5-point scale, reflecting a global consideration of the erythema (E), infiltration (I), desquamation (D) across all psoriatic lesions. It is calculated as follows: PGA score = (E + I + D) / 3, then the score needs to be rounded to the nearest whole number [PGA scale: Clear (0) - Very Severe (5)].</description>

    <description>The Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) is a participant-reported questionnaire used to measure the health-related quality of life (QOL) of adults suffering from a skin disease. Scores range from 0-30, a higher score indicating a greater impact on a participant's quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Patient-reported quality of life (PRQoL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 28 days after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Patient-reported quality of life (PRQoL) is used to assess the impact of psoriasis on individual social life. Scores range from 0-25, a higher score indicating a greater impact on a participant's social life.</description>

    <description>Participants wear eye masks and fully expose the lesions. After selecting the acupuncture points, the surgeon routinely disinfects the hands of the operator and the acupuncture points of the participants before the operation. After selecting an acupuncture needle with a specification of 0.4*40mm and ignites the alcohol lamp, the operator continuously moves the needle from the needle root to the needle tip to burn the red needle to disinfect the needle in the outer flame of the alcohol lamp.
The operator ignites the alcohol lamp, and burns the needle tip and the needle body to the outer flame of the alcohol lamp until it is completely red (the length of the needle burning red is determined by the acupuncture depth), and then rapidly penetrates the skin lesion vertically, the depth of the acupuncture is based on the thickness of the skin lesion, when the operation is performed, the outer edge of the lesion is punctured to the center point, and the spacing is 0.3 to 0.5 cm.</description>
