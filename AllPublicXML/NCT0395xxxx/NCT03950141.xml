  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Apatinib is a novel drug which was produced by Jiangsu Hengrui Medicine Co.Ltd in China. It
      is approved in advanced gastric cancer（GC）. The investigators just want to design such kind
      of trail to prove its effect when combined with S-1 as maintenance in advanced HER-2
      negatived GC treated with 4 cycles chemotherapy and valued as SD. Investigators will evaluate
      progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      GC is the second most common cause of cancer‑related deaths worldwide. Most patients are
      diagnosed with unresectable advanced or metastatic stage disease losing the radical surgery
      opportunity. Till now there is no novel targeted drug which can increase the OS for advanced
      GC patients except HER-2 positive patients.

      Approximate 30 patients with unresectable GC treated with 4 cycles chemotherapy and valued as
      stable disease will be enrolled in this study,The investigators will evaluate the efficacy
      and security of apatinib and S-1 as maintenance therapy.
