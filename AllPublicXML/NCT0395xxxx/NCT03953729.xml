  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain is defined by IASP (International Association for the Study of Pain) as &quot;an unpleasant
      sensory and emotional experience associated with the damage actual or potential tissue or
      described in terms that suggest such harm&quot;. Episodes of pain and discomfort experienced by
      children are one of the main factors for fear and anxiety in dentistry, especially those that
      present the condition of Molar-Incisive Hipomineralization, where we observed increased
      levels of anxiety in relation to the treatment. In order to improve the painful sensation
      that patients with Molar-Incisor Hipomineralization present as well as anxiety demonstrated
      by these patients in face of dental treatment, the objective of present study will be to
      evaluate the occurrence and degree of pain after procedures dentists with administration of
      pre-emptive analgesia or placebo, in children with Molar-Incisive Hipomineralization. Fifty
      patients will be selected in the Pediatric Dentistry courses of the FORP-USP undergraduate
      course, aged 6 to 12 years, of both sexes, who present at least 2 (two) upper and / or lower
      molars affected by Molar- Incisors that need some kind of restorative treatment, extraction
      or endodontic treatment. Also, these patients should present enamel and dentin fractures
      caused by MIH, atypical restoration and / or atypical caries, and that present pain above the
      moderate degree (6&gt;), after stimulation with air/water jet for 5 seconds.
