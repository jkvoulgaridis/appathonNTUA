      with advanced unresectable/metastatic solid tumors.

    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational
      intervention and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational
      intervention to use for further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is
      being studied.

      In this research study, the investigators are evaluating a new drug, FCN-437c, as a potential
      new treatment for cancer.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved FCN-437c as a treatment for
      any disease.

      FCN-437c is a new generation CDK4/6 inhibitor. The CDK 4/6 inhibitors play a key role in
      regulating the transition from G1 to the S-phase of the cell cycle.

      The cyclin D-cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6-inhibitor of CDK4 (INK4)-retinoblastoma (Rb)
      pathway controls cell cycle progression by regulating the G1-S checkpoint. Dysregulation of
      the cyclin D-CDK4/6-INK4-Rb pathway results in increased proliferation, and is frequently
      observed in many types of cancer. Due to the importance of CDK4/6 activity in cancer cells,
      CDK4/6 inhibitors have emerged as promising candidates for cancer treatment.

      FCN-437c is a novel, potent and selective inhibitor of CDK4/6 exhibiting cellular potency
      against a number of human tumor cell lines.

      Laboratory experiments show that FNC-437c may stop tumor growth.

      The purposes of this study are:

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of FCN-437c when administered orally to subjects
           with advanced solid tumors

        -  To determine the MTD and/or the Phase 2 Dose for FCN-437c

             condition that, in the judgment of the Investigator, may interfere with the planned
