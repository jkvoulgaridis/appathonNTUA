      The delegation of procedures within the medical competence to the nurses can increase the
      effectiveness of the healthcare provided. The objectives of the study are (1) to assess the
      quality of training courses for delegated surgical procedures through implementation for
      graduate scrub nursing (&quot;students&quot;) (2) and to evaluate the correlation between the
      evaluation of this training carried out by students and the self-assessment conducted by the
      faculty (&quot;trainers&quot;).

    <description>This questionnaire is part of the System for Evaluation of Teaching Qualities (SETQ) which includes (1) a self-assessment by the trainer (2) an assessment by the student (3) then a feedback and (4) a follow-up to improve teaching. The SFDP26 questionnaire therefore exists in several versions for an evaluation of training by the students but also for a self-evaluation of by the trainers. Both versions share 25 basic items covering 7 dimensions of teaching quality</description>

        We divided Students into groups of 10 to 12 students, distributed into 5 sessions over the
        study period. We paid attention to mix these groups according to various places of
        exercise, surgical skills, length of professional practice and sectors of public or private
        activities. This group allocation was intended to enrich the exchanges between students by
        providing diverse personal and professional experiences, while maintaining a balance
        between the groups.
