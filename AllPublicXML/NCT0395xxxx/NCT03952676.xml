  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Psoriasis is a common chronic and recurrent inflammatory skin disease. The incidence of the
      disease is increasing year by year, seriously affecting people's quality of life. The
      systematic treatment of psoriasis in modern medicine is limited of wide application due to
      the adverse reactions of different degrees and the high economic cost.

      Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies have become an increasingly visible
      part of dermatology. Cupping is becoming an important therapy in complementary and
      alternative medicine. Although, moving cupping therapy has been widely used in the treatment
      of plaque psoriasis and has been recognized by a large number of peers and patients, but
      still lacks high-quality evidence-based medical evidence. Therefore, the project team intends
      to provide evidence support for the effectiveness and safety of moving cupping therapy for
      plaque psoriasis through clinical studies.

    <measure>Psoriasis area and severity index (PASI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 56 days after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) involves grading psoriatic plaques based on erythema (E), infiltration (I), desquamation (D). Severity is graded from 0-4 for each criteria (0 - none, 1 - slight, 2 - moderate, 3 - severe, and 4 - very severe). The body is divided into 4 regions, head, upper extremities, trunk, and lower extremities, and for each region, the surface area involvement is graded on a 0-6 scale (0 - 0% involvement, 1 - &lt;10%, 2 - 10-&lt;30%, 3 - 30-&lt;50%, 4 - 50-&lt;70%, 5 - 70-&lt;90%, 6 - 90-100%).The highest potential PASI score is 72, with higher PASI scores indicating worse psoriasis.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Body surface area (BSA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 56 days after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of BSA involved in psoriasis is estimated by fingerprinting, where the entire palm of the patient represents approximately 1% of the total BSA. The number of handprints on psoriasis skin in a body part is used to determine the extent to which the body part is affected by psoriasis (%).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physician Global Assessment (PGA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 56 days after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Physician Global Assessment (PGA) is scored on a 5-point scale, reflecting a global consideration of the erythema (E), infiltration (I), desquamation (D) across all psoriatic lesions. It is calculated as follows: PGA score = (E + I + D) / 3, then the score needs to be rounded to the nearest whole number [PGA scale: Clear (0) - Very Severe (5)].</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dermatology Life quality index(DLQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 28 days after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) is a participant-reported questionnaire used to measure the health-related quality of life (QOL) of adults suffering from a skin disease. Scores range from 0-30, a higher score indicating a greater impact on a participant's quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient-reported quality of life (PRQoL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 28 days after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>PRQoL is used to assess the impact of psoriasis on individual social life. Scores range from 0-25, a higher score indicating a greater impact on a participant's social life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analogue Score (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 56 days after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Visual Analog Scale (VAS) is used to measure lesion pruritus from 0 to 100 mm at eash visit (with 0 being no pruritis and 100 being maximum pruritis).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>CM symptom score</measure>

    <description>We use a black opaque eye mask to shield the patient's eyes and choose different sizes of cup according to the location of the treatment (There are three sizes of cups)
(1) First apply Vaseline to the skin lesions area; (2) Then hold the 95% ethanol cotton ball with tweezers, and hold the cup with the facing down, after the cotton ball is ignited, immediately sway down in the cup and then exit, and quickly buckle the cup to the skin lesions area. (3) After using the cup to absorb the skin lesions area, hold the cup body in one hand and push and pull the cup along the certain route with a little strength, so that the skin purple color of the treatment area is suitable. (4) Apply even force when pushing the cup to prevent the cup from falling off due to air leakage. (5) Acting on the skin lesions area 30 times, change cup 5 times per push and pull, the interval is not more than 10 seconds.</description>
