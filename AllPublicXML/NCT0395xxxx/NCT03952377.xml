      This is a Phase I/II, double-blind, parallel-group, randomized, placebo-controlled
      multi-centre trial in 180 patients randomized 1:1:1 to receive the IMP (Dexamethasone acetate
      microspheres for extended-release injectable micro-suspension, SX600 at 12.5 mg or 25.0 mg)
      or Placebo (0.9% Sodium Chloride for Injection, BP) via transforaminal epidural injection to

    <description>SF-36 is a self-administered, generic health status questionnaire consisting of 36 questions that measure 8 health concepts: physical functioning, bodily pain, role limitations due to physical health problems, role limitations due to personal or emotional problems, emotional well-being, social functioning, energy/fatigue, and general health perceptions. The total score will be reported and the range of possible total scores is 0 to 100. A high score defines a more favorable health state.</description>
