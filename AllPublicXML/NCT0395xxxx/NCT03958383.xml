    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial is designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose or the maximum
      administered dose of intratumoral administration of hu14.18-IL2 and to evaluate side effects
      of intratumoral hu14.18-IL2 when given alone, after radiation therapy, after radiation
      therapy and in combination with nivolumab, and after radiation therapy and in combination
      with nivolumab and ipilimumab in patients with melanoma that is advanced (stage IV) or with
      melanoma that cannot be removed by surgery and is considered surgically incurable.
      Hu14.18-IL2 is a molecule called a fusion protein that can bind to some tumor cells and cause
      immune cells to become activated to kill tumor cells. Radiation therapy is a type of cancer
      treatment that uses beams of high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors.
      Immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as nivolumab and ipilimumab, can help
      the body's immune system attack cancer by releasing the &quot;brakes&quot; on the immune system to
      allow cancer fighting immune cells to remain activated. This study will evaluate whether
      giving intratumoral hu14.18-IL2 with radiation therapy, nivolumab and ipilimumab has
      antitumor activity for participants with advanced melanoma.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 30 days, every 12 weeks
      for up to 2 years, and then every 6 months thereafter.

      II. Evaluate pathologic (tissue) evidence of immune response at the injection site and
      untreated sites.

      III. Evaluate PFS, CB and duration of response to hu14.18-IL2 in combination with palliative

      vitro cellular, serologic and flow cytometry immune assays.

      VIII. Evaluate for histological evidence of antitumor activity based on the presence of
      necrotic tumor cells, inflammatory infiltrate, cellular phenotype of infiltrate, and presence
      of hu14.18-IL2 within the tumor at selected post-treatment timepoints.

      IX. Evaluate circulating tumor cells, exosomes, endogenous antibodies, and/or
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) as exploratory biomarkers associated with clinical response to
      IT-hu14.18-IL2 in combination with RT, nivolumab and ipilimumab.

      X. Evaluate serial peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples to monitor the induction
      of T cell responses to melanoma-associated antigens.

      XI. Evaluate objective tumor responses, both locally and systemically (by immune-related
      response criteria), in Phases IA, IB and IC of this trial (involving IT-hu14.18-IL2 alone and
      in combinations with palliative RT, and with palliative RT and nivolumab, respectively).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of hu14.18-IL2 fusion protein.

      PHASE IA: Participants receive hu14.18-IL2 fusion protein intratumorally (IT) once daily (QD)
      on days 1-3. Treatment repeats every 21 days for cycles 1-4. Participants who are eligible
      may continue to receive hu14.18-IL2 fusion protein maintenance therapy QD on days 1-3
      beginning with cycle 5. Maintenance cycles repeat every 28 days for up to 13 cycles in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. A total of 9-18 participants will be
      enrolled in 3 escalating dose levels to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)/Maximum
      Administered Dose (MAD) of hu14.18-IL2 in Phase IA.

      PHASE IB: Participants undergo palliative RT on days -8 to -4 of cycle 1 only. Participants
      also receive hu14.18-IL2 fusion protein IT as in phase IA. Treatment with hu14.18-IL2 repeats
      every 21 days for cycles 1-4. Participants who are eligible may continue to receive
      hu14.18-IL2 fusion protein maintenance therapy QD on days 1-3 beginning with cycle 5.
      Maintenance cycles repeat every 28 days for up to 13 cycles in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. The MTD/MAD of IT-hu14.18-IL2 following palliative RT
      will be determined starting 1 dose level below the Phase IA determined MTD/MAD of
      IT-hu14.18-IL2 up to the Phase IA determined MTD/MAD.

      PHASE IC: Participants undergo palliative RT on days -8 to -4 of cycle 1 only. Nivolumab (3
      mg/kg) is given every 2 weeks for up to 1 year with the initial dose given between day -7 and
      day -1 of cycle 1. Participants also receive hu14.18-IL2 fusion protein IT as in phase IA.
      Treatment with hu14.18-IL2 repeats every 21 days for cycles 1-4. Participants who are
      eligible may continue to receive hu14.18-IL2 fusion protein maintenance therapy QD on days
      1-3 beginning with cycle 5. Maintenance cycles repeat every 28 days for up to 13 cycles in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The MTD/MAD of IT-hu14.18-IL2
      following palliative RT in combination with nivolumab will be determined starting 1 dose
      level below the Phase IB determined MTD/MAD of IT-hu14.18-IL2 up to the Phase IB determined
      MTD/MAD.

      PHASE ID: Participants undergo palliative RT on days -8 to -4 of cycle 1 only. Nivolumab (1
      mg/kg) in combination with ipilimumab (3 mg/kg) is given every 3 weeks for 4 cycles with the
      initial dose given between day -7 and day -1 of cycle 1. Following 4 cycles, no additional
      ipilimumab will be administered. Following cycle 4, maintenance nivolumab (3 mg/kg) can be
      given for up to one year. Participants also receive hu14.18-IL2 fusion protein IT as in phase
      IA. Treatment with hu14.18-IL2 repeats every 21 days for cycles 1-4. Participants who are
      eligible may continue to receive hu14.18-IL2 fusion protein maintenance therapy QD on days
      1-3 beginning with cycle 5. Maintenance cycles repeat every 28 days for up to 13 cycles in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The MTD/MAD of IT-hu14.18-IL2
      following palliative RT in combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab will be determined
      starting 1 dose level below the Phase IC determined MTD/MAD of IT-hu14.18-IL2 up to the Phase
      IC determined MTD/MAD. A total of 28 participants will be enrolled at the Phase ID MTD/MAD of
      IT-hu14.18-IL2.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must have histologically proven, malignant melanoma, that is advanced (stage
             IV) or is unresectable and therefore considered surgically incurable

          -  Subject's disease must be measurable by immune-related RECIST criteria using clinical
             assessments or imaging

          -  Subjects must have at least one (1), but preferably two (2), sites of readily
             accessible, superficial disease (i.e., cutaneous, subcutaneous, and/or
             readily-palpable lymphadenopathy) that are amenable to repeated hu14.18-IL2 injections
             and two (2) to four (4) biopsies (designated Lesions A (index lesion) and B). These
             lesions must be at least 1 cm, but no greater than 5 cm, in longest diameter.

               -  If there are two lesions, one will be injected with hu14.18-IL2 and undergo
                  biopsies. The second will not undergo injections with hu14.18-IL2, but will
                  undergo two biopsies and be observed clinically. It is preferable, but not
                  required, that these lesions have not received prior RT.

          -  Subjects must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of
             0 or 1

          -  Subjects must have received or declined at least one FDA approved immunotherapy
             treatment demonstrating an impact on survival (i.e: anti-CTLA-4 antibody, anti-PD-1
             antibody, IL2, etc).

          -  Subjects with Central Nervous System (CNS) metastases are eligible if the CNS lesions
             are stable for at least 2 months and if tapered off treatment doses of systemic
             corticosteroids for at least 2 weeks prior to enrollment on the trial. Management with
             maintenance physiologic doses of corticosteroids is acceptable.

          -  Subjects to be entered into Phase IB, IC and ID must be evaluated by a radiation
             oncologist and determined to have a need for palliative RT based on current or
             imminent symptoms at a tumor site that is also injectable. If palliative RT is needed
             to one or more disease sites, a separate site of disease that does not require RT must
             remain to enable assessment of systemic disease response.

          -  Subjects must have adequate bone marrow, liver, and renal function as defined by:

               -  Total White Blood Cell (WBC) &gt; 3,000/mm3 (or total neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/mm3),
                  platelets &gt;100,000/mm3, and hemoglobin &gt; 10 g/dL.

               -  AST/ALT ≤ 3 x the upper limit of normal. Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x the upper limit
                  of normal (&lt; 3.0 mg/dL for subjects with Gilbert's Syndrome).

               -  Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x the upper limit of normal

          -  Subjects with a history of ischemic cardiac disease must complete a stress
             radionuclide scan with results that show no evidence of myocardial ischemia or heart
             failure, as well as normal pulmonary function

          -  Subjects must be willing and able to provide informed written consent for the study.

          -  Subjects must have no immediate requirements for palliative chemotherapy, or surgery.
             Subjects in Arm 1A must have no immediate requirement for palliative RT.

          -  Subjects must be willing and able to discontinue antihypertensive medications if
             advised to do so for the days of hu14.18-IL2 administration.

          -  Subjects must have a washout period of at least 28 days between any prior systemic
             anti-cancer therapy (including immunotherapies) and the first dose of study drug(s).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with a diagnosed auto-immune disease (exceptions: subjects with controlled
             diabetes mellitus type I, thyroid disease, vitiligo and alopecia areata not requiring
             treatment with immunosuppressants are eligible)

               -  Subjects with a history of diabetes mellitus requiring systemic therapy within
                  the past 3 months (i.e. either oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin) must have a
                  documented Hemoglobin A1c &lt;8.0% at the time of enrollment.

          -  Subjects with known genetic conditions causing pre-disposition to RT toxicity (i.e:
             Li-Fraumeni, ATM deficiency, active scleroderma, etc).

          -  Subjects who cannot provide independent, legal, informed consent.

          -  Women of childbearing potential will be excluded if they are pregnant, nursing, or not
             willing to use effective contraception, as discussed with the treating physician,
             during the treatment period. A negative pregnancy test (serum or urine) is required
             for women of child bearing potential within 14 days before study registration.

               -  A person of childbearing potential is anyone (regardless of sexual orientation,
                  gender identity, having undergone tubal ligation, or remaining celibate by
                  choice) who was born with a uterus and at least one ovary and meets the following
