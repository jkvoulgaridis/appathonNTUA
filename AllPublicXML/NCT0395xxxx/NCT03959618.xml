  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More and more patients report taking dietary supplements based on herbal medicine,
      aromatherapy, vitamintherapy,... in the course of their detoxifying anticancer chemotherapy,
      to stimulate the immune defenses, to relieve and/or decrease the side effects of chemo or
      even to act against cancer. At European level, there are between 15 and 73% of patients
      treated for cancer taking a dietary supplement (in particular phytotherapy) or a great
      heterogeneity according to the studies. However, there is still little evidence of the
      efficacy of these dietary supplements. A large proportion of patients do not seem to inform
      their doctor about the use of dietary supplements. Patients using dietary supplements most
      often ignore the mode of action of these products and generally say they are not informed.

      In 2015, at the West Cancerology Institute (ICO), 5 patient files were analyzed taking this
      type of treatment in addition to chemotherapy; in 2016, 24 files; 2017, 61 patient records
      and this continues to progress.

      At the same time, a product appears very frequently associated with cancer chemotherapy:
      Desmodium Adscendens, an African plant with in vitro properties of liver protector. The
      Desmodium contains triterpene saponins, alkaloids, flavonoids, polyphenols, and tryptamine
      derivatives.

      Morevover, several situations of patients undergoing chemotherapy and taking long-term
      Desmodium, with hepatic cytolyses were experienced, not explained by the usual treatments
      (case described in the literature).

      Therefore, this study will evaluate these new therapeutic modalities that are included in the
      intake of chemotherapy in order to better know them to improve the therapeutic taking of
      patients and to focus on the impact of Desmodium in association with chemotherapy.

      -  Determine the quantitative impact of the use of dietary supplements by patients with
           breast cancer and treated in a neo-adjuvant and/or adjuvant condition by IV chemotherapy
           in day hospital.

        -  Determine an over-risk of disruption of liver balance in the population of patients
           taking Desmodium.

        -  Gather a critical mass of relevant information with the objective of carrying out the
           evaluation and analysis of cancer care practices related to the intake of dietary
           supplements.
