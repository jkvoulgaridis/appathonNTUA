  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of digital self-questionnaires adapted to elderly patients but also to BrC and Bac
      could detect the toxicities of chemotherapy and we formulate the hypothesis that the
      continuous monitoring of these different variables in elderly patients treated with
      chemotherapy is possible and acceptable to this population.
