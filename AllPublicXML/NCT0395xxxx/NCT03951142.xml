  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An open-label, single institutional phase II trial of losartan in patients with primary and
      metastatic brain tumors with an individual stepped-wedge, randomized, assessor-blinded,
      dose-finding design on three indications.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For this study losartan, an angiotensin-II inhibitor, is defined as the Investigational
      Medicinal Product (IMP). The focus of the study is to assess the dose-response relationship
      of losartan on imaging-based measures of tissue perfusion and mechanical forces in patients
      with brain tumors. We hypothesize that losartan improves the effect of traditional cancer
      treatment by alleviating mechanical forces (solid stress) of the tumor microenvironment to
      improve tissue perfusion, while administration of losartan alone has little effect on cancer
      patients.

      This is an open-label study and no active comparator or placebo will be used. Study
      participants include adult patients with newly diagnosed- and recurrent glioblastoma, as well
      as adult patients with metastatic brain tumors from non-small cell lung cancer. The study
      will assess the safety of losartan treatment and its dose-response relationship on
      conventional and experimental radiographic characteristics when used alone or as an add-on to
      standard cancer treatment.

          7. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase
             deficiency or glucosegalactose malabsorption should not take this medicine

             determined by the treating physician

          9. Patients with evidence of recurrence less than 3 months since last radiotherapy

             limit compliance with study requirements as determined by treating the physician

         12. Patients suffering from aortic or mitral stenosis, or obstructive hypertrophic
