    <textblock>
      The proposed study tests the effects of a novel remotely-delivered group cognitive behavioral
      stress management (R-CBSM) intervention on improving health and quality of life in older
      women undergoing breast cancer (BCa) treatment. This study tests if delivered home-based
      group CBSM (R-CBSM) improves response to influenza vaccine (IV) in parallel with improved
      psychological adaptation, inflammation and other immune functioning indicators in older women
      treated for BCa.
