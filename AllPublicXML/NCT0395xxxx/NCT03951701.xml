      The study will unfold in the followed day hospital's departments of the Paul Strauss Cancer
      Center (Strasbourg, France) : supportive care department, chemiotherapy department and
      radiotherapy department. The study is based on two questionnaires that include six sections :
      nutrition, social, psychologic, physiotherapy, pain and supportive care needs evaluation.

      The first questionnaire gives information about the patient and allow to screen supportive
      care needs. It should be read by medical or paramedical staff who report the function of the
      reader and options that are proposed to the patient after reading the questionnaire.

      The second questionnaire will be done after 4 to 6 weeks by a phone call from the clinical
      research nurse. The objective of this questionnaire is to determine what kind of care have
      been provided.

    <description>Assess the percentage of using oncological supportive cares after evaluation of supportive care needs reviewed by a professional. The use of supportive cares is evaluated with an hetero-questionnaire created for this study. The hetero-questionnaire consists in a phone call to evaluate the evolution of each item of the self-assessment questionnaire (which includes 6 evaluations : a nutritional evaluation (10 items), a social evaluation (8 items), a psychologic evaluation (6 items), a physiological evaluation (7 items), a pain evaluation (4 items) and a supportive care needs evaluation (6 items)).</description>
