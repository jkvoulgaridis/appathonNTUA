  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common cause of vaginal discharge among repro-ductive
      aged women. It is been linked to adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. Our objective is to
      evaluate if the use of a single dose of metronidazole in women with BV at time of delivery
      reduces infectious morbidities

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are proposing a double-blinded, placebo controlled, randomized trial of 525
      pregnant women undergoing induction or admitted in early labor and who are diagnosed with
      bacterial vaginosis. On admission to labor and delivery, patient will be counseled about the
      study. Patients who agree to be enrolled, will sign informed consent. Following enrollment
      patients will be screened for Bacterial vaginosis by doing a speculum exam and testing for
      Amsel's criteria. BV +ve patients will be randomized to receive either metronidazole 2 grams
      PO once or identically appearing placebo. The PI, study coordinator, or a collaborator will
      be responsible for the informed consent.

      This will be a double-blinded randomized clinical trial. Neither the patient nor provider
      will be aware of treatment assignment. As with any other in-stance in which antibiotics are
      administered, there is a chance of an allergic or other adverse reaction. The patient will
      receive standard inpatient monitoring during the labor course and in the postpartum period,
      and so any immediate adverse reaction would be promptly detected.

      Patient will be assessed intrapartum for development of chorioamninoitis. Postpartum patient
      will be assessed for infective complications up to 4 weeks. Neonates will be assessed for
      morbidities by chart review for 90 days.
