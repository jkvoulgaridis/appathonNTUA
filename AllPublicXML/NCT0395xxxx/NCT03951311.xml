  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metabolic abnormalities (e.g., hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and obesity)
      and unhealthy lifestyle behaviors (e.g., smoking and drinking habits, sedentary behavior,
      sleep disorder and physical inactivity) and unhealthy diet (e.g., high sugar and high fat)
      are major risk factors for cardiovascular diseases mobility and mortality. The investigators
      sought to estimate the impact of metabolic abnormalities, lifestyle behavior and diet pattern
      on prognosis of heart failure. This study planned to consecutively enroll 1,500 participants
      with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction fulfilling the inclusion criteria. Each
      heart failure survivors will be followed up for 5-10 years. Information on metabolic
      diseases, lifestyle and diet pattern were obtained through standardized questionnaire. The
      major adverse cardiac events will be identified by reviewing pertinent medical records and
      discharge lists from the hospitals, or official death certificates collected at local death
      registration centers, or directly contacting participants' family. The Cox proportional
      hazard model will be used to assess the association between metabolic risk factors and
      lifestyle and diet habits and health outcomes in heart failure patients.
