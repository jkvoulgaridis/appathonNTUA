  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex disease whose evaluation in daily practice
      and clinical research requires consideration of several aspects, in particular disease
      activity and quality of life.

      Health systems are increasingly using Patient Reported Outcome measures (PRO) data to measure
      different dimensions of the disease and its experience.

      In addition, there is a growing number of &quot;e-health&quot; tools for patients. Indeed, the
      collection of health-related data via an electronic system makes it possible to modernise and
      facilitate communication between patients and doctors within the framework of medical
      follow-up and therapeutic education. Nevertheless, very few studies measure the acceptability
      and effective long-term use of such tools, particularly in the context of SLE.

      The Sanoïa patient platform is a digital tool already used in therapeutic areas similar to
      SLE (discoid lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis), offering a guarantee of safety
      and a reduced individual cost.

      The availability of this health-related quality of life data collection tool via a site and a
      mobile application adapted to patients with SLE should:

        -  Facilitate the collection by patients of their quality of life as part of their routine
           follow-up (patient access)

        -  Limit the impact of patients' clinical profiles on the frequency of the collection of
           quality of life data

        -  Enable internal medicine specialists to systematically use their patients' quality of
           life data during consultation (physician access).

      This study therefore proposes to evaluate this digital platform within the framework of SLE
      by measuring the distribution of access by physicians according to the data reported by
      patients and according to the characteristics of the facilities where the subjects were
      recruited for the study. These data will allow us to evaluate the influence of factors
      extrinsic to patients on the adoption of the tool. This area has been very poorly evaluated
      in the few studies that have focused on the adoption of such tools.
