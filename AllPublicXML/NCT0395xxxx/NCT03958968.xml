  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The concept of sensitive or reactive skin was evoked in 1947 and developed in the 1970s and
      is now widely recognized. The international pruritus society has proposed an international
      consensus definition: sensitive skin is defined as a syndrome manifested by the occurrence of
      unpleasant sensations (tingling, burning, pain, pruritus, tingling) in response to stimuli
      that normally do not not cause such sensations. The triggering factors can be cosmetics,
      water, cold, heat, temperature variations, wind ... etc.

      The physiopathological mechanisms are debated and several hypotheses exist. Sensitive skin
      can be considered as a decrease of the threshold of cutaneous tolerance. Sensitive skin is
      linked to abnormalities of the cutaneous nervous system, which becomes hyper-reactive. This
      hyperreactivity can be modulated by multiple factors. Exposure to cosmetics could be one of
      the main triggers for sensitive skin, especially for women. This can be explained by the wide
      use of cosmetics (in France women apply an average of 16 different cosmetics per day), by
      overconsumption of cosmetics, by exposure to potentially irritating ingredients. Sensitive
      skin would be less tolerant to the frequent and prolonged use of cosmetics. However, no
      precise information is available on the actual consumption of cosmetic products in the
      population with sensitive skin, in particular no data exists concerning the type of products
      used, the criteria of choice of products, the daily number of products used. and the
      ingredients contained in these cosmetics

      Objectives are:

      To compare the consumption of cosmetics qualitatively and quantitatively in a group of
      subjects with sensitive skin in the face and scalp, with a group of subjects with
      non-sensitive skin Study of triggers of sensitive skin Localization of sensitive skin in the
      face Resonance of sensitive skin Duration of onset of skin sensitivity after application of
      the cosmetic Use of organic products, formulated for sensitive skin, for children Shopping
      venues for cosmetics Advice from a professional for the purchase of cosmetics Impact of
      sensitive skin on the use of cosmetics Budget dedicated to the purchase of cosmetics
