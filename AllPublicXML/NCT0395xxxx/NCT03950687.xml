      A phase 2, randomized, open label, active comparator parallel controlled study to explore the
      dosage regiment of rESP, and evaluate its efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetic
      characteristics in the treatment of anemia in chronic renal failure patients with
      hemodialysis

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this phase 2, open label, active comparator parallel controlled study, patients were
      randomly assigned to three study groups: one active comparator control group (rHu EPO,
      maintaining the same dose and frequency administrated in the sceening period ), and two
      experimental groups (0.5μg/kg ,once a week; 1.0μg/kg , once every two weeks). All the
      patients were administered intravenously for 32 weeks and were evaluated the efficacy, safety
      and pharmacokinetic characteristics. During the whole study period, dosage adjustment was not
      allowed in the first 4 weeks, while in the remaining trial period dosage adjustment was
      allowed once every two weeks if necessary.
