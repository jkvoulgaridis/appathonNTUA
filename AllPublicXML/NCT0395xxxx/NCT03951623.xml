  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled phase Ib clinical trial in adult
      patients with immune thrombocytopenia. The trial has two parts: dose escalation (stage 1) and
      dose expansion (stage 2). No cross-over treatment will be allowed during the study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximate 51 to 60 patients will be enrolled in dose escalation (3 cohorts, 8 subjects each
      with the ratio of 3:1 vs Placebo) and dose expansion (1 cohort, 27-36 subjects with the ratio
      of 2:1 vs Placebo).
