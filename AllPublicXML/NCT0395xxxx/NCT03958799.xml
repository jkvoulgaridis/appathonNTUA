      The primary objectives of this study are:

        -  To describe the safety profile of each of the investigational vaccine formulations for
           all participants

        -  To describe the humoral and cell-mediated immune responses to all of the investigational
           vaccine formulations

        -  To evaluate the dose response to vaccine components

        -  To describe the magnitude, quality, and longevity of immune responses to each of the
           investigational vaccine formulations

        Inclusion criteria :

          -  Individuals born in Canada and vaccinated with a combination vaccine in accordance
             with the National Immunization Program (NIP).

          -  Aged ≥ 19 years and &lt; 22 years on the day of inclusion.

          -  Pregnant, or lactating, or of childbearing potential and not using an effective method
             of contraception or abstinence from at least 4 weeks prior to the first vaccination
             until at least 3 months after the last vaccination. To be considered of
             non-childbearing potential, a female must be pre-menarche, or post-menopausal for at
             least 1 year, or surgically sterile.

          -  Participation at the time of study enrollment (or in the 4 weeks preceding the first
             trial vaccination) or planned participation during the present trial period in another
             clinical trial investigating a vaccine, drug, medical device, or medical procedure.

          -  Receipt of any vaccine in the 4 weeks preceding the first trial vaccination or planned
             receipt of any vaccine in the 4 weeks before and/or after any study vaccination except
             for influenza vaccination only, which may be received at least 2 weeks before or 2
             weeks after any study vaccination.

          -  History of autoimmune disorder.

          -  History of cardiovascular disorder.

          -  History of Guillain-Barré syndrome.

          -  Receipt of immune globulins, blood or blood-derived products in the past 3 months.

          -  Known or suspected congenital or acquired immunodeficiency; or receipt of
             immunosuppressive therapy, such as anti-cancer chemotherapy or radiation therapy,
             within the preceding 6 months; or long-term systemic corticosteroid therapy
             (prednisone or equivalent for more than 2 consecutive weeks within the past 3 months).

          -  Known systemic hypersensitivity to any of the vaccine components, or history of a
             life-threatening reaction to the vaccine(s) used in the trial or to a vaccine
             containing any of the same substances.

          -  Laboratory-confirmed/self-reported thrombocytopenia, contraindicating intramuscular
             vaccination.

          -  Bleeding disorder or receipt of anticoagulants in the 3 weeks preceding inclusion,
             contraindicating intramuscular vaccination.

          -  Chronic illness that, in the opinion of the investigator, is at a stage where it might
             interfere with trial conduct or completion.

          -  Moderate or severe acute illness/infection (according to investigator judgment) on the
             day of vaccination or febrile illness (temperature ≥ 38.0 C). A prospective
             participant should not be included in the study until the condition has resolved or
             the febrile event has subsided.

          -  Identified as an Investigator or employee of the Investigator or study center with
             direct involvement in the proposed study, or identified as an immediate family member
             (ie, parent, spouse, natural or adopted child) of the Investigator or employee with
             direct involvement in the proposed study.
