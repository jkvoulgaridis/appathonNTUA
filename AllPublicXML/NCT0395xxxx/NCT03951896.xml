  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was done to investigate whether platelet rich plasma(PRP) injections are effective
      in the management of adhesive capsulitis of the shoulder(AC).Patients were randomized to 2
      groups, and one group took PRP injections for 3 times every two weeks, while the other group
      took saline injections in same frequency and volume. A standardized exercise programme was
      also applied to all patients.

      Patients were then evaluated with Shoulder Pain and Disability Index(SPADI), Visual analogous
      scales for pain and disability, Ranges of Movements and use of analgesics in before, after
      and 3rd month of the therapy.

    <measure>Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) is a tool to assess pain and disability in patients with shoulder pain, which was extensively used in studies involving AC of the shoulder6, 15, 16. It consists of 5 questions in pain domain, and 8 questions in disability domain, which were expressed in a visual analogous scale.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analogous Scales for pain</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patients were asked to describe their pain, level of disability or treatment satisfaction on a 10 cm long line, with 0 point being &quot;none&quot;, and 10 cm point being &quot;highest possible&quot;. The proximity of the marked point to the 0 end was measured, and the results were recorded</description>

    <measure>Shoulder ranges of motions</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Shoulder range of motions were also evaluated at the time points that were mentioned, as secondary outcome measures. All of the measurements were done accordingly to the guidelines of American College of Orthopedic Surgeons by a conventional goniometer18, 19. The researcher who obtained the measurements was an experienced therapist in this field, and was blind to the treatment groups.</description>

    <description>Subjects were also asked about their needs of analgesic usage, namely acetaminophen. They were asked to write down each time they took an acetaminophen tablet of 500 mgs. The results were recorded as miligrams.</description>

    <description>Interventions:
A venous blood sample of 8.5 ml were obtained from all patients. For the treatment group, the blood samples were treated with 1.5 ml ACD-A or sodium citrate to achieve anticoagulation. The blood was then centrifugated for 5 minutes with RCF 1200 G velocity to clump red blood cells, and then centrifugated for 10 minutes in same velocity to obtain platelet concentrate. 2 ml's of the resulting platelet rich plasma was injected to the shoulder of the subjects.</description>
