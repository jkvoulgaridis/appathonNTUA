  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim of this trial is to define if Post-Operative Cognitive Dysfunction and Delirium, detected
      analyzing changes between pre-operative and post-operative Neurocognitive Test, relate to
      concentration of effector's site concentration of propofol and remifentanil TCI and to the
      common intraoperative neuromonitoring values.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Post-Operative Cognitive Dysfunction and Emergence Delirium has not been yet investigated
      after general anaesthesia with Targeted-Controlled-Infusion (TCI), daily used in the
      investigator's Hospital to anesthetize patients undergoing spinal surgery. Aim of this trial
      is to define if neurocognitive tests (Pfeiffer test, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Trail
      Making Test A and B, Digit Span Test, Confusion Assessment Method) before and after surgery
      relate to concentrations at effector's site (Ec) of propofol and remifentanil TCI, the values
      of Bispectral Index, blood pressure values and usage of drugs to increase arterial blood
      pressure.

        Patients subjected to spinal surgery in general anaesthesia anesthetized with propofol and
        remifentanil delivered by Targeted-Controlled-Infusion (TCI) pumps. Women will be subjected
        to neurocognitive tests (MOCA, TMT A and B, DST, Pfeiffer, CAM) the day before surgery, 15
        and 60 minutes after awakening (only CAM) and on the first post-operative day. These test
        will be related to propofol and remifentanil concentrations at effector site during surgery
        and awakening, to BIS and Entropia values and to intraoperative blood pressure values.
