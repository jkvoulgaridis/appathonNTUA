      Evaluate the impact of a six-week group drumming intervention on fatigue, anxiety, and
      cognitive impairment when compared to an attentional control for cancer patients who have
      undergone at least one treatment session of chemotherapy or radiation therapy.

      The AIMS related to specific outcomes are:

      To explore impact of group drumming on fatigue and anxiety severity levels and change
      patterns over time as compared to an attentional control group.

      Hgain: Drumming yields greater mean overall improvement on fatigue and anxiety than does
      attention control.

      Hpersistence: The mean trend and projected duration of benefit with drumming are more
      positive than that of the control treatment.

      Hheterogeneity: Participants receiving either intervention will vary in the extent of their
      benefit, as quantified in gain and trend variance.

      Exploratory AIMs. To explore whether cancer patients, who participate in a 6-week group
      drumming intervention, will show improvement in cognitive function, as measured by the
      Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cognition (FACT-COG). To explore impact on group
      drumming and positive affect as measured by Positive Affect &amp; Well-being Scale-Short Form
      (PAW-SF) and Core Flow States (C FSS).

      The impact of group drumming on fatigue, anxiety, and cognitive impairment severity levels
      and change patterns over time will be compared to an attentional control group. Two aspects
      of an individual's response are relevant: the degree of overall treatment impact (gain) and
      the mean rate-of-change post-baseline (trend). Fatigue will be analyzed by looking at gain
      and trend of individual FACIT-F scores at 3 weeks, 6 weeks, and 8 weeks after group has ended
      between intervention and attention control groups. Anxiety will be analyzed by looking at
      gain and trend of individual using STAI scores at 3 weeks, 6 weeks, and 8 weeks after group
      has ended between intervention and attention control groups. Cognitive impairment will be
      analyzed by looking at gain and trend of individual using FACT-COG scores at 3 weeks, 6
      weeks, and 8 weeks after group has ended between intervention and attention control groups.

      Analysis model. The two primary outcomes of fatigue and anxiety will be analyzed using a
      mixed effects linear model that assumes individual longitudinal responses, conditional on
      baseline values, are generated by treatment assignment, and time since baseline.
      Specifically, the post-baseline measures at three, six, and eight weeks after the last group
      ends will be analyzed by examining the difference in mean adjusted gains and trends. In
      randomized controlled trials with no missing baseline observations, the analysis of mean
      treatment arm differences in baseline-conditioned obtained scores defines the most efficient
      primary endpoint available for evaluation of treatment impact with continuous variables
      (Fairclough 2010). In addition, the comprehensive model describes the systematic variation in
      individual gains and time trends within and across treatment arms. Since baseline
      observations are required for conditioning, however, responses cannot be analyzed when the
      baseline is missing. A generalization of this model, sometimes termed Constrained
      Longitudinal Data Analysis, or cLDA, is a likelihood-based variation of this model, and is
      preferred by statisticians for analysis of randomized trials.

      The key statistical questions for the primary outcomes concern whether the mean adjusted gain
      (overall likelihood-based mean difference from expectations, given the baseline) and the mean
      rate-of-change post-baseline differ between treatment arms. The former speaks to the overall
      impact; the latter to the duration of this impact. Moreover, individual differences in both
      gain and trend can be superimposed on the average population effects to distinguish
      individual responses from random measurement and other errors. The individual degree of
      longitudinal benefit can be estimated for participants receiving in both interventions to
      describe how two response attributes of people, Gain and Trend, may differ according to
      treatment arm. Using such a clinical impact analysis model will allow the study to show
      individual responses related to who is benefitting, how much they are benefitting so that
      responses can be viewed based on trend and adjusted gain (or loss). The following hypotheses
      will be evaluated by using constrained likelihood-based longitudinal data analysis: H1:
      Drumming yields greater mean improvement on fatigue, anxiety and cognitive impairment than
      does attention control, Himpact: The mean benefit of drumming on fatigue exceeds that of the
      control condition, H2: Participants receiving either intervention will vary in the extent of
      their benefit, Hpersistence: The mean rate-of-change with drumming is more positive than that
      of the control treatment, Hheterogeneity: Patients receiving either intervention vary in the
      extent of their benefit. This is directly quantified in the two variance components for gain
      and trend. Data will be analyzed using SPSS Mixed and SAS Proc Mixed programs.

      Plan to recruit 120 participants (n=60 treatment, n=60 control) allowing for 20% drop out to
      yield 50 per group. The power calculations for participants were based upon power simulations
      conducted using an appropriately parameterized mixed effects linear model allowing for 20% to
      drop out to yield an analysis sample of 100 (50 per group). The sample size of N=50 per group
      is large enough to detect reasonable population effects while also permitting a reasonable
      range of individual differences.

    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 weeks, 6 weeks, and 8 weeks after group has ended between intervention and attention control groups.</time_frame>
    <description>Anxiety will be analyzed by looking at gain of individual State section of State Trait Anxiety Inventory-State Scale (STAI) scores at 3 weeks, 6 weeks, and 8 weeks after group has ended between intervention and attention control groups. The STAI-form Y-1 will be used to measure state anxiety. It has been used with cancer patients to measure state anxiety with a Cronbach's alpha score of .94 for state anxiety. STAI-form Y-1-inventory consists of 20 anxiety questions like &quot;I feel calm&quot; with participants rating their answers on a four-point Likert scale (1=not at all, 4=very much so). STAI-Y has a minimum score of 20 to a maximum score of 80. STAI scores are commonly classified as &quot;no or low anxiety&quot; (20-37), &quot;moderate anxiety&quot; (38-44), and &quot;high anxiety&quot; (45-80).</description>

    <measure>Positive affect of group drumming will be measured over time using the Positive Affect &amp; Well-being Scale-Short Form (PAW-SF).</measure>
    <time_frame>1st week, 3 weeks, and 6 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by Positive Affect &amp; Well-being Scale-Short Form (PAW-SF). The 9-item positive affect and well-being short form (PAW-SF) was developed to measure positive affect, life satisfaction, and an overall sense of purpose and meaning and responds to longitudinal changes as a result of a treatment with test-retest reliability of 7 days (Salsman et al., 2013). The test-retest correlation coefficients range from 0.59 to 0.86 and the Cronbach's alphas ranges from 0.94 to .095. Raw scores range from 9 to 45, T-scores range from 26.3 to 68, and Standard Errors range from 3.9 to 4.5 (the higher scores result in a better outcome).</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Having a sense of flow during group drumming will be measured by the Core Flow States Scale (C FSS).</measure>
    <time_frame>After each group drumming session (6 weeks).</time_frame>
    <description>The Core Flow States Scale (C FSS) was based upon the work of the Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi who developed the concept of flow to describe the sense of being totally absorbed in a way that feels positive and the scale has been determined to be a valid and reliable measure to capture one's subjective state of being in flow. Internal consistency estimates ranged from .91 to .94. There are 10 questions with five choices ranging from 1 = strongly disagree to 5=strongly agree. Summed scores range from 10 to 50 and each individual sum is divided by 10 resulting in a final score of 1 being the lowest and 5 being the best score to measure a sense of flow.</description>
