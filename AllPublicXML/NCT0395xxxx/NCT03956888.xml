  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a condition defined as a disease state
      characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. The airflow limitation is
      usually progressive and is associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of lungs to
      noxious particles or gases, primarily caused by cigarette smoking. The accelerated decline in
      lung function is closely associated with an increased number of neutrophils in the sputum and
      hence with higher level of airway inflammation. It becomes clear that the inflammatory
      process potentiates as COPD progresses and exerts damage which is irreversible. Oxidative
      stress is inextricably linked to the inflammatory response.

      There is increasing evidence that an oxidant/antioxidant imbalance, in favor of oxidants,
      occurs in COPD.

      NAC has been reported to reduce the viscosity of sputum in both cystic fibrosis and COPD,
      facilitating the removal of pulmonary secretions. Moreover, by maintaining the airway
      clearance, it prevents bacterial stimulation of mucin production and hence mucus
      hypersecretion.

      The superiority of NAC over the other mucolytics may be in its anti-inflammatory and
      antioxidant properties and its mucolytic actions.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of treatment with NAC long on oxidative
      stress marker change and also explore the effect of NAC to airway inflammatory, lung function
      test and CAT scores. Selected oxidative stress marker was defined as 8 - isoprostane, protein
      carbonyl, DNA damage.

    <description>To measure the number of Neutrophil in sputum before and after treated with NAC long in patients in this study, Reduce from first measurement.
Total cell counts are recorded with on a hemocytometer, using Kimura staining. Cell viability is determined by Trypan blue exclusion before cytospins were undertaken. The slides are stained with May-Grunwald-Giemsa stain and differential cell counts were made by a blinded observer. Four hundred inflammatory cells are counted on two slides for each sample in a blinded manner. Differential cell counts are expressed as the percentages of total Neutrophil will be reported.
Samples with cell viability of greater than 70% and less than 30% squamous cell contamination are considered adequate for analysis.</description>

    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To measure the COPD Assessment Test (CATTM) before and after treated with NAC long in patients in this study.
CATTM is Patient-completed questionnaire assessing globally the impact of COPD (cough, sputum, dyspnea, chest tightness) on health status of COPD patient.
The minimum score is Zero (0) and the maximum score is Forty (40). Please see the correlation of score and impact level as in below table.
CAT score
Impact level
&gt;30 = Very high
&gt;20 = High
10-20 = Medium
&lt;10 = Low
5 = -
In each question, there are score from 0 to five, the higher values represent the worse current situation. Score from each question will be summed then interpret based on CATTM Healthcare Professional User Guide ,Reduce test score from first measurement will be reported.</description>
