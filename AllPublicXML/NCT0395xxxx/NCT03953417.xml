  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates an accelerated schedule of theta-burst stimulation using a transcranial
      magnetic stimulation device for treatment-resistant bipolar depression. In this open-label
      study, all participants will receive accelerated theta-burst stimulation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an established technology as therapy
      for treatment-resistant depression. The approved method for treatment is 10Hz stimulation for
      40 minutes over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC). This methodology has been
      very successful in real-world situations. The limitations of this approach include the
      duration of the treatment (approximately 40 minutes per treatment session over 4-6 weeks).
      Recently, researchers have aggressively pursued modifying the treatment parameters to reduce
      treatment times with some preliminary success. In a recent study, the investigators applied
      this accelerated paradigm in individuals with treatment-resistant depression (TRD), which
      showed a significant antidepressant effect (90% remission rate). Additionally, 5 participants
      from this study carried a bipolar TRD diagnosis and responded at minimum, equally as well,
      with no adverse events experienced or manic/hypomanic conversion observed during the
      treatment series. This study intends to further modify the parameters to create a more rapid
      form of this treatment for bipolar TRD, and look at the change in clinical measures and
      neuroimaging biomarkers.

    <measure>Change from baseline Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and immediate post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) is one of the most frequently utilized rating scales to assess manic symptoms. The scale has 11 items and is based on the patient's subjective report of his or her clinical condition.
There are four items that are graded on a 0 to 8 scale (irritability, speech, thought content, and disruptive/aggressive behavior), while the remaining seven items are graded on a 0 to 4 scale. These four items are given twice the weight of the others to compensate for poor cooperation from severely ill patients.
Typical YMRS baseline scores can vary a lot. They depend on the patients' clinical features such as mania (YMRS = 12), depression (YMRS = 3), or euthymia (YMRS = 2).</description>

    <description>A suicidal ideation rating scale created by researchers at Columbia University.
A trained rater will administer the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). This questionnaire was developed to rate suicidal ideation and behavior.
It rates a person's degree of suicidal ideation on a scale, ranging from &quot;wish to be dead&quot; to &quot;active suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent and behaviors.
The scale identifies specific behaviors which may be indicative of a person's intent to complete suicide. An person exhibiting even a single behavior identified by the scale was 8 to 10 times more likely to complete suicide.</description>
