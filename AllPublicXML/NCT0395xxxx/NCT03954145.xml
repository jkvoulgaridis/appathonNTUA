  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At the completion of orthodontic treatment, the position of the mandibular canines and
      incisors is being maintained on a routine basis by bonding a multi-braided wire retainer onto
      their lingual surfaces. One of the adverse events that might occur with time is the debonding
      of the wire from one or several lower anterior teeth . This event which can unfortunately get
      unnoticed by the patient can lead to unwanted tooth displacement. When the practionner
      detects such a debonding, he has to go through a laborious and lengthy procedure to rebond
      the wire. When on the other hand the patient notices himself such a debonding, he is to call
      in emergency his practitioner to get his retainer repaired. This leads to emergency visits
      that are susceptible to affect adversely his timetable. The prevalence of these bonding
      failures is estimated at 37% at 18 month follow-ups. It has been reported that with prior
      enamel sandblasting, bonding failure rate is reduced to 8% at 24 month follow-ups. However,
      no study has reported yet the debonding rate of lower fixed, comparing wires that have been
      bonded after prior enamel pumicing to those that were put in place after prior enamel
      sandblasting.

      The expected result of this trial is a significantly decrease in bonding failure rate of
      mandibular lingual retainer when enamel surfaces are initially sandblasted compared to the
      ones which are pumiced. This reduction would lower the risk of unwanted tooth movement of
      mandibular incisors and canines after orthodontic treatment and decrease the number of
      emergency appointments for the patient and the practitioner.
