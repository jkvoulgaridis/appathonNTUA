    <textblock>
      The current study will explore the efficacy, safety and tolerability of 2 dose combinations
      of JM-010 to determine the optimal doses of each component to be studied in confirmatory
      clinical trials.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel
      group, multicentre study.

      Subjects with a diagnosis of moderate to severe dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease (PD) will
      complete a Screening Visit to assess eligibility to participate in the study.

      Subjects will continue with their usual levodopa treatment regimen for the duration of study
      participation.

      The screening assessment period will be a minimum of 1 week up to a maximum of 6 weeks.
      Subjects deemed to be eligible at the end of the Screening Visit will be randomly assigned in
      a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either 1 of the 2 dose combinations of JM-010 and 1 placebo, or 2
      placebos as per the double-dummy study design. The randomized subjects will be followed
      treatment periods for 12 weeks and safety follow periods for 2 weeks, including
      pharmacokinetic (PK) sub-study.

    <description>To compare the efficacy of JM-010 to that of placebo therapy in reducing dyskinesia severity in Parkinson's Disease by evaluating the total score mean change from Baseline to Week 12 in the sum of the items comprising UDysRS. The scoring range is 0-104, and a higher score indicates more severe dyskinesia.</description>

    <description>To compare the efficacy of JM-010 to that of placebo therapy in relation to improvement in clinician-reported PD symptoms as measured by CGI-C score at Week 12. The CGI-C uses the following ratings: 0=not assessed; 1=very much improved; 2=much improved; 3=a little improved; 4=no change; 5=minimally worse; 6=much worse; and 7=very much worse.</description>
