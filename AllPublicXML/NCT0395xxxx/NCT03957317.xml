  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This investigation will be a randomized interventional prospective quality improvement study.
      Patients undergoing plastic surgery with flap procedures (n =123) will be randomized to
      evaluate the effect of the implementation bundle for sleep quality improvement in the
      surgical intensive care unit (SICU). Roughly one half of the patients (n =62) will be
      randomized to the intervention group. This group will receive the intervention bundle which
      consists of providing ear plugs and eye masks to patients and their family members. Roughly
      one half of the patients (n =62) will be randomized to the control group. This group will
      receive &quot;usual care&quot;, which does not include ear plugs or eye masks and lacks specified times
      for laboratory draws and imaging studies. For each of the two groups, the investigators will
      collect Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire (RCSQ) scores, Confusion Assessment Method for
      the ICU (CAM-ICU) scores, and modified Family Satisfaction in the Intensive Care Unit
      (FS-ICU) scores. The investigators will administer the RCSQ to these patients following every
      night they spend in the SICU and the FS-ICU questionnaire immediately prior to their
      discharge from the ICU.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be identified during their presurgical clinic visit or anesthesia preoperative
      clinic visit for eligibility. The electronic medical record (Epic) will also be used for
      prescreening of potential study participants by reviewing the clinic visit daily schedule or
      operating room schedule. Then patient charts will be reviewed for initial data collection to
      determine the eligibility of potential subjects with the use of a HIPAA waiver form.

      A discussion of risks, benefits, and alternatives will be performed. Following the
      discussion, informed written consent for clinical care and participation in the study will be
      obtained.

      Roughly one half of the patients (n =62) will be randomized to the intervention group. This
      group will receive the intervention bundle which consists of providing ear plugs and eye
      masks to patients and their family members. Roughly one half of the patients (n =62) will be
      randomized to the control group. This group will receive &quot;usual care&quot;, which does not include
      ear plugs or eye masks and lacks specified times for laboratory draws and imaging studies.
      For each of the two groups, the investigators will collect RCSQ scores, CAM-ICU scores, and
      modified FS-ICU scores. The investigators will administer the RCSQ to these patients
      following every night they spend in the SICU and the modified FS-ICU questionnaire
      immediately prior to their discharge from the ICU. The RCSQ is a short, 5-question, validated
      survey instrument for measuring sleep quality in ICU patients. The FS-ICU is a short,
      validated survey instrument for measuring family satisfaction with care and decision making
      in the ICU. The modified version is more focused on satisfaction of the patient rather than
      their family member(s). The CAM-ICU is a validated screening test for delirium, and scores
      are currently charted in the electronic medical record (EMR) as a part of routine monitoring
      in the SICU. The anticipated length of time for the project is 28 weeks.

    <measure>Improvement in Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire (RCSQ) scores</measure>
    <time_frame>2 days from ICU admission</time_frame>
    <description>The Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire (RCSQ) is a 5-item questionnaire used to evaluate perceived sleep depth, sleep latency, number of awakenings, efficiency, and sleep quality. Each RCSQ question is measured on a 0 (minimum) to 100 (maximum) visual-analogue scale, with higher scores representing better sleep. The primary outcome measure is a 25% increase in median RCSQ scores from the control group.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Improvement in overall modified Family Satisfaction in the Intensive Care Unit (FS-ICU) survey scores</measure>
    <time_frame>2 days from ICU admission</time_frame>
    <description>The Family Satisfaction in the Intensive Care Unit (FS-ICU) questionnaire is a reliable and valid 34-item tool used to measure family satisfaction with care and decision-making in the ICU. Each question is completed using a 5-point Likert scale where 1 = excellent, 2 = very good, 3 = good, 4 = fair, 5 = poor, and 6 = not applicable. A modified version of the FS-ICU survey used in the present study includes 14 questions and contains only questions directed toward the patient and not family members. Overall satisfaction score is calculated as the mean of the 14 items, with lower scores indicating greater satisfaction. A secondary outcome measure is to determine the difference in overall modified FS-ICU scores between control and intervention groups.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Improvement in positive Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) scores</measure>
    <time_frame>2 days from ICU admission</time_frame>
    <description>The Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) is a valid and reliable delirium monitoring instrument for ICU patients. It tests for the presence of alteration in mental status, inattention, altered level of consciousness, and disorganized thinking. The presence of both altered mental status and inattention along with either altered consciousness or disorganized thinking corresponds to a positive CAM-ICU result, and delirium is present. If these criteria are not met, then CAM-ICU is considered negative, and delirium is absent. A secondary outcome measure is to determine the difference in positive CAM-ICU results between control and intervention groups.</description>
