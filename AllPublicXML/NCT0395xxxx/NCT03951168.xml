      Through the construction and study of standardized diabetic health education management
      model. Routine diabetes health education management model was used in control group and
      standardized diabetes mellitus health education management model was used in intervention
      group. The changes of diabetic knowledge, self-management ability, quality of life,patient
      empowerment, HbA1c, and other metabolic indexes were observed.

      The aim was to develop a standardized patient education model reflecting the core educational
      elements recommended by Chinese diabetes society guideline, which could be delivered by
      nurses to hospitalized diabetes patients, and which could be easily scaled-up and implemented
      in China tier 3 hospital setting.

      Management mode of standardized diabetes mellitus health education in intervention group.The
      control group carries on the routine diabetes mellitus health education management. In
      intervention group , All participants received Management mode of standardized diabetes
      mellitus health education.The standardized patient education included one-week personalized
      education on diabetes knowledge, diet and excise, glucose monitoring and hypoglycemia
      self-management and others during the hospitalization period. After discharge, patients were
      followed through the phone call at 2and 4 weeks. Follow-up of diabetic education outpatients
      at 12 and 24 weeks after discharge. The education nurse gave recommendations according to
      patent's problem during the follow-up. Full-time education nurses carry on education
      according to diabetes mellitus health education path table. In routine, After
      hospitalization, the responsible nurses interspersed with diabetes health education during
      the hospitalization. The health education is mainly about the problems observed by the
      responsible nurses and the problems raised by the patients. The patients were followed up by
      telephone 2 weeks after discharge.
