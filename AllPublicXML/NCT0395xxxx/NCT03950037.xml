  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subarachnoid neurocysticercosis (SANCC) is a severe infection of the brain by the tapeworm
      Taenia solium. People who have this infection are usually diagnosed late in the disease
      process leading to very poor prognosis. This trial studies the safety of early medical
      intervention in people who have SANCC but do not have symptoms. The trial will enroll 18
      participants in Peru.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To estimate the risk of serious adverse events (SAE) related to intervention in
      asymptomatic SANCC; these include drug-related side effects, moderate/severe intracranial
      hypertension, hydrocephalus requiring shunting or endoscopy, stroke, status epilepticus, or
      unexplained death.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants will be hospitalized for approximately 15-30 days while they receive treatment
      with the antiparasitic drug albendazole, as well as additional drugs (dexmathesaone and
      omeprazole) to address potential treatment complications. Participants will have continuous
      monitoring for adverse events while in the hospital. After participants are released to home,
      they will monitored for adverse events for an additional 12 months through home visits,
      telephone contact, and monthly clinical evaluations with serologic and radiologic assessment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female individuals older than two years with a diagnosis of asymptomatic SANCC
             confirmed by MRI.

          -  SANCC limited to the basal cisterns, the interhemispheric brain space, brain fissures
             or spine.

          -  Baseline laboratory results within acceptable ranges (specifically defined in the
             study protocol)

          -  Willingness to accomplish the two-week minimum hospitalization required.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Individuals who only have subarachnoid lesions in the convexity of the brain
             hemispheres will not be included because these lesions commonly respond well to
             therapy and behave as intraparenchymal lesions

          -  Co-occurrence of a) more than 20 intraparenchymal lesions in addition to their
             subarachnoid disease, or b) intraparenchymal lesions greater than 3.0 cm of diameter

          -  Individuals for whom a surgical intervention to treat their subarachnoid disease is
             considered clearly superior to a medical intervention

          -  Previously diagnosis or treatment for cysticercosis.

          -  Active pulmonary tuberculosis evidenced by chest X-ray and positive sputum smears, or
             symptoms compatible with tuberculosis (fever+sweats or fever+cough) not otherwise
             explained

          -  Individuals with positive markers for active hepatitis

          -  Other systemic disease that may affect therapy or short-term prognosis, including but
             not limited to chronic renal failure, hepatic insufficiency, cardiac failure, or
             steroid-dependent immune diseases

          -  Pregnancy. If a participant becomes pregnant during the study, she will continue in
             the study but will have radiological exams delayed until after delivery

          -  History of hypersensitivity to ABZ

          -  Chronic alcohol or drug abuse as defined in the study protocol

          -  Unwilling or unable to provide MRI exams (e.g. patients with ferromagnetic implants)

          -  Inability or unwillingness of subject or legal representative to give written informed
             consent.
