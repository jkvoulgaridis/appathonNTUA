  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postprandial lipemia produced by fat intake is a major risk factor for the development of
      cardiovascular diseases (CVD), the most important cause of disease and death in the Western
      world. Scientific evidence shows that the consumption of saturated fatty acids has a
      potential harmful effect on postprandial lipemia compared to the intake of monounsaturated
      fatty acids. The magnitude of postprandial lipemia is also determined by the health status of
      individuals, being altered in individuals with metabolic disorders associated with the
      development of CVD, such as hypertriglyceridemia.

      Palm oil is widely used in bakery products because it is more economical compared to other
      fats and oils of other origin and for its stability properties that contribute to this type
      of food. This oil has a profile of fatty acids, rich in saturated fatty acids, mainly
      palmitic acid, which as mentioned above, is associated with health alterations. In addition,
      the investigators must add the environmental problems that are generated by the massive
      cultivation of the plant from which palm oil is extracted (oil palm Elaeis guineensis),
      including the loss of thousands of hectares of tropical forest and endangering to dozens of
      animal species from deforested areas.

      The proliferation of all these arguments associated with the effect on the health and
      environment of the consumption of palm oil has given way to a paradigm shift in the use of
      palm oil in the food sector.

      The hypothesis of the study is that consumption of bagels with a composition optimized in
      fatty acids, eliminating the content of palm oil and replacing it with high oleic sunflower
      oil and stearic acid completely hydrogenated without trans fatty acids, so that the same
      amount of fat is maintained, will decrease the postprandial lipemia, compared to the
      consumption of bagels with a more conventional composition in fatty acids, in healthy and /
      or with mild-moderate hypertriglyceridemia individuals.

      The main objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of acute consumption of bagels
      without palm oil in its formulation and with an optimized fatty acid composition on
      postprandial lipemia measuring the evolution of plasma triglyceride levels in healthy and/or
      with mild-moderated hypertriglyceridemia individuals.
