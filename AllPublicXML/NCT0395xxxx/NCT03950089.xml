  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCT-A) is a noninvasive imaging technique that
      allows one to see blood vessels in the retina. The investigating team used this approach in
      patients with acute, recurrent and persistent subtypes of Central Serous Chorioretinopathy
      (CSC) to check for possible Choriocapillaris hypoperfusion. The presence or absence of these
      microvascular changes was explored in both eyes of the patients and compared to a control
      group of healthy volunteers. The possibility of a correlation between Choriocapillaris flow
      deficits, age and spontaneous resolution of serous retinal detachment was also evaluated.
      This study was conducted in an effort to improve one's understanding of this disease and
      other pachychoroid disorders.

    <description>Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCT-A) images were acquired using an Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography device (Cirrus High Definition OCT Model 5000 with Angioplex; Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, California, USA). With an acquisition speed of 68,000 A-Scan per second, the OCT Microangiography Complex algorithm provided OCT-A information for three-dimensional (3D) flow reconstruction. At each visit, each subject underwent a 3 x 3 millimeter (mm) macular 3D cube acquisition in both eyes. FastTrac continuous eye tracking technology was employed to control for eye movements and minimize motion artefacts.</description>
