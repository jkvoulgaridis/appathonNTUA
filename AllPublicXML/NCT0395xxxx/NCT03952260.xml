    <textblock>
      The study is aim to investigate the appropriate fasting time for clear fluid in paediatric
      patients who plan for elective minor surgery.

      This is a randomize control trial, which patient will be selected randomly to fast for clear
      fluid for 1 hour or 2 hours.

      It is important to determine the gastric residual volume for paediatric age group prior to
      elective minor surgery in order to determine whether the difference between 1 hour fasting
      and 2 hour fasting for clear fluid is significant.

      This study is to evaluate the latest fasting protocol that is currently adopted and
      recommended by United Kingdom, France and Royal Children Hospital Melbourne.

      The research question is should investigator change fasting protocol for paediatric patients
      prior to operation.

      The anaesthesia service is being studied. Participants are patients who are 5-16 years old
      are planned for elective minor surgery in ent, eye, dental surgery, general surgery and
      orthopaedics.

      This study will be done in UMMC. 2 groups of patients will be recruit which consists of 50
      patients each. Each of the group will be instructed to fast for clear fluid for 1 hour or 2
      hours prior to surgery. Prior to induction, the amount of abdominal contents was examined
      using ultrasound scan. In addition, patients anxiety level prior to and 1 hour post general
      anaesthesia will be assess. Also, parents of patients will complete a questionnaire after the
      surgery to assess parental satisfaction toward anaesthesia service.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Gastric residual volume by ultrasound after application of clear fluid fasting for 1 hour versus 2 hours prior to general anaesthesia</measure>
    <time_frame>Prior to induction of general anaesthesia</time_frame>
    <description>We use ultrasound to evaluate gastric volume We scanning distal parts of the stomach-antrum in a semi-sitting or RLD position.
A linear high-frequency (e.g. 5-12 MHz) transducer can be used in leaner or paediatric patients or to obtain detailed images of the gastric wall(4-6mm).
Antral cross sectional area(CSA) can be measured by using two perpendicular diameters and the formula of the area of an ellipse: CSA=(AP×CC×π)/4 (AP=antero-posterior diameter and CC=craniocaudal diameter)
GV (ml)=27.0+14.6×right-latCSA−1.28×age(Perlas and colleagues formula)
Total gastric residual volume is then divide by body weight to get ml/kg, the lower the value the better the outcome.
Referance standard is gastric residual volume acquired through nasogastric suction using nasogastric tube.
Result of &gt;1.5ml/kg show that patient posed risk of aspiration, result of &gt;1ml/kg is significantly increase in this study</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anxiety level of patients by short version of(mYPAS)modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale after application of clear fluid fasting for 1 hour versus 2 hours prior to paediatric general anaesthesia</measure>
    <time_frame>Prior to induction of general anaesthesia and 1 hour post anaesthesia</time_frame>
    <description>Total score from 22.916(minimum score= least anxiety level/total relaxation) to 100 (maximum score= maximum anxiety level/ panic attack)
Total score is obtained from 4 subscale as describe below:
A. Activity (1-4) B. Vocalizations(1-6) C. Emotional expressivity(1-4) D. State of apparent arousal (1-4) Total score: Divide each item rating by the highest possible rating (i.e., 6 for the &quot;vocalizations&quot; item and 4 for all other items), add all of the produced values, divide by 4, and multiply by 100</description>

    <measure>Parental satisfaction by questionnaires after application of clear fluid fasting for 1 hour versus 2 hours prior to paediatric general anaesthesia</measure>
    <time_frame>2 hours to 24 hours post anaesthesia</time_frame>
    <description>Total score from 20(minimum score= not satisfy) to 100 (maximum score= highly satisfy) Total score is obtained from 11 answer to the 11 questions
each of the answer will be score as: Strongly Agree(5 )- Agree(4 )- Neither Agree nor Disagree(3)- Disagree(2) -Strongly Disagree(1) except answers for questionnaire number 3,6,8 will be score as: Strongly Agree(1 )- Agree(2 )- Neither Agree nor Disagree(3)- Disagree(4) -Strongly Disagree(5) Total score calculation: Divide each item rating by 5, add all of the produced values, divide by 11, and multiply by 100</description>
