    <textblock>
      Prospective, monocentric, randomized phase II study evaluating Low-Level Laser Therapy (LLLT)
      as a treatment for the pain due to grade 2 oral mucositis in patients with upper
      aero-digestive tract cancer treated by radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy.

      Patients with upper aero-digestive tract cancer receiving their first cervicofacial
      radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy will be included in this study if they suffer from oral
      mucositis due to their treatment.

      The study procedure will consist in 5 applications of the LLLT that will be performed at
      three days intervals for a maximum duration of 15 days.

      Each patient will be followed until 3 days after the end of the study treatment, for a total
      duration of the study of 18 days.
