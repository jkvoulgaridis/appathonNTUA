  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of REGN5069 compared to
      placebo in patients with pain due to radiographically-confirmed OA of the knee who have a
      history of inadequate joint pain relief or intolerance to current analgesic therapy.

      The secondary objectives of the study are:

        -  To characterize the concentrations of functional REGN5069 in serum over time when
           patients are treated for up to 12 weeks

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of REGN5069 compared with placebo when patients
           are treated for up to 12 weeks

        -  To measure levels of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) against REGN5069 following multiple IV
           administrations
