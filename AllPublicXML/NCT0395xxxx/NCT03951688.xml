      -  Aim: To evaluate the short-term effects of a 16 weeks home-based multi-modal exercise
           program on physical performance variables in community-dwelling older adults.

        -  Design: randomized controlled trial.

        -  Setting: home-based intervention.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Timed 'Up-and-Go' test (TUG)</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The participants are instructed to stand up from a standard chair of 45 cm height, walk 3 metre, turn around a cone, return to the chair, and sit down again in the shortest time possible without running. Two trials are performed, and the quicker time in seconds is recorded. Shorter time indicates better performance.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Repeated chair stand test (STS-5)</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The participants are instructed to stand from a chair five successive times as quickly as possible without the assistance of their arms. Shorter time indicates better performance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>One-Leg Stand test (OLS)</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants are instructed to start the test from a standing position with their eyes open and arms at their sides, choose a leg to stand on, flex the opposite knee, allowing the foot to clear the ground, and stand unassisted on one leg as long as possible. Longer time indicates better performance.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Each home-based session (48) starts with 7 minutes of moderate warm-up exercises focusing on mobility and flexibility. Secondly, the strengthening exercises consist of knee extensions, knee flexions, hip abductions, ankle plantar flexions, and ankle dorsiflexions. Thirdly, a set of balance exercises including knee bends, backwards walking, walking and turning around, sideways walking, tandem stance, tandem walk, one leg stand, heel walking, toe walking, toe to heel walking backwards, sit-to-stand, and stair walking.
Finally, participants are instructed to walk at their usual pace for at least 10 minutes.</description>
