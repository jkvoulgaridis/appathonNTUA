  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The central hypothesis guiding this project is that having mothers view live video of their
      babies while they are pumping increases milk volume, caloric density, and maternal pumping
      experience.

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will be randomized to the order of Intervention and Control pumping session. Excluding the first pumping session of the day, as the volume is highest at that time and more consistent throughout the rest of the day. All 30 mothers will be asked to A (Control): Pump three times while they are away from their infant without using FamilyLink for video observation of their baby during pumping and B (Intervention): Pump three times while they are away from their infant, while watching their baby via FamilyLink.</intervention_model_description>
