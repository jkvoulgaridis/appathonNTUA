  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study assesses the effect of a new vibration system on pain reduction during the
      injection of local anesthesia. Children undergoing dental treatment are allocated to two
      groups; one receiving the Buzz, a vibration system and another group receiving nothing. Pain
      during injection of local anesthetic is assessed using a validated tool in addition to
      assessment of child cooperation during treatment.

      Eligibility of children for inclusion into the study will be assessed followed by random
      sequence generation and randomization into one of the two study group and allocation
      concealment. Topical anaesthesia will be administered to the two groups followed by
      implementation of the vibration system in the test group. . Behavior and pain will assessed
      at the time of injection.

    <time_frame>Procedure (immediately after the administration of Dental anesthesia)</time_frame>
    <description>Self reported pain intensity before the injection and directly after the injection. Each child scored pain intensity twice, one before the injection and one directly after the injection (0=no pain; 10=Very painful).</description>

    <measure>Parents Perception for the child tolerance of pain; Observational Pain rating scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Procedure (immediately after the administration of Dental anesthesia.)</time_frame>
    <description>The parents were asked about the reaction and attitude of the child during the dental anesthesia administration. Parents rated the child ability to tolerate pain with (0=Didn't Tolerate and 10= Tolerated with a smile)</description>

    <measure>External observation for Facial and Physical expression. Using Sounds, Eyes, and Motor (SEM) scale (RANGE 0-9).</measure>
    <time_frame>Procedure (immediately during and after the administration of Dental anesthesia.)</time_frame>
    <description>Video was recorded for each child before, during and after the administration of local anesthesia. Each video was assessed by an external calibrated evaluator to score each child response. SEM (0=Comfortable, with no sound, no eye signs of discomfort and Hands are relaxed, no apparent body tenseness, 9= Painful, with verbal complain, crying tears and moving the hands to make aggressive physical contact and pulling the head away. The lowest record mean the child was comfortable and the higher the score mean the child experienced discomfort.</description>

    <measure>Faces Legs Activity Cry Consolability (FLACC) Scale (RANGE 0-10)</measure>
    <time_frame>Procedure (immediately during and after the administration of Dental anesthesia.)</time_frame>
    <description>Video was recorded for each child before, during and after the administration of local anesthesia. Each video was assessed by an external calibrated evaluator to score each child response. FLACC (0=The child did not express any facial discomfort with normal legs position no abnormal activity, not crying and relaxed. The highest score 10= Child experienced discomfort, moving his legs jerking crying and difficult to console. The lowest record mean the child was comfortable and the higher the score mean the child experienced discomfort.</description>
