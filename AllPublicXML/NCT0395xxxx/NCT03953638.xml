  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pathogen identification is of paramount importance for bacterial meningitis. At present, the
      pathogen of bacterial meningitis is still mainly based on Gram stain and bacterial culture.
      However, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture can be negative in children who receive antibiotic
      treatment prior to CSF examination.Because of the limitations of clinical laboratory testing,
      more than half of the central nervous system infection cases cannot be clearly diagnosed. The
      emergence of powerful next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology have enabled unbiased
      sequencing of biological samples due to its rapid turnaround time. Previous reports highlight
      the feasibility of applying NGS of CSF as a diagnostic method for central nervous system
      (CNS) infection. However, the majority of reports are comprised of single case reports and
      few studies have been reported in the application of NGS for pathogen detection from CSF
      samples of bacterial meningitis patients, especially in pediatric populations. In this study,
      we would like to use the NGS technology to detect directly from the CSF samples of children
      with bacterial meningitis and evaluate the feasibility and significance of the NGS technique
      on the pathogenic identification of bacterial meningitis.

      Bacterial meningitis, also known as purulent meningitis, is caused by a variety of bacterial
      infections. Although the incidence in infants and children has decreased since the use of
      conjugated vaccines targeting Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), Streptococcus pneumoniae
      (S. pneumoniae) and Neisseria meningitides (N. meningitides), bacterial meningitis continues
      to be an important cause of mortality and morbidity in neonates and children throughout the
      world. The causative pathogens of bacterial meningitis depend on different age of the patient
      and predisposing factors.

      Pathogen identification is of paramount importance for bacterial meningitis. At present, the
      pathogen of bacterial meningitis is still mainly based on Gram stain and bacterial culture.
      However, CSF culture can be negative in children who receive antibiotic treatment prior to
      CSF examination.Because of the limitations of clinical laboratory testing, more than half of
      the central nervous system infection cases cannot be clearly diagnosed. Although non-culture
      methods including multiplex PCR and latex agglutination, etc. have been used in clinical
      microbiology, only one or several specific pathogens could be targeted by these kinds of
      technology, let alone rare pathogens.

      In recent years, the emergence of powerful NGS technology have enabled unbiased sequencing of
      biological samples due to its rapid turnaround time. Wilson et al presented a case of
      neuroleptospirosis, resulting in a dramatic clinical improvement with intravenous penicillin
      after identifying leptospira infection in the CSF by unbiased NGS technology. Unbiased NGS
      could facilitate identification of all the potential pathogens in a single assay
      theoretically. Herpes simplex virus1, herpes simplex virus 2 and human herpes virus type 3
      were detected using NGS technology from four cases with clinically suspected viral
      meningoencephalitis respectively. And the results were further validated using polymerase
      chain reaction (PCR). Further, Yao et al detected Listeria monocytogenes in CSF from three
      patients with meningoencephalitis by NGS. These reports highlight the feasibility of applying
      NGS of CSF as a diagnostic method for central nervous system (CNS) infection. However, the
      majority of reports are comprised of single case reports and few studies have been reported
      in the application of NGS for pathogen detection from CSF samples of bacterial meningitis
      patients, especially in pediatric populations. In this study, we would like to use the NGS
      technology to detect directly from the CSF samples of children with bacterial meningitis and
      evaluate the feasibility and significance of the NGS technique on the pathogenic
      identification of bacterial meningitis.

    <description>We aim to collect samples cerebrospinal fluid from patients with Pediatric Bacterial Meningitis. Next-generation sequencing will be performed on the collected samples. Our analysis of the sequencing results will focus on the analysis and identification of pathogen genes and will compare the diagnostic performance of next-generation sequencing with conventional etiological diagnostic methods. We anticipate that next-generation sequencing in Pediatric Bacterial Meningitis will show a greater diagnostic value than the traditional methods (including culture, special pathogen antigen, PCR detection of nucleic acids, etc.).</description>
