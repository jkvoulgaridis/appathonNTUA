  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical study is to investigate the safety, tolerability, and
      feasibility of Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and ventral
      internal capsule (VC) for participants with treatment refractory opioid use disorder (OUD)
      who have cognitive, behavioral, and functional disability. This study will also provide
      critical information for planning subsequent clinical trials.

  <detailed_description>

      The overarching goal of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, feasibility and
      impact on outcomes of NAc/VC DBS for treatment refractory OUD. In treatment refractory OUD,
      innovative approaches and more invasive interventions including DBS are warranted to improve
      outcomes.
