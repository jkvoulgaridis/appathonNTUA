  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High rates of Veteran suicide remain a tragedy. Rates of Veteran suicide have not decreased
      for 10 years, despite the best efforts of the field. Those interventions that do exist have
      only modest effects, which are simply insufficient for the magnitude of the problem. This
      proposal will combine two treatments - brief cognitive behavioral therapy (BCBT) and
      repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Both of these interventions can reduce
      suicide and are available at Veterans Affairs Medical Centers across the country, yet to date
      no one has combined these therapies. This proposal will test the effect of this combination,
      and, if successful, will lead to a novel yet implementable new treatment to reduce Veteran
      suicide.

      The goal of the proposed study is to test the effect of adding Transcranial Magnetic
      Stimulation (TMS) to Brief Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (BCBT) to reduce Veterans' rates of
      suicide ideation and related behaviors. Over 20 Veterans die each day of suicide and rates
      have not appreciably decreased in the last ten years.

      BCBT is a well-established and efficacious treatment that is an extension of Cognitive
      Behavioral Therapy, a treatment that is widely implemented across VA health care systems.
      However, not all patients respond to BCBT. Thus finding ways to enhance treatment efficacy
      for reducing suicide is critical. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) may be an optimal
      treatment to use in conjunction with psychotherapy. TMS is a noninvasive technique that uses
      a pulsed magnetic field to induce neuronal depolarization in a targeted brain region,
      typically the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. TMS can reduce psychiatric symptoms
      associated with suicide risk in Veterans, including depression and PTSD. Furthermore, TMS is
      not associated with the systemic and costly side effects associated with medications used for
      these disorders (e.g., weight gain, diabetes, sexual side effects).

      The primary objective of this study is to conduct a fully-powered randomized controlled trial
      evaluating the effect of adding a standard TMS course of treatment to BCBT to reduce suicide
      behaviors in a sample of Veterans hospitalized for suicide behavior. One hundred and thirty
      (130) Veterans admitted to the psychiatric unit for suicide ideation or attempts will be
      randomly assigned to either active TMS plus BCBT or to sham TMS plus BCBT. Participants will
      be assessed at baseline, post treatment, six, and 12 months post hospital discharge. Efficacy
      of the program will be determined by examining a primary suicide composite outcome and
      several secondary outcomes including suicide attempt, time to first attempt, number of
      re-hospitalizations and severity and severity of suicidal ideation. Secondary analyses will
      be conducted to help identify the types of patients who will receive the most benefit from
      the addition of TMS to BCBT Brief Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for suicide.

      If successful, this study would result in a combined treatment to decrease suicide ideation
      and related behaviors. The proposal addresses HSRD post-deployment health priority,
      specifically suicide prevention and is innovative in that it will be the first study to
      examine efficacy of combined treatment specifically for suicide prevention.

    <intervention_model_description>130 Veterans admitted to the Providence VAMC psychiatric inpatient unit due to suicide attempt or ideation with intent to make an attempt will be recruited and randomly assigned to receive: a) active TMS+BCBT or b) sham TMS+BCBT. Both interventions will begin within the week following hospital discharge, and Veterans will be followed for 12 months post-discharge.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Prior to each TMS session, un-blinded study staff will attach the appropriate (i.e., active or sham) coil according to the participants' randomization code (obtained from the urn randomization computer program). This will facilitate &quot;triple blind&quot; stimulation, where the participant, TMS provider, and outcome rater are blind to group assignation.</masking_description>

    <measure>Change in Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Interview administered assessment of suicide ideation and behavior. The interview consists of two subscales, an ideation and behavior subscale. The severity of ideation subscale is rated on a 5-point ordinal scale: 1 = wish to be dead, 2 = nonspecific active suicidal thoughts, 3 = suicidal thoughts with methods, 4 = suicidal intent, and 5 = suicidal intent with plan. The suicidal behavior subscale is rated on a nominal scale that includes actual, aborted, and interrupted attempts; preparatory behavior; and nonsuicidal self-injurious behavior.</description>

    <measure>Change in Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (SSI)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>A 21-item interview administered measure. The first 5 items are screeners (wish to live, wish to die, and desire to attempt suicide), followed by 14 items to assess suicidal risk factors. The last 2 items capture previous suicide attempts.
Each item is rated on a 3-point scale ranging from 0 to 2 according to suicidal intensity. The SSI is scored by adding up the ratings (0-2) from the first 19 items.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        -Suicide attempt or suicidal ideation with intent to make a suicide attempt within 48 hours
        of hospitalization as indicated on the hospital chart and confirmed by administration of
        the C-SSRS.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Primary psychotic disorder

          -  Bipolar disorder

          -  Cognitive impairment which would interfere with adequate participation in the project
             (MMSE &lt; 20).

          -  For safety, participants must meet established screening criteria safety during MRI,
             which is implemented as a conservative measure given the application of TMS in this
             population, since MRI involves magnetic fields at similar intensity to those emitted
             from the stimulation coil. These measures require a patient not having the following
             (unless MRI-safe):

               -  Cardiac pacemaker

               -  Implanted device (deep brain stimulation) or metal in the brain, cervical spinal
                  cord, or upper thoracic spinal cord.

          -  TMS-specific exclusions are:

               -  pregnancy/lactation, or planning to become pregnant during the study

               -  lifetime history of moderate or severe traumatic brain injury (TBI)

               -  Current unstable medical conditions

               -  Current (or past if appropriate) significant neurological disorder

               -  Lifetime history seizure disorder

               -  Primary or secondary CNS tumors

               -  Stroke

               -  Cerebral aneurysm.

               -  Other exclusions are conditions that would like to be worsened by TMS, such as
                  bipolar disorder

               -  Place Veterans at greater risk of seizures from TMS, such as severe and
                  uncontrolled substance use disorder

               -  Inability to participate in CBT

               -  Other conditions or circumstance that, in the opinion of the investigator team,
                  has the potential to prevent study completion and/or to have a confounding effect
                  on outcome assessments
