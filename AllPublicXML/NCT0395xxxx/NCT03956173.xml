    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesise that following episodes of hypoglycaemia, rebound
      hyperglycaemia may result in a prolonged period of increased QTc and, thereby, increased
      susceptibility to serious cardiac arrhythmias in patients with type - 1 diabetes.

    <textblock>
      In this study, changes in cardiac rhythm, haemodynamic regulation, and hormonal response will
      be evaluated during insulin-induced hypoglycaemia followed by hyperglycaemia and euglycaemia,
      respectively, on two separate experimental days. Twenty-four patients with type-1 diabetes
      are included. Patients are randomised 1:1 to start with either the combined hypo- and
      hyperglycaemic or the hypo- and euglycaemic clamp. After an overnight 10 hour fast,
      participants are admitted for a 255 minute clamp. An individualised insulin infusion will be
      initiated targeting a plasma glucose level of 5.0-8.0 mmol/l. When the targeted plasma
      glucose level is achieved, the hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp will be initiated at time
      0. The insulin infusion will be fixed at an infusion rate 80 mU/m2/min and a 20% glucose
      infusion will be initiated in order to regulate plasma glucose levels. After 45 min of
      monitoring at euglycaemic plasma glucose level, plasma glucose will be decreased over a
      period of 30 minutes, targeting 2.5 mmol/l for a period of 60 min in a hyperinsulinaemic
      hypoglycaemic clamp. From 135 min to 195 min, plasma glucose levels will be increased to
      either hyperglycaemic level (20mmol/l) or normoglycaemic (6mmol/L) and will be kept constant
      for 105 minutes. Echocardiography is performed at baseline, at hypoglycaemic level and at
      hyper-or normoglycaemic level. Blood samples are taken every 15 minutes throughout the entire
      clamp, however bedside plasma glucose is analysed every fifth minute. A Holter-ECG is
      obtained throughout the entire clamp.
