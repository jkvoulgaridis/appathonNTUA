  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is responsive to the call for obtaining enhanced preliminary data for an
      external grant resubmission. The goal is to demonstrate a novel approach using digital health
      tools to help preserve kidney function. The investigators aim to adapt a previous behavioral
      intervention and conduct formative testing among patients with CKD. Specifically, the
      investigators will:

      Aim 1: Modify an existing technology platform to build the iControl CKD system and adapt
      intervention content to reflect behavioral guidelines for patients with mild to moderate CKD.

      Aim 2: Conduct qualitative interviews and user testing among patients with CKD to obtain
      feedback on the design of the intervention.

      Aim 3: Conduct a prospective cohort feasibility trial to assess the feasibility and initial
      acceptability of the iControl CKD intervention.
