    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the addition of a comprehensive lifestyle program including dietary
      management and exercise to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy in overweighted
      adults with obstructive sleep apnea. Half of the participants will receive CPAP therapy while
      the other half will have diet consultations, nordic walking sessions and CPAP.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While the specific impact of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) on quality of life is well
      established, the impact of CPAP therapy on quality of life remains unclear. Yet, improving
      the quality of life of OSA patient is one of the main targets of treatment.

      Both exercise and healthy diet are recommended in the management of overweight and obesity.
      This should improve quality of life as well as comorbidities associated with sleep apnea.

    <measure>General quality of life: SF-36</measure>
    <time_frame>12 and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Mean difference in the seven other following SF-36 subscales between groups:
Vitality (VT)
physical functioning (PF)
bodily pain (BP)
Role-physical (RP)
Role-emotionale (RE)
Social functioning (SF)
Mental health (MH)
Each subscale ranges from 0 to 100. The higher the score, the better quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Specific quality of life: Calgary Sleep Apnea Quality of Life Index (SAQLI)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Mean difference in the SAQLI global score and score in the domain A, B, C and D between groups.
The SAQLI is a 35-items instrument that captures the adverse impact of sleep apnea on 4 domains:
Daily functioning (A)
Social interactions (B)
Emotional functioning (C)
Symptoms (D)
When the SAQLI is administered after a therapeutic intervention, a fifth domain (E) is completed (Treatment-related symptoms).
Items are scored on a 7-point scale with &quot;all of the time&quot; and &quot;not at all&quot; being the most extreme responses. Item and domain scores are averaged to yield a composite total score between 1 and 7. Higher scores represent better quality of life.
To obtain the global SAQLI score the sum of the mean domain scores A, B, C, and D is divided by 4. If Domain E has been used after a therapeutic intervention, the SAQLI score is obtained by summing the mean domain scores A, B, C, and D, subtracting the mean Domain E score and dividing by 4.</description>

    <measure>Subjective sleep quality</measure>
    <time_frame>12 and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Mean difference in the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score between groups.
The PSQI is a 19-item questionnaire which measures several different aspects of sleep, offering seven component scores and one composite score. The component scores consist of subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction.
Each item is weighted on a 0-3 interval scale. The global PSQI score is then calculated by summing the seven component scores, providing an overall score ranging from 0 to 21, where lower scores denote a healthier sleep quality.</description>

Scores range from 0 to 21 for either anxiety or depression. The higher the scores, the more anxiety and depression symptoms are important.</description>
