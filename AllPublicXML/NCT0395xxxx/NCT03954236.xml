             chronic graft-versus-host disease (diagnosed and BSA calculated in accordance with the
             National Institutes of Health Chronic Graft-versus-Host Disease Consensus for Clinical
             Trials: I. The 2014 Diagnosis and Staging Working Group Report)

          -  Patients age ≥ 18 years must provide written informed consent; or patients age ≥12
             years and &lt;18 years must provide assent and have at least one guardian provide written

          -  If on systemic therapy for GVHD, systemic therapy must be stable for past 4 weeks;
             however, any planned systemic corticosteroid taper during the study will be
             permitted.Changes in systemic therapy during the study period will be allowed for the
             management of non-skin GVHD.

          -  Any concurrent topical therapies including topical corticosteroids, topical
             calcienurin inhibitors, moisturizers, phototherapy (narrowband UVB or UVA1); or
             excimer laser therapy must be discontinued on Study Day 0.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known history of allergy to any ingredient of the study medication

          -  Patients with sclerotic cutaneous graft-versus-host disease including deep sclerotic,
             lichen sclerosus-like, morphea-like subtypes of chronic cutaneous GVHD

          -  Use of concurrent topical therapy including topical corticosteroids, topical
             calcienurin inhibitors, moisturizers, phototherapy (narrowband UVB or UVA1); or
             excimer laser therapy after Study Day 0 up to and including Study Day 28.

          -  Changes in systemic therapy during study period for the purpose of treating skin GVHD.

          -  Special populations:

               -  vulnerable populations e.g. decisionally impaired (cognitive, psychiatric),
                  terminally ill, prisoners

               -  patients who, in the opinion of the investigator have a condition that precludes
                  their ability to provide an informed consent

          -  Concurrent participation in another topical trial of a drug(s) or medical device, or
             the subject is in an exclusion period after a previous trial of drug(s) or medical
             device

          -  Pregnancy or lactation

          -  Patients with inadequate liver function (ALT above 4 × upper limit of normal [ULN] for
             the patient's age or direct bilirubin 4 × ULN for the patient's age and the laboratory
             abnormalities are considered to be due to underlying liver dysfunction) unless
             attributed to GVHD

          -  Active uncontrolled infection requiring systemic therapy. Subjects with a controlled
             infection receiving definitive therapy for 48 hours prior to enrollment are eligible.
