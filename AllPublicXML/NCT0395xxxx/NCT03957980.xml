  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare the efficacy of an in-home telehealth-based intervention to
      standard care for children with cortical visual impairment and their caregivers and to assess
      the feasibility and acceptability of an in-home telehealth-based intervention approach for
      children with cortical visual impairment and their caregivers. This pilot study will utilize
      a randomized two group crossover design with assessment at 4 time periods. The assessments
      will occur at remote locations.

      To improve access to evaluation and treatment, the investigators will be offering remote
      cortical visual impairment clinics to assess children for cortical visual impairment. The
      cortical visual impairment clinics will be organized in public spaces such as school
      buildings, libraries, and/or hospital clinics. Study staff will contact potential clinics,
      buildings, etc., about interest in hosting these remote clinics. The cortical visual
      impairment clinics will be staffed by at least one of the following individuals: an
      ophthalmologist and/or an optometrist, a technician, and an occupational therapist. All
      participants will attend 4 remote cortical visual impairment clinics during the study. Prior
      to the initial clinic visit, the participants will be randomized into either the waitlist
      control group or the intervention group using the list of patients scheduled for the clinic.
      During the initial clinic visit, each child who has been given parental consent will complete
      both an eye exam (either an ophthalmologist or an optometrist) and functional vision
      evaluation with an occupational therapist. Both the eye exam and the functional vision
      evaluation occurring during the clinic visit are the same as would be provided during routine
      clinical care. None of the examinations provided during this research study will be billed
      through insurance. Those who are diagnosed with cortical visual impairment will continue on
      with the study. The intervention group will complete the telehealth intervention sessions and
      the waitlist control group will continue with standard care. All participants will attend
      three additional cortical visual impairment Clinics: one 4 months after the initial
      evaluation (+/- 2 weeks), one 8 months after initial evaluation (+/- 2 weeks) and another 12
      months after the initial evaluation (+/- 2 weeks). During the final three cortical visual
      impairment clinics, the participants will complete and updated Cortical Visual Impairment
      Range and Canadian Occupational Performance Measure with the occupational therapist.

    <measure>Change in Functional Vision as measured by the Cortical Visual Impairment Range</measure>
    <time_frame>Collected at the Initial Remote Clinic and the 4-month follow up clinic for the intervention first group and the 8-month follow up clinic for the no intervention first group</time_frame>
    <description>the Cortical Visual Impairment Range is a reliable assessment utilized to measure functional vision for children with Cortical Visual Impairment.. The Cortical Visual Impairment Range consists of 10 behavioral characteristics common in children with Cortical Visual Impairment. Each behavioral characteristic is rated on a scale from 0-1. The characteristic scores are summed to get an overall score of functional vision. This score will be treated as a continuous variable for analysis.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Individualized, function goals as measured by the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM)</measure>
    <time_frame>The COPM will be completed before the intervention, at month 4 in clinic, month 8 (via phone/ email/ mail) and month 12 in clinic (all +/- 2 weeks).</time_frame>
    <description>The COPM is a valid, reliable, and responsive assessment tool (28-30) that measures the caregiver's perception of the child's performance on goals that are important to the child and his/her caregiver. The COPM will help guide the treatment plan for the Cortical Visual Impairment interventions. Overall satisfaction and performance scores are generated from the COPM and each will be treated as a continuous variable for analysis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Individualized, function goals as measured by the Preverbal Visual Assessment (PreVias)</measure>
    <time_frame>The PreVias will be completed before the intervention, at month 4 in clinic, month 8 (via phone/ email/ mail) and month 12 in clinic (all +/- 2 weeks).</time_frame>
    <description>The PreVias is a questionnaire to be completed by the caregiver. It has 30 questions related to one or more visual domain including visual attention, visual communication, visual-motor coordination and visual processing.</description>

    <measure>Caregiver and Therapist Telehealth Qualitative Data</measure>
    <time_frame>Completed at the end of the Initial Remote Clinic visit (consent is obtained and an eye exam is completed here; the survey is filled out immediately following the eye exam)</time_frame>
    <description>A questionnaire will be given to both the intervention and control group. This survey asks questions regarding the quality and the quantity of information given at the initial evaluation. The survey is in a multiple choice format and the answer options range from Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree (Strongly Agree indicates a positive response.</description>

    <time_frame>Completed at the 4-month Follow Up Remote Clinic for the Intervention First group and completed at the 8-month Follow Up Remote Clinic for the No Intervention First group</time_frame>
    <description>The questionnaire will gather data regarding how the therapist and caregiver felt regarding the number of sessions, the set up, the child's improvement, etc.</description>
