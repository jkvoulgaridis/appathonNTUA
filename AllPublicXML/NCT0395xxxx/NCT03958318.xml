      The objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of a multi-modal group-based exercise
      program and nutritional supplementation on physical performance in frail institutionalized
      older adults.

      Participants will be randomly allocated to the intervention groups; exercise (EG) or exercise
      plus nutritional supplementation (SG), or to the control group (CG). During 6 months,
      participants in the intervention groups will be performing the exercise routine based on the
      Otago exercise programme. Additionally, participants in the SG will receive a daily oral
      nutritional supplement.

      Objectives: Evaluate the effects of a multi-modal group-based exercise program and
      nutritional supplementation on physical performance and the capacity to perform daily tasks
      in frail institutionalized older adults.

      Design: Randomized controlled trial, with a 6-month intervention period. Participants: 122
      frail institutionalized older adults aged 65 and older with no cognitive impairment.

      Intervention: After a baseline assessment, the participants will be randomly assigned to the
      control group or one of two intervention groups; multi-modal exercise program (EG) or
      exercise plus nutritional supplementation (SG). During 6 months, participants in the
      intervention groups will be performing the exercise routine based on the Otago exercise
      programme. Additionally, participants in the SG will receive a daily oral nutritional
      supplement.

      Measurements: The primary outcome measure will be mobility measured with the timed up and go
      test. Secondary outcomes will be the functional balance, hand-grip strength, lower limb
      functional capacity, gait speed and distance covered during the 6-minute walk test.

    <description>The participants will be instructed to stand up from a standard chair of 45 cm height, walk 3 metre, turn around a cone, return to the chair, and sit down again in the shortest time possible without running. Two trials will be performed, and the quicker time in seconds will be recorded.</description>
