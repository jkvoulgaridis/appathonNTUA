    <description>The IGA is an instrument used in clinical trials to rate the severity of the subject's global disease and is based on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe). In this trial, the IGA is a lesion-specific assessment and will be evaluated separately for each of the 2 target lesions.</description>

Lesion-specific AEs are defined as lesional/perilesional AEs (i.e. AE location within the treatment area and/or ≤2 cm from the border of a target lesion).</description>

    <measure>A ≥2-point reduction in erythema score at Week 6 compared to baseline.</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 to week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The erythema score is lesion-specific and based on the Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Disease Area and Severity Index (CLASI) and the Revised CLASI (RCLASI) which are validated scoring systems to assess disease activity and damage in patients with cutaneous lupus erythematosus. The severity of the erythema is scored on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 to 3. The severity is scored from low to high with 0=absent and 3=dark red, purple/violaceous/crusted/haemorrhagic.</description>

The severity is scored from low to high with 0=absent and 3=dark red, purple/violaceous/crusted/haemorrhagic.</description>

    <measure>Total skin disease activity score (sum of scores for erythema, scaling/hyperkeratosis, and oedema/infiltration) at Week 6.</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 to Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The disease activity scores are based on the CLASI and the RCLASI which are validated scoring systems to assess disease activity and damage in patients with cutaneous lupus erythematosus. The total skin disease activity score is defined as the sum of the scores for 3 clinical signs (erythema, scaling/hyperkeratosis, oedema/infiltration) for each target lesion. For the total score and the individual clinical signs, higher scores indicate more severe symptoms. Erythema is scored on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (absent) to 3 (dark red, purple/violaceous/crusted/haemorrhagic). Hyperkeratosis/scaling is scored on a 3-point scale from 0 (absent) to 2 (verrucous hyperkeratosis). Oedema/infiltration is scored on a 3-point scale from 0 (absent) to 2 (palpable and visible). The total skin disease activity score can therefore range from 0 to 7.</description>

             DLE.

          -  Unequivocal clinical diagnosis of 2 active DLE target lesions that are &lt;6 months old
             and amenable for clinical evaluation. This includes lesions located on the scalp if
             they fulfil all lesion-specific eligibility criteria.

          -  Target lesion IGA score of at least moderate severity (≥3) at screening and baseline.

          -  Target lesion erythema score ≥2 at screening and baseline.

        Main Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Target lesion dyspigmentation score of 2 at screening or baseline.

          -  Target lesion scarring/atrophy score of 2 at screening or baseline.

          -  Target lesion scarring alopecia score of &gt;0 in scalp lesions at screening or baseline.

             to 9) including SLE-related pleuritis or pericarditis (by clinical evaluation and
             electrocardiogram), and neurologic, renal, and/or other major SLE-related organ system
             involvement. SLE joint involvement is acceptable.

          -  Subjects with unstable or significant SLE disease activity findings that would, by its
             progressive nature and/or severity, interfere with the trial evaluation, completion,
             and/or procedures per the investigator's discretion.

          -  Other skin conditions at screening or baseline that would interfere with the
             evaluation of DLE.

          -  Immunosuppressive/immunomodulating therapy with e.g. methotrexate, cyclosporine,
             azathioprine, retinoids (both topical and systemic), or dapsone within 4 weeks prior
             to baseline.

          -  Systemic prednisolone &gt;7.5 mg/day or changed dose within 4 weeks prior to baseline

               -  Oral antimalarial treatment with hydroxychloroquine &gt;6.5 mg/kg body weight/day,
                  or chloroquine &gt;4 mg/kg body weight/day, or changed dose within 12 weeks prior to
                  baseline.

               -  Quinacrine combined with either hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine within 12 weeks
                  prior to baseline.

               -  Drugs known to interact with antimalarials (e.g. digoxin, cimetidine) within 12
                  weeks prior to baseline.

          -  Treatment with topical corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and
             phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE-4) inhibitors within 2 weeks prior to baseline.

          -  Use of systemic antibiotics or cutaneously applied antibiotics on the target lesions

             of any of the target lesions within 4 weeks prior to baseline.

          -  Receipt of live (attenuated) vaccines within 4 weeks prior to baseline.

          -  Treatment with any marketed biological therapy or investigational biologic agents:

               -  Any cell-depleting agents including but not limited to rituximab: within 6 months
                  prior to baseline, or until lymphocyte count returns to normal, whichever is
                  longer.

               -  Other biologics: within 3 months or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer, prior to
                  baseline.

          -  Unstable or fluctuating use of tobacco within 1 month prior to screening which, in the
             opinion of the investigator, may affect the natural course of the disease and thus
             affect the evaluation of the treatment.

          -  History of any active skin infection within 1 week prior to baseline.

          -  Clinically significant infection within 4 weeks prior to baseline which, in the
             opinion of the investigator, may compromise the safety of the subject in the trial,
             interfere with evaluation of the IMP, or reduce the subject's ability to participate
             in the trial. Clinically significant infections are defined as:

               -  A systemic infection.

               -  A serious skin infection requiring parenteral (intravenous or intramuscular)
                  antibiotics, antiviral, or antifungal medication.

          -  Tuberculosis requiring treatment within 12 months prior to screening and/or subjects
             with a positive blood test for tuberculosis at screening. Subjects with high risk of
             latent tuberculosis (e.g. prior residence in or travel to countries with high
             prevalence of tuberculosis, close contact with a person with active tuberculosis, or a
             history of active or latent tuberculosis where an adequate course of treatment cannot
             be confirmed) must be tested at screening.
