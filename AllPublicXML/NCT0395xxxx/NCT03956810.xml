  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prenatal trip assistance project is a study comparing two methods of delivering
      transportation assistance to pregnant women living in communities with high rates of infant
      mortality. Franklin County, Ohio, home of the state's capital of Columbus, has one of the
      highest rates of infant mortality in the U.S. at 8.2 per 1,000 live births.There have been
      many advances in &quot;smart&quot; applications in transportation over the past 10 years. However,
      despite the fact that the vast majority of impoverished women have a mobile phone, the
      transportation providers currently used by the Medicaid managed care plans are low tech with
      no mobile alerts or two-way communication with the woman. The purpose of the proposed study
      is to examine the efficacy of providing expanded and &quot;smart&quot; transportation services to
      increase communications, reliability, and customer satisfaction and reduce adverse pregnancy
      outcomes among women whose children are at high risk of infant mortality. The investigators
      will enroll and randomize 500 eligible pregnant women to either on-demand services or usual
      transportation services as provided by their Medicaid managed care organization. The primary
      outcome for the proposed trial will be overall satisfaction with transportation services as
      assessed by the final study questionnaire (i.e., two months after delivery or miscarriage)
      and secondary outcome measures will include: adequacy of prenatal care, preterm birth and
      infant mortality.

    <description>Participants will be asked in one question to rate their level of overall satisfaction with transportation services measured on a five-point scale (5=very satisfied, 1=Very dissatisfied). Those who rate their satisfaction as either somewhat (4) or very satisfied (5) will be considered satisfied with transportation services in analysis.</description>

    <measure>Kotelchuck Adequacy of Prenatal Care Utilization index</measure>

    <description>The Adequacy of prenatal care utilization index, as defined by Kotelchuck (AJPH, 1994). This index utilizes information on: gestational age at entry to prenatal care, the number of prenatal care visits, and the gestational age at delivery (to determine an expected number of prenatal visits). The index includes two dimensions which are combined (adequacy of initiation of prenatal care and adequacy of received services) into a single summary prenatal care utilization index category (Adequate plus utilization, Adequate utilization, Intermediate utilization, Inadequate utilization).</description>
