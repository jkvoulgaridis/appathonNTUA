    <textblock>
      Acromioclavicular pains are one of the etiologies of shoulder pains, the prevalence of which
      is relatively high, ranging from 5 to 47% in the general population. The cause is usually
      degenerative, occurring mainly after the age of 40, especially in male manual workers. This
      pathology is described as the great forger of the shoulder, ignored by clinicians because it
      is often uninvestigated, whereas an interrogation and a complete clinical examination are
      sufficient to make the diagnosis.

      Acromioclavicular pathologies are better known to orthopaedic surgeons, particularly in
      traumatic pathologies but also in degenerative pathologies. However, before operating on
      acromioclavicular osteoarthritis, interventions whose results are sometimes disappointing, a
      well-managed medical treatment usually helps to relieve pain.

      The precise clinical examination and a radiological examination focused on the joint make it
      possible to diagnose acromioclavicular arthropathy, the key is to think about it and look for
      it.

      Care includes explanation of the diagnosis, drug treatments, physiotherapy techniques and
      self-exercise as well as osteoarticular manipulations, which are less frequently practiced or
      performed in isolation outside the medical setting.

      The results of the different treatments have been little studied, with studies that don't
      always allow us to distinguish several etiologies of shoulder pains. Most studies compare
      surgical techniques with each or with medical techniques. However, there are very few studies
      comparing traditional medical care with manual medicine.

      In order to compare the different non-surgical therapies for the care of acromioclavicular
      arthropathies of degenerative origin, the investigators propose a dedicated study.

      This is a non-inferiority, prospective, open, randomized, two-armed study comparing the
      efficacy of manipulations by a physician with a training in manual medicine versus cortisone
      infiltration Under ultrasound control.

      After diagnosis of degenerative pathology of the acromioclavicular joint, patients meeting
      the inclusion criteria will be randomized to the infiltration arm or to the manipulations
      arm.

      The assessment will be based on the pain during and after the procedure.
