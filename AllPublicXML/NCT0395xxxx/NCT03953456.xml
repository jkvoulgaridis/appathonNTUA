  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind, cross-over (placebo or elafibranor [GFT505])
      placebo-controlled study, will evaluate the effect on hepatic lipid composition and safety of
      elafibranor 120 mg quaque die (QD) versus placebo in an adult NAFL population after 6 weeks
      of treatment with a 4-week wash-out period. This study will achieve mechanistic information
      about the mode of action of Elafibranor on the (lipid) metabolism in the human fatty liver

             voluntary consent/assent or compliance with required study procedures, or would
             confound the objectives of study

          -  Known hypersensitivity to the investigation product or any of its formulation
             excipients

             until end of treatment

          -  Any medication use known to interfere with glucose homeostasis/metabolism
