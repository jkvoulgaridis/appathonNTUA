        The study population will consist of the following three mutually exclusive cohorts:

          1. Nintedanib initiators, consisting of adult IPF patients who newly initiated nintedanib
             treatment

          2. Pirfenidone initiators, consisting of adult IPF patients who newly initiated
             pirfenidone treatment

          3. Untreated cohort, consisting of adult IPF patients without any prescription for
             antifibrotic treatment (i.e., no prescription for nintedanib nor pirfenidone)
