  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The TREAT Pilot is a 3 months open-label pilot study to examine the effect of restricting the
      duration of eating (Time Restricted EATing) in metabolically unhealthy adults with overweight
      or obesity. This pilot study will allow the investigator to collect preliminary data for the
      design of a larger study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Disruption of the circadian rhythm, caused by aging, obesity, shift work, or prolonged daily
      eating duration into hours normally reserved for sleep, is a recognized risk factor for
      impaired metabolism and cardiovascular disease risk. Mice with disrupted clock gene have
      dysmetabolism. Restricting the eating window in these mice improves their metabolism.

      Data will be collected to examine the feasibility and effect of a lifestyle intervention,
      aiming to reduce body weight in metabolically unhealthy individuals with overweight and
      obesity. The TREAT pilot study employs the use of mobile application to document eating
      behavior, when, what and how much people eat. In addition, the participants will receive
      reminders and complete in-person study visits to monitor their eating and sleeping schedule.

The sleep schedule will also be recorded.</description>
