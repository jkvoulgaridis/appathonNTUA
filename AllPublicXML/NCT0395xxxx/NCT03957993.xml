  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to measure the impact of a telehealth-based model of occupational therapy
      (OT) treatment on clinical outcomes for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and/or
      attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Half of the participants will receive
      clinic-based, in-person services and half of the participants will receive video-based,
      Telehealth services.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and/or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
      (ADHD) often receive occupational therapy (OT), which traditionally takes place in a clinical
      setting. This setting may present barriers and distractors that make it hard for children to
      achieve their OT goals. Telehealth-based sessions provide an alternative, allowing the
      therapist to be virtually present within the home.Once enrolled, children will randomly be
      assigned to be in one of two groups: (1) Standard, in which children will receive
      clinic-based services as per standard of care OR (2) Telehealth, in which children will
      receive in-home services on a video-based platform on a timeline identical to what they would
      receive if they were in the Standard group. Children in both groups will participate for the
      duration of the episode of care, estimated to last 10-12 weeks. Assessments will be completed
      at initial evaluation, discharge, and three months following discharge.

    <description>The Goal Attainment Scale is a criterion-referenced, individualized outcome measure used to assess progress on goals that are important to the child and their family. The Goal Attainment Scale is reliable, valid and responsive to change. The status of goal attainment is rated on a scale of +2 to -2 (+2 is much more than expected, -2 is much less than expected)</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and approximately 2 weeks after treatment (approximately 14 weeks after baseline measurement)</time_frame>
    <description>The Canadian Occupational Performance Measure is a valid, reliable, and sensitive assessment tool that measures the caregiver/patient's perception of the participant's performance and satisfaction on goals that are important to the child and his/her caregiver. The performance and satisfaction are rated on a scale from 1-10 (1 is low performance/satisfaction, 10 is high performance/satisfaction).</description>

    <description>Participants in the telehealth-based model will undergo occupational therapy treatment via a telehealth-based video chat platform for the entire episode of care (generally 10-12 weeks in duration). The patient will use the video chat client to connect to his/her occupational therapist, and the therapist will conduct the session over this virtual connection.</description>

    <description>Participants in the standard of care model will undergo occupational therapy treatment via traditional in- person encounters in an outpatient clinic setting for the entire episode of care (generally 10-12 weeks). These children will receive routine occupational treatment via in-person sessions with an occupational therapist conducted in an outpatient clinic setting.</description>
