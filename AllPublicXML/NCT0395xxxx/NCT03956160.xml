  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to the brutality of stroke and increasingly shorter lengths of hospital stay, patients
      and their families must adapt quickly to the patient's new state of health and the new role
      of caregiver for family members. Patients and caregivers report a significant need for advice
      and information during this transition period. Thus, the provision of information through an
      Internet platform could meet these characteristics, in association with individualised
      support by a case-manager to ensure continuity of care and improve care pathway.

      The investigating team's hypothesis is that, through comprehensive, individualized and
      flexible support for patients and their caregivers, a patient-centred post-stroke
      hospital/home transition program, combining an Internet platform and telephone follow-up by a
      case-manager, could improve patients' level of participation and quality of life.

      Going back home following a stroke is a key step for the patient and his or her relatives.
      Due to the brutality of stroke and increasingly shorter lengths of hospital stay, patients
      and their families must adapt quickly to the patient's new state of health and the new role
      of caregiver for family members. Currently, 70% of patients return home directly after
      treatment in a stroke center. Following the acute phase, the patient's care path involves
      many health and social workers. However, the health care system is complex and difficult for
      patients and their caregivers to understand. A lack of support during the hospital/home
      transition has significant negative consequences for the patient (reduced functional
      prognosis, quality of life and reintegration, increased risk of recurrence) and his or her
      caregiver (increased perceived burden, decreased quality of life, socio-economic impact).

      Patients and caregivers report a significant need for advice and information during this
      transition period. They are looking for individualized, good quality information and whose
      nature evolves over time with the needs and recovery of the patient. Thus, the provision of
      information through an Internet platform could meet these characteristics, in association
      with individualised support by a case-manager to ensure continuity of care and improve care
      pathway. In France, no such program has been developed to date for stroke. Existing
      transition programmes mainly focus on home rehabilitation and do not offer a comprehensive
      approach to the situation, integrating caregivers. In addition, no programs have been
      developed in partnership with patients and families to best meet their needs.

      The investigator's hypothesis is that, through comprehensive, individualized and flexible
      support for patients and their caregivers, a patient-centred post-stroke hospital/home
      transition program, combining an Internet platform and telephone follow-up by a case-manager,
      could improve patients' level of participation and quality of life.

    <description>For 12 months from the return home, patients in the intervention group will benefit from telephone support by a trained case-manager (number and frequency of contacts defined according to the patient's needs) and access to an Internet platform.
The intervention aims to improve the patient's ability to manage his or her situation and meet his or her needs upon return home, including identifying and requesting the necessary health or social resources.</description>

    <description>Patients randomized to the control group will receive the usual practices. As part of the study, they will be contacted for data collection upon their return home, at 6 months and 12 months by a clinical research associate.
Access to the internet platform and an interview with the case-manager will be offered at the end of the study to patients in the control group.</description>

    <description>4 participatory co-design workshops lasting 4 hours each that will follow a &quot;user-centered design&quot; approach: identification of end-user needs, prototyping/development of the intervention (case-management procedures and platform), iterative improvement, end-user testing.
Based on the cognitive social theory underpinning the intervention, scientific literature, an overview of existing organizations and the results of the Stroke 69 and Arthur Tybra studies (patient needs following the acute phase), the advisory committee will:
Define the case-manager's profile, and required knowledge and skills
Identify the resources and tools to be proposed on the Internet platform
Test the tools and content
Refine the program evaluation criteria
Test and validate the study procedures.</description>
