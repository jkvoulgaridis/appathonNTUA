  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study to determine if identifying an optimal level of positive
      end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) targeted specifically to individualized patient
      characteristics will shorten the time on the ventilator.

      Participants will have catheter placed through the nose into the esophagus to measure the
      pressure inside the chest. This catheter will remain until the patient is freed from the
      ventilator. Participants will be randomized to usual care or to have the level of PEEP
      determined by the esophageal balloon pressure readings. The total time spent on the
      ventilator will be recorded.

      Study Design:

      Randomized-controlled clinical trial. Patients will be enrolled within 4 days of mechanical
      ventilation and randomized 1:1 to titration of PEEP based on esophageal balloon pressures or
      based on the &quot;High PEEP&quot; ARDSnet PEEP/FiO2 (fraction of inspired oxygen) table. All patients
      will have esophageal balloons placed with baseline measurement of Ptp. Patients randomized to
      the intervention arm will then undergo titration of PEEP based on Ptp measurements to achieve
      &quot;Optimal PEEP,&quot; defined as end expiratory Ptp of 0 to +2 cm H2O.

    <masking_description>Due to the obvious treatment differences between the two groups, blinding of treatment group will be impossible. However, the investigators will have one outcome assessor who will have access only to the data necessary to determine the primary outcome (Ventilator-Free Days at 28-days), and this assessor will be blinded to treatment group using built-in REDCap tools.</masking_description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The waveforms of airway pressure (Paw), esophageal pressure (Pes), and transpulmonary pressure (Ptp) will be visualized on the ventilator. Ptp is obtained from Paw - Pes. PEEP will be increased on the ventilator to achieve a Ptp between 0 and +2 cm H2O (Optimal PEEP). Measurements will be obtained daily and adjustments to PEEP will occur daily. PEEP will be reduced below Optimal PEEP in the setting of hemodynamic compromise (requiring increasing vasoactive medications for blood pressure support).</description>

    <arm_group_label>ARDSNet High PEEP</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>PEEP in the control group will be determined by High PEEP ARDSnet PEEP/FiO2 table. Titration of PEEP will occur when clinically indicated by partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) or oxygen saturation (SpO2), and FiO2. The investigators chose the High PEEP table based on the clinical suspicion that obese patients may require higher PEEP levels on average than non-obese patients to balance the additional pressure of their chest wall. In addition, EPVent2, a study of esophageal balloon PEEP titration in patients with ARDS utilized the High PEEP table. Patients with moderate and severe ARDS benefit from higher levels of PEEP.</description>

    <description>All patients in both groups will have an esophageal balloon catheter inserted by a research investigator. The catheter will be inserted into their nare while upright (head of bed &gt;30 degrees) to a depth slightly more than the estimated distance from the lower sternum to the back of the ear (typically around 60 cm). Gastric positioning will be confirmed with abdominal compression testing and the catheter then retracted 10 - 20cm into the lower esophagus. Placement will be confirmed with the presence of cardiac oscillations on the esophageal probe. The probe will then be secured to the patient's nasal opening using tape.</description>

    <description>Patients in the Intervention group will undergo an SBT regardless of their PEEP level. The PEEP that generates a Ptp of 0 will be considered their optimal PEEP, and this will not be lowered for the SBT. The Intervention Group SBT will consist of a trial of a pressure support of 5 cm H2O and Optimal PEEP.</description>

    <description>Patients in the Control group will undergo an SBT when they reach a PEEP â‰¤8 cm H2O. This is the current standard of care based on the SBT protocol at UNC Hospitals. SBT and extubation prior to meeting these criteria will be based on primary medical team's discretion and will be recorded for analysis and safety tracking.</description>

    <description>Based on the use of optimal PEEP in this group, and the experience in the previous study protocol, the investigators will place patients in the Intervention group on Tracheostomy Collar Trial ONLY with a speaking valve. This simulates the normal process of utilizing the upper airway to maintain lung inflation that is performed automatically when a patient does not have an artificial airway.</description>

    <description>The control group will be placed on Tracheostomy Collar Trial with no requirement for speaking valve. They may utilize a speaking valve if tolerated and desired, but there is no requirement as there is in the Intervention group.</description>
