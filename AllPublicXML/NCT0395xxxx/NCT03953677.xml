  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Septic shock is common in patients admitted to intensive care and hospital mortality occurs
      in close to 50% of these patients. In half of the cases, death occurs within the first 72
      hours in a context of multiple organ failure that does not respond to conventional therapies,
      particularly circulatory therapies, despite increasing doses of catecholamines. Vasopressor
      resistance in septic patients defines refractory septic shock. In one study (Conrad et al.
      2015), the increase in blood pressure observed with an infusion of increasing doses of
      phenylephrine (dose-response curve) made it possible to quickly and clearly identify patients
      resistant to vasopressors at a high risk of death by refractory shock (ROC AUC 0.92). This
      resistance is due in particular to a downregulation of α1 adrenergic receptors, linked to
      sympathetic hyper activation associated with septic shock. To date, there is no validated
      therapy in this situation. However, experimental data have shown that the administration of
      α2 agonists, usually used for their sedative (dexmedetomidine) or anti-hypertensive
      (clonidine) effect, normalizes sympathetic activity towards basal values. In animals, α2
      agonists restore the sensitivity of alpha1 adrenergic receptors, resulting in improved
      vasopressor sensitivity and survival. In humans, a beneficial effect on mortality was
      suggested in the first trial testing dexmedetomidine in septic patients in 2017. This effect
      was observed especially in the most severe patients, suggesting a restoration of sensitivity
      to vasopressors.

      The hypothesis is that the administration of dexmedetomidine in patients in refractory septic
      shock may improve response to phenylephrine and decrease resistance to vasopressors. This
      pilot study could lay the foundation for a randomized controlled trial.
