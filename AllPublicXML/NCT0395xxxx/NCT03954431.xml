      This study is being performed to find out if a new kind of breast imaging (called
      contrast-media enhanced breast CT or CE-BCT) can help doctors to see the small structures in
      breast tissue more clearly. This study is also being performed to find out if using the
      CE-BCT will separate cancers from non-cancers. This is important because 25% to 35% of
      structures that do not appear to be normal and are removed from the breast (biopsied) for
      studying under a microscope turn out to be cancer.

      The breast imaging device that will be used in this study (breast computed tomography or BCT)
      is not FDA-approved for this use so this is a research study. The machine has been redesigned
      to see if doctors can see smaller structures and use a lower radiation dose.

      An x-ray dye will be injected through a needle in the subject's arm before the test. The FDA
      has approved this dye for other uses, but not for this exam, so the use of the dye is also
      research.

      The breast CT device will take multiple pictures of the subject's breast and create a 3-D
      image of the breast. It does not compress or squash the breast like a mammogram.

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  who were asymptomatic and 40 years of age or older (typical screening age range) at
             the time of the screening exam that prompted the recall

          -  who were assigned BI-RADS category 4 or 5 after x-ray based diagnostic work-up such as
             mammography or digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT)

          -  who have no known adverse reaction to iodinated contrast media

          -  who satisfy University of Arizona (UA) - Banner University Medical Center (BUMC),
             Department of Medical Imaging policy for administration of iodinated contrast media
             for computed tomography (CT) imaging, which may include a blood draw for renal
             function assessment.

        Exclusion criteria:

             determine pregnancy)

          -  women with physical limitations that may prohibit resting prone on the exam table,
             such as, but not limited to: frozen shoulder, recent heart surgery, pace maker;

             nonmalignant conditions, such as (but not limited to) treatment for enlarged thymus
             gland as an infant, irradiation for benign breast conditions, including breast
             inflammation after giving birth, and treatment for Hodgkin's disease;

          -  women who have participated in a prior breast clinical trial that gave additional
             radiation dose, such as an additional mammogram;

          -  women with glomerular filtration rate (GFR) less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m^2 indicative of
             impaired kidney function,

          -  women with known allergies to contrast media,
