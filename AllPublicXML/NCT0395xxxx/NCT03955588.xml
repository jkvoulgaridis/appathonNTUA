  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Conventional cytogenetics has been the gold standard for chromosomal analysis in prenatal
      diagnosis. It allows a microscopic examination for any structural abnormalities of chromosome
      with a turn-around time of 2 to 3 weeks and it is also labour intensive. Array comparative
      genome hybridisation (aCGH) provides a platform for a higher resolution analysis of
      chromosomal aberrations in a shorter period of time. The effectiveness of its application in
      prenatal diagnosis has been examined. The main clinical limitation lies on the difficult
      interpretation of certain copy number variants (CNV). Our previous study has demonstrated an
      increase diagnostic yield of 3.2% using aCGH over conventional cytogenetics in the first-tier
      test study and by 6% as a further test in a cohort of fetuses with ultrasound abnormality and
      normal karyotype findings. This finding were consistent with the overall reported of 5.2% to
      10% increased detection rate by other studies. Various authorities have also approved the use
      of aCGH as an adjunct diagnostic tool in prenatal cases with fetal ultrasound abnormalities.

      The presence study aims to demonstrate the clinical acceptability on the use of aCGH to
      replace cytogenetics in prenatal diagnosis. For patients requiring invasive prenatal
      diagnosis by chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis, they will be offered the options of
      having either conventional cytogenetics or aCGH. A standard unbiased counselling procedure
      will be performed by well trained midwives. For patients opting for conventional
      cytogenetics, the current procedure of karyotyping will be performed. For those opting for
      aCGH, a quantitative fluorescent Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) will be performed first to
      exclude common aneuploidies and triploidies. aCGH will be arranged for those with normal PCR
      results and conventional cytogenetics will be reserved for visualization of clinically
      significant CNVs.

      All patients will be asked to complete the same questionnaire that has been adopted for the
      study on &quot;Questionnaire survey on Knowledge and Acceptance on Application of whole genome
      array Comparative Genomic Hybridisation (aCGH) in Prenatal Diagnosis&quot;.

      Conventional cytogenetics has been the gold standard for chromosomal analysis in prenatal

      The main clinical limitation lies on the difficult interpretation of certain copy number
      variants (CNV). Our previous study has demonstrated an increase diagnostic yield of 3.2%
      using aCGH over conventional cytogenetics in the first-tier test study and by 6% as a further
      test in a cohort of fetuses with ultrasound abnormality and normal karyotype findings (Kan et
      al., 2014). This finding were consistent with the overall reported of 5.2% to 10% increased
      detection rate by other studies (de Wit et al., 2014; Hillman et al., 2013; Hillman et al.,
      2011). Various authorities have also approved the use of aCGH as an adjunct diagnostic tool
      in prenatal cases with fetal ultrasound abnormalities (American College of Obstetricians &amp;
      Gynecologists, 2013; Novelli et al., 2012).
