  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A multi-center observational study based at referral centers and community hospitals within
      the US. Patients' blood will be collected at enrollment for testing with PredictSURE IBD™,
      which will occur at a later date. Patients will be prospectively followed up for 12 months
      with clinicians treating according to local standard of care, with a step-up or accelerated
      step-up regimen. Clinicians and patients will be blinded to the biomarker results.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Active UC or CD with typical symptoms in conjunction with at least one objective
             measure of disease activity: elevated CRP, calprotectin, endoscopic evidence.

          -  Not currently receiving systemic therapy* with steroids, immunomodulators or
             biologics, and at least 7 days since the last steroid dose.

          -  Due to be managed using a &quot;step-up&quot; or &quot;accelerated step-up&quot; approach (so will not
             receive biologics as first line therapy).

          -  Aged 16-80 years old.

        Note, the ideal patients for this study are newly diagnosed patients who are
        treatment-naïve.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The presence of any of the following will preclude patient inclusion:

          -  Patients with fistulating peri-anal Crohn's disease or active perianal sepsis.

          -  Obstructive symptoms and evidence of a fixed stricture on radiology or colonoscopy.

          -  Patients who are scheduled to start on &quot;top-down&quot; therapy or receive biologics as a
             first line therapy
