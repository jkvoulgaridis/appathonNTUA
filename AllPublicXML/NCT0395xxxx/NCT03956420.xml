  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been assumed that some elements of the ERAS protocol may contribute to the reduction
      of complications and improve the satisfaction of patients undergoing coronary artery bypass
      surgery.

      Elements of the ERAS strategy will be tested in this study. The elements that prove to be
      feasible and have a positive effect on the treatment process will be introduced into everyday
      clinical practice.

      In the next stage of the research, we are planning to investigate whether the introduction of
      the ERAS strategy has had a long-term positive effect on the quality of life after treatment
      (a survey 1 month and 6 months after leaving the hospital).

      Evaluation of the impact of implemented elements of the ERAS strategy on the results of
      surgical treatment of coronary artery disease in the aspect of:

        -  preoperative preparation (comprehensive information, premedication, hydration),

        -  haemodynamic stability (discontinuation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and
           angiotensin II receptor blockers immediately before surgery), optimal pre- and
           intraoperative fluid therapy,

        -  occurrence of respiratory complications (assessment of the duration of mechanical
           ventilation and passive oxygen therapy),

        -  demand for painkillers in the postoperative period, after introducing the preemptive
           strategy,

        -  incidence of postoperative delirium,

        -  time to recovery of the normal bowel function (nausea, vomiting),

        -  possibility of early mobilisation on the first day after surgery,

        -  patient's satisfaction with treatment assessed on the basis of a survey carried out on
           the day before leaving the hospital.
