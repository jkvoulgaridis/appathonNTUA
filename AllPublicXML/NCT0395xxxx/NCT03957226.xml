  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This early feasibility study proposes to evaluate use of the electronic-Osseoanchored
      Prostheses for the Rehabilitation of Amputees (e-OPRA) device, a transhumeral implant system
      for direct skeletal anchorage of amputation prostheses, with a test prosthesis. The e-OPRA
      System is being investigated to better understand the ability to improve the functionality of
      the prosthesis and enhance the sense of embodiment of the prosthesis itself. This will be a
      10 subject Early Feasibility Study in which the primary objective is to capture preliminary
      safety and effectiveness information on the implanted e-OPRA system. With the addition of
      electrodes to the muscle segments, this biological interface allows for both the extraction
      of fine motor control signals from the nerve fascicles and the generation of sensory percepts
      via electrical stimulation of the muscles. In addition, electrodes placed on muscles within
      the residuum with native vascularization and innervation also allow the extraction of
      critical motor control signals and the generation of sensory feedback through muscle
      stimulation. The electrical activity recorded from these muscle segments (called
      electromyography or EMG) is specific to certain movements and can be used to determine
      precisely how a person wants to move their arm and hand. Use of the e-OPRA device with the
      well-documented neuro-electronic capabilities of EMG control systems provides an alternative
      to traditional socket prostheses by establishing a direct, loadbearing link between the
      patient's skeleton and prosthesis.

    <description>Change in Pain Level as measured by LANSS survey Pain will be assessed using the LANSS survey instrument, to be filled out by the participant before surgery and at each experimental visit. The Numeric Rating Scale measures (adult, pediatric, parent proxy) each consist of a single item rating pain on average over the past 7 days from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain you can think of). The items are not calibrated and do not produce a T-score. Instead, raw response scores (0 to 10) should be used for analyses.</description>

The DASH Outcome Measure is scored in two components: the disability/symptom section (30 items, scored 1-5) and the optional high performance Sport/Music or Work section (4 items, scored 1-5). The raw is transformed to a zero-to-100 scale, with an average score closer to 100 meaning higher disability (unable to perform tasks).</description>

             phantom pain, or osteoporosis, such that, in the opinion of the Investigator, the
             subject will not be a good study candidate.

          -  History of systemically administered corticosteroids, immunosuppressive therapy, or
             chemotherapeutic drugs within six (6) months of implant surgery.

          -  Severe medical co-morbidity, atypical skeletal anatomy, or poor general
             physical/mental health that, in the opinion of the Investigator, will not allow the
             subject to be a good study candidate (i.e., other disease processes, other indwelling
             electronic implants, mental incapacity, substance abuse, shortened life expectancy,
             and vulnerable patient population).

          -  Current involvement in another clinical study where that participation may conflict or
             interfere with the treatment, follow-up or results of this clinical study.
