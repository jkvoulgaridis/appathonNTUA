  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the impact of transurethral prostate resection in regard to
      complications. These are direct surgical complications, such as bleeding, infection and
      readmissions, as well as the long term complications as incontinence and impotence. Also, the
      study aims to investigate if selected cases of patients could be performed as outpatient
      surgery, thereby reducing cost.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transuretral prostate resection (TUR P) is a common procedure to relieve voiding problems in
      men. After the introduction of bipolar resection with saline, the serious complication of
      transurethral resection syndrome (i.e. acute hypo-natremia) has been eradicated.

      The post surgical care is generally a couple of days inhospital care. The reson for this, is
      the risk of clot formation and in rare cases post surgical infection.

      However, in selected cases, outpatient surgery has been performed with encouraging results.
      However, the technique has not been spread widely. The use of ambulatory surgery would reduce
      the direct cost of the procedure, thereby increasing it´s availability.

      Also, complications in contemporary TUR P in the modern era (outside of the selected patients
      of clinical trials) is lacking. The information of complications that can be expected is
      therefore an important for patient counseling. In some studies, the use of incontinence pads
      after TUR P is more than 15%, which is important to reliably ascertain if this is holds true.

        This is a feasibility cohort study. All patients planned for TUR P are eligible. Patients
        in the ambulatory group have prostate size less than 50 cc and ASA score less less than 4
        and ser under 80 years of age. This is clinical routine at the study site.
