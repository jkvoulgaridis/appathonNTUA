  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin B3 has recently been found to be a potent modifier of energy metabolism, especially
      the function of mitochondria. Mitochondria power up all cells in our bodies, by generating
      fuel, ATP, for cellular functions. In previous studies, it has been discovered that
      mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative metabolism in adipose tissue is severely impaired in
      obesity, already at a young adult age. Here the investigators describe a proposal where they
      use nicotinamide riboside (NR), a form of vitamin B3 naturally found in milk, to activate
      dysfunctional mitochondria, in particular the SIRT/NAD+ pathway, and to rescue signs of
      obesity-related diseases. The investigators use a unique human study design: monozygotic
      twins either discordant or concordant for obesity, to examine the effects of NR on
      mitochondrial function in muscle, adipose tissue and the metabolism of the whole body. The
      upcoming upcoming results are important for understanding the links between mitochondrial
      dysfunction and chronic metabolic diseases in humans, as well as for clarifying mechanisms of
      the novel nutritional therapeutic approaches.

    <intervention_model_description>Study with two interventions in healthy monozygotic twin pairs. In the first intervention, both members of BMI-discordant monozygotic twins are treated with Nicotinamide Riboside (NR). With this unique model, the investigators obtain the information on how beneficial NR is in two different BMI classes (obese and leaner) with an identical genomic background. In the second intervention, monozygotic twins concordant for body weight are selected and randomized to treatment. One member of the twin pair is treated with NR while the other co-twin gets placebo. With the twin set-up, the investigators can detect a significant treatment effect, and the heritability of NR treatment can be estimated as well.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>One intervention includes healthy BMI-discordant monozygotic twin pairs, which both are treated with NR. With this unique model, the investigators obtain the information on how beneficial NR is in two different BMI classes (obese and leaner) with an identical genomic background.
The final dose for NR will be 1 g/day. The daily NR dose is gradually escalated by 250 mg/week so that the full dose of 1 g/day is reached in one month. The intervention time with the full NR dose is 4 months, total intervention time 5 months. At the end of the study, the daily dose will be decreased by 250 mg/week rate.</description>
