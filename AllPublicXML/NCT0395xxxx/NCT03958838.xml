      This project will disseminate a community-level intervention that integrates peer support
      from Community Self-Management Groups (CSMGs) and primary care through Community Health
      Centers (CHC). The model and program materials were developed and refined from the first year
      of implementation within community health centers in Shanghai. This project will be
      implemented in 12 communities in 6 districts across Shanghai, representing a diverse cross
      section of the population. A total of 1440 subjects will be recruited from the 12
      intervention communities and 720 control subjects will be recruited from 4 control
      communities.

      The development of contemporary diabetes care offers new hope for long and satisfying lives
      of those with the disease, but also provides increased challenges for integration across the
      many dimensions of care (varied medications in addition to insulin, specialty services, diet,
      physical activity, stress management, etc.) and across the many who contribute to care
      (specialists, primary care providers, nurses, dietitians and patient educators, family
      members, friends, worksites). The Shanghai Integration Model (SIM) has made great strides to
      integrating specialty/hospital care with primary/community care. The addition of peer support
      can enhance patient engagement within that integrated care. Peer support can also integrate
      care with the daily behaviors and patterns that optimal diabetes management requires and with
      the family members and others in individuals' daily lives who can support diabetes
      management.

      This project will disseminate a community-level intervention that integrates peer support
      from Community Self-Management Groups (CSMGs) and primary care through Community Health
      Centers (CHC). The model and program materials were developed and refined from the first year
      of implementation within community health centers in Shanghai. This project will be
      implemented in 12 communities in 6 districts across Shanghai, representing a diverse cross
      section of the population. A total of 1440 subjects will be recruited from the 12
      intervention communities and 720 control subjects will be recruited from 4 control
      communities.

      The program is a collaboration among the Shanghai Sixth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong
      University, the Shanghai Diabetes Institute, the National Office for Primary Diabetes Care,
      the Shanghai Municipal Health Commission, the Shanghai Municipal Center for Disease Control
      and Prevention, and, at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, Peers for Progress,
      widely recognized for its leadership in promoting peer support in health care and prevention.

    <description>9 items from Summary of Diabetes Self Care Activities and Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Items 1-7 measure diabetes self care activities during the previous 7 days. Items 1, 2, 4-7 are assessed on a scale of 0 to 7 days. Item 3 is assessed on scale of 1-4, where 1 represents very low levels of daily activity and 4 represents very high levels of daily activity. Items 8 and 9 are yes/no questions that measure cigarette intake over the past 7 and 30 days.</description>

    <description>6-item EQ-5D, a standardized instrument for measuring generic health status. The respondents are asked to choose one of the statements which best describes their health status on the surveyed day. Rated level can be coded as a number 1, 2, or 3, which indicates having no problems for 1, having some problems for 2, and having extreme problems for 3. As a result, a person's health status can be defined by a 5-digit number, ranging from 11111 (having no problems in all dimensions) to 33333 (having extreme problems in all dimensions). Item 6 is the visual analogue scale, in which respondents are asked to mark their health status on the day of the interview on a 20 cm vertical scale with end points of 0 and 100, where 0 corresponds to &quot;the worst health you can imagine&quot;, and 100 corresponds to &quot;the best health you can imagine&quot;</description>

    <description>4-item Diabetes Distress Scale, an abbreviated version of the 17-item Diabetes Distress Scale. The respondents are asked to respond to which degree each of the items has bothered them in the past month on a 6-point scale (1-6), where 1 is not a brother and 6 is very bothersome. Scores are summed and divided by 4 to calculate the mean. Mean scores of 3 or higher (moderate distress) are considered worthy of clinical attention.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline Depression and 12 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>8-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ), the PHQ-9 minus the last question on suicidal thoughts. The PHQ is a standard instrument used in primary care settings to screen for the presence and severity of depression. The respondents are asked how often they have been bothered by each of the 8 items in the past 2 weeks on a 4 point scale (0-3), where 0 is &quot;not all&quot; and 3 is &quot;nearly every day&quot;. The scores for each item are summed to produce a total score between 0 and 24 points. A total score of 0 to 4 represents no significant depressive symptoms. A total score of 5 to 9 represents mild depressive symptoms; 10 to 14, moderate; 15 to 19, moderately severe; and 20 to 24, severe.</description>

    <description>Subjects will receive usual care from community health center staff. In addition, they will also receive a variety of community-level and individual-level interventions, categorized broadly into three levels.
At the community level, subjects will receive the 5 Key Diabetes Messages that Everyone Should Know and the 6 Modules of Basic Diabetes Education. At the individual level, subjects and their families will be invited to participate in group activities, co-organized by community health staff, CHC staff, and CSMG peer leaders. Subjects will receive in-person peer support through these group activities, with follow up through telephone calls and text messaging. For subjects that have poorly controlled diabetes or are experiencing emotional distress related to their diabetes, CSMG peer leaders will work closely with them to help them solve problems around their diabetes.</description>
