  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of treatment with CPX-351 (an FDA
      approved drug for the treatment of AML) in individuals with MDS while using a new
      stratification tool to predict outcomes of participants following HMA failure. This approach
      is intended to gain a better understanding and insight into identifying new opportunities for
      drug approvals in this setting.

      This study will evaluate efficacy of treatment with CPX-351in participants with MDS while
      using a new stratification tool to predict outcomes of patients following HMA failure in
      order to gain a better understanding and insight into identifying new opportunities for drug
      approvals in this setting.

      CPX-351is an investigational (experimental) drug for the indication of myelodysplastic
      syndrome that works by delivering two chemotherapy medications (daunorubicin and cytarabine)
      together which are then concentrated into the bone marrow (the part of the body that makes
      blood cells). CPX-351 is experimental because it is not approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) for the indication of myelodysplastic syndrome. This drug is approved by
      theFDA for the indication of acute myeloid leukemia. One or more of the Investigators
      conducting this study serve as consultants for the company that makes products used in this
      study. These financial interests are within permissible limits established by the local
      institutional Conflict of Interest Policy.

      Prior to beginning treatment, all eligible participants will be grouped into low risk versus
      high risk based on a stratification tool used to determine their disease. Group 1 will be low
      risk participants and group 2 will be high risk participants. All study participants will get
      the same study drug, CPX-351. Participants will receive the CPX-351 on days 1, 3 and 5 of the
      first 28 day cycle. After participants finish the first round of treatment and based on their
      response they may be eligible for another 4 cycles of treatment. The participant's doctor
      will inform them if this is an available option when the time comes. Once participant have
      finished treatment, their doctor will continue observe for side effects and follow their
      condition for 1 year.
