  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The advantage of carbohydrate loading in minimally invasive surgeries are not well
      established. We designed this study to evaluate whether preoperative oral carbohydrate
      improve postoperative recovery after laparoscopic gynecologic surgeries.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted in the female adult patient scheduled for laparoscopic
      gynecologic surgery for benign or premalignant condition. Patients with American Society of
      Anesthesiologist physical status classification I-II, not pregnant or on lactation will be
      included. Patients with underlying disease that will delay gastric emptying (GERD, history of
      gastrointestinal surgery, diabetes), or contraindicated to NSAID or opioid, psychiatric or
      mental disorders, alcoholism, or drug abuse will be excluded.

      Participants will be randomized into 2 group: the control group and the study group.
      Randomization will be conducted via random block with stratification generated by the
      http://www.randomization.com with 1:1 allocation. The sequence will be kept in opaque, sealed
      envelopes until the day before the study date. One investigator, not involved in the outcome
      assessment, opened the envelope on the day before the surgery, and allocated participants in
      each group.

      After having regular diet until the evening before surgery, participants allocate in the
      control group were kept fasted from midnight until surgery. Participants in the study group
      will receive 800 mL of carbohydrate beverage (12.8% carbohydrates, 50 kcal/100 mL, 290
      mOsm/kg). The participants in the study group will freely drink carbohydrate beverage
      starting from the evening before surgery up to 2 hours before surgery.

      The postoperative quality of recovery (QoR) score, time to readiness to discharge, patient
      satisfaction, postoperative nausea and vomiting, change in body weight, and insulin
      resistance will be assessed.

    <measure>Quality of recovery (QoR)-15 score</measure>
    <time_frame>2 days after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>This score measures the quality of recovery after surgery in 2 dimensions, which are the physical well-being (in 9 items) and mental well-being (6 items). Each item is rated from 0 (poor) to 10 (excellent). A sum of each score represents the QoR of the patients.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>time to readiness to discharge (TRD)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 days after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>This measures the time when the patients are ready to discharge from the hospital after surgery. It assesses five criteria: (1) tolerance of oral intake, (2) recovery of lower gastrointestinal function, (3) adequate pain control with oral analgesia, (4) ability to mobilize and perform self-care, and (5) clinical examination and laboratory tests. TRD is defined by the time from the operation end time to the time when time to readiness to discharge criteria is fulfilled.</description>
