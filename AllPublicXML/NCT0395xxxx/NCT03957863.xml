  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Erythropoietin (EPO) is a glycoprotein hormone with a molecular weight of 30.4 kDa,
      responsible for regulating erythropoiesis in adults, newborns and fetuses. During pregnancy,
      the concentration of maternal serum EPO increases linearly to allow for effective
      erythropoiesis over time. In the fetus, in the first 30 weeks of gestation, the liver is the
      main synthetic organ. Thereafter, there is a progressive transfer of the synthesis of EPO to
      the kidneys. In the long term, under normal conditions of oxygenation, the fetal synthesis of
      EPO is mainly ensured by the kidney.

      Because of the impossibility of making EPO tissue reserves and the inability of EPO to pass
      the placental barrier, the concentration of circulating EPO in the fetus reflects the balance
      between production and elimination. During the last trimester of pregnancy, in the absence of
      patent hypoxia, fetal concentrations of circulating EPO are between 10 and 50 mIU /ml, while
      in amniotic fluid the EPO is found at lower concentrations, between 2 and 20 mIU /ml.

      In adults, EPO synthesis is primarily renal, and incidentally hepatic, even if in certain
      pathological situations (end-stage kidney disease or polycystosis) the liver is able to take
      over and synthesize EPO with an electrophoretic profile similar to that of the EPO from the
      umbilical cord, but often in insufficient quantities.

      The objective of this study is to describe the forms of EPO in newborns and to compare
      possible iso-forms with those of adults.
