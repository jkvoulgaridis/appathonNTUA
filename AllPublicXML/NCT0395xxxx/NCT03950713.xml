    <textblock>
      This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the newly developed Mindfulness-Based
      Stress Reduction-Taiwan program (MBSR-T) for old people with type 2 diabetes living in
      long-term care facilities.

      This study reported the first randomized controlled trial of Mindfulness-based reduction
      stress for residents with type 2 diabetes newly moved into long-term care facilities on
      depression, relocation stress and HbA1c levels. The results highlighted the benefits of using
      strategies in the MBSR-T to promote good quality of diabetes care for residents in long-term
      care.

      The contents of the 9-week MBSR-T program were adapted from an initial MBSR program by the
      Taiwan Mindfulness Association for older people with diabetes (Chinese version). The program
      consisted of a 1.5-hour session each week for 9-weeks for a group of 8 to 10 participants.
      Each session included 30 minutes of mindful deep breathing relaxation and 60 minutes of
      practicing mindfulness activities.

      A total sample of 140 was determined. All eligible individuals in each long-term care
      facility were randomized by computerized random numbers, sequence generated by an independent
      statistician with one-to-one ratio for allocating to either control or intervention group.
      All participants were blinded to group allocation. Participants in the control group received
      usual care, while participants in the intervention group received the MBSR-T in addition to
      the usual care. All sessions in the MBSR-T were delivered by a trained mindfulness registered
      nurse who had received additional trainer qualification of mindfulness. A research assistant
      was blinded to the study protocol, who was employed to undertake data collection at baseline,
      at 3, 6, and 9 weeks (T0, T1, T2, T3).

    <intervention_model_description>A cluster randomized controlled trial was used to examine the effectiveness of the MBSR-T. The outcomes included HbA1c levels progression as the primary endpoint, and relocation stress, depression as secondary end points. Participants in the intervention group received the MBSR-T in addition to routine care. The control group received the routine care provided in facilities, including routine check-ups at diabetes clinics as necessary.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The Depression and Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21) was used to measure depression. The DASS-21 in Chinese version consists of 21 items with a 4-point Likert scale. The good internal consistency for the DASS-21 subscales .92 for depression, .94 for anxiety, and .91 for stress have been reported.</description>

    <description>The MBSR-T is focused on strategies to manage diabetes distress for new residents by three new techniques. Firstly, it involves practicing body and meditation exercises for openness to the awareness and acceptance of transferred life experiences, such as mindful attention exercise, which is assumed to allow the residents to behave in a less reactive and more reflective manner when confronted with transferred life stressors. Second, mindfulness meditation techniques were provided for difficult thoughts and feelings related to diabetes, such as paying full attention to the present moment of life and choosing to respond skillfully rather than reacting automatically to external events, thoughts or emotions as they arise. Third, a specific topic, for example on how to be mindful when life style is changed, or how to pay attention to the present moment within Chinese culture of peacefulness was discussed in each session.</description>
