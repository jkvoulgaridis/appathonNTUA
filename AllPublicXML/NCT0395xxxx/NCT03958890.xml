    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, double-blind, multi-center, phase III clinical study comparing
      the clinical efficacy and safety of HLX10 or placebo combined with chemotherapy in first-line
      treatment of locally advanced/metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC)
      patients.This study consists of three periods, screening period (28 days), treatment period
      and follow-up period (including safety follow-up, survival follow-up).Subjects can be
      enrolled into this study only if they meet inclusion criteria and do not meet exclusion
      criteria.
