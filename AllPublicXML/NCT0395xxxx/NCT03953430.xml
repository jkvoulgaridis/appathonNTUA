  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with clubfoot treated with the Ponseti method and undergoing Tibialis Anterior
      tendon transfer from a prospective database are evaluated using gait analysis including the
      Oxford foot model and compared to a group of healthy children.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children with dynamic clubfoot recurrence after initial Ponseti treatment who underwent TATT
      between 2014 and 2017 are considered for this study. Exclusion criteria are neurological
      disease, split transfer of the tendon, additional bone or joint invasive surgery, and initial
      treatment abroad.

      Gait analysis, including the Oxford foot model, will be conducted, and the kinematic and
      kinetic data of the lower extremity will be compared with a group of age-matched healthy
      children. To comprise a control group for the purpose of collecting gait analysis data of
      healthy children, employees of our hospital are asked to allow their children to participate
      in this study.

      Patients will undergo gait analysis, including video recordings with a Vicon motion capture
      system (Vicon, Oxford, UK) with kinetic data collected from three AMTI force plates (Advanced
      Mechanical Technology, Inc., Watertown, MA). Placement of markers will be a combination of
      Cleveland (lower extremity), PlugInGait (upper body), and Oxford Foot (movement within the
      foot) models.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in forefoot supination in relation to hindfoot after TATT during swing</measure>
    <time_frame>preoperative (1-21 days) and 6-12 months postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure is forefoot supination in relation to the hindfoot during swing. Changes of forefoot supination during swing after TATT (6-12 months postoperatively) are compared to preoperative values (Oxford foot model). The parameter is a mean value (in degree) of swing phase supination.
Therefore gait analysis, including video recordings with a Vicon motion capture system (Vicon, Oxford, UK) with kinetic data collected from three AMTI force plates (Advanced Mechanical Technology, Inc., Watertown, MA) will be conducted. Placement of markers will be a combination of Cleveland (lower extremity), PlugInGait (upper body), and Oxford Foot (movement within the foot) models.
Analysis will include graphic gait curve analysis as well as statistical analysis of pre- to postoperative changes.</description>

    <description>Another primary outcome measure is forefoot adduction in relation to the hindfoot during swing. Changes of forefoot adduction during swing after TATT (6-12 months postoperatively) are compared to preoperative values (Oxford foot model).
