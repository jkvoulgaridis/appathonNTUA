      In this prospective study, entitled &quot;The Long-Term Efficacy of Overminus Lens Therapy in
      Intermittent Exotropia&quot;,the investigators examined the long-term impact of overminus lenses
      on the management of intermittent exotropia (IXT), treatment effect after overminus treatment
      has been discontinued and also investigated if overminus lenses cause myopia in long-term.

      Purpose: To evaluate the long-term impact of overminus lenses in intermittent exotropia
      (IXT), to determine if the treatment effect would persist after overminus minus lenses are
      discontinued and also to investigate if overminus lenses cause myopia.

      Materials and Method: Sixty-five consecutive cases of IXT followed for at least 48 months
      were included. Patients with a history of previous surgery, ocular pathology, convergence
      insufficiency, severe myopia (&gt;-5.0 D), severe hyperopia (&gt;+5.0 D), moderate or severe
      amblyopia and poor compliance with spectacles were excluded. Data was collected including
      near stereoacuity, AC/A ratio, control of IXT measured with Newcastle Control Score (NCS) at
      baseline and in all follow-up visits. Baseline values without overminus threapy were compared
      with postintervention values at every visit.
