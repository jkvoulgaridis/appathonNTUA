        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has planned to breastfeed her neonate at any time during the 28-day period after

             clinically significant idiosyncratic reaction to required study medications.

          -  Has been administered bupivacaine within 5 days prior to the scheduled surgery.

          -  Has been administered any local anesthetic within 72 hours prior to the scheduled
             surgery.

          -  Has been administered systemic steroids within 5 half-lives or 10 days prior to
             administration of study drug.

          -  Has initiated treatment with study medications within 1 month prior to study drug
