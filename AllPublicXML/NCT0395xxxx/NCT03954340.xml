    <textblock>
      This study is intended 1. To quantify the effects of the iRemember personalized EEG-NFB
      therapy on working memory and executive functions in subjects with MCI by calculating the
      percentage of change in the Neurotrax tests performed prior to and after the treatment, and
      compare the results between the active treatment and placebo cohorts
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      By using the BestBrain iRemember EEG-NFB System, subjects within the &quot;treatment&quot; arm of this
      clinical investigation will show improvement in working memory, executive functions and
      general improvement in daily life based on standard accepted cognitive tests such as the
      Neurotrax and Kielhfner questionnaire. This hypothesis will be accepted or rejected based on
      the statistical analysis of the data collected .

      Subjects will be randomized either to the treatment or placebo groups. Each subject will
      undergo an initial and final assessment using NeuroTrax and specified questionnaires prior to
      and after 20 treatments. The first sessions will be dedicated to subject evaluation. Each
      subject will undergo either a neurofeedback (NFB) or sham treatment.

    <description>Neurofeedback (NFB) is a treatment technique based on learning with operant conditioning, in which a feedback (or a reward) is given in proportion with the desired physiological activity in order to improve cognition and/or behavior. This research will focus on EEG-NF where electrical activity measured with EEG serves as the physiological activity to be influenced.
EEG-NFB has been successfully used as a clinical tool for over 40 years treating various disorders from Autism , ADHD , Epilepsy , OCD and depression Electroencephalography (EEG) equipment is used to measure the electrical activity representing the neuronal activity of different parts of the brain.
During the treatment, electrode(s) are placed in predetermined location. Audio and visual rewards are given when the activity is measured to be within the desired frequency range.</description>
