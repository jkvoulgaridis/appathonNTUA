    <textblock>
      This trial is a multi-center, open label, randomized controlled, non-inferiority phase III
      trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of a 3 g oral dose of zoliflodacin compared to a
      combination of a single intra-muscular 500 mg dose of ceftriaxone and a single 1 g oral dose
      of azithromycin for the treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhoea.

             cervical uncomplicated gonorrhoea as determined by either a positive culture or NAAT
             or Gram stain or methylene blue test/gentian violet stain in the past 14 days prior to
