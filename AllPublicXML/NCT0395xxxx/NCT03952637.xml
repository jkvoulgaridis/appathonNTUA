    <textblock>
      Background:

      GM1 gangliosidosis is a disorder that destroys nerve cells. It is fatal. There is no
      treatment. People with GM1 are deficient in a certain enzyme. A gene therapy may help the
      body make this enzyme. This could improve GM1 symptoms.

      Objective:

      To test if a gene therapy helps type II GM1 gangliosidosis symptoms.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 2-12 with type II GM1 gangliosidosis

      People ages 6 months to 1 year with type I GM1 gangliosidosis

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with their medical history and a phone survey.

      Participants will stay at NIH for 8-10 weeks.

      Participants will have baseline tests:

      Blood, urine, and heart tests

      Hearing tests

      Ultrasound of abdomen

      EEG: Sticky patches on the participant s head will measure brain function.

      Lumbar puncture: A needle will be stuck into the participant s spine to remove fluid.

      MRI scans, bone x-rays, and bone scans: Participants will lie in a machine that takes
      pictures of the body

      IQ tests

      Neurology exams

      Central line placement

      Skin biopsy: A small piece of the participant s skin will be removed.

      Speech tests

      Participants will have an x-ray while swallowing food.

      Participants will take drugs by mouth and IV. This will get their immune system ready for
      therapy.

      Participants will get the gene therapy by IV. They may stay at NIH for a week to watch for
      side effects.

      Participants will have visits 3 and 6 months after treatment. Then visits will be every 6
      months for 2 years. Then they will have a visit at 3 years. Visits will take 4-5 days.

      Participants will return to NIH once a year for 2 years for tests in an extension study....

      This is a non-randomized, Phase 1/2 clinical trial to study the safety and efficacy of a
      single dose gene transfer vector AAV9/GLB1 (AAV9-GLB1) by intravenous infusion to subjects
      with Type II GM1 gangliosidosis. Subjects in this study will be male and female, greater than
      or equal to 2 years old and less than or equal to 12 years old, with genetically confirmed
      mutations and phenotype consistent with diagnosis of Type II GM1 gangliosidosis and be
      seronegative for anti-AAV9 antibodies. Other inclusion/exclusion criteria apply. Each subject
      will receive 1.5 x 10^13 vg/kg of the gene transfer agent. A total of 4 subjects will be
      treated at the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, MD.

      The primary objective of this first-in-human study is to assess the safety of the AAV9-GLB1
      vector following intravenous infusion. Secondary objectives include: 1) Assess developmental
      change in the Growth Scale Scores on the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales Third Edition
      (Vineland-3) instrument between pre- and post-treatment, 2) Assess brain volume using a 3T
      MRI, and central nervous system (CNS) metabolite levels by magnetic resonance spectroscopy
      (MRI) between pre- and post-treatment and compared to historical controls, 3) Assess motor
      function using mobility scales developed as part of the natural history study, 4) Assess
      change in disease severity using the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) scale.

      Exploratory objectives include: 1) Plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and urinary biomarkers
      of disease progression 2) Examine differences in resting state functional connectivity (RSFC)
      using functional MRI (fMRI), 3) Assess neurological symptoms based on clinical and
      developmental rating scale scores and a structured videotaped neurologic exam pre- and
      post-treatment, 4) Assess immune tolerance to the gene transfer vector with antibody titers
      to AAV9 in serum and CSF, 5) Measure GM1-galactosidase enzyme activity in CSF pre- and
      post-treatment, and 6) Measure GM1 ganglioside levels in CSF pre- and post-treatment.

      GM1 gangliosidosis is an autosomal recessive, neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorder
      resulting from mutations in the GLB1 gene, encoding the enzyme beta-galactosidase (betagal).
      Betagal functions by removing terminal galactose moieties from GM1 ganglioside, a
      glycosphingolipid present in highest quantity in the CNS, primarily found in neurons. Betagal
      deficiency leads to accumulation of GM1 ganglioside and its asialo derivative (GA1) in the
      CNS. The age of onset and progression of GM1 gangliosidosis differs depending on the amount
      of residual betagal activity, but the disease is generally divided into three clinical forms:
      Type I (infantile), Type IIa and IIb (late-infantile and juvenile), and Type III (adult or
      chronic). This clinical trial will treat GM1 Type II subjects. This form of GM1 generally has
      onset between 3 and 5 years with plateauing, then regression of developmental milestones
      (juvenile) or onset of symptoms after 12 months but before 24 months, plateauing of
      milestones then regression (late-infantile). Clinical features vary but in addition to CNS
      manifestations typically include a degree of skeletal involvement and mild
      hepatosplenomegaly. The primary symptoms are frequent falls, poor coordination, dysarthria
      and cognitive decline. Disease progression is variable, with subjects surviving well into the
      third decade (juvenile) or into the late teens (late-infantile), but with severe cognitive
      and physical disabilities. GM1 gangliosidosis is extremely rare, with an incidence estimated
      at 1:100,000 to 1:200,000. The disease is uniformly fatal with no effective therapy. Care is
      limited to symptomatic medical management. Intravenous administration of a gene transfer
      vector to deliver a normal copy of the GLB1 gene to the CNS could potentially provide an
      effective treatment for GM1 gangliosidosis.

    <description>The risks of administering this treatment in a subject with GMl gangliosidosis are not completely known. The major risk associated with intravenous infusion is from the subject's immunological response to the viral capsid and/or the beta-gal protein. To reduce this possibility, immune modulation therapy is being started prior to vector delivery and maintained for six months afterward. There is a theoretical risk that the integration of a small percentage of the rAAV vector DNA into the host cell genome could cause cellular transformation to cancer cells and lead to a malignancy. This has never been seen in subjects receiving intravenous AAV9 gene therapy so the risk of this complication, is likely very low.</description>

    <description>The audiology assessment will be performed in the Audiology Clinic using a standard audiogram to measure thresholds for pure tones and speech, word recognition, tympanometry, and otoacoustic emissions if the subject is capable and tolerant of these measures. The assessment will take approximately 30 minutes. The ABR is a noninvasive neurophysiologic test to evaluate electrical signal transmission from the 8th cranial nerve to the brainstem and the cortex in response to specific tones. Electrodes are placed on the scalp and on each earlobe. An earphone gives off a brief click or tone and the electrodes pick up the brain's responses to these sounds and record them. This will be performed by a trained neurophysiology technician to monitor possible change in hearing during treatment. The procedure will be performed in the Interventional Radiology suite while the subject is sedated following the MRI, fMRI, and MRS of the brain.</description>

The NIH Swallowing Questionnaire from the Speech Language Pathology Section is designed to identify the presence and or absence of functional swallowing dysfunction as perceived by the subject and or caregiver. This 4point scale assists with further identification of clinical/research assessments of oral pharyngeal swallowing function if indicated in the form of a modified barium swallow. In addition to swallow assessments, tape recording of speech will also be included with diadochokinetic tasks and sustained phonations as well as speech if able. Recordings will be stored on a shared drive accessible only by the study team. The assessment may take approximately 30 minutes to 1 hour.</description>
