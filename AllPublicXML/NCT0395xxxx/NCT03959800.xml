  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this retrospective and prospective project is to understand the molecular and
      genetic basis of liver cancer of childhood. Understanding the molecular and genetic bases of
      liver cancers can offer a better classification based on tumor biology, mechanisms and
      predisposition.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pediatric liver cancers are rare, affecting at times no more than 1 in one million
      population. Understanding the molecular basis of these cancers is important in order to
      develop more accurate diagnoses and more effective treatments. Current classifications of
      these cancers are based on how these cancers look on diagnostic studies such as radiologic
      imaging or under the microscope. Such a classification system does not explain why a
      particular cancer has a different outcome from what is considered &quot;usual&quot; for that particular
      cancer. Nor does such a classification system explain why two different classes of cancers
      behave the same way. Understanding the genetic bases of liver cancers can offer a better
      classification based on tumor biology, mechanisms and predisposition.

      To achieve these goals, large numbers of such cancer patients or affected tissue must be
      collected. This is not possible in any single institution, or any single country. The current
      project will collect biological samples such as residual tumor tissue, saliva, or blood from
      affected patients and their biological parents and families, along with clinical information
      about the cancer. These biological samples will be used to study the genes and how these
      genes work in tumor tissue and in non-tumor tissue. The results of this study will permit
      childhood liver cancers to be categorized on the basis of common defects in genes and their
      function.
