    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of Cognitive Behavioral Training for
      Insomnia (CBT-I) on improving cognitive function in older adults with symptoms of insomnia,
      determine the association between change in sleep measures and change in cognitive function,
      and to examine the efficacy of CBT-I on reducing the rate of Aβ deposition. Participants,
      ages 60-85, will be randomly assigned to a six-week CBT-I training or to an active control
      group. A sub-group of fifty CBT-I participants will undergo Florbetapir-Positron-emission
      tomography (PET) imaging during the one-year reassessment to examine the efficacy of CBT-I on
      reducing the rate of Aβ accumulation from baseline to one year post CBT-I.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lifestyle interventions to increase exercise and improve diet have been the focus of recent
      clinical trials to potentially prevent Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, despite the strong
      links between sleep disruptions, cognitive decline, and AD, sleep enhancement has yet to be
      targeted as a lifestyle intervention to prevent AD. Approximately fifteen percent of AD may
      be prevented by an efficacious intervention aimed to reduce sleep disturbances and sleep
      disorders. Chronic insomnia is the most frequent sleep disorder occurring in at least forty
      percent of older adults. Individuals with insomnia are more likely to be diagnosed with AD
      and demonstrate a decline in cognitive function at long-term follow-up. AD is characterized
      by the accumulation of Aβ plaques and tau tangles in the brain, and growing evidence shows
      impaired sleep contributes to the accumulation of Aβ. An intervention aimed at improving
      insomnia may represent a critical opportunity for primary prevention to slow cognitive
      decline and potentially delay the onset of AD. CBT-I is an efficacious treatment for
      insomnia, but the use of CBT-I to improve cognitive function and potentially reduce the rate
      of Aβ accumulation has never been examined. Therefore, the long-term goal of this research
      agenda is to understand how addressing sleep disturbances may delay the onset of AD.
