    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to characterize the safety, tolerability, dose limiting
      toxicities, maximum tolerated dose, maximum administered dose, or alternative dose of
      BMS-986301 alone or in combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab to participants with cancers
      that have failed to respond to or are known to be insensitive to T cell checkpoint inhibiting
      antibodies.
