  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic ileocolic resection is the preferred surgical approach for patients with
      ileocecal Crohn's disease (CD). Objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a
      minimally invasive gas-less ileocolic resection in complex cases of CD through a Mc Burney
      incision, in patients who already had a previous appendectomy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      From January 2016 to December 2017, all consecutive CD patients with primary or recurrent
      complex disease referred for IC resection were evaluated for the study purpose.Complex
      disease patients presenting McBurney incision for a previous open appendectomy were included
      in the group of study. This group was compared with a control group of CD patients with the
      same clinical characteristics of ileocolic disease who underwent standard laparoscopic IC
      resection, pooled out from the database of IC resections for CD of the Minimally Invasive and
      Gastrointestinal Surgery Unit of Tor Vergata Hospital, Rome, Italy. Data on demographics,
      BMI, type and behavior of CD, presence of disease apart from ileocecal site, previous
      surgery, recurrence, current medical treatment, thickening of the mesentery, preoperative
      imaging results (MR enterography or small intestine contrast ultrasound), operative time,
      blood loss, conversion to laparoscopy and conversion to open rates, complications, adherence
      rate to ERAS protocols and length of hospital stay were collected for the study purpose.
