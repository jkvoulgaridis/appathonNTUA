  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will refine and test the effectiveness of CareAvenue, an automated e-health tool
      that informs and activates patients with uncontrolled diabetes to take steps in accessing
      resources and engaging in self-care. Our central hypothesis is that activating patients with
      uncontrolled diabetes and linking them to resources to address financial burden and unmet
      social risk factors will improve both intermediate outcomes and measures of disease control
      above and beyond existing services, especially for high need patients.

    <measure>Change in HbA1c as measured by an HbA1c machine</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in HbA1c will be measured at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months using HbA1c machine. HbA1c is a measure of the average level of glucose in blood over the past 3 months measured as a percentage.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in blood pressure as measured an automated blood pressure machine</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in blood pressure will be measured at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months using an automated blood pressure machine. Blood pressure is measured as systolic blood pressure/diastolic blood pressure in millimeters of mercury (e.g., 120/80 mm Hg).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Change in Cost-Related Non-Adherence Behaviors with prescribed treatment regimens related to diabetes as measured by participant questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Cost-Related Non-Adherence (CRN) Behaviors related to diabetes will be measured at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months by 4-items adapted from the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey and 2 items adapted from the National Health Interview Survey that look at diabetes. The items are measured with a 4-point Likert scale. Participants answering &quot;often&quot; or &quot;sometimes&quot; to any of the items are indicated as exhibiting CRN.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Cost-Related Non-Adherence Behaviors with prescribed treatment regimens related to other conditions being managed as measured by participant questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Cost-Related Non-Adherence (CRN) Behaviors related to other conditions being managed will be measured at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months by 4-items adapted from the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey and 2 items adapted from the National Health Interview Survey that look at other health conditions being managed. The items are measured with a 4-point Likert scale. Participants answering &quot;often&quot; or &quot;sometimes&quot; to any of the items are indicated as exhibiting CRN.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Perceived Financial Burden as measured by the Comprehensive Score for Financial Toxicity (COST) - Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Perceived Financial Burden will be measured at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months by the 12-item measure Comprehensive Score for Financial Toxicity (COST) - Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT). The items are measured with a 5-point Likert scale. The higher the score the better the Financial well-being.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Unmet Social Risk Factors as measured by participant questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in Unmet Social Risk Factors will be measured at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months by 20 items adapted from the Accountable Health Communities Health-Related Social Needs Screening Tool, the Health Leads Social Needs Screening Toolkit, and the Kaiser Permanente Your Current Life Situation Questionnaire. The item values are binary (yes/no). Number of &quot;yes&quot; responses indicates number of unmet social risk factors.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Unmet Social Risk Factors as measured by participant questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in Unmet Social Risk Factors will be measured at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months by 3 items from the Accountable Health Communities Health-Related Social Needs Screening Tool and 1 item adapted from the National Health Interview Survey. The items each have three response options, in which a positive response indicates an unmet social risk factor.</description>
