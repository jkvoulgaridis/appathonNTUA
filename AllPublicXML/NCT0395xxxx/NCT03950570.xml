    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the anti-tumor effects of ORIN 1001 in patients with advanced solid
      tumors and relapsed refractory (patients with progressive disease after receiving at least
      two lines of therapy in the advanced setting) metastatic breast cancer.

    <textblock>
      This is a first in human, Phase 1, open label, dose escalation and dose expansion study that
      consists of two stages: A dose escalation stage to determine the MTD/RP2D of ORIN1001 when
      given as a single agent in up to 30 subjects with advanced solid tumors. In addition, a dose
      escalation stage to determine the MTD/RP2D of daily ORIN1001 in combination with paclitaxel
      given intravenously at 175 mg/m2 in up to 18 subjects with relapsed refractory metastatic
      breast cancer (TNBC, MYC+, or ER+ HER2-) . An expansion stage of ORIN1001 alone (Cohort A:
      TNBC) and in combination with paclitaxel (Cohorts B: MYC+; Cohort C: ER+ HER2-, and Cohort D:
      TNBC) to estimate efficacy in up to 120 subjects with relapsed refractory.
