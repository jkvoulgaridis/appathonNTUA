  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

        1. . The incidence and mortality of colon cancer are high in China and in the world.

        2. . The treatment of many patients in the real world is not standardized, and there are
           problems such as over-treatment or under-treatment. To explore the adjuvant treatment of
           colon cancer in the Chinese population, this study will retrospectively analyze
           real-world data on adjuvant therapy for colon cancer in Chinese patients after radical
           surgery.

      The purpose of research:

        1. . Current status of adjuvant therapy for stage II-III colon cancer in the real world:
           chemotherapy regimen, chemotherapy time, efficacy, safety, etc.

        2. . Comparison of efficacy and safety of different adjuvant chemotherapy time (&lt;3 months
           vs. &gt;=3 months) in high-risk stage II and III colon cancer patients in the real world

        3. . Comparison of efficacy and safety of different adjuvant chemotherapy regimens (XELOX
           vs. FOLFOX) in high-risk stage II and III colon cancer patients in the real world
