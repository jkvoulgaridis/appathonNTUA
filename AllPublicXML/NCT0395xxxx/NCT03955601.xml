  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe and very severe aplastic anemia are life threatening disorders for which allogeneic
      stem cell transplant is only curative treatment. However, matched sibling donor (MSD) is
      available in only 25-35% cases. Pakistan has a population of around 203 million but there is
      no donor registry available so there is no option available for matched unrelated donor (MUD)
      transplants . Haploidentical transplant represents only curative option for patients lacking
      MSD. Protocols involving post transplant cyclophosphamide require Total body irradiation
      (TBI) and utilize peripheral blood stem cell(PBSC) as graft source. TBI is not available in
      most of transplant centres across Pakistan due to lack of availability , cost and lack of
      expertise. The investigators have conceived a novel TBI free conditioning regimen to be used
      for haplo-identical Hemtopoeitic stem cell transplant in acquired aplastic anemia patients

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aplastic anemia is considered to be a rare and heterogenous disease with incidence of 1-2 per
      million in western countries. Data from Asian studies show a 3-4 fold higher
      incidence.Majority of newly diagnosed aplastic anemia patients are younger and in Armed
      forces bone marrow transplant cohort of 1324 patients 64 % patient are younger than 24 years
      of age and 87% patients younger than 40 years (unpublished data).There is no donor registry
      in Pakistan and patients lacking sibling match donor cannot proceed to stem cell transplant
      due lack of matched unrelated donors. Horse antithymocyte globulin is not available currently
      in Pakistan and response to Rabbit antithymocyte globulin is dismal as shown in number of
      international studies. So haploidentical stem cell transplant remains only curative option
      for patients lacking Matched sibling donor. Currently there are 2 major platforms used for
      haplo-identical stem cell transplant. Post transplant cyclophosphamide based using TBI and
      haplo regimen of Peking university. TBI is not available for most of our patients in Pakistan
      due to cost,non-availability and lack of expertise. The investigators have formulated a novel
      TBI free regimen incorporating Busulphan, antithymocyte globulin and using co-primed bone
      marrow and peripheral blood harvest to minimize graft-versus-host disease and facilitate
      engraftment. Post transplant cyclophosphamide, Cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil will be
      used for graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis
