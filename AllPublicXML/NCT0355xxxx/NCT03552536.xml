  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and
      anti-retroviral therapy (ART) activity of the tenofovir prodrug, MK-8583 monotherapy in
      ART-naïve, HIV-1 infected participants. The primary hypothesis is that at a dose that is
      sufficiently safe and generally well tolerated, MK-8583 has superior anti-retroviral activity
      compared to historical placebo, as measured by change from baseline in plasma HIV-1
      ribonucleic acid (RNA) (log10 copies/mL) at 168 hours post-dose.

    <measure>Number of Participants With at Least One Adverse Event (AE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 29</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor's product, is also an AE.</description>

    <description>Plasma HIV-1 RNA was measured at baseline and 168 hours after dosing. Change from baseline for MK-8583 at 168 hours post-baseline was estimated from longitudinal data analysis (LDA) model containing fixed effects for time (predose, 168 hours postdose) and a random effect for participant. The change from baseline in plasma HIV-1 RNA in participants administered MK-8583 was compared with historical placebo data.</description>

        <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor's product, is also an AE.</description>
