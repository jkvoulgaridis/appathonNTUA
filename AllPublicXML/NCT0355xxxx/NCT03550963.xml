  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since the prevalence of gestational diabetes melitus (GDM) increased by ..., as an important
      part of medical treatment, nutrition therapy is highly required to help patients achieve
      normoglycemia. Carbohydrate intake is the primary nutrient affecting postprandial glucose
      levels,therefore the total amount and type of carbohydrate should be manipulated to blunt
      postprandial hyperglycemia. However,the type of carbohydrate has not yet been established.
      Rice and wheaten food have similar Glycemic Index (GI),but some researches found the glucose
      response to them is different. A case-control study is designed to compare the glucose
      control status between rice-richen meal and wheaten-richen meal, and all other macronutrients
      and micronutrients are all calculated and same between two groups, which may provide more
      clues for type of carbohydrate recommendation for Chinese women with GDM.
