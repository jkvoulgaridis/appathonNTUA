  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot outpatient study conducted at Stanford to obtain preliminary data on how
      Fiasp® works in a closed-loop system and to determine if any changes need to be made to the
      670G pump to optimize the use of Fiasp®.

  <detailed_description>

      This will be a randomized cross-over blinded study and to see how the 670G pump responds to
      the introduction of Fiasp® insulin. Subjects enrolled in the study will have a 2 week period
      of optimization with weekly assessments of their Carelink download before entering the
      blinded phase of the study. They will use their usual home insulin during the optimization
      phase. They will then be started on their first blinded insulin (aspart or Fiasp®) which they
      will use for 2 weeks, before they cross-over to the other insulin.
