             variable of CDAI) over the 7 most recent days out of the 10 days before colonoscopy
             preparation (may or may not be contiguous) AND/OR ii. Average of the daily stool
             frequency subscore &gt;=4 of type 6/7 (very soft stools/liquid stools) as shown in the
             BSFS over the 7 most recent days out of the 10 days before colonoscopy preparation
             (may or may not be contiguous) c. Presence of ulcerations that are characteristic to
             CD, as determined by a colonoscopy performed during screening, and as defined by the
             SES-CD &gt;6 (SES CD &gt;=4 for isolated ileitis) Note that the participant must be

             cannot be performed locally, a central laboratory may be used, with prior agreement
             from the sponsor:

               1. An IGRA is strongly recommended for participants with a prior Bacillus
                  Calmette-Guérin vaccination but may be used for any participant Documentation of
                  IGRA product used and the test result must be in the participant's source
                  documentation if performed locally Acceptable IGRA products include
                  QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus In-Tube Test

               2. If the results of the IGRA are indeterminate, the test may be repeated, and if a
                  negative result is obtained, enrollment may proceed In participants with no
                  history of treated active or latent TB, a positive test on repeat will exclude
                  the participantParticipants with a history of active or latent TB infection must
                  follow instructions for &quot;Participants with a prior diagnosis of active or latent
                  TB are excluded unless both of the following criteria are met&quot; in this criterion

               3. Participants with repeat indeterminate IGRA results, with no prior TB history,
                  may be enrolled after consultation with a pulmonary or infectious disease
                  specialist who determines low risk of infection (ie, participant would be
                  acceptable for immunosuppressant [eg, anti-TNF] treatment without additional
                  action) This consultation must be included in source documentation Results from a
                  chest x-ray, taken within the 12 weeks before or during screening (Visit 1)must
                  show no abnormalities suggestive of active TB infection as determined by a
                  qualified medical specialist

          -  Participants with a pre-existing demyelinating disorder such as multiple sclerosis or

             deficits, or significant abnormalities noted during screening

          -  Participants with any unexplained symptoms suggestive of PML based on the targeted
             neurological assessment during the screening period

          -  Participants with a transplanted organ. Skin grafts to treat pyoderma gangrenosum are
             allowed

                  cardiovascular, pulmonary, immunologic [eg, Felty's syndrome], or local active
                  infection/infectious illness) that, in the investigator's judgment will
                  substantially increase the risk to the subject if he or she participates in the
                  study

               2. Cancer or history of cancer or lymphoproliferative disease within the previous 5
                  years (other than resected cutaneous basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell

                  no evidence of recurrence)

               3. Presence of acute coronary syndrome (eg, acute myocardial infarction, unstable
                  angina pectoris) within 24 weeks before screening (Visit 1)

               4. History of significant cerebrovascular disease within 24 weeks before screening
                  (Visit 1)

          -  Participants who have had significant trauma or major surgery within 4 weeks before
             the screening (Visit 1), or with any major elective surgery scheduled to occur during
             the study.

          -  Participant with evidence of cirrhosis with or without decompensation (ie, esophageal
             varices, hepatic encephalopathy, portal hypertension, ascites)

          -  Participant with primary sclerosing cholangitis

          -  Participant with evidence of positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or hepatitis
             B core antibody (HBcAb) Note: if a subject tests negative for HBsAg, but positive for
             HBcAb, the subject would be considered eligible if no presence of hepatitis B virus
             (HBV) DNA is confirmed by HBV DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) reflex testing
             performed in the central laboratory

          -  Participant with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) (positive HCV antibody [HCVAb] and
             HCV RNA) Note: Participant who are HCVAb positive without evidence of HCV RNA may be
             considered eligible (spontaneous viral clearance or previously treated and cured
             [defined as no evidence of HCV RNA at least 12 weeks prior to baseline])

          -  Participant with any of the following abnormalities in hematology and/or serum
             chemistry profiles during screening (Visit 1) Note: Screening laboratory tests, if the
             results are considered by the investigator to be transient and inconsistent with the
             subject's clinical condition, may be repeated once during the screening period for
             confirmation results must be reviewed for eligibility prior to the screening
             colonoscopy procedure

                  &lt;150,000 cells/mm3, a further evaluation should be performed to rule out
                  cirrhosis, unless another etiology has already been identified
