      Evaluation of the impact of the introduction of multiplex PCR panels on the clinical
      management of patients with gastroenteritis at the University Hospital of Lausanne,
      Switzerland.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gastrointestinal multiplex PCR panels have been introduced in clinical practice several years
      ago, but the impact on the management of patients is yet unknown. The investigators are
      interested to evaluate if the multiplex PCR panels introduced at the University Hospital of
      Lausanne in July 2017 modified the usual medical care and in particular the prescription of
      anti-infectious treatments. The high sensitivity of the multiplex PCR panels should allow a
      more precise diagnosis of the etiology of the gastrointestinal symptoms of the patients than
      the traditional methods of stool culture and microscopy. The investigators expect therefore
      to observe a modification of the proportion of patients receiving anti-infectious treatment,
      but it is uncertain if it will lead to an increase or a decrease in the use of antibiotics.
      On one hand antibiotics could be prescribed more often due to a greater and faster detection
      of enteropathogens. On the other hand antibiotics could be prescribed less often due to more
      precise diagnosis, showing that viruses and certain bacteria do not require antibiotic
      treatment.
