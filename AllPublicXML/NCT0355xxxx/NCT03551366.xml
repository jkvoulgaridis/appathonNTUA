      The Skill Acquisition Methods underpinning Pedagogy for LEarning in Physical Education
      (SAMPLE-PE) project aims to investigate the influence of different pedagogical approaches to
      teaching and learning in physical education (PE) on 5-6 year old children's health and
      development. Schools from deprived areas are invited to take part in the project and will be
      randomly assigned to either: (1) linear pedagogy PE curriculum programme, (2) nonlinear
      pedagogy PE curriculum programme or (3) carry on as normal. The linear and nonlinear pedagogy
      PE programmes will be underpinned by different and contrasting theories of skill acquisition
      and are delivered by trained coaches over 15 weeks. Children will be measured to assess their
      physical, psychological, cognitive, and emotional health and development, and their physical
      activity levels at the start of the study, immediately after the 15 week PE programme, and
      again after 12 months. It is expected that children taking part in the linear and nonlinear
      PE programmes will demonstrate greater physical development than children attending schools
      that carry on as normal. Furthermore, it is also anticipated that children taking part in the
      nonlinear PE programme will show greater gains in psychological, cognitive and emotional
      outcomes than the linear and usual practice programmes.

    <description>Perceived Physical competence will be assessed using the corresponding subscale within The Pictorial Scale of Perceived Competence and Social Acceptance for Young Children (Harter &amp; Pike, 1984). The Physical Competence subscale includes items 3, 7, 11, 15, 19, and 23 from the Pictorial Scale. Each item is scored on a 4-point scale, where 4 represents the highest degree of perceived competence. The subscale score is computed by adding values of child responses and ranges from 6 to 24.</description>

    <description>Perceived Skill Competence will be assessed by the Pictorial Scale of Perceived Movement Skill Competence for Young Children (Barnett et al., 2015).
The Scale consists of twelve items with two subscales of six items each representing &quot;Locomotor Skill Perceived Competence&quot; and &quot;Object-Control Skill Perceived Competence&quot;, respectively. Each item is scored on a 4-point scale, where 4 represents the highest degree of perceived competence. Subscale scores are computed by adding values of child responses and range from 6 to 24 (higher values indicate higher perceived competence).
All 12 items are summed to generate the Perceived Movement Skill Competence scale score, which ranges from 12 to 48 (higher values indicate higher perceived competence).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (Month 0), after the intervention (approximately 5 months post-baseline) and follow-up (approximately 12 month post-baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>Self-Regulation will be assessed by the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (Goodman, 1997; Stone et al., 2010), as completed by the child's class teacher.
The Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire consists of 25 items within 5 subscales (emotional, conduct, hyperactivity, peer and prosocial).
There are five items on each subscale with each item scored 0, 1 or 2. Scores therefore range from 0-10 for each subscale, with 10 indicating higher levels of difficulties (emotional, conduct, hyperactivity, peer subscales) or strengths (prosocial subscale) and 0 indicating lower levels.
A total difficulties score is also generated by summing scores from all the scales except the prosocial scale, with scores ranging from 0 (low) to 40 (high).</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline Self-Regulation at 5 and 12 Months (Response to Challenge Scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Month 0), after the intervention (approximately 5 months post-baseline) and follow-up (approximately 12 month post-baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>Self-Regulation will be assessed by the Response to Challenge Scale (RCS: Lakes, 2012; 2013)
The RCS is an observer-rated measure of children's responses to a physical challenge and includes 16 bipolar adjectives (e.g., VulnerableâInvincible) rated on 7-point scales (scored 1-7).
There are three subscales assessed: &quot;Cognitive&quot; (6 items, scoring range from 6 to 42), &quot;Affective&quot; (7 items, scoring range from 7 to 49) and &quot;Physical/Motor&quot; (3 items, scoring range from 3 to 21). Negatively worded items are reversed prior to aggregation, so that possible scores on all subscales ranged from 1 to 7, with higher scores indicating greater self-regulation.</description>

    <description>Subjects in this group will receive a linear PE curriculum for 15 weeks. Linear Pedagogy is underpinned by neuro-computation approach to motor learning such as information processing theory and prescribes that an ideal movement pattern exists for each task and that the teacher's role is to help learners recreate that pattern. Furthermore, theorists have suggested that learning is a gradual, linear process. This linear pedagogy is supported by a teaching and learning approach that includes both prescriptive and repetitive actions, utilising technical demonstrations that provide learners with a 'visual template or criterion model' for the desired skill . As a consequence, a PE pedagogy has developed whereby the teacher's role is to make all the decisions, and the learner's role is to follow their instructions on cue - a teacher-led approach to PE.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Subjects in this group will receive a nonlinear PE curriculum for 15 weeks. Nonlinear pedagogy is grounded in Ecological Dynamics theory. Ecological dynamics regards learners as complex adaptive systems which afford opportunities for action from their environment and generate movement solutions to satisfy the combination of personal, environmental and task constraints imposed upon them. According to nonlinear pedagogy, the teacher's role is to design learning experiences that create behavioural symmetry between learning and the performance environment. The teacher is a facilitator and manipulates constraints to channel the learner's physical development, while learners are left free to experiment and select the movement solutions that best answer their individual needs. This child-focused, less prescriptive approach may enhance a child's intrinsic motivation by offering freedom to choose, and an emphasis on exploration and problem solving.</description>

    <description>The linear pedagogy arms consists of three, five-week phases of lesson delivery, commencing around two weeks after baseline assessments. The first phase focuses on dance, the second on gymnastics and the final phase on ball sports. Each phase has its own schemes of work which includes five lessons objectives, each taught over a two lesson period. The lesson objectives aligned to the aims of English national curriculum. Lessons are delivered twice a week by trained coaches, with each lesson lasting 60 minutes in total, with 45 minutes of on task teaching time. Linear curriculum lessons will be focused on the functioning of the body and children learning movement patterns. These lessons will be far more prescriptive and have clearly stated outcomes/goals for each lesson, with a typical lesson structure following the structure of warm up, isolated practice of technique or skill, simulated game and warm down.</description>

    <description>The non-linear pedagogy arm consists of three, five-week phases of lesson delivery, commencing around two weeks after baseline assessments. The first phase focuses on dance, the second on gymnastics and the final phase on ball sports.

Lessons are delivered twice a week by trained coaches, with each lesson lasting 60 minutes in total, with 45 minutes of on task teaching time. The nonlinear curriculum lessons will look to make sure that children are both engaged and empowered throughout the learning process. In adherence to representative learning design, we will look to contextualise lessons and guide learning through the use of books/stories, lived experiences and the sharing of ideas.</description>
