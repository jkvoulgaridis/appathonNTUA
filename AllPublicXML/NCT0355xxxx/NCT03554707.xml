  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is a early phase 1, open label, single center, single arm study of the
      combination of intravenously administered SGT-53 and irradiation and/or chemotherapy in
      pediatric patients with recurrent or progressive CNS malignancies. The objective of the study
      is to establish the safety and feasibility of administration of SGT-53 in conjunction with
      conventional radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy in children with recurrent or refractory CNS
      malignancies.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 13 months</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence that began or worsened in grade after the start of study drug through 30 days after the last dose. The safety will be assessed by the number and severity of any AE or serious adverse events (SAE) experienced by the patients, and by their relationship to the study drug SGT-53 (e.g. definitely, probably, possibly, unlikely or unrelated). Severity will be graded according to NCI CTCAE version 4.0.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Response Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>36 months</time_frame>
    <description>The response rate will be calculated from the percentage of patients whose cancer shrinks or disappears after treatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response</measure>
    <time_frame>36 months</time_frame>
    <description>The duration of response will be the time calculated from documentation of tumor response as indicated by response criteria, to disease progression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>36 months</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival will be calculated from date of original diagnoses to death and also from the date of study registration to death.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progressive-Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>36 months</time_frame>
    <description>PFS will be calculated at all times during follow-up, with particular interest in the 6-month time point. Progression free survival will be calculated from date of first treatment to the date of first observation of progressive disease, non-reversible neurological progression or increasing steroid requirements (applies to stable disease only), death due to any cause, or early discontinuation of treatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Characterization of Phenotype of Patients</measure>
    <time_frame>4-5 days</time_frame>
    <description>Tissue will be obtained from each enrolling patient for subsequent testing for TP53 pathway functionality, including assessment of mdm2, p21, and other mutation or expression alterations. This analysis will also include measures of commonly assessed polymorphisms, including MGMT methylation assessment, ATRX mutation among others.</description>

    <description>Radiation phase: SGT-53 will be given at 2.1 mg DNA/m2 twice weekly for the first week of radiation therapy, and then increase to 2.8 mg DNA/m2 twice weekly. Radiation therapy will be administered as per clinical care, with a target of fifteen (15) fractions, but patients with other clinically-determined radiation plans will be allowed.
Chemotherapy phase: SGT-53 will be administered at the highest tolerated dose given during radiation phase. Irinotecan will be given at a dose of 50mg/m2/dose IV daily for five days in a 4-week cycle. Temozolomide will be given at a dose of 100mg/m2 PO daily for five days in a 4-week cycle and bevacizumab will be given at a dose of 10mg/kg IV every two weeks in a 4-week cycle.</description>
