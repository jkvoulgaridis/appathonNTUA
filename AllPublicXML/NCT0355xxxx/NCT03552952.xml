      This study aims to explore the developmental of the gut microbiome in preterm infants as they
      grow and mature

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preterm birth, defined as childbirth occurring at less than 37 completed weeks, is a major
      determinant of neonatal mortality and morbidity and has long-term adverse consequences for
      health. The human microbiome is the collective genome of the immense ecosystem of trillions
      of microbes and is considered to have a coevolved relationship with the immune system and
      fundamental roles in multiple aspects of human physiology. Little is known about the
      developmental of the gut microbiome in preterm infants as they grow and mature.

      One hundred premature infants born in Rambam healthcare campus in Haifa, Israel, will be
      recruited to the study and 100 term healthy infants will be recruited as controls. Infants
      born before 24 weeks of gestation or have birth weights of less than 400 g and infants with
      severe congenital anomalies will be excluded from the study. Fecal samples will be collected
      during the hospital stay and in follow-up visits. Blood samples will be taken during the
      hospital stay. The investigators will analyze the data from this clinical cohort using
      computational and experimental approaches for extracting novel information on microbiome
      composition and development, gene function, metabolic pathways and metabolite production.
