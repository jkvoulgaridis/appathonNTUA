  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Monocentric study with the objective to evaluate the impact of genotyping CYP2C19 on the
      hospitalization period. The genotyping will permit to adapt at best the Voriconazole
      posology.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this multi-center study is to evaluate the impact of dose adjustment of
      Voriconazole after CYP2C19 genotyping at the start of treatment, on the length of hospital
      stay.

      Thus, a new strategy will be proposed as part of this project and will be compared to the
      reference strategy:

      The New strategy: genotyping of CYP2C19 in any patient receiving treatment with Voriconazole
      in order to better adapt the treatment regimen as quickly as possible (increase of the dosage
      of Voriconazole in high-speed metabolisers or use of another antifungal, decreased dosage in
      poor metabolisers).

      The Reference strategy: pharmacological therapeutic monitoring of Voriconazole allowing an
      adaptation of the Voriconazole dosage based on the residual concentration measured once
      steady state has been reached (5 elimination half-lives).

      Multicenter, randomized study comparing two strategies of Voriconazole adaptation according
      to whether or not genotyping of CYP2C19 is performed as soon as Voriconazole is started.

      Thus, the new strategy tested in this project and compared to the reference strategy
      (adaptation of Voriconazole dosage depending on the residual concentration), will be a
      genotyping of CYP2C19 in any patient receiving a treatment based on Voriconazole in order to
      better adapt the treatment regimen as quickly as possible (increase in the dosage of
      Voriconazole or use of another antifungal agent in ultra-rapid metabolisers, decrease in
      dosage in poor metabolisers).
