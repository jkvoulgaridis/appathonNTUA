    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare a study drug known as LY2963016 with insulin glargine
      (Lantus) in healthy Chinese participants. Blood samples will be taken to compare how the body
      handles the drugs and how they affect blood sugar levels. Side effects and tolerability will
      be documented. The study will last at least 18 days, not including screening. Screening is
      required within 4 weeks prior to the start of the study.
