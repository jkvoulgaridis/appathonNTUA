  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of the collaborative care model
      in Singapore in which clinical pharmacists, nurses and dietitians are active participants who
      collaborate with physicians in caring for patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM).Since
      DM is a cardiovascular risk equivalent, co-morbidities such as hypertension (HTN) and
      dyslipidaemia (DLP) will also be evaluated to assess the holistic care provided for the
      investigator's patients afflicted with these top chronic diseases in Singapore.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Specifically, this study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of an integrated collaborative
      care model comprising of a healthcare team (physician, clinical pharmacist, nurse, and/or
      dietitian) compared to the usual or conventional healthcare model (physician-centered care)
      mainly in the clinical, humanistic and economic outcomes.
