  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study in 50 healthy
      adolescents and children, 9-17 years of age, inclusive, who are in good health and meet all
      eligibility criteria. This clinical trial is designed to assess the safety and immunogenicity
      of a prime-boost regimen of H3N2 M2SR intranasal influenza vaccine (manufactured by FluGen)
      followed by licensed inactivated Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine (QIV) boost administered
      intramuscularly Subjects will be enrolled in one of two groups in a 1:1 ratio. Arm 1 will
      receive one dose of M2SR intranasally on Day 1 and one dose of QIV on Day 92. Arm 2 will
      receive one dose of placebo (saline) intranasally on Day 1, and one dose of QIV on Day 92.
      Study duration will be approximately 28 months with patient participation duration
      approximately 13 months. The primary study objective is to assess the safety and
      reactogenicity of a monovalent live attenuated influenza H3N2 M2SR vaccine.

      reactogenicity of a monovalent live attenuated influenza H3N2 M2SR vaccine. The secondary
      study objectives are to identify circulating and mucosal antibody responses induced by H3N2
      M2SR vaccination and to identify cellular immune responses induced by H3N2 M2SR vaccination.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Parent(s)/legal guardian(s) must provide written informed consent prior to initiation
             of any study procedures, and subject must provide assent.

          2. Are able to understand and comply with planned study procedures and be available for
             all study visits.

          3. Are males or non-pregnant females, 9-17 years old, inclusive at the time of
             enrollment.

          4. Are in good health*.

             *As determined by medical history and physical examination to evaluate acute or
             currently ongoing chronic medical diagnoses or conditions, defined as those that have
             been present for at least 90 days, which would affect the assessment of the safety of
             subjects or the immunogenicity of study vaccinations. Chronic medical diagnoses or
             conditions should be stable for the last 60 days (no hospitalizations, ER, or urgent
             care for condition and no adverse symptoms that need medical intervention). This
             includes no change in chronic prescription medication, dose, or frequency as a result
             of deterioration of the chronic medical diagnosis or condition in the 60 days prior to
             enrollment. Any prescription change that is due to change of health care provider,
             insurance company, etc., or that is done for financial reasons, as long as in the same
             class of medication, will not be considered a deviation of this inclusion criterion.
             Any change in prescription medication due to improvement of a disease outcome, as
             determined by the site principal investigator or appropriate sub-investigator, will
             not be considered a deviation of this inclusion criterion. Subjects may be on chronic
             or as needed (prn) medications if, in the opinion of the site principal investigator
             or appropriate sub-investigator, they pose no additional risk to subject safety or
             assessment of reactogenicity and immunogenicity and do not indicate a worsening of
             medical diagnosis or condition. Similarly, medication changes subsequent to enrollment
             and study vaccination are acceptable provided there was no deterioration in the
             subject's chronic medical condition that necessitated a medication change, and there
             is no additional risk to the subject or interference with the evaluation of responses
             to study vaccination. Note: Low dose topical steroids, herbals, vitamins, and
             supplements are permitted.

          5. Oral temperature is less than 100.0 degrees Fahrenheit.

          6. For female adolescent of child-bearing potential* must agree to correctly use an
             acceptable method of contraception** from 30 days prior to vaccination until 30 days
             after the last study vaccination.

             *Defined by the onset of menses, and not sterilized via tubal ligation, bilateral
             oophorectomy, hysterectomy, or successful Essure(R) placement (permanent,
             non-surgical, non-hormonal sterilization) with documented radiological confirmation
             test at least 90 days after the procedure, and still menstruating.

             **Includes non-male sexual relationships, abstinence from sexual intercourse with a
             male partner, monogamous relationship with a vasectomized partner, and correct use of
             male condoms with the use of applied spermicide, intrauterine devices, NuvaRing(R),
             and licensed hormonal methods such as implants, injectables, contraceptive patches or
             oral contraceptives (&quot;the pill&quot;). Method of contraception will be captured on the
             appropriate data collection form.
