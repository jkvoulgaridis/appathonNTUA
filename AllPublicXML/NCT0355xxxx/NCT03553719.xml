  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, multicenter study aims to evaluate the effect of routine training of
      intensive care unit (ICU) staff on the implementation rate of screening tools for pain,
      agitation and delirium (PAD) ) in three one day point-prevalence analyses.

      The evaluations will take the form of one day point-prevalence analyses, administered both
      pre- and post-training phase.

      The 6-week training block consists of e-learning material in the form of text content, slides
      and brief training videos.

      At each point-prevalence analysis, data of approximately 300 patients in 14 participating
      centers will be collected.

      Data collection focuses primarily on parameters of routine patient management (e.g.
      medications, screening scores) and basic patient characteristics (e.g. illness severity, age,
      major comorbidities).

      Additionally, one member of each major profession in the ICU care team (attending physician,
      resident physician, nurse) will be given a brief online questionnaire to gauge their estimate
      of routine practice with regards to delirium screening and delirium prevalence in their ICU.

      Each participating patient will also receive one &quot;gold standard&quot; delirium screening with the
      Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU score) performed by a
      trained expert.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ICU-staff that is adequately trained in PAD-screening and -management is part of guideline
      recommendations internationally, and staff training should take place accordingly. Prior
      studies have hinted at low implementation rates of delirium screening intensive care units
      and an overall low reliability of the documented scores.

      The study's rationale is to evaluate staff perceptions regarding delirium screening practice
      in their ICU, and evaluate the validity of routine delirium screening scoring (compared to an
      expert-screen). Subsequently, the effect of a training block for ICU staff on routine
      delirium screening frequency and validity will be assessed.

      The implemented training package contains online lectures, instructional videos, educational
      handouts, and a bedside teaching component over the course of 6 weeks.

      On each point-prevalence day three members of the ICU staff (attending/consultant, trainee
      physician, nurse) will fill out their respective questionnaire (attending CRF, physician CRF,
      nurse CRF). These questionnaires ask for estimates of delirium prevalence in their respective
      ICU, as well as estimates on the frequency of delirium screening implementation.

      Subsequently, the local study coordinator will evaluate all patients that have received
      treatment in the ICU during the past 24 hours according to the inclusion and exclusion
      criteria. Each included patient will receive a pseudonym and the study coordinator will fill
      out one electronic case report file (eCRF, see list of items) per included patient.

      A member of staff who is trained in administering the CAM-ICU screening tool will then
      evaluate all included patients, and enter the respective score result in each patient's
      &quot;expert CRF&quot;.

The test assesses a patient's state of confusion and serves as a screening test for ICU-related delirium.
