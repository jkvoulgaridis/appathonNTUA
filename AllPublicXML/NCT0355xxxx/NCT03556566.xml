      This Phase II will evaluate a new type of ovarian cancer immunotherapy based on a
      fundamentally new approach that has been successfully tested in a published clinical study of
      liver cancer. We will test new tableted preparation, V3-OVA, obtained from hydrolyzed,
      inactivated blood and tumors of patients with cancer of ovaries. Study will last 3 months, 20
      patients will be recruited, given one pill per day for three months. The primary clinical
      endpoint is effect on tumor size and burden after 3 months. Secondary endpoint will be effect
      on levels of tumor markers on monthly basis compared to baseline.

    <textblock>
      Ovarian cancer (OC) - a malignant disease affecting the ovarian tissue - is the sixth most
      diagnosed cancer among women and causes more deaths than any other cancer of the female
      reproductive system. For treatment of OC, surgical intervention, chemotherapy, as well as
      radiation methods are used. Despite treatment, about 70% of patients have a relapse. Many
      different types of immunotherapy (especially checkpoint inhibitors) of OC being tested, but
      so far the successes have been insignificant, and serious side effects are frequent and
      unpredictable. This Phase II will evaluate a new type of ovarian cancer immunotherapy based
      on a fundamentally new approach that has been successfully tested in a published clinical
      study of liver cancer. We will test new tableted preparation, V3-OVA, obtained from
      hydrolyzed, inactivated blood and tumor tissues of patients with cancer of ovaries. Study
      will last 3 months, 20 patients will be recruited, given one pill per day for three months.
      The primary clinical endpoint is effect on tumor size and burden after 3 months. Secondary
      endpoint will be effect on levels of tumor markers on monthly basis compared to baseline.
