    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot clinical trial is to study how well drug therapies given prior to
      and after surgery work in treating participants with high-risk stage III melanoma. Patients
      will receive either the combination of cobimetinib and atezolizumab or the combination of
      vemurafenib, cobimetinib, and atezolizumab; followed by surgery; followed by atezolizumab
      treatment.

      Vemurafenib may stop the growth of melanoma cells by blocking an enzyme needed for cell
      growth called BRAF. However, this drug only has potential benefit for patients with a
      mutation in BRAF, and it will only be given to this subset of patients. Cobimetinib blocks
      another enzyme important for melanoma cell growth, and it also may provide benefit by making
      the immune response to melanoma more effective. Atezolizumab may provide benefit by making
      the immune response to melanoma more effective.

      Giving combined therapy before surgery and atezolizumab after surgery may work better than
      other approaches in treating patients with high-risk stage III melanoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the percentage of patients with stage III BRAFV600 mutated (BRAFm) melanoma
      that achieves a pathologic complete response after 12 weeks of neoadjuvant
      vemurafenib/cobimetinib/atezolizumab (neoadjuvant phase).

      II. To estimate the percentage of patients with stage III BRAF-wild-type (BRAFwt) melanoma
      that achieves a pathologic complete response after 12 weeks of neoadjuvant
      cobimetinib/atezolizumab (neoadjuvant phase).

      III. To assess recurrence-free survival (RFS) in patients with stage III BRAFm melanoma after
      neoadjuvant vemurafenib/cobimetinib/ atezolizumab, surgery, and adjuvant atezolizumab
      (adjuvant phase).

      IV. To assess RFS in patients with stage III BRAFwt melanoma after neoadjuvant
      cobimetinib/atezolizumab, surgery, and adjuvant atezolizumab (adjuvant phase).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the frequency of adverse events among patients with stage III BRAFm melanoma
      receiving neoadjuvant vemurafenib / cobimetinib / atezolizumab followed by surgery followed
      by adjuvant atezolizumab.

      II. To determine the frequency of adverse events among patients with stage III BRAFwt
      melanoma receiving neoadjuvant cobimetinib/atezolizumab followed by surgery followed by
      adjuvant atezolizumab.

      TRANSLATIONAL OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the association between pretreatment, on treatment, post-neoadjuvant and
      post-adjuvant treatment soluble PD-L1 (sPD-L1) and RFS in patients with stage III melanoma
      receiving neoadjuvant vemurafenib / cobimetinib / atezolizumab or cobimetinib/atezolizumab,
      followed by surgery and adjuvant atezolizumab.

      II. To determine the association between pretreatment, on treatment, post-neoadjuvant and
      post-adjuvant treatment intracellular bim in tumor-related T cells and RFS in patients with
      stage III melanoma after neoadjuvant vemurafenib/cobimetinib/atezolizumab or
      cobimetinib/atezolizumab, followed by surgery and adjuvant atezolizumab.

      III. Evaluate associations between pre and post-neoadjuvant treatment molecular features of
      melanomas and the tumor immune microenvironment in responders versus non-responders with
      multiplexed immunohistochemistry (mIHC) and ribonucleic acid-sequencing (RNA-Seq) in patients
      with stage III melanoma after neoadjuvant vemurafenib/cobimetinib/atezolizumab or
      cobimetinib/atezolizumab, followed by surgery and adjuvant atezolizumab.

      IV. To determine the association between pretreatment tumor PD-L1 and RFS in patients with
      stage III melanoma receiving neoadjuvant vemurafenib/ cobimetinib/ atezolizumab or
      cobimetinib/atezolizumab, followed by surgery and adjuvant atezolizumab.

      OUTLINE: Participants are assigned to 1 of 2 groups.

      ARM A (BRAF mutant): Participants receive vemurafenib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days
      1-28, cobimetinib PO once daily (QD) on days 1-21, and atezolizumab intravenously (IV) over
      30-60 minutes on days 1 and 15 of courses 2 and 3. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to
      3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B (BRAF wild-type): Participants receive cobimetinib as in Arm A, and atezolizumab IV
      over 30-60 minutes on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 3 courses in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Within 2-4 weeks after treatment, participants undergo surgery then receive atezolizumab IV
      over 30-60 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeat every 21 days for up to 8 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed every 3 months for up to 3
      years.
