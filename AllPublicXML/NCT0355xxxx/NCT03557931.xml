  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of ASP4345 on cognitive impairment
      compared to placebo using change from baseline in MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB)
      neurocognitive composite score (excluding social cognition domain). The primary estimand will
      use a Hypothetical Strategy and compare participants as though the participant had continued
      on the assigned treatment and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ASP4345 compared to
      placebo. This study will also evaluate the effects of ASP4345 compared to placebo on
      functional capacity using the University of California San Diego Performance-based Skills
      Assessment-2 Extended Range (UPSA-2-ER) total score and evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile
      of ASP4345 and its metabolites, if necessary.

      Participants will receive oral doses of ASP4345 or matching placebo QD (once daily) for 12
      weeks. All participants will be administered the first dose of blinded study drug at the site
      following randomization and provided with web-based applications that provide supplemental
      cognitive training and record treatment compliance. Participants will return to the clinic
      weekly for safety, efficacy, and/or pharmacokinetic procedures. Participants will continue
      the participant's antipsychotic treatment for the entire study and will be followed for 14
      days after the participant's last dose of study drug.

    <time_frame>baseline to week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) is a cognitive battery to assess 7 domains recommended by the MATRICS initiative (ie, working memory, verbal learning, speed of processing, attention/vigilance, visual learning, social cognition, reasoning and problem solving). The MCCB neurocognitive composite score is a standardized mean of the six domain scores (excluding social cognition). Raw scores are converted to age and sex adjusted t-scores which are standardized to normative data, and have a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10 in the general healthy population. A higher score indicates less impairment.</description>

The AIMS is a checklist and uses a 5 point rating scale for recording scores for 7 body areas: face, lips, jaw, tongue, upper extremities, lower extremities and trunk.
Scores of 2 or higher indicate a diagnosis of tardive dyskinesia. Shifts from baseline at each treatment visit will be shown as follows: [&lt;2 to &lt;2 (no change, not present); &lt;2 to ≥2 (worsening); ≥2 to &lt; 2 (improvement); ≥2 to ≥2 (no change, present).</description>

Rating requires the investigator to observe the participant's gait and check for tremor, excessive salivation and rigidity in the arms, shoulder and neck. Each item is rated from 0 to 4 and a total score can be obtained.
Scores will be categorized as [&lt;3 (normal); 3-5 (minimal); 6-11 (clinically significant); 12-17 (severe); ≥18 (extreme)</description>
