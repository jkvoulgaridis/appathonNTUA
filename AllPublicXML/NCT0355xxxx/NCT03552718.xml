    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1 study to evaluate the safety, the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D), and
      preliminary efficacy of a personalized neoepitope yeast-based vaccine, YE-NEO-001, in
      subjects who have completed potentially curative therapy for their solid cancer and who would
      otherwise be entering a period of surveillance for recurrent disease.

    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1 trial to evaluate the safety, the RP2D, and preliminary efficacy of a
      personalized neoepitope yeast-based vaccine, YE-NEO-001, in subjects who have completed
      potentially curative therapy for their type of solid cancer (eg, colorectal cancer, breast
      cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma) and would otherwise be entering a
      period of surveillance for recurrent disease.

      The study will be conducted in two parts: part 1 will involve dose escalation, and part 2
      will involve the expansion of the RP2D to further evaluate the safety of YE-NEO-001. In part
      2 of the study, dose expansion will occur when the RP2D has been determined. An additional 4
      subjects may be enrolled in part 2, for a total of up to 10 subjects at the RP2D.

             IRB or IEC guidelines.

          3. Histologically-confirmed cancer amenable to treatment with curative intent as part of
             SoC. Must be willing to provide a tumor tissue sample (either a tumor biopsy specimen

             tumor molecular profiling.

               -  Solid cancers include any of the following surgically resectable cancers:
                  colorectal cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, non-small cell lung
                  cancer, breast cancer (either hormone receptor positive, HER2-positive or
                  negative, or triple-negative breast cancer), pancreatic cancer, liver cancer, and
                  melanoma. Curative therapy, whether surgery, radiation therapy, or adjuvant
                  chemotherapy, must be completed per National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)
                  guidelines.

             definitive radiation therapy are considered NED if they have no evidence of cancer
             growth on the first and second surveillance CT scans. Subjects who have disease
             recurrence prior to the start of the vaccination process are also eligible if no
             satisfactory alternative treatment options are available or if subject has refused all
             other available therapies.

          2. Must have received &lt; 6 months of SoC therapy.

          3. Able to understand and provide a signed informed consent that fulfills the relevant
             IRB or IEC guidelines.

             for exploratory analyses.

          6. If cancer recurs while on treatment on this study, must be willing to provide a tumor
             biopsy specimen for exploratory analyses, if considered safe by the Investigator.

          7. Ability to attend required study visits and return for adequate follow-up, as required

             non-sterile male subjects must agree to use a condom for up to 4 months after
             treatment. Effective contraception includes surgical sterilization (eg, vasectomy,
             tubal ligation), two forms of barrier methods (eg, condom, diaphragm) used with
             spermicide, IUDs, and abstinence.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Pre-treatment Phase: Tissue Procurement and Development of Vaccine

        1. Unable or unwilling to attend required study visits and return for adequate follow-up,
        as required by this protocol.

        Treatment Phase:

          1. Serious uncontrolled concomitant disease that would contraindicate the use of the
             investigational drug used in this study or that would put the subject at high risk for
             treatment-related complications.

          2. Active autoimmune disease requiring systemic immunosuppressive treatment within 4
             weeks prior to enrollment on this study (eg, lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid
             arthritis, Addison's disease, autoimmune disease associated with lymphoma, ankylosing
             spondylitis, scleroderma, multiple sclerosis). A history of inactive autoimmune
             disease or autoimmune disease not requiring systemic immunosuppressive therapy within
             4 weeks prior to study enrollment is allowed.

          3. History of organ transplant requiring immunosuppression.

          4. History of or active inflammatory bowel disease (eg, Crohn's disease, ulcerative

             reaction or anaphylaxis in subjects who have known contrast allergies is allowed.
