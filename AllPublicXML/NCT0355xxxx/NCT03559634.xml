  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many female adolescents using the pediatric emergency department (ED) are at higher risk for
      unintended pregnancy. This is a significant public health issue and hormonal contraception is
      the mainstay of prevention. Many barriers to hormonal contraception exist and other studies
      have demonstrated that referral from the ED for hormonal contraception leads to poor follow
      up.

      This study will be a pilot study to assess the feasibility of initiating hormonal
      contraception in the pediatric ED.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the feasibility of initiating hormonal contraception in the pediatric
      ED. Currently, all 15-21-year-old patients receiving care in our ED are asked to complete an
      adolescent heath questionnaire to identify risk-factors for sexually transmitted infections
      (STIs). Sexually active female patients who indicate on this questionnaire they are not
      currently using hormonal contraception will be eligible for participation in this study.

      Potential participants will be screened using the EMR and eligible patients will be
      approached. Consent will be obtained from adults directly and from a parent or guardian for
      minors that have one present. For minors that present without a parent or guardian, assent
      only with be obtained from the minor. Participants will be randomized into two groups, an
      intervention group and a control group. Participants in both groups will be given tablet
      computer and, through a software application on the tablet, answer questions electronically
      about their background, medical history, and contraceptive preferences. They will then be
      shown a video that provides an overview of hormonal contraceptive options. Depending on the
      participants medical history and contraceptive preferences, they may be offered more in-depth
      educational videos about specific types of hormonal contraception for which they are eligible
      (e.g. pill, transdermal patch, intravaginal ring, injection, and implant).

      Once they have completed watching the videos, participants in the intervention group will
      have the option of initiating one of the offered forms of birth control during the ED visit.
      They will only be offered medications considered low risk and for which they do not have any
      medical contraindications. Urine pregnancy testing will be done before any method is given.
      They will be able to start any contraceptive method from among those offered after their
      screening. Participants in the control group will be offered outpatient referral to initiate
      contraception, the current standard of care in our ED. All patients in both arms of the study
      will be given referral/follow up options for further contraceptive care.

      All participants in this study will then be followed up at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months to
      determine continuation of contraception practices, follow up practices, satisfaction, and
      pregnancy rates.

    <description>Using an electronic application, participants answer survey questions about their sexual history, medical history, and contraceptive preferences. They will watch a video that overviews the types of hormonal contraception. Then, based on survey answers, they will be able to watch more in-depth educational videos on methods that they qualify for. Participants will only be offered methods that are considered low risk and without any contraindication based upon responses to survey screening. This may include, contraceptive implant, medroxyprogesterone acetate injection, microgestin pills, xulane patch, or intravaginal ring. Participants will then be given the opportunity to initiate contraception in the ED. All participants will be referred for follow up outpatient health services. Subjects who have medical contraindications to certain contraceptive medications will be given a standardized handout that explains why they were not eligible for the medication(s) while in the ED.</description>

    <description>The electronic application will collect screening health information and contraceptive preferences about the participant. Then, using branch logic, decide which contraceptive options the participant would qualify for based on health history answers.
