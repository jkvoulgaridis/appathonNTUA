  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if Niraparib can help to control
      metastatic pancreatic cancer. The safety of this drug will also be studied. Niraparib is FDA
      approved and commercially available for the treatment of ovarian cancer. Its use in this
      study is investigational.

             not in the best interest of the patient to participate

          -  Patients must not have known, symptomatic brain or leptomeningeal metastases

          -  Patient must not have any known history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute
