  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aphasia is a loss of language due to stroke or other brain injury. Word-finding in
      conversation is a universal and persistent difficulty in aphasia. While several techniques
      exist to improve word-finding in aphasia, it is unclear how the brain changes in response to
      behavioral therapy. In this study, persons with aphasia will receive behavioral therapy aimed
      at helping them to be more successful at finding words. Twenty therapy sessions will be
      provided in a 10-week period. Each therapy session will last about 2 hours and will include a
      variety of language tasks. Prior to beginning word-finding therapy, each participant will
      receive two fMRI scans, spaced 10 weeks apart. After finishing therapy, each participant will
      receive two additional fMRI scans, spaced 10 weeks apart. For a portion of the MRI scan,
      participants will complete language tasks. The purpose of these fMRI scans is to measure
      brain changes that may occur due to successful behavioral therapy. The hypotheses are as
      follows: First, that the behavioral therapy will improve word-finding as it has been shown to
      do in the past. Second, that the brain will change in a couple of different ways. It is
      expected that the network of regions that support word-finding will be more connected and
      work together more efficiently after therapy. It is also expected that the networks of
      regions that support other aspects of cognitive function, such as attention and executive
      function, will also be more connected and work together more efficiently.
