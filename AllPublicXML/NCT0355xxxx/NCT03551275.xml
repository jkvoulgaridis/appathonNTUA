    <description>EDSS is a scale for assessing neurologic impairment in MS. It consists of eight functional systems (FS) which are used to derive the EDSS steps (score) ranging from 0 (normal) to 10 (death due to MS). The functional systems are Visual, Brain Stem, Pyramidal, Cerebellar, Sensory, Bowel and Bladder, Cerebral and Other functions. Based on the assessment of each FS, the participant's score is determined between 0 to 10. A positive change from baseline indicates improvement</description>
