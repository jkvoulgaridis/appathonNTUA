  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The dengue, Zika and chikungunya arboviruses represent potentially severe infections to which
      the New Caledonian population is exposed. In the absence of specific treatment or vaccine,
      vector control remains the method of choice to limit their spread. However, the traditional
      methods of prevention and vector control measure today face their limits: mosquito resistance
      to insecticides, difficulty of access and destruction of breeding areas... The World Mosquito
      Program Noumea project is based on the artificial colonization of the mosquito vector Aedes
      aegypti by the endosymbiotic bacteria Wolbachia, which reduces its ability to transmit
      arboviruses. The breeding of mosquitoes carrying the bacterium Wolbachia in the laboratories
      of the Institut Pasteur of New Caledonia requires the use of human blood samples for mosquito
      gorging.

      The objective of the research is to generate, maintain and amplify Aedes aegypti Caledonian
      lineages carrying the Wolbachia bacteria for the planned insect release program in Noumea.

      The dengue, Zika and chikungunya arboviruses represent potentially severe infections to which
      the New Caledonian population is exposed. In the absence of specific treatment or vaccine,
      disease vector control remains the method of choice to limit their spread. However, the
      traditional methods of prevention and disease vector control must today face their limits:
      mosquito resistance to insecticides, difficulty of access and destruction of breeding
      areas... The World Mosquito Program Noumea project is based on the artificial colonization of
      the mosquito vector Aedes aegypti by the endosymbiotic bacterium Wolbachia, which reduces its

      lineages carrying the bacterium Wolbachia for the planned insect release program in Noumea.

      The establishment of Wolbachia in Aedes aegypti populations in Noumea should lead to the
      reduction of active transmission of dengue, Zika and chikungunya in the municipality.
