      -  60 participants will consume experimental product every day 3 sticks of the dietary
           supplement (1.4 grams/stick) during 12 months: 2 sticks should be consumed before lunch
           and 1 stick before dinner. During the 12 first weeks, each volunteer will be included on
           a low weight program (PPP) with an individual hypocaloric diet planning and regular
           physical adapted activity (PPP period). When PPP period is over, volunteers will
           continue consuming the product for 9 months more (Post-PPP period).
