  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Critically ill patients in the intensive care unit are known to lose muscle mass and function
      at a rapid rate. Currently, there is a global recognition and shift in the ICU culture to
      reduce sedation and encourage exercise and mobilization early during the ICU stay. Functional
      stimulation assisted supine cycling can be applied to patients in the bed and does not
      require patient participation. This study seeks to evaluate the effect of conventional
      exercise and early mobilization in combination with functional stimulation assisted supine
      cycling applied early during the ICU on muscle mass, strength, and physical function, as well
      as patient-reported disability as compared to conventional exercise and early mobilization
      alone.

    <description>Physical function will be assessed using the functional status score in the ICU (FSS-ICU). This score consists of 3 pre-ambulation categories (rolling; supine to sit transfer; and unsupported sitting) and 2 ambulation categories (sit to stand transfers; ambulation). Each category is scored from 1 (total dependent assistance) to 7 (complete independence) with a total score range of 0-35 (0: unable to perform a task due to physical limitations or medical status).</description>

Each item is scored on a 0-100 scale and items in the same category are averaged together to create the 8 scale scores, with 0 being the lowest score and 100 being the highest for each category.</description>

    <intervention_name>Functional electrical stimulation assisted supine cycling (FESC)</intervention_name>
    <description>A supine cycle ergometer attached to a six-channel stimulator will be used for FESC. Surface electrodes will be applied to the hamstrings, quadriceps, and calf muscles on both legs. Muscles will be stimulated at specific stages throughout the cycling phase. Each session will start with a 1 minute motor-driven passive cycling warm-up at a rate of 20 revolutions per minute. Patients will continue with passive, active-assisted, or active cycling, according to their level of participation. If the patients stop cycling actively, the ergometer will revert to passive cycling.</description>
