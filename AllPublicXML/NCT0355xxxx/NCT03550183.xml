    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative movement disorder，which mainly shows up in
      the elderly. And there is as yet no effective drug treatment. Umbilical cord derived
      mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) derived from mesoderm owns strong proliferation ability and
      multiple differentiation potential. The investigators used UC-MSCs via intravenous infusion
      to treat PD. With different durations of follow-up, the investigators cleared therapeutic
      effect, the quality of life and prognostic implications of UC-MSCs on PD through the Unified
      Parkinson`s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), revised Hoehn-Yahr（H-Y） staging, Mini-Mental State
      Examination (MMSE), Hamilton depression scales 24 (HAMD 24), Hamilton Anxiety Scale 14 (HAMA
      14) and Clinical Global Impression (CGI). In this research, the investigators seek new
      therapeutic approaches for PD, and provide clinical evidences for the clinical application of
      UC-MSCs in the future.

    <measure>Changes of the Unified Parkinson`s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Post cell transplantation: 1, 3, 6, 12months</time_frame>
    <description>The UPDRS was assessed to identify the severity of PD. It includes the four-scale structure with a reorganization of the various subscales. This four-scale structure are (Part I) nonmotor experiences of daily living (13 items), (Part II) motor experiences of daily living (13 items), (Part III) motor examination (18 items), and (Part IV) motor complications (six items). Each subscale now has 0-4 ratings, where 0 = normal, 1 = slight, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, and 4 = severe.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes of in the Hoehn and Yahr staging</measure>
    <time_frame>Post cell transplantation: 1, 3, 6, 12months</time_frame>
    <description>Hoehn and Yahr (H-Y) staging was used to determine the stage of PD based on clinical findings and functional disability. In H-Y staging is a rating scale measured in an ordinal level.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Post cell transplantation: 1, 3, 6, 12months</time_frame>
    <description>The MMSE was used to measure cognition. This test consists of 2 parts: language and performance. Its total score can range from 0 to 30, with a higher score indicating better function.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes of the Hamilton depression scales 24 (HAMD 24)</measure>
    <time_frame>Post cell transplantation: 1, 3, 6, 12months</time_frame>
    <description>The HAMD 24 is used to assessed the severity of depression symptoms. The scores for each item range from 0 to 4 or 0 to 2, where 0 represents no symptoms. There are 24 items in the HAMD 24.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes of the Hamilton Anxiety Scale 14 (HAMA-14)</measure>
    <time_frame>Post cell transplantation: 1, 3, 6, 12months</time_frame>
    <description>The HAMA-14 is used to assessed the anxiety symptoms. Its total score can range from 0 to 56. Lower score represents a better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Adverse reaction</measure>
    <time_frame>Post cell transplantation: 1, 3, 6, 12months</time_frame>

    <description>Selected patients with Parkinson's disease were randomly divided into a therapy group and a control group. Umbilical Cord Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells(UC-MSCs) at a dose of 10-20 million by intravenous infusion.Patients in the therapy group treated once a week with UC-MSCs. Each course of treatment Lasted 3 weeks.</description>

    <description>Patients with PD in the therapy group were given UC-MSCs by intravenous infusion and conventional therapy. There was only conventional treatment in the control group. All patients after treatment for 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months were evaluated respectively the curative effect.</description>
