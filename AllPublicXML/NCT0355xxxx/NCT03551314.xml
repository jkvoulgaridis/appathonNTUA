    <textblock>

      and nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation on breathing pattern variables of very
      low birth weight neonates immediately after extubation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The effects of non-invasive ventilation on the respiratory function of neonates have not been
      fully elucidated. Currently, two modalities of non invasive ventilation are commonly used in
      Brazilian neonatal intensive care units: continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and nasal
      intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). In this study, it was hypothesized that
      NIPPV will improve tidal volume when compared to CPAP. The objective of this study is to
      evaluate the effects of continuous positive airway pressure and nasal intermittent positive
      pressure ventilation on breathing pattern variables of very low birth weight neonates
      immediately after extubation. Soon after extubation, the neonates will be randomized into the
      CPAP-NIPPV (sequence 1) or the NIPPV-CPAP (sequence 2). The sequence will be assigned at
      random using sealed envelopes. Respiratory inductive plethysmography will be used to evaluate
      the breathing pattern (tidal volume, respiratory rate, minute ventilation, mean inspiratory
      flow) and chest wall motion (labor breathing index, inspiratory phase relation, expiratory
      phase relation, total phase relation and phase angle). Student t tests for paired samples
      will be used and the Wilcoxon test according to the data distribution. A significance level
      of 5% will be adopted. The analyzes will be performed by StatisticalPackage software for the
      Social Sciences® (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA), version 17.0 for Windows.

    <measure>Labored Breathing Index (LBI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measure during the two non-invasive ventilation strategies. Labor breathing index (LBI) will be measured for 2 hours, one hour in continuous positive airway pressure and one hour in nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation.</time_frame>
    <description>This is a measure of chest wall coordination. This is the Labored Breathing Index (LBI) of a breath that takes into account phase and amplitude of the ribcage and abdomen traces. It is computed as the ratio of the sum of the integrals of the absolut values of the derivatives of the inspiratory limbs of ribcage and abdomen excursions divided by the corresponding integral of the derivative of the inspiratory limb of the tidal volume deflection. This measure of thoracoabdominal coordination is computed on a breath by breath basis. Perfect thoracoabdominal coordination produces an LBI of 1.0. In babies or adults who are relaxed and awake or in Quiet State, LBI lies between 1.0 and 1.2 but no systematic study of the normal values of LBI as a function of sleep stage and body posture has yet been undertaken. In Active State, thoracoabdominal discoordination generally is associated with elevated LBI values.</description>
