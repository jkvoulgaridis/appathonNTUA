  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The mortality effect of kangaroo mother care in stable newborns &lt;2000g is well established
      but mortality effect in unstable newborns is not conclusively known. This pragmatic clinical
      trial aims to investigate the mortality and clinical effects of early continuous Kangaroo
      Mother Care (KMC) compared to standard care in mild-moderately unstable neonates &lt;2000g in a
      resource limited hospital setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This individually randomised controlled trial will compare 2 parallel groups of hospitalised
      mild-moderately unstable neonates &lt;2000g and aged &lt;24h at time of screening who receive
      either early continuous kangaroo mother care (KMC) (started at &lt;24h of admission) or standard
      care with continuous KMC at &gt;24h of admission and when stable. The intervention will be
      un-blinded to participants and researchers with blinding of outcomes where possible. If
      participants clinically deteriorate and meet &quot;stopping criteria&quot; they will be temporarily
      withdrawn from the intervention arm and re-start KMC when clinically stable, as per the
      control arm. Intention to treat analysis will be used. Duration of time spent in KMC will be
      documented and compared between arms. All other hospital management will be provided as per a
      Standardised Preterm Management Protocol, based on current standard care at the study site
      and compliance to this protocol will be monitored in both arms.

      Underlying protective mechanisms for early KMC will also be explored, focusing on causal
      pathways such as thermal control, cardio-respiratory stability, infection prevention control
      and gastro-intestinal stability pathways.
