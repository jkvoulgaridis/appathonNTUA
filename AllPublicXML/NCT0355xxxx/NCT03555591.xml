    <textblock>
      The purpose of this survey is to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of trelagliptin
      tablets in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in the routine clinical setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this survey is called trelagliptin tablet. This tablet is being
      tested to treat people who have type 2 diabetes mellitus.

      This survey is an observational (non-interventional) study and will look at the long-term
      safety and efficacy of the trelagliptin tablet in the routine clinical setting. The planned
      number of observed patients will be approximately 3000.

      This multi-center observational trial will be conducted in Japan.
