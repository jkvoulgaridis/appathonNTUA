  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of exercise in form of whole-body
      electromyostimulation (WB-EMS) on early tumor-induced muscular dysfunction. It is anticipated
      to gain detailed knowledge about composition and metabolism of skeletal muscle cells, and
      single muscle fiber functionality. To determine key factors leading to impaired force
      generation and thus decreased muscle strength in cancer patients who are suspected to develop
      or already show early signs of tumor cachexia is crucial for the establishment of effective
      cancer treatment. Comparative analysis of skeletal muscle biopsies taken from the abdomen of
      patients during indicated surgeries will be conducted. The patients will be allocated to the
      following study groups: a) Study group 1: Patients without cancer, b) Study group 2: Patients
      with solid tumors who did not perform physical training and c) Study group 3: Patients with
      solid tumors who executed physical training in form of WB-EMS. The investigation can help to
      understand skeletal muscle physiology under exercise and to get a better insight into the
      effects of physical training on early-stage muscle atrophy, both on cellular and molecular
      level. Initially, it is planned to identify the inflammation and nutrition status of the
      patients, and to determine skeletal muscle strength. It is anticipated to explore muscle
      protein composition, particularly myosin to actin ratio and their interaction. Biochemical
      analysis and the examination of the cellular ultra-structure should enhance the knowledge
      about the key mechanisms controlling the contractile apparatus of single muscle fibers in
      order to determine the quality of muscle force. Taken together, these investigations will
      help to better understand muscle atrophy in advanced cancer patients, and might support the
      development of targeted anti-cachectic therapies, that can be applied already in early phases
      of the tumor disease to significantly improve the patients' prognosis and their quality of
      life.

    <description>Patients of the WB-EMS group will perform whole-body electromyostimulation (WB-EMS) training sessions twice a week over a period of 8 weeks. To allow muscle recovery a break of at least 2 days between the sessions will be scheduled. To adapt the patients to the WB-EMS intervention, the training duration will be gradually increased (week 1, 12 min; increase of 2 min/week; week 5-8, 20 min). WB-EMS training sessions will include light physical exercises according to a video tutorial and individually supervised by certified physio therapists.</description>
