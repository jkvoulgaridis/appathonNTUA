  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to enhance the scalability of an office-based smoking cessation treatment
      protocol for veterans with PTSD, integrated care (IC), by adapting it to be delivered over
      the telephone and to incorporate mobile technology components. Mobile technology components
      include: (1) the Stay Quit Coach (SQC) mobile application (app), and (2) the iCO mobile
      Smokerlyzer, a smartphone-compatible carbon monoxide monitor. Eighty U.S. military veteran
      smokers with PTSD, ages 18-39, will be randomized to receive either: (1) the telephone-and
      technology-facilitated intervention (n=40), or (2) the current standard of care (referral to
      the VA telephone Quitline) (n=40) as a control. All participants will receive a baseline
      (Week 0) office visit and will optionally be prescribed nicotine replacement therapy (NRT).
      Participants in the intervention condition will receive eight 20- to 30-minute video or
      telephone counseling sessions and be asked to use the SQC app and iCO Mobile Smokerlyzer.
      Control participants will receive up to eight weekly proactive telephone sessions through the
      VA telephone Quitline. Assessments will occur at baseline (Week 0), treatment end (Week 8),
      and at three months (Week 12) and six months (Week 24) post-randomization. The primary aims
      of this pilot randomized controlled trial are: (1) to assess the feasibility and
      acceptability of the intervention; and (2) to assess the impact of the adapted IC
      intervention on treatment retention compared to treatment as usual (i.e., VA Quitline).

    <time_frame>over 8-week intervention period; calculated at Week 8 (post-treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The difference in recruitment rates among residents of rural versus urban areas. Higher recruitment rates suggest greater study and intervention feasibility, and a large difference score would indicate greater feasibility based on type of residential area.</description>

    <measure>Feasibility: Intervention Adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>over 8-week intervention period; calculated at Week 8 (post-treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The difference in total number of treatment sessions attended between the experimental treatment condition and the control condition. Higher adherence rates suggest greater study/intervention feasibility and acceptability, and a large difference score would indicate greater feasibility/acceptability of one study condition over the other.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Feasibility: Retention/Attrition</measure>
    <time_frame>over 8-week intervention period; calculated at Week 8 (post-treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The difference in study drop-out rates between the experimental treatment condition and the control condition. Higher drop-out rates suggest poorer study/intervention feasibility and acceptability, and a large difference score would indicate greater feasibility/acceptability of one study condition over the other.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Acceptability Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Participants (in the intervention condition only) will complete a questionnaire developed by the investigators to rate the intervention protocol from 1-10 in terms of perceived helpfulness, understandability, and likelihood of use. The mean score (i.e., average of item ratings) will be reported for the participants in the intervention condition. Higher scores represent greater acceptability.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>System Usability Scale (SUS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The SUS is a brief, reliable and valid instrument to measure perceptions of usability of technology devices. Items are rated on a scale from 0-5. An SUS total score is calculated by summing item ratings, and then multiplied the sum by 2.5. The maximum score on the SUS is 100, with higher scores reflecting greater usability. The SUS will be administered to the intervention condition only. Mean usability score will be reported.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Client Satisfaction Questionnaire-8 (CSQ-8)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8 (post-treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The CSQ-8 is an eight-item instrument designed to measure satisfaction with an clinical intervention. Items are rated on a scale from 1-4 and summed to for an CSQ-8 total score. Scores range from 8-32, with higher scores indicating greater satisfaction. The CSQ-8 will be administered to the intervention condition only. Mean satisfaction score will be reported.</description>

    <measure>Fagerstr√∂m Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND)</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 0, 8, 12, and 24</time_frame>
    <description>The FTND is a validated, 6-item self-report instrument that evaluates the intensity of physical addiction to nicotine. Three items are rated yes/no (0/1), and the other three items are rated on a scale from 0-3. Items are summed to yield a total score of 0-10, with higher scores reflecting greater nicotine dependence.

    <description>The Integrated Care (IC) treatment protocol for smoking cessation is a PTSD-informed intervention that has been adapted to be delivered over video or telephone and to incorporate technological components, including the Stay Quit Coach (SQC) smartphone application (app) and the iCO Smokerlyzer device and app. Content of sessions is consistent with that delivered in the IC treatment protocol for veteran smokers with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The experimental intervention condition in the proposed study differs from the standard of care in that participants will be receiving tailored, individualized smoking cessation counseling for veterans with PTSD.</description>
