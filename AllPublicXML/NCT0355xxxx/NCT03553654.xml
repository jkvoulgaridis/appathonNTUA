    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent.

          2. 18-75 year old patients with newly-diagnosed cancer scheduled to undergo
             anthracycline-based chemotherapy (minimum of 200 mg/m2 of doxorubicin or equivalent)
             at UCSD Medical Center.

          3. Women of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or
             barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of
             study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.

             â€¢ A woman of child-bearing potential is any female (regardless of sexual orientation,
             having undergone a tubal ligation, or remaining celibate by choice) who meets the
             following criteria:

               -  Has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or

               -  Has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months (i.e.,
                  has had menses at any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months)

          4. Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test during the
             screening period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior chemotherapy with anthracycline;

          2. Persistent tachycardia (heart rate&gt;90);

          3. LVEF&lt;53% or history of cardiomyopathy or decompensated heart failure;

          4. Baseline GLS below lower limit of normal (normal range varies depending on age and
             gender (23)) or inability to obtain meaningful strain data due to poor quality of
             Echocardiographic images;

          5. Known unrevascularized coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction within 30 days
             of enrollment;

          6. Moderate or severe valvular heart disease;

          7. Prior allergy or intolerance to iodinated contrast;

          8. Renal failure (GFR&lt;30, creatinine &gt;1.5);

          9. Cancer involvement of the heart.
