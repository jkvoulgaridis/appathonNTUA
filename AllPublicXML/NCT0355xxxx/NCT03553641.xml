    <textblock>
      the aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of dental hyperalgesia and mechanical
      allodynia on the assessment capacity of individuals in a local Turkish population. The
      hypothesis of this study is that excessive amounts of pain and a major functional shift in
      the somatosensory system due to central sensitization might cause unwitting intent.

      It included patients between the ages of 18 and 70 who had a symptomatic tooth in need of
      non-surgical root canal treatment. All enrolled subjects volunteered and signed a written
      informed consent. Patients diagnosed with systemic diseases and those who had used an
      analgesic within 12 hours prior to the appointment were excluded from the study. A total of
      30 patients were included in the study. A data sheet including patients' demographic data,
      diagnostic data, and data of explicit declaration of intent was completed. All pain scores
      were recorded according to the Visual Analog Scale (VAS). After the demographic data,
      diagnostic data. Patients were explicitly informed that the answers they were going to
      provide to the questions related to their explicit declaration of intent would not affect
      their diagnosis or the treatment they would undergo.

    <description>presence or absence of dental hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia was recorded as well as the intensity of pain according to visual analog scale (VAS) with patients request of treatment to further evaluate any relevance between the variables. VAS scale is between 1 to 10 and 1 means no pain and 10 means worst pain ever. The scale was drawn as a 10 cm line on a paper, with a number at the beginning of each cm from 1 to 10 and patients were asked to show the respected place regarding their intensity of pain they were experiencing on the line.</description>
