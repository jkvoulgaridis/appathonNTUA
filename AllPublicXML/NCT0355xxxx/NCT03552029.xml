  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants with AML that have gone into remission and come back (relapsed) or gone into
      remission with a number of leukemia cells still in their system (refractory) will be
      recruited for this study. They will also be positive for FLT3-ITD mutation.

      Participants will receive a combined dose of quizartinib and milademetan that have not been
      approved by the US Food and Drug Administration yet (m).

      The combination of these drugs will be provided in different amounts on defined days (dosing
      schedules).

      It is expected that the combination of milademetan and quizartinib will be safe and well
      tolerated. It is expected that the combination may fight the leukemia better than a single
      drug.

      The study will run for approximately 3 years. There may be up to 156 participants.

      The study has 2 parts:

        -  Part 1 will test 24-36 participants in approximately 15 study centers globally.
           Participants will receive two study drugs (milademetan and quizartinib) in different
           amounts on specific days. Information will be gathered to see what dosing schedule of
           the drug combination is best (maximum tolerated/recommended dose).

        -  Part 2 of the study will confirm the recommended dosing schedule identified in Part 1 is
           effective. A larger number of participants will receive the recommended dose in
           approximately 15 additional sites worldwide as necessary, based on the enrollment rate,
           the population, and the standard of care available to them at the time of enrollment.
