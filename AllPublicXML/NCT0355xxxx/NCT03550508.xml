  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      JMT103 is a novel, full human IgG4 monoclonal antibody targeting RANKL. In preclinical
      studies, JMT103 demonstrated strong activity through blocking RANKL receptor, RANK on the
      surface of osteoclasts, leading to inhibit osteoclast differentiation, activation, and
      maturation and reduce bone resorption.

      This first-in-human study is conducted to assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and
      dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) ,to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and preliminary
      efficacy (bone turnover markers) of recombinant fully human Anti-RANKL Monoclonal Antibody
      (JMT103) in patients with bone metastases from tumors at single doses and multiple doses.

      About 36 cases patients are to be recruited.

      This is a Phase I, first-in-human, multi-center, open-label dose escalation clinical study of
      recombinant fully human Anti-RANKL Monoclonal Antibody (JMT103) administered subcutaneously
      to patients with bone metastases from tumors.

      The study includes two phases: dose escalation study and expansion study. The dose-escalation
      stage is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of single dose
      and following repeat doses of JMT103 given every 4 weeks (Q4W) for three times. The expansion
      study stage is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of repeat
      doses of JMT103 given every 4 weeks (Q4W) for three times.
