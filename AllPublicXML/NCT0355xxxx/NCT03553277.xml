  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dengue viruses are the most medically important arthropod-borne pathogens worldwide, with
      transmission occurring in most tropical and sub-tropical regions. An estimated 390 million
      infections occur yearly. Although, there are considerable ongoing efforts to develop a
      vaccine, vector control remains the only option for reducing dengue virus (DENV) transmission
      and disease burden. The recent emergence of Aedes-borne Zika (ZIKV) and Chikungunya viruses
      (CHIKV) highlight need for novel vector control tools. The goal of this project is to
      determine the efficacy of a spatial repellent (SR) product (active ingredient transfluthrin)
      for reducing contact between household residents and vector mosquitos and as a result reduce
      DENV, ZIKV, and/or other Aedes-borne virus transmission. Henceforth the investigators will
      designate the combined risk of Aedes-borne dengue, Chikungunya, Zika virus transmission by
      (DCZV). Spatial repellency is used here as a general term to refer to a range of insect
      behaviors caused by airborne chemicals that reduce contact between people and disease
      vectors. This can include movement away from a chemical stimulus, and interference with host
      detection (attraction-inhibition) and/or feeding response.

      Protection provided by this product will be measured using entomological and virological
      approaches, comparing entomological indices will be measured through standard household
      monitoring of Aedes aegypti population densities, while DCZV transmission will be measured
      through door-to-door surveillance for active dengue disease and through serological
      monitoring for DCZV exposure in a randomized cluster trial.

      The investigators will establish a cohort of 3,400 persons, primarily children 2-12 years of
      age and adults who have not been previously infected with DCZV who will provide annual blood
      samples when they are healthy (longitudinal cohort), whereas in the same clusters the
      investigators expect to monitor up to 27,500 residents for active dengue disease (febrile
      surveillance cohort). The cohort will be monitored for a period of 2 years. The use of
      spatial repellents has never been tested on a large scale to reduce disease and could change
      vector control practices worldwide, reducing the amount of chemical insecticides applied and
      also prevent the development of insecticide resistance. The investigators plan to implement a
      short questionnaire to determine levels of acceptability and perceived efficacy amongst
      participating households.

      The project will be carried out in the Amazonia City of Iquitos, Peru, which has a
      well-established infrastructure for studying urban dengue fever. The study will generate
      rigorous evidence, documenting and evaluating the impact of SR products on human infection
      rates, to be considered and used by academia, industry and public health key stakeholders at
      the global, regional, national and/or local level and drive efforts to acquire full
      recommendation of SR products for inclusion in disease control programs.

    <description>Compare perceived efficacy of product to reduce mosquito nuisance in households with active and placebo product as indicator for product acceptability. Scale ranges from 0 (no difference in mosquito nuisance from before product was installed), 1 (less mosquito nuisance then before the product was installed) and 2 (greater mosquito nuisance since the product has been installed). A value of 1 is considered the better outcome whereas a value of 2 is considered the worse outcome. Scores will be averaged for each treatment arm.</description>
