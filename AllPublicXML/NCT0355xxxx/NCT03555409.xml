      Microsporidia comprise a diverse group of obligate spore-forming intracellular eukaryotic
      pathogens first described in immunocompromised patients. Many species of microsporidia are
      found in aquatic environments, and they are considered as waterborne pathogens.Microsporidia
      are opportunistic pathogens that are reported to cause infections in various organs,
      including the eyes. The ocular appearance of this infection can manifest as corneal stromal
      keratitis or a superficial punctate keratoconjunctivitis. In particular, the characteristic
      feature of microsporidial keratoconjunctivitis is multiple whitish, slightly elevated
      epithelial lesions in conjunction with acute conjunctivitis. Awareness of microsporidial
      keratoconjunctivitis is increasing, and the number of cases reported is on the rise. This
      study was a retrospective case series of patients diagnosed as microsporidial
      keratoconjunctivitis. The purpose of this project was to analysis the causes, pathogenesis,
      diagnostic modalities and treatment outcomes of microsporidial keratoconjunctivitis
