  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre, randomized clinical trial which evaluates the efficiency of the
      collagen xenograft (Muco-Graft®) in comparison to the autologous connective tissue graft for
      the augmentation of keratinized mucosa and gaining hygienic access to the implants diagnosed
      with peri-implantitis.

      Nowadays, there is not enough evidence that evaluates the patient's perception of utilizing
      the soft tissue substitutes in comparison to the autologous connective tissue graft for the
      augmentation of the keratinized mucosa and gain of hygienic access to the implants with
      infectious pathology and with minimum or absent keratinized mucosa.

      Therefore, the aim of the study is to evaluate the change of clinical parameters of
      peri-implant health and the patient perception of the procedure for augmentation of the
      keratinized tissues around dental implants with peri-implantitis.

      The hypothesis is that collagen matrix of porcine origin is associated with lower patient
      morbidity, in comparison with autologous connective-tissue graft, when used for the
      augmentation of the keratinized tissues around endosseous dental implants with infectious
      pathology and with minimum or absent KT mucosa.

      A sample 48 patients will be recruited basing upon the diagnosis of peri-implantitis and
      absent or insufficient peri- implant mucosa. 1 month after the non-surgical treatment,
      surgical procedure will be performed.

      Peri-implant clinical and radiographic parameters, as well as patient perception of the
      therapy provided, will be evaluated before and at various stages (up to 52 weeks) after the
      surgical intervention. Also, change of vestibulum depth will be analyzed, as well as the time
      spent for the procedure measured.

    <masking_description>The examiners will be blinded. Envelopes will be prepared by a research assistant not involved as clinician or examiner. The clinicians involved will have no access to the data collection sheets or the group allocation, whilst the examiners will have no access to the patients' treatment notes or group allocation. The examiners will be blinded with regards to the participant treatment assignments. The measures will include no access to the dental records as to which treatment has been assigned. The patients are not to reveal their treatment assignment to the examiners. Unblinding is expected when patients present with adverse outcomes during the course of the study, e.g., emphysema.</masking_description>
