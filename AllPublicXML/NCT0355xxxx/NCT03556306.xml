  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Retrospective study with patients submitted to bariatric surgery between 2013 and 2016 at a
      single Institution. The objective was to analyze the incidence and causes of unexpected
      intraoperative findings and complications, change in surgical plan, extra surgeries and
      procedure interruption. All operative information was collected prospectively and aimed to
      describe any of the previous situations. Secondarily, a morbidity analysis was performed,
      correlating intraoperative complications with postoperative complications and length of stay.

    <description>The gastric bypass (&quot;simplified technique&quot;) was performed in an antecolic fashion, with a calibrated 2 cm gastro-jejunal anastomosis (linear stapler); biliary and alimentary limbs measured 70 and 150 cm respectively [17] . Mesenteric defects were closed and the omentum divided. The sleeve gastrectomy was performed at 5-6 cm from the pylorus over a 36 Fr. bougie, with oversuture of the staple line (2-0 polypropylene). Methylene blue test and the use of drains were done routinely.</description>
