  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The principal objective of this study is to compare migration patterns between the Attune and
      Attune S+ PS knee systems using model-based RSA over the first 2 post-operative years.
      Secondary objectives include; comparison of 2-year migration values against published
      thresholds for adequate short-term fixation, quantify changes in functional and health status
      of subjects following surgery and compare between study groups, and assess occurrences of
      complications following surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre, randomized controlled trial of patients undergoing
      posterior-stabilized total knee arthroplasty. In this study, the investigators propose to
      randomize 50 subjects to receive either the standard Attune PS TKA (n=25) or the enhanced
      fixation Attune S+ PS TKA (n=25) and follow them for a period of 2 years post-operatively.
      The primary outcome of the study will be stability of fixation of the tibial baseplate as
      measured by model-based RSA. Secondary outcomes will be to determine the functionality of
      patients after surgery using self-reported questionnaires.

    <measure>Knee Replacement Expectation Survey (KRES)</measure>
    <time_frame>Preoperative</time_frame>
    <description>The KRES is a patient reported questionnaire that consists of 19 questions. The questions ask how each expectation is important in the treatment of the knee. The scale is rated: 1 (Very important) to 5 (This does not apply to me). The score ranges from 19 to 95 with higher scores associated with higher expectations.</description>

    <description>Evaluate and compare the change from preoperative to 2 years between the study groups timepoints in functional outcomes assessments. The EuroQol 5D 5L questionnaire is a standardized instrument for use as a measure of health outcome that is designed for completion by the subject.</description>

    <time_frame>Preoperative, 6 Months, 1 Year and 2 Years]</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluate and compare the change in UCLA activity score compared to baseline in the study cohort. UCLA activity scores range from 1 to 10, and is a measure of activity with 10 being most active.</description>

    <measure>Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Preoperative and 1 Year</time_frame>
    <description>The patient are asked to indicate the degree to which they have the above thoughts and feelings when they are experiencing pain. Each PCS item is rated on a 5-point scale: 0 (not at all) to 4 (all the time). The PCS total score is computed by summing responses to the 13 items. PCS total scores range from 0 - 52.</description>

    <measure>Pre-operative Patient's Knee Implant Performance (PKIP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Preoperative, 6 Months, 1 Year and 2 Years</time_frame>
    <description>The Pre-surgical and/or Post-surgical Patient's Knee Implant Performance (PKIP) questionnaire is a patient reported questionnaire that consists of 24 questions relating to the patient's awareness of their knee. Questions include the patient's self-confidence about the current status of their knee performance, stability, and overall satisfaction. Each question has a 5, 6 or 10 Likaert- like response option.</description>
