  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hearing impairment is the most frequent sensory deficit in humans and affects one newborn out
      of 500. The prevalence rises to 3,5/1000 in teenagers due to retarded forms. Most of hearing
      impairments (about two thirds) have a genetic origin, with recessive, dominant or X-linked
      mode of inheritance. Some rare forms can be linked to mitochondrial DNA. Molecular diagnosis
      (i.e. defining the molecular basis of the disease, genes and precise DNA variants) is
      essential for the follow-up of patients and families.

      The project intends to perform exome sequencing on 30 samples of families presenting with
      hearing impairment. Families have been included based on the genetic origin of the hearing
      impairment (familial cases) and the exclusion of the involvement of 74 known deafness genes.
      Exome sequencing (sequencing of the coding regions of all known genes, about 22,000) in these
      cases may underly new gene/disease relationships.

      Exome sequencing will be performed of 10 trios that each include two affected and one non
      affected members of a family. Filtering of variants will be performed based on frequency. For
      each trio, data will be analysed in parallel to follow segregation of the variant(s) in
      candidate genes. The selected candidate genes will be further characterized in order to
      ascertain their involvement in hearing function.

      Finally, once these new genes are well defined as &quot;deafness genes&quot; , their screening will be
      added to existing diagnostic panels.
