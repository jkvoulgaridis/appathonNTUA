    <textblock>
      Inappropriate antipsychotic prescribing is a key quality indicator by which clinical outcomes
      might be monitored and improved in LTC. A multi component intervention to reduce
      inappropriate antipsychotic prescribing was evaluated in ten Canadian long-term care
      facilities.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Increasing numbers of older adults are affected by dementia, and many will eventually reside
      in long-term care (LTC), where antipsychotic use is relatively common. Inappropriate
      antipsychotic prescribing is a key quality indicator by which clinical outcomes might be
      monitored and improved in LTC but limited evidence exists on the most effective strategies
      for reducing inappropriate antipsychotic use.

      The objective of the study was to evaluate a multicomponent approach to reduce inappropriate
      prescribing of antipsychotics in LTC.

      A prospective, randomized stepped-wedge, study design was used to evaluate the effect of the
      intervention in 10 LTC facilities in Canada. The intervention consisted of an educational
      in-service, provision of evidence-based tools to assess and monitor neuropsychiatric symptoms
      (NPS) and monthly interprofessional team meetings.

    <description>The proportion of long-term care residents receiving any antipsychotic without a diagnosis of psychosis is a quality indicator is used by the Canadian Institute for Health Information to determine potentially inappropriate antipsychotic use. The quality indicator is calculated using information routinely collected on Resident Assessment Index-Minimum Dataset (RAI-MDS) assessments by determining the number of individuals who received antipsychotics on one of more days in the 7 days preceding index (RAI-MDS item O4a â‰¥ 1). Individuals with schizophrenia, Huntington's disease, hallucinations, delusions, those with a limited life expectancy and those currently receiving palliative care are excluded from the numerator and denominator of this indicator.</description>
