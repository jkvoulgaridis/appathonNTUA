  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the changes of lung function before and after the
      exercise in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.The assessment of quality of
      life is also carried out through questionnaires.

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized,open-label study to research the changes of lung function before and
      after exercise in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .At baseline,lung
      function test,blood oxygen saturation and pulse are measured before and after 6-min walk test
      for each subject.Quality of life is assessed through questionnaires including modified
      Medical Research Council dyspnoea scale(mMRC),St George's Respiratory
      Questionnaire(SGRQ),Clinical Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Questionnaire(CCQ) and chronic
      obstructive pulmonary assessment test(CAT).And then budesonide(160ug) and formoterol(4.5ug)
      bid will be given to the subjects for 3 months.The subjects will have a follow-up visit with
      all the examinations mentioned above after 3 months` treatment.
