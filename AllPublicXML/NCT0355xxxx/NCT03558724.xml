  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For locally advanced esophageal cancer (EC), neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) for 5 weeks
      followed by esophagectomy and lymphadenectomy, if necessary, is standard of care. It is
      reported that the pathological complete response (pCR) rate after nCRT ranges from 16% to
      43%, with a median of 26.5%. According to current clinical guidelines, patients who achieved
      pCR still go for surgery even though those patients who achieved pCR may not benefit from
      surgery. Besides, about 50% of EC patients may have post-operative complications including
      pneumonia, anastomotic leakage, recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis, which lead to low
      health-related quality of life (HQoL).

      The golden standard to test the pathological response is by pathological assessment of the
      surgical specimen and thus after surgery. Theoretically, if pCR after nCRT can be predicted
      accurately before surgery by advanced imaging techniques, patients could have a wait-and-see.
      The wait-and-see procedure includes regular follow-up and salvage surgery if recurrence is
      present. Therefore, molecular fluorescence endoscopy (FME) using near-infrared fluorescence
      (NIRF) tracer bevacizumab-800CW targeting vascular endothelial growth factor combined with
      high-definition white light (HD-WL) endoscopy is expected to be a promising technique to
      monitor pCR and fill the gap.
