  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the loss of retinal cells following retinal
      detachment surgery using an imaging device called an adaptive optics camera. The retina is a
      thin layer which lines the back of the eye. It is sensitive to light (like the film in a
      camera) and is necessary for vision. If a hole or rip develops in a retina it can become
      detached. The macula is the central portion of the retina which the investigators use for
      fine vision. This area can also become detached as part of a retinal detachment.
      Proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) is an abnormal scarring response inside the eye which
      can occur when the retina detaches. It can adversely affect the outcome of the retinal
      detachment repair and is associated with a worse visual prognosis. The investigators want to
      investigate retinal cell loss in patients with retinal detachments that have developed PVR
      when the macula has been involved.

      The investigators plan to compare them to two other groups of patients, who have not
      developed PVR:

        1. Patients with macula-involving retinal detachments without PVR

        2. Patients with macula-sparing detachments without PVR

      The investigators will investigate retinal cell loss in these types of retinal detachments
      using adaptive optics imaging. This is a non-invasive imaging technique which allows the
      investigators to view the retina at very high magnification. Investigating photoreceptor loss
      and its association with visual outcome in this way should help to guide future interventions
      in promoting retinal regeneration. The investigators plan to recruit 25 patients at one UK
      hospital. The project is funded by the charity Fight for Sight.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A cohort of 10 cases of macula-involving retinal detachment complicated by proliferative
      vitreoretinopathy grade C (RDPVR group) will be identified from vitreoretinal clinics at
      Moorfields Eye Hospital. 26 weeks following retinal detachment repair, and after removal of
      any silicone oil tamponade, these cases will undergo post-operative visual assessment, OCT
      imaging and microperimetry. These investigations will be correlated with adaptive optics (AO)
      enface imaging of cone photoreceptors at the macula. This will be compared with groups of 10
      cases of macula involving retinal detachment without PVR (RD-OFF) and 5 cases of
      macula-sparing retinal detachment (RD-ON). Both comparison groups (RD-OFF &amp; RD-ON) will
      undergo assessments at both 6 weeks and 26 weeks post-operatively.
