    <textblock>
      The purpose of this survey is to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of the alogliptin
      and metformin hydrochloride combination tablet in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with
      renal impairment (mild), hepatic impairment (mild or moderate), or advanced age (65 years and
      more) in the routine clinical setting.

      The drug being tested in this survey is called alogliptin and metformin hydrochloride
      combination tablet. This tablet is being tested to treat people who have type 2 diabetes
      mellitus with renal impairment (mild), hepatic impairment (mild or moderate), or advanced age
      (65 years and more).

      This survey is an observational (non-interventional) study and will look at the long-term
      safety and efficacy of the alogliptin and metformin hydrochloride combination tablet in the
      routine clinical setting. The planned number of observed patients will be approximately 600.

      This multi-center observational trial will be conducted in Japan.

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available for all interventional studies after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received (or program is completely terminated), an opportunity for the primary publication of the research and final report development has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>
