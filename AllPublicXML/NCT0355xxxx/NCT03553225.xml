  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Concord grape (Vitis Labrusca) is rich in polyphenols such as anthocyanins, flavanols,
      procyanidins and flavonols. Current reports investigating the effects of Concord grape (CG)
      consumption on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk have provided mixed results. Studies were
      limited by small sample size or lacked a control arm. Moreover, subjects presented with CVD
      or CVD risk factors and thus to our knowledge, it remains unknown as to whether the
      consumption of Concord Grape (poly)phenols can maintain vascular function in healthy
      individuals. The aim of this study is therefore to examine both acute and chronic effects of
      Concord Grape on cardiovascular health by investigating whether daily consumption of Concord
      Grape Extract (CGE) for 12 weeks can affect biomarkers of CVD risk, including endothelial
      function, blood pressure and blood lipids, in young healthy men and women.
