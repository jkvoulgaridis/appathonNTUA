  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the effect of digoxin on pyruvate kinase isoform 2 (PKM2) binding to
      pro-inflammatory loci and innate immune inflammatory responses in the peripheral blood in
      healthy subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the effect of orally administered digoxin on innate immune inflammatory
      responses in the peripheral blood of healthy subjects. We hypothesize the reduction in innate
      immune inflammatory responses will be expected in the peripheral blood with the effect of
      oral digoxin.

      To investigation of how human peripheral blood immune cells change their inflammatory
      responses after exposure to digoxin in vitro.

    <time_frame>after starting digoxin</time_frame>
    <description>We will be taking neutrophils (PMN's) from the blood and seeing if the patients on digoxin have lower levels of spontaneous reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. This will be determined as a greater than 25% reduction in ROS compared to individuals not taking digoxin. The serum digoxin levels are just being done per usual guidelines to make sure that supratherapeutic levels of digoxin are not reached.</description>
