  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Selective cannulation is an essential step for the success of ERCP. The successful
      cannulation is influenced by types of disease (such as Sphincter of Oddi Dysfunction and
      duodenal stricture), the experience of endoscopists and the anatomy of papilla. It is
      suggested that the size, morphology, orientation and location of major duodenal papilla
      (MDP), could cause a difficult cannulation (Endoscopy 2016; 48: 657-683). However, the
      related evidences are limited. The investigators hypothesized that special anatomy of
      papilla, such as a lanky shape (defined by the higher ratio of length to width) and a deeper
      location, could increase the difficulty of cannulation. Here the investigators investigated
      the effects of the anatomy of major duodenal papilla on post-ERCP pancreatitis and the
      procedure of cannulation in patients undergoing ERCP.

    <description>ERCP was performed by trainees or trainers. Before the cannulation, the photo of major duodenal papilla will be taken carefully to evaluate its size, morphology, orientation and location. All patients initially received wire-guided cannulation with a sphincterotome, If cannulation failed, precut sphincterotomy or the double-wire technique was performed when appropriate. Therapeutic manipulation (eg, sphincterotomy, balloon dilation, stone extraction, and stenting) was done when appropriate. Pancreatic duct stent placement was performed at the discretion of the endoscopists.</description>
