  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To study the relationship between sarcopenia and undernutrition in adult patients over 70
      years of age, and at the same time to define a threshold value for the predictive SARC-F
      score of undernutrition.

      Hypothesis : the SARC-F score is correlated with malnutrition defined according to the
      following HAS criteria :

      Moderate denutrition Severe denutrition
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The geriatric population is a population at risk, given the frequent and numerous
      comorbidities present. Undernutrition is one of these, which is frequently associated with
      sarcopenia, that is, a decrease in muscle strength. Its screening must be early to avoid
      complications (osteoporosis, fractures, infections ...) and given the cost it generates for
      society. However, the detection of undernutrition can sometimes be time-consuming and its
      criteria in default, such as in the presence of edema or obesity, for example. There is a
      score, the SARC-F, which allows to detect sarcopenia from a result greater than or equal to
      4, but which does not allow direct detection of undernutrition.

      The primary objective is to evaluate the SARC-F score as a screening tool for undernutrition
      in a geriatric population, secondary objectives being to find a threshold value at this
      score, and also to estimate a prevalence of undernutrition in this population.

      It will be a cross-sectional exploratory study to evaluate a diagnostic tool, the SARC-F
      score, with comparison between cases and controls.

      The study will be conducted in a single center, a geriatric short-stay service. Participation
      in the study will be offered to any patient admitted to the geriatric ward, those who meet
      the inclusion criteria and do not have exclusion criteria will have to complete the SARC-F
      questionnaire during their stay, and to do the handgrip test and impedancemetry performed by
      a third party. Biological data (albumin, pre-albumin and C-Reactive Protein) and
      anthropometric data will be collected and analyzed to determine if the patient is
      malnourished or not, and the results of SARC-F will be compared between these 2 groups.

    <description>SARC-F score (dependent variable) defined by a questionnaire, completed by the patient during the stay at the clinic. This questionnaire includes 5 questions rated from 0 to 2 and is therefore 10 in total. It is admitted the presence of sarcopenia for a score greater than or equal to 4 according to the literature. However, there is currently no study defining a threshold for the diagnosis of undernutrition</description>
