  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diagnosis of patients with microsporiosis relies on pathological findings as well as
      laboratory detection of the causative organism. The conventional laboratory diagnosis of
      microsporiosis relies on microscopic visualization of the characteristic V. Corneae
      organisms. We develop a fully automated molecular platform for detection of Vittaforma
      corneae among patients with microsporidia keratitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clinical infections due to Microsporidium spp. are protean and can be found in humans,
      insects, and fishes. The most common type of infection is keratitis and mostly is caused by
      Vittaforma corneae. Diagnosis of patients with microsporiosis relies on pathological findings
      as well as laboratory detection of the causative organism. The conventional laboratory
      diagnosis of microsporiosis relies on microscopic visualization of the characteristic V.
      Corneae organisms. Laboratory tools of identification of V. corneae include Gram staining,
      Giemsa staining, and modified Ziehl-Neelsen staining of scratching or biopsied specimens of
      infected cornea. However, the sensitivity of these staining methods is not acceptable due to
      the variation of specimen quality and quantity, processing, and low load of organisms in the
      specimens. The BD MAX system (Beckon Dickinson, Diagnostic Systems, Sparks, MD, USA) was
      introduced in clinical microbiology laboratory of NTUH in 2014 for Pneumocystis jirovecii
      detection. Till now, no data are available in using this system on V. corneae detection. We
      develop a fully automated molecular platform for detection of Vittaforma corneae among
      patients with microsporidia keratitis.
