  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Different methods was tried to treat high AC/A strabismus cases;such as prescription of
      bifocal glasses in esotropia,recession of horizontal muscles with posterior fixation
      sutures,more recession than needed for far deviation(augmented recession),recession and
      pulley fixation and slant recession.

      Different results was reported for any type of above methods. In recent studies,slanted
      recession was applied for high AC/A in esotropic cases and success rate of 67% was
      reported.but there was no unanimity for procedure of choice.

      Since slant recession method is simpler and has low side effect than the other
      methods,therefore in this study the investigators want to peruse the outcome of this method
      on high AC/A horizontal strabismus.
