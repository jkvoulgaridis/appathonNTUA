    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is to evaluate the safety and effect of personalized neoantigen vaccines,
      which are based on next-generation sequencing and MHC affinity prediction algorithm. The
      hypothesis of this study is that personalized neoantigen vaccines will be safe and capable of
      generating measurable neoantigen-specific CD4 and CD8 T cell responses.

      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety and effect of
      personalized neoantigen vaccines for pancreatic tumors. It is known that pancreatic tumors
      have various mutations (changes in genetic material) that are specific to an individual
      patient and tumors. These mutations can cause the tumor cells to produce proteins that appear
      very different from the body's own cells. It is possible that these proteins used in a
      vaccine may induce strong immune responses, which may help the participant's body fight any
      tumor cells that could cause the pancreatic tumors to come back after radical surgery. The
      study will examine the safety and effect of the vaccine when given at several different time
      points and will examine the participant's blood cells for signs that the vaccine induced an
      immune response. Finally we will establish the typical flow to assess efficiency and safety
      of vaccines according to the different reactivity of patients, as a result, to explore the
      most suitable practical approaches for applying personalized pancreatic tumor vaccines.

    <description>Patients will receive radical surgery and at least one circle of post-operative chemotherapy.
Personalized neoantigen vaccines will be injected on day 1 of weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, short interval or 1-2 months after the end of their post-operative chemotherapy, and two boosts will be on day 1 of weeks 12, 20.
Vaccines will be given in a total volume of up to 1.0ml/shot consisting of 0.3mg peptide+0.5mg ployICLC injected subcutaneously into two to four separate sites of the subject's thighs.
Patients will be called 2 times by study staff in the 6 months after last dose of vaccine and asked about any side effects experienced since the end-of-study visit.</description>
