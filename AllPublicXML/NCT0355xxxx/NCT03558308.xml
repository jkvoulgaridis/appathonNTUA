      This study examines the effects of computerbased cognitive rehabilitation on executive
      functions in the chronic phase after acquired brain injury using two clinically developed
      programmes and one sham-intervention. Furthermore, the study consists of Groups that receives
      the computerized training both with and witouth support from a professional.
