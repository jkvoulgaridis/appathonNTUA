  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, randomized, single-center, 3-part, FIH study to assess the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK, or how the drug behaves in the body), and
      pharmacodynamics (PD, or what the drug does to the body) of single and multiple doses of
      CC-99677 and to characterize the effect of food on the single-dose PK of CC-99677 in healthy
      adult subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This first-in-human (FIH) study aims to identify a safe and tolerable dose of CC 99677 in
      support of phase 2 and/or phase 3 studies to be conducted in subjects with underlying
      inflammatory diseases.

      The study also aims to evaluate the PK of CC-99677 following administration of single and
      multiple oral doses, including assessment of the effect of food on the single dose PK of CC
      99677, and to assess the effect of CC 99677 on electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters in healthy
      adult subjects. The pharmacodynamics (PD) and pharmacogenomics (PG) of CC 99677 will also be
      assessed.

      Parts 1 and 2 are designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, and PD of single and
      multiple ascending doses of CC 99677, respectively. The study has been designed to allow for
      safety, tolerability, and PK data to be gathered in a stepwise fashion. Part 1 will consist
      of escalating single doses in sequential groups. Approximately 48 subjects will be enrolled
      into 6 planned dose level cohorts. Part 2 will consist of escalating multiple doses
      (administered for 14 days) in sequential groups. In Part 2, approximately 40 subjects will be
      enrolled into 5 proposed dose level cohorts. Each dose level cohort will consist of 8
      subjects; 6 subjects will receive CC-99677 and 2 subjects will receive placebo according to
      the randomization schedule. In both Part 1 and Part 2, a higher daily dose level will not be
      initiated until adequate information on the preceding dose level is available and reviewed.
      Parts 1 and 2 will also employ strict dose escalation, individual subject, and intra cohort
      stopping criteria. Parts 1 and 2 will be placebo controlled to appropriately characterize the
      safety and tolerability of CC 99677.

      Part 3 is designed to characterize the effect of food on the single dose PK of CC 99677.

        Subjects must satisfy the following criteria to be enrolled in the study:

          1. Subject is ≥ 18 and ≤ 55 years of age at the time of signing the informed consent form
             (ICF).

          2. Subject must understand and voluntarily sign an ICF prior to any study-related
             assessments/procedures being conducted.

          3. Subject is willing and able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol
             requirements.

          4. Subject is in good health, as determined by the Investigator based on a physical
             examination at screening.

          5. Female subjects of childbearing potential (FCBP) must:

               -  Have 2 negative pregnancy tests as verified by the Investigator prior to the
                  first dose of IP. She must agree to ongoing pregnancy testing during the course
                  of the study, and prior to discharge from the study site. This applies even if
                  the FCBP subject practices true abstinence from heterosexual contact.

               -  Either commit to true abstinence from heterosexual contact (which must be
                  reviewed on a monthly basis, as applicable, and source documented) or agree to
                  use, and be able to comply with, one highly effective method and one effective
                  barrier method of contraception without interruption, during the study (including
                  any dose interruptions), and for at least 30 days after discontinuation of IP.
                  The female subject's chosen form of highly effective contraception must be
                  effective by the time the female subject is enrolled into the study (eg, hormonal
                  contraception should be initiated at least 28 days prior to enrollment).

          6. Female subjects NOT of childbearing potential must:

             - Have been surgically sterilized (hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; proper
             documentation is required) at least 6 months before screening, or be postmenopausal
             (defined as 24 consecutive months without menses before screening, with a
             follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH] level of &gt; 40 IU/L at screening).

          7. Male subjects must:

             - Practice true abstinence (which must be reviewed on a monthly basis, as applicable,
             and source documented) or agree to use a condom during sexual contact with a pregnant
             female or a FCBP while participating in the study, during any dose interruptions, and
             for at least 90 days after discontinuation of IP, even if he has undergone a
             successful vasectomy. In addition, any non-pregnant FCBP partner of a male subject
             must use an approved method of effective contraception, without interruption, during
             the study (including any dose interruptions) and for at least 30 days after
             discontinuation of IP. Examples of approved methods of effective contraception for
             non-pregnant FCBP partners include progestogen-only oral hormonal contraception; male
             or female condom with or without spermicide; or cap, diaphragm, or sponge with
             spermicide.

          8. Subject has a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 18 and ≤ 33 kg/m2 at screening.

          9. Subject has clinical laboratory safety test results that are within normal limits or
             considered not clinically significant by the Investigator. In addition, ALT, AST, and
             total bilirubin must be ≤ the upper limit of normal at screening and on Day -1 (of
             Period 1, when applicable [ie, in Part 3]). Platelet count, absolute neutrophil count
             (ANC), and absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) must be ≥ the lower limit of normal at
             screening and on Day -1 (of Period 1, when applicable [ie, in Part 3]).

         10. Subject is afebrile, with supine systolic blood pressure (BP) ≥ 90 and ≤ 140 mmHG,
             supine diastolic BP ≥ 50 and ≤ 90 mmHg, and pulse rate ≥ 40 and ≤ 110 bpm at
             screening.

         11. Subject has normal or clinically acceptable 12-lead ECG. In addition:

               -  If female, subject has a QTcF value ≤ 450 msec at screening.

               -  If male, subject has a QTcF value ≤ 430 msec at screening.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The presence of any of the following will exclude a subject from enrollment:

          1. Subject has any significant medical condition (including but not limited to
             neurological, gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, cardiovascular, psychological,
             pulmonary, metabolic, endocrine, hematological, allergic disease, drug allergies, or
             other major disorders), laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric illness that would
             prevent the subject from participating in the study.

          2. Subject has any condition including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, which
             places the subject at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study.

          3. Subject has any condition that confounds the ability to interpret data from the study.

          4. Subject is pregnant or breastfeeding.

          5. Subject was exposed to an investigational drug (new chemical entity) within 30 days
             preceding the first dose administration, or 5 half-lives of that investigational drug,
             if known (whichever is longer).

          6. Subject has used any prescribed systemic or topical medication (including but not
             limited to analgesics, anesthetics, etc) within 30 days prior to the first dose
             administration.

             Exceptions may apply on a case-by-case basis if considered not to interfere with the
             study objectives as agreed to by the Investigator and Sponsor's Medical Monitor.

          7. Subject has used any non-prescribed systemic or topical medication (including
             vitamin/mineral supplements, and herbal medicines) within 14 days prior to the first

             interfere with the study objectives as agreed to by the Investigator and Sponsor's
             Medical Monitor.

          8. Subject has used CYP3A inducers and/or inhibitors (including St. John's Wort) within
             30 days preceding the first dose administration. The Indiana University (2016)
             &quot;Cytochrome P450 Drug Interaction Table&quot; should be utilized to determine inducers
             and/or inhibitors of CYP3A (http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/table.aspx). The
             Sponsor's Medical Monitor or designee should be queried in case of uncertainty.

         13. Subject is known to have a history of hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C, or have a
             positive result to the test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies at
             screening.

             Note: Subjects who received hepatitis B vaccination and who test positive for
             hepatitis B surface antibody and negative for both hepatitis B surface antigen and
             hepatitis B core antibody remain eligible for study participation.

         14. Subject smokes &gt; 10 cigarettes per day, or the equivalent in other tobacco products

             months prior to the first dose administration or is planning to receive immunization
             with a live or live attenuated vaccine for 2 months following the last dose
             administration.

         16. Subject has a history of Gilbert's syndrome or has laboratory findings at screening
             that, in the opinion of the Investigator, are indicative of Gilbert's syndrome.

         17. Subject has a history of incompletely treated Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB)
             infection, as indicated by:

               -  Subject's medical records documenting incomplete treatment for Mycobacterium TB.

               -  Subject's self-reported history of incomplete treatment for Mycobacterium TB.
                  Note: Subjects with a history of TB who have undergone treatment accepted by the
