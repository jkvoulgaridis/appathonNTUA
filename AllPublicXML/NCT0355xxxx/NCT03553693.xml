  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The RAPID-VL study will take place in 20 HIV care health facilities in Southwestern Uganda.
      The study will test the hypothesis that a multi-component intervention package that targets
      barriers to efficient and timely HIV viral load (VL) testing will improve test ordering,
      speed up result turnaround times, and improve the quality of VL results counseling to
      patients. Phase 1 of the study will consist of a 1-year retrospective medical record review
      in all participating health facilities. In Phase 2 the intervention will be introduced in 10
      randomly chosen health facilities, while the remaining 10 sites will continue with standard
      VL testing and counseling operations. The study will measure the speed and efficiency of VL
      testing, experiences of patients and clinicians with the intervention, and the cost of the
      intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will test the hypothesis that a multi-component intervention grounded in implementation
      science principles and that targets key barriers to optimal HIV viral load (VL) processing
      will improve viral load ordering, speed up viral load turnaround, and improve the quality of
      viral load counseling of results to patients within a Ugandan network of HIV care clinics.
      Specific objectives are as follows: Objective 1: Determine the comparative effectiveness of
      the RAPID-VL intervention on VL ordering and VL turnaround time: We will randomize 20 HIV
      clinics to the RAPID-VL multi-component intervention vs. standard of care VL procedures (n=10
      clinics each, 60 patients/health facility). Objective 2: Identify facilitators and barriers
      to implementation, and perceived utility of the RAPID-VL intervention from both the patient
      and clinician perspectives. Objective 3: Determine the costs, cost-effectiveness, and
      incremental change costs of the RAPID-VL intervention.
