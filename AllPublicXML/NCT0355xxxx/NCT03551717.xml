  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to investigate whether there are links between the blood
      vessels of the retina as a whole and heart and/or vascular diseases (cardiovascular
      diseases).

      The arteries and veins of the retina are, like the large vessels of the human body (aorta,
      coronary, cerebral arteries), exposed to the complications of hypertension, diabetes,
      obesity, dyslipidemia (abnormal blood lipid profile) or tobacco. Several studies have shown
      that changes in retinal vessels (microvascularization) generally occur several years before
      damage to large peripheral vessels (macrovascularization). The study of the vessels of the
      retina is now possible thanks to simple and non-invasive examinations of photographs (not
      creating any lesion). They allow a painless evaluation of the vessels in the retina.

      Ultimately, if this study is conclusive, the patient's cardiovascular risk could be evaluated
      simply by analysis of the vessels of the retina.

      The study is being conducted in the ophthalmology and cardiology departments of Dijon
      University Hospital. In total, the investigators wish to include approximately 510 patients
      who present cardiovascular risk factors (255 low risk patients recruited in the ophthalmology
      department and 255 high risk patients hospitalized in the cardiology department).

      All patients participating in the study will be asked to visit the ophthalmology department
      for a complete examination of the retina.
