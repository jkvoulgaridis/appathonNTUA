  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuraxial labor analgesia is performed by the administration of a local anesthetic/opioid
      mixture in the epidural space. The delivery method is a combination of continuous infusion,
      provider-administered boluses and patient-administered boluses (patient controlled epidural
      analgesia [PCEA]) via epidural catheter. Pain during the first stage of labor is primarily
      due to lower uterine segment and cervical stretching. The pain signals enter the spinal cord
      through sensory nerves at the T10 through L1 dermatomes. Pain signals from the late first
      state and second stage of labor also arise from the vagina and perineum. These signals travel
      with the pudendal nerve and enter the spinal cord at S2-S4. Thus, the anesthetic solution
      administered through the lumbar epidural catheter must spread cephalad in the epidural space
      to reach the T10 nerve roots and spinal cord, and must spread caudad to reach the caudal
      nerve roots in the epidural space.

      The optimal method for maintaining labor analgesia is unknown. Several studies have
      demonstrated that PIEB, in combination with PCEA, provide superior maintenance of labor
      analgesia (less need and longer time to provider intervention, lower local anesthetic
      consumption, less motor block, and improved patient satisfaction scores) than maintenance
      with a continuous infusion with PCEA.The mechanism for this difference is not known; however,
      one suggested mechanism is improved spread of the local anesthetic within the epidural space.
      Kaynar et al. injected methylene blue dye through a multi-orifice catheter using either a
      continuous infusion or intermittent bolus and the area of diffusion was measured on a piece
      of paper. The authors found that intermittent boluses were associated with a greater surface
      area of diffusion than continuous infusion. In a cadaver study, dye was injected into the
      lumbar epidural space, and cryomicrotome sections were taken.Dye flowed in rivulets through
      small channels in the epidural space, as opposed to moving as a unified front. The authors
      found dye injected at high pressures had more uniform spread through the epidural space,
      supporting the concept of intermittent epidural injection providing superior analgesia.

      Epidural infusion pumps capable of delivering PIEB of local anesthetic with PCEA have become
      commercially available and many studies have attempted to assess the optimal parameter
      settings (including volume of programmed bolus, bolus interval, rate of bolus administration)
      to provide superior labor analgesia. Recently we completed a double-blinded randomized
      control trial evaluating two bolus delivery rates, hypothesizing that those patients
      randomized to receive higher bolus delivery rates would have improved labor analgesia.
      However, no difference was found between groups.What is more, both groups had a mean cephalad
      sensory level to cold of T6. This sensory level is higher than the traditional goal of T10
      (upper dermatome level of uterine innervation), but despite the adequate sensory level, a
      large number of patients required supplemental physician-delivered boluses of local
      anesthetic during labor. Forty percent of the women in the high-rate group and 36% of the
      low-rate group required a manual re-dose during labor. This suggests that either a higher
      volume, or higher concentration of local anesthetic (i.e., higher dose) is needed to maintain
      adequate labor analgesia.

      Traditionally higher concentration local anesthetic solutions have been associated with
      increased motor blockade leading to a higher incidence of instrumental vaginal delivery.
      Several local anesthetic solutions with varying drug concentrations are available for labor
      analgesia and are used clinically in the United States. We plan to perform a randomized,
      controlled, double-blind study to test the hypothesis that patients whose labor analgesia is
      maintained using PIEB with low-volume bolus (6.25 mL) of a higher local anesthetic
      concentration solution (0.1% bupivacaine with fentanyl 2.0 mcg/mL) will require less
      supplemental analgesia (manual provider re-doses) than patients whose PIEB is delivered with
      a high-volume bolus (10 mL) of lower density local anesthetic solution (0.0625% bupivacaine
      with fentanyl 2.0 mcg/mL).

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the association between bolus volume and concentration
      of local anesthetic during maintenance of labor analgesia with programmed intermittent
      epidural bolus (PIEB) analgesia.

      The hypothesis of this study is: patients whose labor analgesia is maintained using PIEB with
      low-volume bolus (6.25 mL) of higher local anesthetic concentration solution (0.1%
      bupivacaine with fentanyl 2.0 mcg/mL) will have a longer duration of adequate analgesia (time
      to first manual re-dose request) than patients whose PIEB is delivered with a high-volume
      bolus (10 mL) of lower concentration local anesthetic solution (0.0625% bupivacaine with
      fentanyl 2.0 mcg/mL).
