  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The biocompatible silicone tube miniature drainage device is a small, non-valved implant to
      shunt aqueous humor underneath the conjunctiva to control the intraocular pressure. Efficacy
      and safety were evaluated with a minimum follow-up of 12 months.

    <textblock>
      Patients were examined postoperatively at 1 day, 1 week, 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 months or more
      frequent when required. IOP, BCVA and slit lamp biomicroscopy were observed at every visit.
      History of all medication details and postoperative complications were recorded. One-way
      analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures was used to analyze the other differences
      over time in IOP and BCVA. Nonparametric K-related samples test was used to analyze the
      difference of medications number at different time points. Success rates were evaluated using
      Kaplan-Meyer survival analysis curves.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:Eligible patients were at least 18 years of age and presented with
        medically uncontrolled POAG requiring incisional surgery for IOP (intraocular pressure)
        reduction.

        -

        Exclusion Criteria:Exclusion criteria included narrow angles, normal tension glaucoma,
        previous eye surgery (except cataract surgery), neovascular glaucoma, uveitis, any ocular
        abnormality that would preclude accurate IOP assessment, and inability to comply with the
        follow-up program or unwillingness to participate in this study.
