  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the abuse liability of mentholated very low nicotine
      cigarettes compared to nicotine gum and usual brand cigarettes.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a randomized, two-part, 3-way crossover designed to evaluate the abuse
      liability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and product use behavior associated with study products,
      including menthol VLN cigarettes, subjects' own-brand cigarettes, and nicotine polacrilex gum
      in healthy adult male and female exclusive smokers. Subjects will participate in a standard
      Screening visit and one 7-day Confined Assessment Phase, which will include a product trial
      session (Day -1), and two study parts (Part A and Part B). Following the Screening visit,
      eligible subjects will check-in to the study site on Day -1. Following the polacrilex gum
      training session, subjects will be required to abstain from nicotine- and tobacco-containing
      products for approximately 20 hours until the first product use session on Days 1 to 3; use
      of other nicotine-containing products will be prohibited throughout the study. No additional
      tobacco or nicotine products will be provided after the second product use on Days 4 to 6.

      On Day 1, subjects will be randomized to one of three product sequence groups in Part A,
      which will consist of an ad libitum product use session for each of the following study
      products for 4 hours in a randomized crossover manner (Days 1 to 3; one product per day):

      Product A: VLN menthol cigarette

      Product B: Own-brand filtered standard king size menthol cigarette

      Product C: 4 mg Nicotine polacrilex gum

      A pharmacodynamic measure (&quot;use product again&quot; visual analog scale (VAS)) will be
      administered at the end of each ad libitum product use period. Product use behaviors (i.e.,
      number of units consumed,duration of gum in mouth) will be collected throughout each ad
      libitum product use period. Upon completion of Part A, subjects will be randomized to one of
      three product sequence groups in Part B, which will consist of 3 study days (Days 4 to 6),
      with one product per day. Each study day will consist of: 1) Controlled Product Use Session
      (10 puffs from their own-brand cigarette or VLN menthol cigarette [maximum 3 ± 2 seconds per
      puff] at approximately 30 ± 5-second interpuff intervals, or chew the nicotine polacrilex gum
      using the &quot;chew and park&quot; method for 10 minutes); and 2) Uncontrolled Product Use Session (ad
      libitum use for 10 minutes). The Controlled Product Use Session and Uncontrolled Product Use
      Session will be separated by approximately 6 hours. During Part B, pharmacodynamic measures,
      pharmacokinetics (PK) , and product use behavior (Uncontrolled only) will be collected at
      various time points each day.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects will be required to meet each one of the following inclusion criteria in order to
        be eligible for participation in the study:

          1. Must provide written informed consent prior to the initiation of any protocol-specific
             procedures.

          2. Male and female adults, between 22 to 65 years of age, inclusive.

          3. Body mass index (BMI) within 18.0 to 35.0 kg/m2, inclusive (minimum weight of at least
             50.0 kg at Screening).

          4. Healthy, as determined by no clinically significant medical history, physical
             examination, 12-lead ECG, vital signs or laboratory (including hematology, clinical
             chemistry, urinalysis, and serology) findings at Screening, as judged by an
             investigator.

          5. Smoking history of an average of at least 10 manufactured filtered standard (i.e., not
             slim) king size combustible cigarettes daily for at least 1 year prior to Screening.
             Brief periods (i.e., up to 7 consecutive days) of non-smoking during the 3 months
             prior to Screening (e.g., due to illness or participation in a study where smoking was
             prohibited) will be permitted.

          6. Self-reporting of desire to smoke within approximately 30 minutes of waking.

          7. Positive urine cotinine (≥500 ng/mL) at Screening.

          8. Negative pregnancy test at Screening and Day -1 (check-in) for all female subjects.

          9. Female subjects of non-childbearing potential must be surgically sterile or 1 year
             postmenopausal (as confirmed by serum Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) &gt; 35 U/L). A
             subject is considered to be surgically sterile if she has had a tubal ligation,
             hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy or bilateral oophorectomy, or
             hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. If the subject is of childbearing
             potential, she must be using a medically accepted method of contraception and agree to
             continued use of this method for the duration of the study and for 30 days after
             completion of the study. Acceptable methods of contraception include abstinence, birth
             control pill, or an intrauterine device (known to have a failure rate of less than 1%
             per year) or double barrier method of contraception (e.g., male condom in addition to
             a diaphragm, contraceptive sponge or spermicide).
