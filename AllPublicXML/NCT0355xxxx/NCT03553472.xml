  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients under the age of 50 can have a greater risk than
      the general population above age 50. IBD patient are commonly treated with immunosuppression
      that increases the risk for Herpes Zoster. A new HZ vaccine is available that could decrease
      the risk of HZ in IBD patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of chronic inflammatory disorders of the
      gastrointestinal tract. A recent national survey from the CDC estimates that the prevalence
      of IBD in the United States (US) is nearly 3.1 million cases. IBD is often associated with
      debilitating symptoms, hospitalizations, decreased quality of life, frequent procedures
      and/or surgery. Treatment options include immunosuppressive therapies, such as
      corticosteroids, immunomodulators (thiopurines and methotrexate) and anti-tumor necrosis
      factor alpha (TNF) agents. Although they are effective in achieving clinical remission and
      decrease the risk of complications, they also increase the risk for serious infections,
      including herpes zoster (HZ).

      The primary goal is to study those patients with IBD who are thought to be at the highest
      risk for HZ reactivation by evaluating cell mediated immunity (CMI) to VZV.

        A history of chronic (greater than 3 month) ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease diagnosed
        and documented by the standard clinical, radiographic, endoscopic and histopathologic
        criteria.

        3.12 Ages 40-55 3.13 There will four groups divided by medication group. All patients will
        be on stable doses of medication for at least 3 months divided in the following groups: A)

        3.16 All participants must have received a tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis (Tdap) or
        tetanus, diphtheria (Td) within the previous 10 years the Wisconsin Immunization Registry
