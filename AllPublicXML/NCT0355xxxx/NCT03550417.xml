      The purpose of this research is to retrospectively evaluate current clinical care of
      Bronchiectasis (non-cystic fibrosis [CF]) in adults from a multidisciplinary management
      perspective. This evaluation aims to address the important gaps in current clinical care in
      2011, 2013 and July 2016- Jun2017. The primary outcome of this evaluation is to compare the
      efficacy of current multidisciplinary clinical practice to the British Thoracic Society (BTS)
      &amp; Thoracic Society of Australia and New Zealand (TSANZ) guidelines for bronchiectasis.
      Secondary outcomes of this evaluation will determine the impact of clinical care in 2011,
      2013 and July2016-June2017 through quantification of:hospital utilization for using hospital
      admission data, average length of stay, readmission rates within 28 days, emergency service
      attendance, outpatient review, exacerbations use of antibiotics, use of Hospital and Home
      (H@H), number of contacts with the respiratory nursing service and type of contacts with the
      respiratory nursing service.

      Project design: The study will be a 12 month retrospective observational cohort study
      conducted through a review of medical records, internal respiratory databases and electronic
      hospital patient record (OACIS, HOMER &amp; EPAS). Participants: Participants in the study will
      include all patients who have emergency service presentations or admissions to The Queen
      Elizabeth Hospital (TQEH) with new or existing bronchiectasis in 2011(Jan 1st to Dec 31st).
      This will be repeated using the same criteria in 2013. An additional year of July2016-
      Jun2017 has been added for recency of management and to assess if change occurred with
      introduction of electronic patient record. Data collection: Demographics, clinical data,
      hospital service utilization, and clinical outcomes such as exacerbation frequency and
      disease progression. All data will be extracted into a standardized data extraction form,
      which a random subset will be checked by a second researcher.Analysis of results:Demographic
      and descriptive data will be given in means + standard deviation and compared using a
      two-tailed and Student t-test. Categorical variables will be compared using chi-squared or
      Fisher exact tests, and when appropriate the Mann Whitney U test for non-parametric data.
      Statistical significance will be determined using an alpha of p &lt;0.05. All analyses will be
      examined using SPSS software (version x). A subgroup analysis for primary and secondary
      admission diagnosis will also be performed.
