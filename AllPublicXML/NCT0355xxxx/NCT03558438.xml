    <description>Fragility is defined according to the 5 Fried criteria:
Involuntary weight loss: (&gt; 4.5Kg in the last year)
Declined mood: through two questions from the Scale for Depression of the Center for Epidemiological Studies (CES-D).
Speed of walking adjusted for height and sex,
Weekly physical activity adjusted by sex.
Muscle weakness according to manual grip strength adjusted for BMI and sex.</description>

    <measure>Define a new simplified fragility index for the elderly patients with HIV infection easily applicable in clinical routine practice</measure>
    <time_frame>Year 5</time_frame>
    <description>The simplified fragility index for the elderly patient with HIV infection can not be defined a priori, so a multivariate logistic regression analysis will be performed for those variables that are associated with fragility in the analysis univariate, which will allow us to determine the variables that are associated in a independent with fragility, which will be with which we will define the fragility index simplified. Fragility will be treated as a binary variable: pre-fragile and robust will form a group that will serve as control. The fragility phenotype defined by the 5 Fried criteria will be considered the gold standard test to measure fragility when validating the simplified fragility screening test specific for elderly patients with HIV infection that we want to define</description>
