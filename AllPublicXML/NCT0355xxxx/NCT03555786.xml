  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the primary objective was to estimate the minimum effective volume of
      bupivacaine 0.5% resulting in successful block in 90% of patients (MEV90) for
      ultrasound-guided retroclavicular approach to infraclavicular brachial plexus block.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A &quot;biased coin up-and-down sequential design&quot; will be applied to assess the minimum effective
      volume in 90% of patients for the retroclavicular brachial plexus block. The first subject
      received 25 ml 0.5% bupivacaine . Each subsequent patient received a dose that depended on
      the response of the previous one. If the previous block is successful, the block will be
      performed either by a reduction of the volume by 2.5 ml with a probability ß = 0.11 or by a
      same dose of the previous one with a probability 1-ß = 0.89 in the next patient.
