  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy drugs improve cancer survival but increase the risk of cardiovascular disease
      (CVD). VEGF inhibitors (VEGFI) cause severe hypertension, while cisplatin appears
      pro-thrombotic. Hence while cancer survival may improve, this is at the risk of potentially
      severe CVD and associated morbidity. Mechanisms underlying the cardiovascular toxicities of
      VEGFI and cisplatin are unknown, but effects on vascular function may be important.

      The INTELLECT study will phenotype the endothelial effects of VEGFI and cisplatin using a
      variety of methods.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There remains an unmet need to identify a preventive treatment for patients with testicular
      cancer treated with platinum based chemotherapy to diminish the risk of subsequent
      cardiovascular events. A future randomised trial of statin therapy in these patients is under
      consideration and results from this study will inform its design.

      The information gained from this pilot study will guide the development of interventional
      pharmacological studies that are directed towards the most appropriate pathophysiological
      processes, at the most appropriate time and in the most appropriate patient groups treated
      with platinum based chemotherapy for testicular cancer.
