  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of a digital health platform coupled
      with walking activity tracking for patients with Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) and symptoms
      limited to claudication.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a two center, non-blinded, 2 period randomized crossover trial. 50 patient subjects
      are planned. Patient participants will be identified and recruited from clinical environments
      (including clinics and diagnostic testing departments) at participating sites. Diagnosis and
      testing will occur through usual clinical care, and participants will not incur financial
      costs related to participation. A crossover design will be utilized, where all participants
      will use the VOICE platform with activity tracking for 35 days and usual care for 30 days.
      Randomization will determine the order in which participation in the VOICE phase versus the
      usual care phase occur. Randomization will occur using a closed envelope system. For patients
      in the VOICE platform group, data collection will occur over a total of 35 days, including an
      initial 5-day &quot;run in&quot; period during which participants will orient themselves to the system.
      Each provider participant will receive a single end-user survey evaluating VOICE from their
      perspective.

      Screening of patients electronic medical records will be done to determine subject
      eligibility. Subjects who meet all inclusion criteria will be approached to participate.

      Total duration of subject participation will be 9 weeks during the control and intervention
      phases, with a final follow-up survey at 6 months post-enrollment.

    <measure>PROMIS Pain Interference Short Form 6a (raw score, T-score conversion)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month, 2 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System designed to gauge the level to which pain interferes with the participant's social, work, and day-to-day household activities. This six-item assessment yields total values ranging from 4 (low) to 20 (high) based on reported severity of pain interference, within a seven day duration. This measure will be repeated three times across the study and the data will be analyzed to determine consistency, improvement, and/or deterioration of quality.</description>

    <description>Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System short form questionnaire designed to gauge the level to which the participant feels their disease limits their ability to perform daily tasks and activities, at the time of the assessment. This six-item questionnaire yields total values ranging from 6 to 30, with a higher score representing a higher level of functional ability. This measure will be repeated three times across the study and the data will be analyzed to determine consistency, improvement, and/or deterioration of quality.</description>

    <description>Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System is a short form questionnaire administered to participants to gauge sleep depth and quality, within a seven day duration. This nine-item assessment is a combination of items in which participants are asked to respond either affirmatively or negatively, and with a subset of questions scored on a numerical scale with a raw score ranging from 4 (low) to 20 (high). This measure will be repeated three times across the study and the data will be analyzed to determine consistency, improvement, and/or deterioration of quality.</description>

    <measure>Grip Strength (kg)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Dominant hand grip strength will be measured and recorded by study staff, using a Jamar hand dynamometer. The participant will be directed to squeeze the unit's handle to obtain a &quot;peak-hold&quot; reading, with a potential isometric grip force ranging from 0-200lbs (90kgs). The numerical output will be recorded as part of the participant's chart to be analyzed and compared with the investigator's data set.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Ankle-Brachial Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Ankle-brachial index (ABI) is a diagnostic measure used by providers to determine the likelihood and severity of blocked arteries, due to peripheral artery disease. ABI is calculated by comparing the ratio of the recorded blood pressure at a participant's ankle to the pressure in the upper arm. Participant's previous ABI values in MiChart will be used to determine eligibility at time of enrollment. Newly ordered ABI studies will then be tracked by study staff and recorded to be analyzed with the data set, for the duration of their participation in the study.</description>
