  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A multi-center randomized controlled, parallel, assessor-blinded full-scale trial will be
      conducted based on the results of the pilot study to evaluate the comparative clinical
      effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of Doin (conduction exercise) with acupuncture for
      chronic neck pain patients compared to acupuncture alone as assessed using pain, functional
      disability, health-related quality of life, economic evaluation, and safety measures.

    <measure>Difference between visual analogue scale (VAS) of neck pain for the past 3 days at 5 weeks post-baseline and baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 5 post-baseline (screening)</time_frame>
    <description>VAS uses a 10cm line labeled at each end with scale anchors. In pain measurement using VAS, patients are asked to mark a point that represents their pain between the anchors of 'no pain' and 'worst pain possible' (labels may vary by study). Scores are recorded in millimeters with a total range of 0-100 millimeters.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 1, 6, Month 3, 6, 9, 12 post-baseline (screening)</time_frame>
    <description>The NDI evaluates functional impairment and is a 10-item questionnaire developed to assess the level of disability due to neck pain. Each item is graded into 6 levels, each representing a score of 0-5. Higher scores indicate greater limitation relating to neck pain.</description>

    <description>The NPQ evaluates functional impairment for the past 3 days in this study and is a patient reported outcome of subjective neck pain and pain reduction. The NPQ is a 9-item questionnaire developed to assess the level of disability due to neck pain. Each item is graded into 5 levels, each representing a score of 0-4. Higher scores indicate greater limitation relating to neck pain.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 6, Month 3, 6, 9, 12 post-baseline (screening)</time_frame>

    <time_frame>Week 1, 6, Month 3, 6, 9, 12 post-baseline (screening)</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D is a tool developed for health-related quality of life (HRQoL) assessment, and is widely used in the health care sector. Scores range from -1, 'health worse than death' to 1, 'perfect health'. EQ-5D-5L has 5 dimensions covering current health status and functionality: mobility (M), self care (SC), usual activities (UA), pain/discomfort (PD), and anxiety/depression (AD), to be rated out of 5 grades (1, no problem; 2, slight problem; 3, some/moderate problem; 4, severe problem; 5, extreme problem).</description>

    <time_frame>Week 1, 6, Month 3, 6, 9, 12 post-baseline (screening)</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-VAS uses a vertical 10cm line labeled at each end with scale anchors. EQ-VAS is used to indicate the patient's health state and patients are asked to mark a point that represents their health state between the anchors of 'worst health state' and 'best health state imaginable'. Scores are recorded in millimeters with a total range of 0-100 millimeters.</description>

    <description>SF-12 is a simplified version of SF-36. SF-12 assesses health-related quality of life (HRQoL) across 8 domains with 1-2 items per domain: physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. Higher scores indicate better HRQoL.</description>
