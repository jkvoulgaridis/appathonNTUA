    <textblock>
      This is an open label, single-arm, multi-center, phase 2 Study of SHR-1210 in
      recurrent/metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma(R/M NPC) patients who have received previous at
      least two lines of chemotherapy.

    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this phase 2 study is to assess objective response rate of SHR-1210
      in patients with R/M NPC. The secondary objective is to observe the duration of response,
      progression free survival, time to response, overall survival and safety of SHR-1210 in R/M
      NPC. ADA is also investigated.
