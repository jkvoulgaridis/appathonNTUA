      The objective of this Named Patient Program (NPP) is to provide continued availability of
      Certolizumab Pegol (CZP) to adult Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) patients who participated in the
      open label studies C87015 (CDP870 015), C87028 (CDP870-028) and C87051 (CDP870-051).
      Physicians may use the option to continue offering patients CZP treatment or to transition
      patients off CZP to a standard care regimen.
