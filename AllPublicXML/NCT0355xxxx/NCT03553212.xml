    <textblock>
      Feasibility trial of twice high dose radiotherapy using Tomotherapy in patients with organ
      confined Prostate Cancer histologically proven. The study involves 2 steps:

      A) Assessment of safety as proportion of patients with acute ≥G3 Genito-urinary (GU) and
      Gastro-intestinal (GI) side effects on the first 16 enrolled patients; B) evaluation of
      primary and secondary objectives on overall patients.

      Twice High dose external beam Radiotherapy by Image-guided tomotherapy for organ-confined
      Prostate cancer treatment emulating HDR brachytherapy:

      Feasibility trial of twice high dose radiotherapy using Tomotherapy in patients with organ
      confined Prostate Cancer histologically proven. The study involves 2 steps:

      A) Assessment of safety as proportion of patients with acute ≥G3 Genito-urinary (GU) and
      Gastro-intestinal (GI) side effects on the first 16 enrolled patients; B) evaluation of
      primary and secondary objectives on overall patients. Thirty-one patients will be enrolled,
      with histologically confirmed very low , low and intermediate risk prostate cancer following
      the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) risk categories guidelines. Patient should
      not be eligible to prostatectomy or patient's should refuse to undergo surgery.

      Prescription dose to the target: 20-23 Gy in 2 fractions on the whole prostate gland +/-
      seminal vesicles and 24-27 Gy in 2 fractions as simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) on the
      dominant intraprostatic lesion (DIL) 2 weeks in all.
