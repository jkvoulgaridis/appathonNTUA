    <intervention_model_description>This study will be conducted sequentially in two parts
Part 1: Subjects with moderate HI (based on Child-Pugh scores) will be compared to demographically matched subjects with normal renal function
Following review of PK and safety data from Part 1, a decision will be made on which hepatically impaired group (Mild or Severe, based on Child-Pugh scores) will be enrolled in Part 2. If a significant clinical effect is not observed in the moderately impaired group, only Severe HI will be enrolled, otherwise Mild and Severe HI will be enrolled.</intervention_model_description>
