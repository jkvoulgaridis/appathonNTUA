  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Progressive Supranuclear Palsy and related disorders (PRD) are debilitating, costly, and
      understudied conditions. Improving access to comprehensive, specialized, in-home patient care
      offers the potential to minimize the downward spiral of morbidity and preventable healthcare
      utilization. The aim of this study is to test whether and to what degree an interdisciplinary
      home visit program will improve patient- and caregiver-reported outcomes, and to identify
      unmet needs in this population.

      Participants can elect to complete either the Home Visit Arm of the study or the Usual Care
      Arm of the study.

      Home Visit Arm:

      This interdisciplinary home visit program consists of 4 visits to patients' homes over the
      course of one year from a team of a movement disorders doctor, a nurse, a research
      coordinator, and a social worker. The team will come to a patient's home and assess the needs
      of both the patient and caregiver (if present), and connect the patient with any needed
      services. These visits can replace or be in addition to seeing another movement disorders
      doctor.

      Usual Care Arm:

      The information collected from the home visit participants will be compared to data collected
      from participants who elect to complete the usual care arm of the study. These participants
      and their caregivers (if available) will be invited to complete an online version of the
      survey. They will be contacted 12 months after their initial completion of the survey to
      complete a follow-up survey.

    <measure>Change in patient quality of life as measured by the EuroQol 5-D (EQ-5D) scale</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>This scale is a brief, 6-item instrument measuring five specific domains of health-related quality of life (mobility, self-care, activities of daily living, anxiety/depression, pain/discomfort) and overall well-being. Items are scored on a 1-5 scale, with 5 indicating the highest level of perceived problems. Scores at Visits 1 and 4 will be compared.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in caregiver strain as measured by the Multidimensional Caregiver Strain Index (MCSI)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>An 18-item tool measuring 6 dimensions of subjective response to stressors. Subscales include physical strain, social constraints, financial strain, time constraints, interpersonal strain, and elder being demanding/manipulative. Respondents are asked about the frequency with which items apply, ranging from &quot;never&quot; to &quot;all of the time&quot; on a 5 point scale. Higher scores indicate higher levels of caregiver strain. Scores at Visits 1-4 will be compared.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Patient satisfaction with the home visit program as measured by the Client Satisfaction Inventory- Short Form (CSI-SF)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>A 9-item instrument developed within the field of social work to assess client satisfaction with multidisciplinary programs like the home visit program in this study. Each item is scored on a 1-7 scale, with higher scores indicating greater client satisfaction. This measure will be completed at our last home visit (Visit 4).</description>
