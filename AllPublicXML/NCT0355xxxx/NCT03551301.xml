  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to the World Health Organization the population suffering from addiction problems
      is increasing. This population is characterized by multiple needs at the medico-psychosocial
      level. However, some of these patients, a particular subgroup that we are going to be
      interested in the so-called &quot;high need&quot; user group, find it difficult to access and stay in
      outpatient treatment programs. They often present a chaotic use of the health system,
      including a high number of hospitalizations in times of crisis. They also show very low
      utilization of health care services, accompanied by social marginalization. This can be
      related to relapses and poor social functioning. A high number of relapses occur particularly
      at the end of hospitalization. Interventions in the field of addiction, such as Transitional
      Case Management (TCM) should increase the adherence of these patients to treatment by
      accompanying them in the sensitive period following hospitalization. One of the objectives of
      the study is to evaluate the impact of TCM on the number, duration and type of
      hospitalizations, as well as the number of emergency room visits. The investigators will also
      measure the duration until the possible future hospitalization, after the TCM. The secondary
      objectives of this study will be to see the effect of TCM on adherence to outpatient
      treatment. The investigators will focus on the impact of follow-up on the participant's
      medico-psycho-social network, substance use and other psychological variables. The
      investigators will also evaluate his or her psychiatric symptoms and global and social
      functioning. Life satisfaction and satisfaction with the care received will also be measured.
      The investigators will compare the population treated by the TCM with the other users of the
      addiction service who are hospitalized. The study will investigate this through
      questionnaires at the beginning of care, at one month, three months, six months and 12 months
      after the start of TCM management.

    <description>TCM program is a type of very flexible community treatment in terms of frequency and intensity of care. This is facilitated by a small case load ratio per health care professional (1:10). The healthcare workers are specialised in SUD treatment. The intervention begins during hospitalisation and lasts around 4 weeks after discharge from the hospital.
The main aim of this intervention is to accompany the patient in the difficult phase of transition between hospital and outpatient care and ensure their adherence to the treatment program. The healthcare workers will explore specific patient needs and ensure that health and social services are better coordinated to fit their needs. Another important aim is to reduce the number of (unplanned) hospitalizations and emergency room visits.</description>
