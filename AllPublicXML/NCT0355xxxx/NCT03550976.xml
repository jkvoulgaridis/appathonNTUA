  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of gestational diabetes increased.The multidisciplinary management of GDM
      during pregnancy is helpful to improve the pregnancy outcome, but it will occupy huge medical
      resources.Early prediction, diet and exercise interventions can reduce the incidence of
      gestational diabetes, but there is no reliable way to predict and intervene early.This study
      is a randomized controlled trials, and aims to use comprehensive prediction method (genetic
      screening, body composition, clinical risk factors screening) screening the subjects with
      high GDM risk in early pregnancy, conducting diet and exercise intervention in second
      trimester and observing the effect on the incidence of GDM and perinatal outcomes.
