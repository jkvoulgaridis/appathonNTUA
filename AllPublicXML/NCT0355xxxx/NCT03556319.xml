  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test how well people tolerate a new dietary ingredient called
      2-HOBA and how it is metabolized in the body. 2-HOBA is a compound that occurs naturally in
      buckwheat seeds. This dietary ingredient has been used in animal studies, and single doses
      have been tolerated well when given to a small group of healthy people. In this study we will
      test how well people tolerate taking 2-HOBA over 2 weeks and how it is metabolized by the
      body.

      Consenting volunteers between 55 and 79 years old with metabolic syndrome, including males,
      and post-menopausal females will be recruited for the study. Eighteen volunteers will be
      studied with a reasonable sampling of ethnicities from the Nashville area, and an effort will
      be made to recruit equal numbers of males and females. The study will be conducted by the
      Vanderbilt Clinical Research Center (CRC).

      Based upon single dose pharmacokinetics, two multiple dose regimens will be studied to
      determine the safety, accumulation kinetics, and pharmacodynamic effects of multiple daily
      doses administered over 2 weeks. A complete health history and physical examination will be
      conducted by a physician. An EKG, baseline blood and urine sample, and vital signs will be
      taken prior to supplement administration. A physician will oversee all clinical aspects of
      the study and will be responsible for all trial-related medical decisions. Additionally, DNA
      will be collected from the blood drawn and used to determine if there are any genetic
      differences in metabolism of 2-HOBA. Volunteers will be given 3 daily doses of either placebo
      or one of two levels of 2-HOBA to determine the safety, accumulation kinetics, and
      pharmacodynamic effects of the multiple dose administration over a 2 week period.

A computer-generated randomization sequence with a block of size 3 will be used to assign participants at the ratio of 1:2 (placebo:2-HOBA) at each dose level of the treatment. All participants receiving the lower dose regimen will be completed before enrolling participants in the higher dose group.</intervention_model_description>
