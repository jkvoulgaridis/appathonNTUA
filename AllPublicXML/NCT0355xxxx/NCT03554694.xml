  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim is to test if dietary supplementation with prebiotics reduces measures of anxiety in
      healthy human participants with high self-reported levels of anxiety. Study will test for an
      effect on behavioural, neuroendocrine and brain imaging markers of anxiety.

    <intervention_model>Crossover Assignment</intervention_model>
    <intervention_model_description>Crossover Assignment Randomised Double-blind Cross-over design with 4-6 weeks of prebiotics intervention and 4-6 weeks of placebo intervention. The first intervention phase will be followed by a 3 week wash-out period prior to the second intervention phase.d.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Double (Participant, Investigator)</masking>
    <masking_description>Both intervention and placebo products are similar in colour, texture, and taste. A third party, independent of the daya-to-day research coordinator, will randomise treatments.</masking_description>
  </study_design_info>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cortisol awakening response (CAR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Cortisol awakening responses will be measured at the end of the first intervention phase (4-6 weeks after study entry) and at the end of the second intervention phase (11-15 weeks post study entry).</time_frame>
    <description>CAR, a marker of stress responsivity, should be decreased after taking prebiotics compared to placebo (as previously found in non-anxious participants in Schmidt et al., 2015, Psychopharmacology)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Brain imaging (BOLD fMRI activity) in amygdala and cortical regions</measure>
    <time_frame>Brain imaging will be measured at the end of the first intervention phase (4-6 weeks after study entry) and at the end of the second intervention phase (11-15 weeks post study entry).</time_frame>
    <description>Brain imaging (BOLD fMRI activity) in amygdala and cortical regions Will provide neural measures of threat reactivity. We predict decreased amygdala and/or increased parietal-prefrontal brain activity after prebiotics compared to placebo, indicating an anxiolytic-like profile (fearful -neutral face trials in the low load condition) (as in Bishop et al, 2007 and Ironside et al, 2017)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in gut microbiome</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes in the microbiome will be measure using a single stool/faecal sample at four time points: baseline (0 weeks), following first intervention (4-6 weeks), following washout (7-9 weeks), and following the second intervention (11-15 weeks).</time_frame>
    <description>Availability of specific bacteria in microbiome will change as function of prebiotics and not during placebo. The change will be measured at the start of each intervention compared to the end of each intervention</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Trait anxiety levels &gt; 40 on STAI trait inventory

          -  Participant is willing and able to give informed consent for participation in the
             study

          -  Not currently taking any psychoactive medications

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant participants

          -  No contraindications to prebiotic administration

          -  Antibiotic, probiotics and/or prebiotic treatment in at least the two previous months.

          -  Participants who are taking any other food supplements that, in the opinion of the
             Investigators, may affect the results.

          -  Participants who are taking any medications that, in the opinion of the Investigators,
             may affect the results.

          -  Any significant change in diet which, at the discretion of the Investigators, may
             affect the results.

          -  Participants who have recently participated in another research trial which, at the
             discretion of the Investigators, may affect the results.

          -  A history of dementia, traumatic brain injury or stroke.

          -  Anyone who is unable to perform the behavioural tasks.

          -  Current use of any psychoactive medication.

          -  Current use of psychological treatment.

          -  Anyone who does not have adequate understanding of English, sufficient to give
             informed consent.

          -  Any person who has a history of drug abuse or a previous history of a neurological, or
             has a history of neurosurgical procedure is excluded as they may be at increased risk
             of epilepsy and data collected may be influenced by their condition.

          -  Anyone with any metal implants or implantable device would be excluded from any brain
             imaging studies as indicated by the MRI safety screening form.
