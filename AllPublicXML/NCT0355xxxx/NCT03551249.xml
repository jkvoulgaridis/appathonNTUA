  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of the ExAblate Model 4000 Type 2 used as
      a tool to disrupt the BBB (blood brain barrier) in patients with high grade glioma undergoing
      standard of care therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, single-arm study to establish the safety and feasibility
      of BBB (blood brain barrier) disruption along the periphery of tumor resection cavity using
      the ExAblate Neuro Model 4000 Type 2 (220 kHz) system. For this study, patients will be
      eligible to enroll in the study prior to beginning the planned adjuvant TMZ chemotherapy
      phase of treatment. Of note, only patients who are deemed eligible for adjuvant TMZ will be
      eligible for enrollment.
