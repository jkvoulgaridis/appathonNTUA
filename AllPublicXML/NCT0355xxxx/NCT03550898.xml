  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with neurogenic bladder need periodic evaluation with urodynamic study, a invasive
      and uncomfortable procedure.

      Aim: To evaluate the accuracy of dynamic ultrasonography as a feasible and noninvasive
      alternative diagnostic method to identify detrusor overactivity in patients with neurogenic
      bladder
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The urodynamic study and dynamic ultrasonography were performed concurrently, to identify
      detrusor overactivity, in patients with myelomeningocele and clinical indication for
      urodynamics, by investigators without verbal or visual contact.

      The overactivity was diagnosed through active conformational change of the bladder during
      filling phase.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate the accuracy of dynamic ultrasonography to identify bladder overactivity in neurogenic bladder.</measure>
    <time_frame>20 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Dynamic Ultrasonography evaluated the dynamic conformational change of the bladder to identify the presence of detrusor overactivity, based on a subjective graduation of contractions, compared to the urodynamic data.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate the accuracy of dynamic ultrasonography to identify maximum cystometric capacity.</measure>
    <time_frame>20 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The bladder maximum capacity was measured at the end of the filling phase, based on the ellipse formula and compared to the infused volume in urodynamics.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To assess the ability of dynamic ultrasonography to estimate the pressure of detrusor contractions.</measure>
    <time_frame>20 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>According to the detrusor mobility and bladder deformity, the contractions were graded: 1 - no contractions; 2 - partial contraction of bladder floor; 3 - partial contraction of bladder floor and posterior wall; 4 - generalized contraction with modification of bladder shape from ellipsoid to round. These data were compared to the maximum pressure data recorded in the urodynamic study.</description>
