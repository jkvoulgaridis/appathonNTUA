  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this pilot study is to investigate whether psilocybin alters
      neuroplasticity in people with major depressive disorder. The primary hypothesis is that
      psilocybin will result in neuroplastic changes that parallel improvement in symptoms of
      depression.

      In this placebo-controlled, blinded study, individuals with depression will participate in 2
      experimental sessions approximately 4 weeks apart during which they will receive two of the
      following three interventions: 1) placebo, 2) low dose psilocybin (0.1 mg/kg), and 3) medium
      dose psilocybin (0.3 mg/kg).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in electrical brain activity associated with neuroplasticity measured by Electroencephalography (EEG)</measure>
    <time_frame>One day and two weeks after each experimental session</time_frame>
    <description>An auditory Long Term Potentiation (LTP) task will assess changes in neuronal plasticity. For the EEG task, the outcome measures will include event-related potential (ERP) amplitude and latency, and time x frequency measures (i.e. spectral power, inter-trial coherence, and cross-frequency coupling).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in verbal memory</measure>
    <time_frame>One day and two weeks after each experimental session</time_frame>
    <description>This will be measured by a modified computer version of the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), administered while EEG data is collected.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in electrical brain activity associated with emotion processing</measure>
    <time_frame>One day and two weeks after each experimental session</time_frame>
    <description>This will be measured by an affective go/no task and electroencephalography. Outcome measures will include event-related potential (ERP) amplitude and latency, and time x frequency measures (i.e. spectral power, inter-trial coherence, and cross-frequency coupling).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in mood symptoms using the GRID-Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (GRID-HAM-D)</measure>
    <time_frame>Four weeks before the initiation of testing, the day before and after each experimental session, and one and two weeks after each experimental session.</time_frame>
    <description>The GRID-Hamilton Depression Rating Scale is a clinician-administered rating scale designed to assess severity of depressive symptoms. It includes 17 items, nine of which are scored on 5-point scale, and eight of which are scored on a three-point scale. The score range for the GRID-HAMD is 0 to 52, with higher score indicating more severe depression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in mood symptoms using the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (QIDS-SR16)</measure>
    <time_frame>Four weeks before the initiation of testing, the day before and after each experimental session, one and two weeks after each experimental session, then monthly for three months after the last experimental session.</time_frame>
    <description>The QIDS-SR16 is a 16-item self-reported rating scale designed to assess severity of depressive symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in blood pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured during each test session prior to drug administration, every 30 min for the first two and then hourly for 4 hours or until resolution of psychedelic effects (~6 hours post drug)</time_frame>
    <description>Maximum change from baseline during each test day (mmHg)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in heart rate</measure>

    <measure>Change in peripheral oxygenation</measure>
