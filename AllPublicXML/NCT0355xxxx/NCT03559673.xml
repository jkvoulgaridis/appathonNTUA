    <textblock>
      The objective of this Compassionate Use Program (CUP) is to provide continued access to
      Lacosamide (LCM) for monotherapy use for patients who were receiving LCM in SP0993 and SP0994
      at the time of study unblinding and close of SP0994, and who benefited from the treatment per
      investigator assessment.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has completed the Termination Visit of SP0994 and has been treated with
             Lacosamide (LCM) monotherapy

          -  Patient is expected to benefit from participation in the Compassionate Use Program
             (CUP) with LCM monotherapy, in the opinion of the treating physician

          -  Patient is willing and able to comply with all program requirements

          -  Patient is informed of the details of this CUP, is given ample time and opportunity to
             ask questions and consider his/her participation in this CUP, and the patient or the
             legally authorized representative (LAR) has provided verbal consent to participate,
             and, if applicable to local regulations, has given written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is receiving any investigational drugs or using any experimental devices in
             addition to LCM

          -  For countries where LCM is reimbursed: Patient requires another anti-epileptic drug
             (AED) for the treatment of seizures For countries where LCM is not reimbursed (or
             conditionally reimbursed: Belgium, Australia e.g.): Patient requires another AED for
             the treatment of seizures and qualifies for commercial LCM (and LCM is being
             reimbursed)

          -  Patient experienced emergence of a seizure type other than partial-onset or
             generalized tonic-clonic seizures, or occurrence of status epilepticus

          -  Patient developed second- or third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block or another
             clinically relevant change in medical condition (or electrocardiogram (ECG) or
             laboratory parameter)

          -  Patient having liver function test (LFT) results of transaminases (aspartate
             aminotransferase [AST] and/or alanine aminotransferase [ALT]) ≥3×ULN to &lt;5×upper limit
             of normal (ULN)

          -  Patient has actual suicidal ideation or behavior

          -  Patient is experiencing an ongoing serious adverse event (SAE) and there is no
             expected benefit for him/her to continue on LCM treatment

          -  Female patient who is pregnant or nursing, and/or a woman of childbearing potential
             who is not surgically sterile, 2 year postmenopausal or does not practice one highly
             effective method of contraception (according to ICH guidance defined as those that
             result in a failure rate of less than 1 % per year when used consistently and
             correctly), unless sexually abstinent, for the duration of the study

          -  Patient was treated with carbamazepine controlled release (CBZ-CR) in SP0994
