  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bladder dysfunction is one of the most important factors influencing duration and quality of
      life in children with spinal cord injury. Effective bladder control comprises a major aspect
      of a child's life with SCI and is especially challenging due to the rapid changes in a
      child's physical and cognitive development. Urological consequences secondary to a neurogenic
      bladder are responsible for many clinical complications post-spinal cord injury, including
      repeated urinary tract infections, autonomic dysreflexia, lifelong urologic care, and many
      hospitalizations. Alternative approaches to bladder management that focus on recovery of
      function and age-appropriate independence are needed. Prior research findings in our lab in
      adult participants indicate a benefit of locomotor training on bladder function. The purpose
      of this study is to determine with quantitative unbiased urodynamic outcome measures if
      locomotor training, provided to children with spinal cord injury, impacts the developing
      urinary system.

      Our overall hypothesis is that spinal cord injury-induced bladder dysfunction, facilitated by
      the loss of supra-spinal connections and subsequent alterations of the lumbosacral circuitry,
      can be ameliorated through activity-based therapy that regulates the state of
      detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia and normalizes release of neurotrophic factors known to
      contribute to bladder hyper-reflexia. The primary study aim is to determine the effects of
      weight-bearing task-specific training for locomotion (stepping on a treadmill) after
      incomplete and complete spinal cord injury in children on bladder storage, voiding,
      biomarkers, and quality of life (parent-reported during baseline and exit interview). A
      secondary aim is to develop a scale for classifying bladder recovery after spinal cord injury
      based either on the pattern of storage and voiding prior to injury (if the child had bladder
      control prior to injury) or on established patterns of micturition development (if the child
      was injured prior to experiencing bladder control).

        Children, 2 to 18 years old, who sustained an upper motor neuron spinal cord injury and are
        medically approved for enrollment in an outpatient, standardized locomotor training program
        at the University of Louisville (either clinic or research-based) are eligible for
        participation. Each participant will serve as his/her own control reducing the variability
        among individuals related to the injury itself, time since injury, medications taken,
        therapies received, differences in degree of bladder dysfunction, capacity to independently
        void prior to injury, and many other factors that cannot be controlled in the human
        experience.
