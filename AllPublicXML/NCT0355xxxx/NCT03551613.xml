      Fifty infants and children of both sexes, aged 6 months to 3 years, with malnutrition were
      consecutively recruited from the Nutrition Clinic of the Pediatric Hospital, Ain Shams
      University.

      These patients were randomly assigned following a simple randomization procedure
      (computerized random numbers) to either the honey group (group 1) or the malnourished control
      group (group 2) with a 1:1 allocation ratio. Each group consisted of 25 patients.

      An additional 25 healthy infants and children with the same age range and of both sexes were
      recruited from the outpatient pediatric clinic of Ain Shams University, Egypt as a healthy
      control group (group 3).

      The inclusion criteria was in whom the under nutrition is caused by inadequate energy intake,
      while the exclusion criteria included markedly ill patients, and children with chronic or
      severe systemic illness or malabsorption disorders, chromosomal aberrations, inborn errors of
      metabolism and cerebral palsy.

      History taking with special emphasis on the dietetic history, history of any disease that
      might interfere with the nutrient intake or their use by the body and history of any acute or
      chronic illness. And full body Examination which include anthropometric measurements weight,
      height and mid arm circumference.

      Each patient in the intervention group or honey group or group 1 took oral honey in a dose of
      2ml/kg/day for 8 weeks; the calculated dose of honey was dissolved in water with a ratio of
      1: 3, respectively, and then ingested by the patient before breakfast.
