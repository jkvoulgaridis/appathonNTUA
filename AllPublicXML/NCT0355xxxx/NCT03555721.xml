  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to correlate the results from a standard of care biopsy with
      CytID™ and hpvID™ swab tests for potentially premalignant and malignant oral lesions. The
      biopsy is considered standard of care and will be performed regardless of the patient's
      enrollment in the study. The study-related data gathering will not influence the treatment
      decisions of the clinician.

    <description>CytID™ is an adjunctive process that is a noninvasive, pain-free, chair-side procedure for assessment of suspicious oral cavity lesions using a brush swab. The test is based on an objective measure of gross changes in the nuclear DNA content of oral epithelial cells; thereby, providing information about the pre-cancerous or cancerous state of a lesion.</description>

    <description>hpvID™ testing can detect all major HPV types and shows the current HPV status of the patient. This provides additional clinical information to correlate and compare hpvID™ trends with routine standard of care biopsy or cytology results.</description>
