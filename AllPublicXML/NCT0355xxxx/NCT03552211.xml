    <textblock>
      Background: High dose biotin is a therapeutic option for French progressive Multiple
      Sclerosis (MS) patients, without relapse for at least one year, since June 1, 2016. Despite
      the inflammatory activity of progressive forms of MS is known to be low, several publications
      mentioned clinical and/or radiological activity for biotin-treated patients.

      Objectives:

        1. To determine if high dose biotin increase the clinical inflammatory activity of patients
           with a progressive form of MS.

        2. To compare the clinical characteristics of the relapses that occurred with biotin or
           not.

        3. To describe the characteristics of the patients with a clinical inflammatory activity
           with biotin.

      Methods: This is a national, academic, observational and retrospective study comparing one
      group of progressive MS patients with high dose biotin to another group without this
      treatment using a propensity score, in intention to treat. The main judgment criterion is the
      annualized relapse rate (ARR) from the beginning of the biotin to the last evaluation
      available before the data extraction. A Student's t test will be used. A negative binomial
      modelling with relapses counting over a period of exposure and taking into account the inter
      and intra center variability will be used. The statistical tests will be adapted to the
      nature of the variables concerning the secondary judgment criteria.

      Expected results: This French national study will provide a better knowledge of the
      inflammatory activity of the progressive forms of MS treated with high dose biotin. If an
      increased clinical inflammatory activity is highlighted with biotin a prospective study will
      be necessary to confirm the result before a specific information of the scientific community
      and the patients about this risk or even an amendment of prescription rules in order to
      secure the use of the product. On the contrary, the absence of increased risk of clinical
      inflammatory activity with biotin would help to reassure the prescriber and the patient about
      the innocuity of the treatment.

      Investigators are going to recruit retrospectively all the patients treated with biotin since
      the product is available in France, in all French MS centers that agree to participate
      (maximum 30). They are going to collect through medical records, demographic data (as age,
      gender, MS center localization), but also data about the disease (as MS duration, primary
      progressive or secondary progressive MS), data about disability (with several Expanded
      Disability Status Scale -EDSS- scores at different time points) and data about treatments (as
      duration of biotin, existence of other concomitant disease-modifying therapy). For
      comparison, a control group without biotin is going also to be recruited from the European
      Database for Multiple Sclerosis (EDMUS). The same data as described above are going to be
      collected for the controls.
