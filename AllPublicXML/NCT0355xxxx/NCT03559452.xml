  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Limb injury generally requires a period of recovery during which time the limb is often
      immobilised (e.g. with a cast or brace) resulting in a rapid loss of skeletal muscle. Despite
      the importance of muscle loss during injury, our understanding of how it occurs is
      incomplete. Several factors are likely to contribute, including a lack of muscle contraction
      and injury induced inflammation. In this study, the investigators will recruit healthy
      volunteers who will spend 7 days in a knee brace to replicate leg immobilisation. Prior to
      immobilisation, half of the participants will perform a single session of strenuous
      resistance exercise which is known to cause muscle damage and initiate an inflammatory
      response. This is designed to replicate the muscle damage and inflammation that occurs with
      injury. The remaining half of participants will not perform this exercise, allowing us to
      look at the additive effect of muscle damage and inflammation on muscle loss with
      immobilisation.
