  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has previously been shown in healthy subjects, that a carbonated water containing a mix of
      amino acids and chromium picolinate can decrease postprandial blood glucose. Based on these
      findings, a flavored sparkling water product called Good Idea® with a proprietary blend of
      five amino acids and chromium picolinate has been developed. This product, along with an
      identical placebo, are included in this study to evaluate the effects on postprandial blood
      glucose in healthy, overweight adults when consumed with a standardized, high glycemic test
      meal. The study will be conducted in a cross-over design, double-blinded and placebo
      controlled, including 45 participants. The primary endpoint of the study is the incremental
      area under the curve (iAUC) for capillary blood glucose within 180 minutes after ingestion of
      the meal.
