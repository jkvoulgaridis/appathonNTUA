  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Imaging of chest disorders is mainly achieved by using computed tomography. This is
      especially the case for detection, morphologic assessment and followup of pulmonary nodules.
      A positron emission tomography (PET) /CT may be additionally required for lung nodule
      management in some conditions including a size greater than 8 mm with morphologic or growing
      characteristics suspicious of malignancy. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) represents however
      an interesting alternative diagnostic radiation-free method, in particular owing to the
      recent development of sequences dedicated to lung parenchyma analysis. A major limitation
      remains the control of respiratory artefacts.

      High Frequency non-invasive ventilation, HF-NIV, has the potential to allow chest
      stabilization and is currently used in the department of radio-oncology at the Lausanne
      University Hospital. It has been recently applied to perform MRI and PET examinations at end
      inspiration during an &quot;apnea &quot; generated by the system. Continuous periods of respiratory
      stabilization of several minutes at end-inspiration are thus obtained, allowing prolonged MR
      and PET acquisitions with improvement of image quality as observed in our preliminary studies
      (Beigelman-Aubry et al., Prior et al.). Interestingly, the lung volume explored by using this
      ventilation technique is similar to that of CT studies, conversely to respiratory gated MR
      sequences which are currently performed at end-expiration, this potentially generating
      underevaluation of lung disorders especially at lung bases.

      The present project aims to determine the impact of HF-NIV in the management of patients with
      pulmonary nodule(s). After a first step of optimization of acquisition parameters of
      HF-NIV-MR in healthy volunteers, the performances of MRI and PET/CT (when required) under
      this ventilation technique will be compared to the current method(s) of reference in cases of
      pulmonary nodule(s) (CT scan and PET when required) and histological data when available. All
      MRI and PET/CT (when required) acquisitions will be performed without the ventilation
      technique, as used in current practice, and with it.

      The project was completed with an amendment to investigate MRI under continuous positive
      airway pressure (CPAP). The MR-CPAP combination will be evaluated with optimized parameters
      in healthy volunteers and compared to free-breathing acquisitions without any device.
