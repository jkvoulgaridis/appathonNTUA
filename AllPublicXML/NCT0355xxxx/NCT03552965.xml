  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study to evaluate the quality of life and amount of dry mouth experienced
      as a result of radiotherapy in subjects who have squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck
      (HN-SQCC). This study will compare the side effects experienced based on the method to plan
      radiotherapy, Margin Based or Robust.

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized pilot clinical trial, stratified by primary tumor site, to
      evaluate the degree of xerostomia and quality of life (QOL) in subjects with HN-SQCC treated
      with radiation therapy under margin-based and robust radiotherapy treatment plans.
      Margin-based plans will use both biological (biological optimization) and physical objectives
      whereas robust planning will use physical objectives for sparing of the parotid glands.
      Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and standard chemotherapy will be used. QOL
      (quality of life) will be measured using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment
      of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ)-C30 questionnaire and EORTC QLQ-H&amp;N35
      (head and neck) module before radiotherapy (baseline) and then 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after
      radiotherapy. Xerostomia will be measured in study subjects using two patient-reported
      scoring systems completed by each subject before radiotherapy and then 3, 6, 9, and 12 months
      after radiotherapy: Late Effects Normal Tissue Task Force (LENT)-Subjective, Objective,
      Management, Analytic (SOMA) LENT/SOMA grading system and the University of Michigan's
      Xerostomia Questionnaire (XQ). The data collected by this randomized pilot clinical trial
      will be used to inform the design of, and decision-making for, future larger studies that
      seek to compare different methods of radiotherapy planning in the treatment of HN-SQCC.

    <description>Self reported dry mouth using University of Michigan's Xerostomia Questionnaire (XQ). This questionnaire has 8 questions that measure the degree to which xerostomia is affecting quality of life. Patients rate each item on a scale from 0 to 10. Higher score denotes worse xerostomia. To analyze the XQ, scores on its 8 items will be summed for each subject at each time point to produce an overall XQ score whose values theoretically can range from 0 to 80; it will be treated as a continuous variable. Lower values indicate a more favorable outcome than higher values.</description>
