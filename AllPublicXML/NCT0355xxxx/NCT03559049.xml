    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-center, Phase I/II, single arm trial to assess the safety and efficacy
      of the combination of oral rucaparib plus intravenous pembrolizumab as maintenance therapy in
      patients with stage IV non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) without progressive
      disease (PD), as confirmed on CT scans, after induction therapy with
      carboplatin/pemetrexed/pembrolizumab (CPP) triplet therapy.

    <description>The primary endpoint is median progression free survival (PFS) which is defined as the median duration of time from the start of treatment to progression. Progression is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started, or the appearance of one or more new lesions.</description>

    <description>All patients will receive induction therapy with Pembrolizumab (200mg IV on day 1 of every 21 days), Pemetrexed (500mg/m^2 IV on day 1 of every 21 days), and Carboplatin (AUC5 IV on day 1 of every 21 days).
This will be followed by maintenance therapy with Pembrolizumab (200mg IV on day 1 of every 21 days) and Rucaparib (600mg PO BID days 1-21 of each 21 day cycle).</description>
