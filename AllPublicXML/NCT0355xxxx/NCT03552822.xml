  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocols have been proven to be very successful in
      specific patient populations. An example is with ERAS for colorectal surgery. ERAS protocols
      in this patient population have been shown to reduce overall morbidity and hospital length of
      stay (LOS). At the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), the institution has had
      successful implementation of ERAS protocols for several surgical specialties including
      colorectal, breast, spine, gynecology, and gynecology-oncology. However, the institution
      currently does not have a protocol in place for the most commonly performed surgical
      procedure - cesarean delivery. At UAB, the institution performs approximately 1,000 cesarean
      deliveries per year.

      The investigators believe that an ERAS protocol will be beneficial for these patients.
      Currently, there is very little data published on ERAS protocols. Although this patient
      population is ideal for an ERAS protocol, there are several barriers that have to be
      overcome. The data published show promising results for ERAS protocols with cesarean
      delivery. A larger tertiary care center showed earlier discharge with lower re-admission
      rates with an ERAS pathway.

      Currently, the investigators have created a multidisciplinary group at UAB to establish an
      ERAS protocol for patients undergoing cesarean delivery. This group includes
      anesthesiologists, obstetricians, nursing, neonatology, pharmacy, and informatics. Once the
      investigators have implemented this protocol, the investigators would like to perform a
      retrospective analysis to determine if there are any significant changes in our desired
      outcomes the investigators will study. Our goal is to demonstrate significantly improved
      outcomes in the investigators' measured endpoints. The investigators believe that this
      information will be very useful because although there is a national interest in creating
      ERAS protocols for cesarean deliveries, there currently is very little published on the
      subject. The investigators would like to publish the investigators' results and protocol as a
      resource for other institutions to adopt.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are implementing an enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocol for
      patients undergoing cesarean delivery. The purpose of the ERAS protocol is to optimize care
      provided to patients (patient education, nutrition, pain management, early ambulation, etc.).
      The anticipated date of protocol initiation is May 2018. Once this protocol has been in place
      for approximately 6 months to one year, the investigators would like to retrospectively
      review data on these patients and compare outcomes to a similarly-matched group of patients
      the year preceding protocol implementation. Specific outcomes the investigators will assess
      are: hospital length of stay, post-operative pain scores, opioid consumption, patient
      satisfaction [through IRB-approved survey (protocol X300001121)], surgical site infection
      rates, readmission rates, and unscheduled clinic and maternal evaluation unit (MEU) visits
      before the first scheduled postpartum visit. The investigators also plan to track compliance
      monthly with the adherence to the protocol. Since the investigators want to track compliance
      (both as a quality improvement project as well as research), the investigators are requesting
      (Institutional Review Board) IRB approval now.

    <description>Measurement of pain score post-cesarian section will be obtained using clinical data gathered by the care team providing routine clinical care, and asking routine pain score questions. The scale used is the standard 1-10 pain scale, with 1 being no pain or very mild discomfort, and 10 being very severe pain. Thus, higher values indicate a worse outcome.</description>
