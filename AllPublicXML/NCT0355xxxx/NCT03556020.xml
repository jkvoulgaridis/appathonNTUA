  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, controlled, Phase 2 study to assess the
      safety, tolerability, and efficacy of PB1046 at the optimally titrated dose after 16 weeks of
      treatment. Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to one of two parallel dose groups: a)
      high-dose group where PB1046 will be up-titrated from a 0.2 mg/kg minimally effective
      starting dose to a target high dose level of at least 1.2 mg/kg or higher to a maximally
      tolerated dose (MTD), or b) a low-dose group that will start at 0.2 mg/kg and remain at this
      minimally effective dose (MED) level with sham up-titration. The total treatment period will
      be comprised of 2 phases: 1) an initial 10 week dose titration phase in which weekly doses of
      PB1046 will be titrated (or sham titrated) up to a target dose level of at least 1.2 mg/kg or
      higher to the MTD, and 2) a maintenance of treatment phase that begins when subjects reach
      week 11 and continues for 6 weeks during which no further up-titration should occur.

  <detailed_description>

      The primary safety and tolerability objectives will be assessed by investigating the
      incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs) as well as changes from baseline in vital
      signs, laboratory parameters, ECGs and their relationship to PB1046. The primary efficacy
      objective will be assessed by investigating the change in PVR derived from right heart
      catheterization (RHC). Secondary efficacy objectives will be assessed by investigating the
      impact of PB1046 on change from baseline in 6 minute walk distance (6MWD) test and NT-proBNP,
      a prognostic biomarker for PAH, in the two groups (comparing the MTD and MED groups) at the
      end of the treatment period. In addition, the effect of PB1046 on other cardiopulmonary
      hemodynamic parameters (e.g. CI, mPAP, mRAP, wedge pressure and SvO2) as measured by RHC will
      be assessed. Changes in BDI, HRQoL, and NYHA/WHO (New York Heart Association/World Health
      Organization) FC will also be assessed.

      An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will periodically assess safety, efficacy
      and biomarker data to independently assess the overall safety profile of PB1046, to help
      adjudicate potential dose-limiting toxicities, and to monitor the overall benefit risk
      profile of PB1046 during the study. The DSMB will review the safety and tolerability data
      after the first 10 subjects while recruitment is ongoing.
