  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with ulnar impingement are often coexisting with patients with distal ulnar and
      ulnar joints with a type of sigmoid notch, and ulnar shortening surgery is one of the most
      useful and long-lasting treatments for the treatment of ulnar impingement. Some theories
      point out that if ulnar shortening surgery is performed on patients with distal oblique ulnar
      incisional ulnar joints, it may lead to accelerated degeneration of distal ulna and ulna
      articular joints, resulting in worse wrist function. Some theories have pointed out this
      Instead, surgery will cause joint remodeling and adaptation, but no long-term studies have
      confirmed this. Therefore, this study plans to evaluate the long-term radiological and
      clinical outcomes of ulnar shortening surgery performed on patients with preexisting inverted
      sigmoid notch to determine whether this surgery will cause accelerated distal degeneration of
      the phalangeal joints or Reshaping of joints and clinically corresponding changes in results.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The distal ulnar joint of the wrist contains a patient with an inverted sigmoid notch
             of the sacrum, and the ulnar impaction causes ulnar wrist pain. Therefore, the ulnar
             shortening surgery is accepted.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with diagnosed diseases of immune rheumatism, patients with ischemic necrosis
             of the carpus, patients with this lesion caused by infection or tumor.
