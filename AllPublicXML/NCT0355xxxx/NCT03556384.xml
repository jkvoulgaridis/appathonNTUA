      FDA-approved products for patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST include therapies
      such as imatinib and sunitinib. Although there are FDA-approved products for the treatment of
      advanced/metastatic GIST, these therapies are known to be ineffective in the
      SDH-mutant/deficient subtype and no known effective therapies exist.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate SDH-Mutant/Deficient Gastrointestinal Stromal
      cancer's response to the drug Temozolomide (TMZ) and aim to improve patient outcomes.

      Temozolomide is approved by the FDA for the treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastoma
      multiforme (GBM) and refractory anaplastic astrocytoma cancers.

      Temozolomide is considered experimental because it is not approved by the FDA for the
      treatment of SDH-Mutant/Deficient Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor.

      This oncology study will be a phase 2 study for patients with advanced or metastatic GIST.
      This study will determine overall response rate at 6 months for TMZ therapy in patients with
      SDH-mutant/deficient GIST.

      Treatment will continue for 6 months (with option to continue if benefiting treatment) or
      until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (whichever occurs first). All patients
      will have regular evaluations for assessment of safety parameters. Temozolomide dose may be
      held and/or modified for the management of adverse treatment effects according to
      pre-specified criteria. Patients will have radiographic imaging (CT or MRI) every 8 weeks to
      assess tumor resection.

      An end of treatment visit for clinical evaluations and safety assessments will be performed
      approximately 28 days (7 days) after the last dose of study drug. Patients discontinuing
      study treatment will be followed every 3-6 months for disease recurrence and survival.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient has pathologically confirmed SDH-mutant/deficient GIST.

          2. Has recovered from the acute toxic effects of all prior chemotherapy, immunotherapy,
             or radiotherapy.

          3. Patient has an ECOG Performance Status of 0-2.

             of contraception starting with the first dose of study therapy through 120 days after
             the last dose of study therapy.

          8. Has measurable or evaluable disease as per RECIST v1.1 (Appendix B).

             treatment.

          3. Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.

          4. Evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic diseases [e.g., unstable or uncompensated
             respiratory, cardiac (including life threatening arrhythmias)].

          5. Unresolved toxicity ≥ CTCAE Grade 2 from previous anti-cancer therapy except alopecia

          7. Pregnant or breast-feeding females.

          8. Medical condition such as uncontrolled infection (including HIV), uncontrolled
             diabetes mellitus or cardiac disease which, in the opinion of the treating physician,
             would make this protocol unreasonably hazardous for the patient.

          9. Any concurrent condition which in the investigator's opinion makes it undesirable for
             the subject to participate in this trial or which would jeopardize compliance with the
             protocol.

         10. Patients who cannot swallow oral formulations of the agent
