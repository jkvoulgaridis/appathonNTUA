    <textblock>
      Single arm, multicenter, open-label Phase II study of the effects of parenteral testosterone
      in combination with nivolumab in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who
      previously progressed on at least one novel androgen-receptor targeted therapy (i.e.
      Abiraterone acetate, Enzalutamide). Up to one taxane agent is permitted.

      The trial will enroll up to 44 participants. Eligible participants will continue on androgen
      ablative therapy with a GnRH analogue (i.e. Zoladex, Trelstar, Eligard, or Lupron) if they
      have not undergone orchiectomy. Following enrollment, participants will receive an
      intramuscular injection of testosterone cypionate 400mg every 4 weeks for a lead-in period of
      12 weeks. After the lead-in period, all participants will be treated with nivolumab 480mg IV
      every 4 weeks and maintained on testosterone cypionate 400mg IM every 4 weeks. Assessments
      for response to testosterone + nivolumab will be performed approximately every 3 months.
      Treatment [with a minimum drug exposure of 12 weeks] will be continued until PSA progression
      (Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 [PCWG3] criteria) or clinical/radiographic progression
      (whichever comes first), or until unmanageable toxicity requiring drug cessation.

             put the patient at risk from therapy with testosterone (e.g. femoral metastases with
             concern over fracture risk, severe and extensive spinal metastases with concern over
             spinal cord compression, extensive liver metastases).

          -  Concurrent use of other anticancer agents or treatments, with the following
             exceptions:

             metastases. Subjects with brain metastases are eligible if metastases have been
             treated and there is no magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence of progression for
             at least 4 weeks after treatment is complete and within 28 days prior to the first
             dose of testosterone administration. There must also be no requirement for
             immunosuppressive doses of systemic corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg/day prednisone
             equivalents) for at least 2 weeks prior to study drug administration.

          -  Patients should be excluded if they have an active, known or suspected autoimmune
             disease (e.g. inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune hepatitis,
             lupus, celiac disease). Subjects are permitted to enroll if they have vitiligo, type I
             diabetes mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune condition only requiring

          -  Patients should be excluded if they have a condition requiring systemic treatment with
             either corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other
             immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of study drug administration. Inhaled or
             topical steroids and adrenal replacement doses &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents
             are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease.

          -  Permitted therapies include topical, ocular, intra-articular, intranasal, and
             inhalational corticosteroids (with minimal systemic absorption). Physiologic
             replacement doses of systemic corticosteroids are permitted, even if &gt; 10 mg/day
             prednisone equivalents. A brief course of corticosteroids for prophylaxis (e.g.
             contrast dye allergy) or for treatment of non-autoimmune conditions (e.g. delayed-type
             hypersensitivity reaction caused by contact allergen) is permitted.

          -  As there is potential for hepatic toxicity with nivolumab, drugs with a predisposition
             to hepatotoxicity should be used with caution in patients treated with
             nivolumab-containing regimen.

          -  Patients should be excluded if they have a positive test for hepatitis B virus surface
             antigen (HBV sAg) or hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV antibody) indicating
             acute or chronic infection.

          -  Patients should be excluded if they have known history of testing positive for human
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or known acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).

          -  History of severe hypersensitivity reaction to any monoclonal antibody.

          -  Other primary tumor (other than CRPC) including hematological malignancy present
             within the last 5 years (except non-melanoma skin cancer or low-grade superficial
             bladder cancer).

          -  Has imminent or established spinal cord compression based on clinical findings and/or
             MRI.

          -  Any other serious illness or medical condition that would, in the opinion of the
             investigator, make this protocol unreasonably hazardous, including, but not limited
             to:

               -  Any uncontrolled major infection.

               -  Cardiac failure New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV.

               -  Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis.

               -  Known allergy to any of the compounds under investigation.

               -  Unmanageable fecal incontinence.

          -  Persistent toxicities (&gt; CTCAE Grade 2) caused by previous cancer therapy, excluding
             alopecia.

          -  Poor medical risk due to a serious, uncontrolled medical disorder, non-malignant
             systemic disease or active, uncontrolled infection. Examples include, but are not
             limited to, uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia, recent (within 6 months) myocardial
             infarction, uncontrolled major seizure disorder, extensive interstitial bilateral lung
             disease, or any psychiatric disorder that prohibits obtaining informed consent.
