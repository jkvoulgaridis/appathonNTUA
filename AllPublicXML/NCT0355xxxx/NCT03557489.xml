  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In surgical patients, prevention of pressure injury is a challenge because of the high risk
      for multiple comorbid conditions, hemodynamic instability, and long duration of immobility.

      The objectives of our study is to compare the difference in incidence rates of sacral
      pressure injury in surgical patients with supine position more than 3 hours between those
      treated with usual preventive care and a sacral foam pad versus a control group receiving
      usual care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of pressure injury in surgical patients about 12% to 45%, though these patients
      were treated with &quot;gel pad&quot; as routine. Based on the nutritional status of patients,
      long-term surgery, surgical posture, and anesthesia-induced hypotension, pressure injury
      still occurred. Sacral foam pad (Mepilex(®) Border Sacrum) is an unique 5-layer design, was
      designed to protect sacral pressure injury. In this study, we enrolled surgical patients who
      need to supine over ≧ 3 hours to evalute the effectiveness of sacral foam pad in preventing
      sacral pressure injury. The patients will randomized to control and intervention groups, both
      groups recruited 105 patients. In control group, patients use gel pad during surgery; whereas
      patients use gel pad in addition to sacrum foam pad (Mepilex(®) Border Sacrum) in
      intervention group. After surgery, the occurrence and severity of sacral pressure injury was
      evaluated. The results of this study can provide evidence to improve the awareness of
      operating room medical staff on surgical pressure injury, and find out the risk factors in
      avoiding of pressure injury, and offer an effective strategy to enhance the quality of
      surgery throughout the perioperative care.
