    <textblock>
      Mental illness is often severe, chronic and difficult to treat. The sleep disturbance
      commonly experienced by individuals with a severe mental illness reduces capacity to function
      and contributes to key symptoms. This study seeks to collect pilot data on an adapted version
      of the Transdiagnostic Sleep and Circadian intervention (TranS-C). The adapted version will
      be referred to as 'Fitted TranS-C' as it is designed to improve the fit to delivery within
      community mental health centers. 'Fitted' treatments are needed because the context for
      implementation (community setting) typically differs from the original testing context
      (university setting) causing a lack of 'fit' between the setting and evidence based
      treatments.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a 'treatment development' pilot study in which we intended to continue to develop and adapted 'Fitted TranS-C' as we gain experience. At the outset of the study, it involves 4 x 20-30 minute sessions. It utilizes four cross-cutting, 3 core and 1 optional modules from Standard TranS-C. All participants will get the same Fitted Trans-C.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>The acceptability of the intervention to providers will be assessed by the 'Acceptability of Intervention Measure' (AIM)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks (i.e. post-treatment assessment)</time_frame>
    <description>The AIM is a measure of the extent to which the intervention is acceptable to providers. The AIM is comprised of 4 questions rated on a 1 'completely disagree' to 5 'completely agree' scale. The responses to all four qus will be reported along with the summed total score.</description>
