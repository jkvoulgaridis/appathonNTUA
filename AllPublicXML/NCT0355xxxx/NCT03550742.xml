  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open labeled, one-armed real-world study in IBS-patients. All participants will
      receive active treatment for 12 weeks.

      The primary objective of the study is to assess the effect of Human Milk Oligosaccharides
      (HMOs) on bowel function in adults with IBS. Secondary objectives are to evaluate HMOs'
      tolerability, effect on participant reported satisfaction with bowel habits, interference
      with life in general, quality of life, somatic symptoms, and anxiety and depression in all
      patients and subgroups of patients.

      In this trial, a total of 300 adults (at least 18 years of age) diagnosed with irritable
      bowel syndrome (IBS) in accordance with the Rome IV criteria will be included. Patients will
      be recruited from gastroenterologists and primary care clinics across the USA. The study
      product, Fuco-N-Tetraose, will be taken daily throughout the course of the trial. All data
      will be collected through 4 web based surveys, and the participants will complete those at
      baseline before the intervention starts, and after 4, 8 and 12 weeks of intake of the study
      product.

      The primary outcome of the study will be assessed by the Patients' Global Impression of
      Change (PGIC) scale. Other questionnaires used in the study includes the IBS specific
      Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS-IBS), the IBS Quality of Life Scale (IBS-QoL),
      the Participant Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4), the Participant Health Questionnaire-12
      (PHQ-12), and the Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS). All outcomes will be evaluated in all
      patients and in sub-groups of patients. i.e. subtypes by predominant bowel habit
      (diarrhea-predominant, constipation-predominant, or altered/mixed pattern), and lactose
      intolerant patients.
