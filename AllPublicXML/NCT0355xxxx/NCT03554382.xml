  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Hypertension is an increasing global problem and measures are needed against the emerging
      hypertensive burden. Management of the risk factor hypertension consists of medical treatment
      in conjunction with lifestyle adjustment, whereby lifestyle adjustment is the preventive
      cornerstone but has also been proven to contribute to BP reduction among those already
      receiving medical drug treatments. Non-adherence is a significant barrier to successful
      hypertension management.

      Goal:

      To improve management of hypertension in daily life from a person-centred perspective,
      utilizing information and communication technology, and further to decrease complications of
      hypertension. To increase the proportion of persons with hypertension obtaining a BP goal
      =&lt;140/90 mmHg and to conduct a health economic evaluation of our intervention.

      Plan:

      The investigators will conduct a multi-centre randomized controlled trial in 36 primary care
      centres in three counties in Sweden. There will be approximaely 430 patients in each group.
      BP will be measured in a standardized manner, laboratory tests taken and questionnaires
      answered at baseline, after eight weeks and after a year in both the intervention and the
      control group. Register data on health care resource one year before baseline and for the
      full study period will be retrieved for participants in both study groups.

      Singificance:

      The intervention is expected to improve adherence to treatment and a significant lowering of
      the blood pressure. Hospitalization rates are lower among persons with hypertension that
      adheres to their medication. By improving treatment of hypertension the hope is to decrease
      complications and morbidity due to hypertension and thereby hospitalization and health care
      costs. Due to the generic nature of the technology involved, the self-management system can
      easily be adapted to monitor other chronic conditions.

    <description>The patients are provided with a home BP monitor. Thereafter they will be asked to use the self-management support system and self-report, once daily in the evening, via their own mobile phone during eight weeks. At each occasion, the patients first answer the questions on wellbeing, symptoms, lifestyle, medication intake and side effects and then measure their BP and pulse, and when these data (mean of three readings) are input into the mobile phone, they automatically register in the database. During intervention the paient has regular access to self-reported data via graphs</description>
