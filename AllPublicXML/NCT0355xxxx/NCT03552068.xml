  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Noradrenergic system is involved in impulsivity in the general population and is altered in
      Parkinson's disease (PD) in the early stages of the disease. Thus, targeting this system
      could be of interest in impulse control disorder (ICD). Acting on the noradrenergic system is
      possible using clonidine, an α2 adrenergic agonist largely used in hypertension treatment and
      that induces a decrease of NADR release. Thus, our aim is to conduct a proof of concept study
      evaluating the efficacy and safety of clonidine on ICD in PD. This study is a multicenter,
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled in parallel group clinical trial.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with PD according to MDS (movement disorders society) criteria for at least
             one year

          -  Patients with ICD with a QUIP-RS score ≥10 and/or at least one of the sub-scores in

             between &gt;8 and 12; Hypersexuality between &gt; 8 and 12; Eating between &gt; 7 and 12. The
             use of &quot;lower&quot; margins will guarantee that patients will present behavioral
             disturbances severe enough to justify clonidine treatment. On the other hand, the use
             of &quot;upper&quot; margins will guarantee that the patients included in the trial will not
             suffer from ICD too severe to ethically participate to a placebo controlled study.

          -  Weight between 40 and 95kg

             randomization for women.

             Parkinsonism)

             list, appendix 2);

          -  Presence of renal failure (Cockcroft-Gault at inclusion visit&lt;30 ml/min/1,73m2);
