  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine response rates (partial and complete responses)
      to nivolumab of recurrent or progressive IDH mutant high-grade gliomas with prior exposure to
      alkylating agents.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gliomas are the most common malignant primary brain tumor in adults. Their clinical
      presentation is heterogeneous and prognosis is dependent on both the grade of the tumor and
      the molecular subtype. Somatic mutations in Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) or, less
      commonly, Isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) genes have emerged as an important prognostic
      factor in gliomas and are associated with longer survival.

      Regardless of initial grade, recurrence and transformation into higher grade tumors is almost
      universal. There is high unmet medical need in treating recurrent gliomas as there is
      currently no established standard of care therapy. Recent trials of IDH inhibitors in IDH
      mutant gliomas and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and PD-L1 inhibitors in recurrent
      gliomas have been disappointing. Multiple studies in other cancers have demonstrated that
      hypermutated tumors are associated with response to immunotherapeutic agents, including
      anti-CTLA4 agents in melanoma, anti-PD1 therapy in bladder cancer, and
      anti-programmed-cell-death protein 1 (anti-PD1) therapy in lung, and colorectal cancer.

      There is evidence to suggest that gliomas with somatic IDH mutations are more prone to
      develop hypermutation after exposure to alkylating agents than IDH wildtype tumors, providing
      strong scientific rationale for establishing nivolumab as a treatment option in this subgroup
      of patients.

    <description>Nivolumab 240 mg will be given every 2 weeks for 8 cycles. Beginning with Cycle 9, nivolumab 480 mg will be given every 4 weeks for a total therapy duration of 2 years, or until progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. Nivolumab will be administered as a 30-minute infusion. A finite treatment duration with immune therapies in this participant population remains an area of ongoing research; therefore the treatment duration chosen was 2 years.</description>
