  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psychosis and schizophrenia are common and costly mental health problems. Psychosis is the
      name given to a group of mental conditions in which cause people to perceive or interpret
      things differently from those around them. One of the most common causes of psychosis is
      schizophrenia, a condition that causes a range of psychological symptoms, including
      hallucinations (hearing and/or seeing things) and delusions (believing something that is not
      true). One of the main treatment options for psychosis and schizophrenia is long-term
      treatment with antipsychotic medication, but many patients still find life difficult.
      Antipsychotic drugs can also have dangerous and unpleasant side effects. Finding alternatives
      to long-term drug treatment is a priority for patients and services. This study is testing
      the effects of gradually reducing antipsychotic medication in people with schizophrenia,
      psychosis or similar conditions in order to see if it can help improve day-to-day functioning
      and how it affects their chance of suffering a relapse (worsening of their condition).

      The RADAR trial is a randomised controlled trial that will compare a flexible and gradual
      strategy of antipsychotic reduction and possible discontinuation with maintenance
      antipsychotic treatment in people with schizophrenia or who have recurrent psychotic
      episodes. In the reduction group, a guideline reduction schedule will be devised by the
      research team for each participant taking into account starting dose and number of
      antipsychotics prescribed. This may be adjusted by treating clinicians in discussion with
      participants. Antipsychotics will be discontinued in cases where reduction progresses well.
      The reduction schedule will be flexible, and will include guidance on monitoring and treating
      symptoms and signs of early relapse.

      Participants will be individually randomised to the two treatment strategies, which will be
      administered by treating clinicians. They will be followed up for two years. The primary
      outcome is social functioning, and secondary outcomes include relapse, symptoms, side
      effects, employment and medication adherence.

    <masking_description>Participants and treating clinicians will not be blinded because participants will start on different antipsychotic regimes, and those within the antipsychotic reduction intervention will follow an individualised reduction protocol.
Following trial extension the sample size was reduced from 402 to 218. The study is now powered to the primary outcome 'social functioning'.
Members of the research team conducting outcome assessments will be blinded to treatment allocation.</masking_description>
