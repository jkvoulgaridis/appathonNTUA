  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In breast reduction surgery, pain control is usually performed with tumescent anesthesia,
      thoracic epidural anesthesia, intercostal nerve blocks and paravertebral block applications.
      Tumescent anesthesia is also preferred by plastic surgeons because of the varying risk of
      thoracic epidural anesthesia and paravertebral block applications.

      After the Erector spinae block was first described by Forero in 2016, it was reported to have
      been applied in many cases, including breast surgery.

      It is considered to be a safer block because of the presence of paravertebral block-like
      activity and the location where the needle is guided away from the pleura. The investigators
      aimed to compare postoperative analgesia consumption, pain scores and patient satisfaction of
      erector spine block with tumescent anesthesia in patients who underwent reduction mammoplasty
      operation under general anesthesia in this double-blind prospective randomized study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients aged 18-65 years undergoing bilateral reduction mammoplasty. Patients were randomly
      divided into two groups with closed envelope to perform tumescent anesthesia and erector
      spinae block.

      All patients were premedicated with oral midazolam 0.5 mg/ kg preoperatively. All patients
      received standard general anesthesia protocol as induction with 2-3 mg/kg iv propofol and
      1-1.5 mcg/kg fentanyl and 0.6 mg/kg iv rocuronium. Endotracheal intubations were performed
      7.0 or 7.5 endotracheal tubes with the patient in a supine position. Anesthesia maintenance
      was with sevoflurane 0.5/kg/mg remifentanil infusion and in a 50% O2 -50% air mixture.
      Standard monitoring of the patients included of heart rate, invasive systolic, diastolic and
      mean blood pressure and peripheral oxygen saturation and the operating times were recorded.

      At approximately 30 minutes before the end of surgery, 8mg dexketoprofen IV was administered
      to all patients. At the end of the operation, all the patients were performed with iv
      PCA(Patient Controlled Analgesia).

      Demographic data such as age, weight, and height of the patients were recorded. After
      patients informed about pain score NRS (Numeric Pain Rating Scale) and patient satisfaction
      score ( one to ten) recorded by the nurse of PACU and ward.
