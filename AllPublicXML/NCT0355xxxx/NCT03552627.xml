  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The World Health Organisation recommends that all patients having a general anaesthetic for
      surgery should be given 80% oxygen as this might reduce their risk of getting an infection
      after their operation. However there remains a lot of uncertainty about how much oxygen
      patients should be given whilst undergoing surgery. In other areas of medicine evidence is
      slowly emerging to suggest that giving less oxygen may be as safe or even safer than giving
      high amounts of oxygen (e.g. after a heart attack, patients unnecessarily given oxygen seem
      to do worse than those given air). The amount of oxygen currently given to patients having
      surgery varies widely; in a recent study of almost 400 procedures across 29 hospitals, we
      found values ranged from below 30% to almost 100% oxygen. The aim of this research is to
      explore if giving less oxygen will generate less strain on parts of the body, particularly
      the lungs as they are always exposed to all of the oxygen that enters the body. Participants
      undergoing major elective surgical procedures will be randomised to receive either 80%, 55%
      or 30% throughout their general anaesthetic and levels of inflammation, oxidative stress and
      perioperative recovery will all be measured for upto 7 days after surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over 3 million patients receive oxygen (O2) during general anaesthesia (GA) in the UK
      annually, and a large number of these also have co-morbid respiratory diseases such as Asthma
      or COPD. The World Health Organisation (WHO) recently recommended that all surgical patients
      receive 80% O2 throughout GA and for 6 hours in recovery to reduce Surgical Site Infections
      (SSIs). However, a recent Cochrane systematic review found no evidence of benefit from this
      approach and some evidence that harm could be increased (including mortality).

      Excess oxygen has been associated with worse outcomes in many areas of medicine (including
      acute respiratory illnesses), possibly due to increased Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)
      production: ROS can cause oxidative stress and damage proteins, DNA, and lipids.
      Observational data from our group shows most surgical patients currently receive nearer 55%
      O2 under GA. The effect of intraoperative O2 concentration on other surgical outcomes remains
      unknown.

      This project will determine whether giving lower concentrations of oxygen to surgical
      patients during anaesthesia can reduce levels of oxidative stress during surgery
      (particularly in the lungs); investigate how this affects other organs; and evaluate the
      feasibility of performing a large (multi-centre) effectiveness study to define 'safe' oxygen
      administration concentrations during surgery.

      Patient undergoing elective major surgery will be randomised to receive 80% (WHO's
      recommendation); 55% (current usual care) or 30% oxygen (intervention) throughout
      anaesthesia. Endotracheal aspirates will be sampled along with paired central venous and
      arterial blood samples throughout surgery to monitor levels of oxidative stress and organ
      function. Patients will be followed up for 7 days after surgery.
