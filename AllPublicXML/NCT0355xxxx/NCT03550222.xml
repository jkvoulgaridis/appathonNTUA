  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Critical illness is associated with ICU acquired weakness and diaphragmatic dysfunction.

      Ultrasound can evaluate the muscle mass non invasively and provides the ability for a muscle
      follow up during and after the ICU stay. Magnetic stimulation of the phrenic nerves and the
      measure of the end expiratory tracheal pressure with an occlusion valve allows to evaluate
      the diaphragm force production in mechanically ventilated patients.

      The aim of the present study is to constitute an image bank and to describe the muscle mass
      and function recovery in critically ill patients.

      Ultrasound and clinical data will be collected and analysed during the ICU stay.
