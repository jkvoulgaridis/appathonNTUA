  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glaucoma implants have been used for refractory glaucoma and are gaining popularity as a
      primary procedure in selected patients. In order to prevent tube erosion, a biologic material
      such as pericardium, cornea, and sclera is used as coverage over the tube. Despite this
      preventive measures, patch graft thinning and silicon tube exposure are still a serious
      complications and may occur in 1%-7% of eyes after glaucoma implantation. In this study we
      used a novel technique named short tunnel small flap (STSF) by tunneling the sclera without
      using any biological material . efficacy and safety of this technique is comparing with
      conventional scleral patch graft.

      This randomized clinical trial, was performed at the Glaucoma Clinic of Labbafinejad Medical
      Center, Tehran, IRAN from September 2015 to January 2017 . The study was approved by the
      ethics committee at the Ophthalmic Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical
      Sciences, Tehran, Iran and followed the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. After
      explaining all therapeutic options and their side effects, the written consent form was
      obtained from all patient. 80 eyes of 80 patients with refractory glaucoma underwent AGV
      implantation by short tunnel small flap technique (group1) or scleral patch graft (group2)
      randomly. Primary outcome measure is Intraocular pressure(IOP) and Tube exposure, and
      secondary outcome measure is success rate that is defined as intraocular pressure (IOP) &gt; 5
      mmHg, ≤ 21 mmHg, and IOP reduction ≥ 20% from baseline at two consecutive visits after three
      months, no reoperation for glaucoma. Outcome measures are compared at 1, 3 , 6 and 12 months
      postoperatively.
