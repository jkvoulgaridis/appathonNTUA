      BACKGROUND:

        -  Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive cancer with a poor prognosis. Although
           highly responsive to chemotherapy initially, SCLC relapses quickly and becomes
           refractory to treatment within a few months.

        -  The inability to destroy residual SCLC cells despite initial chemosensitivity suggests
           the existence of a highly effective DNA damage response network. SCLC is also
           characterized by high DNA replication stress (RB1 inactivation, MYC and CCNE1
           activation).

        -  There is only one FDA approved treatment for patients with relapsed SCLC after
           first-line chemotherapy: topotecan, which inhibits religation of topoisomerase
           I-mediated single-strand DNA breaks leading to lethal double-strand DNA breaks.
           Temozolomide, an oral alkylating agent, which causes DNA damage by alkylating guanine at
           position O6 also has activity in relapsed SCLC, particularly for brain metastases.

        -  Preliminary evidence indicates that disruption of the immune checkpoint PD-1/PD-L1
           pathway can yield responses in a subset of SCLC patients, but response rates
           (approximately equal to 10%) are lower than NSCLC and other tumors with comparable tumor
           mutational burden indicating additional immunosuppressive mechanisms at play in the SCLC
           tumor microenvironment.

        -  M7824 is a bifunctional fusion protein consisting of an anti-programmed death ligand 1
           (PDL1) antibody and the extracellular domain of transforming growth factor beta
           (TGF-beta) receptor type 2, a TGF-beta trap.

        -  Safety data from the dose-escalation study in solid tumors as well as preliminary data
           from expansion cohorts show that M7824 has a safety profile similar to other checkpoint
           inhibiting compounds.

        -  Combining immunotherapy, and chemotherapy could synergistically improve the anticancer
           activity of immunotherapy. Combination of chemotherapy with immunotherapy have improved
           outcomes in NSCLC and melanoma leading to FDA approvals of such combinations.

        -  We hypothesize that increased DNA damage induced by topotecan and temozolomide will
           complement the anti-tumor activity of M7824, in recurrent SCLC.

      OBJECTIVE:

      - The primary objective of the trial is to determine the efficacy (using objective response
      rate) of M7824 plus topotecan or temozolomide in relapsed SCLC.

      ELIGIBILITY:

        -  Subjects with histological or cytological confirmation of SCLC.

        -  Subjects must be greater than or equal to 18 years of age and have a performance status
           (ECOG) less than or equal to 2.

        -  Subjects must not have received chemotherapy, or undergone major surgery within 2 weeks
           and radiotherapy within 24 hours prior to enrollment.

        -  Subjects must have adequate organ function and measurable disease.

      DESIGN:

        -  Arm A (M7824 monotherapy): Up to 10 patients may be treated with M7824 monotherapy to
           obtain safety and PK data, and a preliminary estimate of clinical responses to M7824 in
           SCLC. Patients with progressive disease on Arm A may then receive M7824 plus
           temozolomide as per description of treatment for Arm C.

        -  Arm B (M7824 plus topotecan) and Arm C (M7824 plus temozolomide) will be administered in
           3 and 4-week cycles respectively; these arms will have a safety run-in followed by
           efficacy analysis. Up to 10 patients with extrapulmonary small cell cancer will be
           enrolled in arm C to receive the combination of M7824 and temozolomide.

        -  Optional tumor biopsies will be obtained at pre-treatment on C1D1 and C1D15 for Arm C;
           pre-treatment on C1D1 and C2D1 for arms A and B.

        -  Every subject of each arm of the safety run-in will be observed for at least 7 days
           after first dose of M7824 before the subsequent subject can be treated. Subjects who are
           not evaluable for DLT will be replaced and not included into evaluation

      ARMS:

        -  Arm A (3-week cycles): M7824 monotherapy 2400 mg every 3 weeks until disease progression
           or a criterion in Protocol is met. Patients with progressive disease on Arm A may then
           receive 1200 mg M7824 every 2 weeks plus temozolomide 200 mg/m^2/day on days 1-5 every 4
           weeks.

        -  Arm B (3-week cycles): M7824 2400 mg plus topotecan 1 mg/m2 on days 1-5 every 3 weeks
           until disease progression or a criterion in Protocol is met.

        -  Arm C (4-week cycles): M7824 1200 mg every 2 weeks plus temozolomide 200 mg/m2/day on
           days 1-5 every 4 weeks until disease progression or a criterion in Protocol is met.

             consent document.

          -  The effects of the trial treatment on the developing human fetus are unknown; thus,
             women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use highly-effective
             contraception prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation and up to
             120 days after the last dose of the drug. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect
             she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should
             inform her treating physician immediately.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Subjects with tumor amenable to potentially curative therapy per PI.

          -  Subjects who are receiving any other investigational agents. Prior immunotherapy,
             topotecan and temozolomide are allowed.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to (study agent) or other agents used in study.

          -  Subjects with symptomatic brain metastases will be excluded from trial secondary to
             poor prognosis. However, subjects who have asymptomatic brain metastases, and those
