  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Niraparib is a potent and highly selective PARP-1/-2 inhibitor. The primary objective of this
      trial is to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of ZL-2306 (niraparib) and its
      metabolite M1 in patients from Mainland China with ovarian cancer, following a single and
      multiple oral administration of the study drug at the indicated dose (300mg, 200mg or 100mg),
      once a day.
