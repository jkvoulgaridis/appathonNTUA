  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an imaging modality, first described in 1991, that
      provides cross-sectional images of the eye in a non-invasive manner. OCT is analogous to
      ultrasonography but measures the &quot;echoes&quot; of light waves rather than sound and, as a result,
      generates extremely high-resolution images (~5 Î¼m axial resolution). Although OCT has already
      proven revolutionary in ophthalmology, current OCT systems are large, expensive, and require
      skilled personnel for image acquisition and interpretation. Furthermore, current OCT systems
      are limited to examination of specific regions of single eyes - for example, separate devices
      are typically required for anterior segment (e.g., cornea) versus posterior segment (e.g.,
      retina) imaging. A new form of OCT imaging has recently been developed - so-called
      &quot;binocular&quot; optical coherence tomography (OCT) (Envision Diagnostics, Inc., California).1,2
      Binocular OCT addresses many of the short-comings of conventional OCT devices.

      Binocular OCT extends the application of OCT devices beyond that of simple, cross- sectional
      imaging to a diverse array of diagnostic tests. The binocular design also removes the need
      for additional personnel to perform testing (i.e., the device can be self-operated in an
      automated manner), and allows for novel testing to be performed that is not possible with
      monocular imaging. In particular, binocular OCT devices have the potential to perform
      automated, quantitative pupillary measurements - an entirely novel application for this
      imaging modality, plus also adds a number of unique capabilities. In particular, binocular
      OCT removes the need for additional personnel to acquire the images by enabling patients to
      align the optical axes of the instrument with the optical axes of their own eyes. The system
      also employs recently developed &quot;swept-source&quot; lasers as its light source, allowing it to see
      deeper into the eye than conventional OCT systems. Finally, binocular OCT systems allow image
      capture from both eyes at the same time. This &quot;simultaneous&quot; ocular imaging extends the range
      of diagnostic testing possible, allowing for features such as pupillometry and ocular
      motility.

      The greatly increased range of imaging for these lasers enables the entire depth of eye
      tissue to be captured in just a few sequences of images - so- called &quot;whole eye&quot; OCT or &quot;OCT
      ophthalmoscopy&quot;.

      In this study, the investigators aim to explore the unique imaging features of the binocular
      OCT to describe novel features across a range of diseases. The repeatability of quantifying
      various parameters in the images acquired using the system will be assessed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Imaging of the retina using OCT is the commonest ophthalmic imaging procedure worldwide - in
      2011, it is estimated that more than 20 million retinal OCT images were obtained, more than
      the sum of all other ophthalmic imaging procedures combined).4 OCT is also used to image the
      anterior segment, particularly to measure corneal thickness, in glaucoma to measure the
      irido-corneal angle, 5 and more recently to measure cells in ocular inflammatory conditions.
      In addition, vitreous imaging may be useful to measure cells in the posterior chamber.

      Most OCT systems are dedicated to retinal imaging or anterior segment imaging. Some
      commercial retinal scanners are capable of switching between anterior and posterior imaging
      modes with additional optical attachments, however anterior segment imaging performance is
      typically suboptimal in these instruments. A key feature of the Binocular OCT is that it can
      perform 'whole-eye' OCT imaging spanning from the eyelids to the posterior pole in a single
      instrument without the requirement of additional attachments, and in an automated way.

      This study will determine whether the instrument can be used for patients with different eye
      diseases. The investigators anticipate recruiting approximately 100 participants with
      anterior eye conditions such as keratoconus, acute anterior uveitis, and pigment dispersion
      syndrome, in addition to approximately 100 participants with posterior segment eye conditions
      such as diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, and glaucoma.

      As this device can image many structures of the eye and with a greater depth range than most
      commercial OCT devices, it may be possible to visualise features not previously imaged with
      other devices such as vitreous imaging, or imaging of cells in the ocular inflammatory
      conditions. In this study, the prototype binocular OCT system will be used to describe novel
      features across a range of ocular diseases. Qualitative analyses of raw binocular OCT images
      will be performed (including assessments of retinal pathological features, corneal and
      anterior chamber morphology, lens status, iris dynamics, and ocular inflammatory cells).
      These parameters will be correlated with findings from other non-invasive ocular imaging
      previously obtained during routine clinical care. Although raw OCT images can be useful for
      diagnosis, quantitative data from the images are useful to monitor eye disease. Commercial
      OCT devices have built-in software packages to analyse OCT images to provide the clinician
      with parameters for detecting and monitoring eye disease. Quantitative analysis of binocular
      OCT images will be performed using MATLAB (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, Massachusetts, United
      States).

      In addition, the ability to combine structural and functional assessments in the same
      instrument may permit better examinations of ophthalmic disease compared to separate clinical
      tests. This study will also permit future studies to be correctly powered.
