  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fenofibrate is a specific ligand for PPARα, which has been used for the treatment of
      hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases for long
      time. Fenofibrate reduces low-density lipoprotein (LDL), very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)
      and triglyceride levels, while increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels. PPARα has
      also shown antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Fenofibrate confers cytoprotective
      effect against myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury in rats by suppressing cell
      apoptosis and ameliorates age-related renal injury through the activation of AMPK and SIRT1
      signaling. However, the safety and effectiveness of fenofibrate on the progression of
      radiation-induced skin injury remain unknown. The purpose of this study is to determine
      whether topical application of fenofibrate is safe and effective for radiation-induced skin
      injury.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Radiation-induced skin injury is a significant side effect of ionizing radiation delivered to
      the skin during cancer treatment as well as a result of other exposure to radiation. The skin
      is one of radiosensitive organ systems in human body because it is a continuously renewing
      organ containing rapidly proliferating and maturing cells. Ionizing radiation promotes
      reactive nitrogen and oxygen species (RNS/ROS) production due to radiolysis of water and
      direct ionization of target molecules, which result in oxidative damage and skin injuries. It
      is considered that ~95 % of cancer patients receiving radiation therapy will develop some
      form of radiodermatitis, including erythema, dry desquamation, and moist desquamation.
      Radiation-induced skin injury negatively affects the process of radiotherapy and the quality
      of patients' life. Despite substantial improvements in radiation technology,
      radiation-induced skin toxicity is still a concerning problem. The purpose of this study is
      to determine whether topical application of fenofibrate is safe and effective for
      radiation-induced skin injury.

    <description>Skin toxicity of radiotherapy was evaluated every day, once radiation began. Fenofibrate administration was given immediately when Grade 1 dermatitis occurred, and then dermatitis was recorded weekly. The score at the end of radiotherapy was the one of the last week of radiotherapy. The evaluation continued until 2 weeks after the end of radiotherapy with two approaches. The standard was the RTOG score defined by the observers.</description>
