  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II trial designed to estimate the activity of single agent tremelimumab in
      subjects with metastatic urothelial cancer with disease progression despite prior treatment
      with PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. The primary endpoint is objective response rate and the study will
      employ a Simon's 2-stage design.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Written informed consent and HIPAA authorization for release of personal health
             information prior to registration. NOTE: HIPAA authorization may be included in the
             informed consent or obtained separately.

          -  ECOG Performance Status of 0 or 1 within 14 days prior to registration.

          -  Histologically or cytologically documented urothelial cancer. Locally advanced (T4b,
             any N; or any T, N 2−3) or metastatic disease (M1, Stage IV) (also termed TCC or UCC
             of the urinary tract; including renal pelvis, ureters, urinary bladder, and urethra)
             Subjects with mixed histologies are eligible provided that the predominant component
             is urothelial cancer. Locally advanced bladder cancer must be inoperable on the basis
             of involvement of pelvic sidewall or adjacent viscera (clinical Stage T4b) or bulky
             nodal metastasis (N2−N3).

          -  Representative formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor specimens in paraffin
             blocks (blocks preferred) or at least 15 unstained slides. If archival tissue is not
             available and the subject is undergoing a standard of care biopsy, tissue from the
             biopsy is required to be submitted for correlative analyses. Subjects without adequate
             baseline tumor tissue may be considered for enrollment on a case by case basis after
             discussion with the sponsor-investigator.

          -  Measurable disease according to RECIST 1.1 within 28 days prior to registration. At
             least 1 lesion, not previously irradiated, that can be accurately measured at baseline
             as ≥10 mm in the longest diameter (except lymph nodes, which must have short axis ≥15
             mm) with computed tomography (CT) (preferred) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
             scans, preferably with IV contrast, and that is suitable for accurate repeated
             measurements as per RECIST 1.1 guidelines; lesions in a previously irradiated field
             can be used as a measurable disease provided that there has been demonstrated
             progression in the lesion.

          -  A subject with prior brain metastasis may be considered if they have completed their
             treatment for brain metastasis at least 4 weeks prior to study registration, have been
             off of corticosteroids for ≥ 2 weeks, and are asymptomatic

                  anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibody therapy.

               -  Subjects must have received at least 1 line of prior systemic therapy

                  resolved to baseline prior to screening for this study with the exception of
                  endocrine related AEs that are stable on replacement therapy (e.g., steroids,
                  thyroid hormone) which may be considered eligible but must be discussed with the
                  sponsor-investigator.

               -  Must not have experienced a ≥ Grade 3 immune related AE or an immune related
                  neurologic (neuro-muscular) or ocular AE of any grade while receiving prior

                  enroll if they are stably maintained on appropriate replacement therapy and are
                  asymptomatic. Must not have required the use of additional immunosuppression
                  other than corticosteroids for the management of an AE, not have experienced
