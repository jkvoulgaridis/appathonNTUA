    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of the proposed research are to evaluate patient use of KeraStat Cream
      and collect data to inform a larger future trial.

      The secondary objectives are to assess the safety and tolerability of KeraStat Cream in
      subjects at risk of radiation dermatitis, to assess the effectiveness of KeraStat Cream and
      how that compares to the current standard of care, and to estimate the amount of KeraStat
      Cream used per patient and coverage on skin.

    <measure>Dermatology Life Quality Index</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The DLQI measures the impact of dermatological conditions on a patient's quality of life. The DLQI is scored by summing the score of each question (answered from not at all, 0, to very much, 3). The maximum is 30 and the minimum is 0. The higher the score, the greater the impairment of quality of life. Data will be aggregated across treatment groups.</description>
