  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain (LBP) is the leading cause of disability worldwide and has substantial impacts
      on pain and function for an individual. Some individuals with LBP seek physical therapy for
      their condition. The purpose of the study is to determine whether individuals with LBP have
      improved pain and disability following physical therapy targeting either the low back only or
      low back plus hip(s).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Often, individuals with LBP also have concurrent impairments in strength and/or range of
      motion of one or both hips. Physical therapists may or may not decide to treat the concurrent
      hip impairments for an individual with LBP based on their clinical decision making.
      Currently, it is unknown which approach leads to superior patient outcomes in terms of pain
      and disability.

    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 weeks, end of intervention (discharge; an average of 6 weeks), 6 month and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The ODI is a reliable and responsive 10 question condition-specific self-report measure for individuals with LBP. The ODI is scored on a scale from 0% to 100%, higher scores indicating higher levels of disability.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline on the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 weeks, end of intervention (discharge; an average of 6 weeks), 6 month and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The NPRS is an 11 point scale (0-10) where the participant is asked to rate their pain intensity at best, worst and average over the last 24 hours. The scale is anchored on the left (score of 0) with the phrase &quot;No Pain&quot; and on the right (score of 10) with the phrase &quot;Worst Imaginable Pain&quot;. The NPRS is a valid and reliable assessment of pain severity for individuals with low back pain.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline on the Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire (FABQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 weeks, end of intervention (discharge; an average of 6 weeks), 6 month and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The FABQ is a 16-item questionnaire designed to quantify fear and avoidance beliefs in patients with LBP. The FABQ has two sub-scales, a 7-item scale to measure fear-avoidance beliefs about work-related activities (FABQ-W) and a 4-item scale to measure fear-avoidance beliefs about physical activity (FABQ-PA). Each item is scored from 0-6 with possible scores ranging between 0-24 and 0-42 for the physical activity and work subscales, respectively, with higher scores representing increased fear-avoidance beliefs. Recent evidence suggests that the FABQ may be a valuable piece of data for predicting outcomes following intervention in work-related low back pain patients.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline on the Global Rating of Change (GROC)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks, end of intervention (discharge; an average of 6 weeks), 6 month and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The GROC is a 15-point scale that ranges from -7 (a very great deal worse) to zero (about the same) to +7 (a very great deal better). 28 Descriptors of worsening or improving are assigned values from -1 to -6 and +1 to +6 respectively. It has been reported that scores of +4 and +5 are indicative of moderate changes in patient status and scores of +6 and +7 indicate large changes in patient status. This scale will not be administered at baseline evaluation, but at all subsequent time points.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline on the Patient Acceptable Symptom State (PASS)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks, end of intervention (discharge; an average of 6 weeks), 6 month and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PASS is a single question designed to determine if an individual considers their current status as 'feeling well'. The PASS question was: &quot;Taking into account all the activities you have during your daily life, your level of pain, and also your functional impairment, do you consider that your current state is satisfactory?&quot; The participant response with a 'yes' or 'no' answer.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline on the Godin Leisure-Time Physical Activity Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, end of intervention (discharge; an average of 6 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The Godin-Shepard Leisure-Time Physical Activity Questionnaire allows for self-reported leisure-time physical activity. It allows the participant to designate the number of times per week that the engage in physical activities that are of varying intensities (strenuous, moderate, mild). The sum of each intensity is then multiplied by their corresponding metabolic equivalent values of 9, 5, and 3, respectively. High total scores provide the frequency and intensity of exercise that an individual participates in on a weekly basis. The questionnaire has been validated for classifying healthy adults into active and insufficiently active categories. A lack of physical activity in leisure times have been associated with increased prevalence of low back pain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The PHQ-2 is a validated two-question screening questionnaire that is used to determine the presence of depressive disorders. Individuals with low back pain that have depressive symptoms tend to have poor outcomes. The two questions are completed by the participant and scored on a 0-3 scale. The scores for both questions are summed with a cut off score of 3 or higher is considered more at risk for the presence of any depressive disorder.</description>
