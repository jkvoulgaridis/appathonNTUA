    <textblock>
      Background There has been much interest in the relationship between the types of gut
      microbiota and the development of obesity in recent years. It has been reported that the
      proportions of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes differ between obese and normal weight human
      subjects. Human intestinal microbiota compositions have been found to be associated with
      long-term dietary habits and lifestyle. However, an increasing number of researches show that
      intestinal microbiota composition may be affected after short-term diet intervention.
      Importantly, obesity and metabolic problems play important roles in morbidity and mortality
      of schizophrenia patients. Human intestinal microbiota compositions related with obesity may
      impact the heath of this population. Therefore, we searched current advances about the
      connection of obesity, intestinal microbiota compositions, and diet in schizophrenia to
      conduct a clinical research focus on the effect of high fiber diet on the intestinal
      microbiota of schizophrenia patients with central obesity.

      Method We will investigate in a 4-week intervention whether consumption of dietary fiber
      supplement(Inulin) affect the microbiota composition in schizophrenia inpatients with central
      obesity. Fecal samples from participants before and after the intervention will be processed
      for the microbiota analysis.
