    <textblock>
      Whether Subthalamic Nucleus (STN) Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS), a treatment commonly used to
      ameliorate the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD), affects on facial expressions is
      unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential effects of DBS and
      different frequencies on facial expressions of PD patients by volunteers via a web site:

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most frequent progressive neuro-degenerative disease
      with a worldwide prevalence of 4-6 million and the mask face is an important and also
      troublesome sign of PD. Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) surgery can be a viable option which has
      recently emerged and been accepted as a useful surgical method for PD. Standard DBS targets
      include Subthalamic Nucleus (STN) and Globus Pallidus Internus (GPi). Although the STN-DBS
      application is known to have favorable effects on motor and non-motor symptoms of PD, there
      is a lack information about the effect on facial expressions of PD patients. Our aim is to
      analyze the effect of the STN-DBS stimulation and different frequencies on the facial
      expressions of PD patients.

      The study initially recruited 18 patients with idiopathic PD who underwent DBS surgery for
      movement disorders caused by PD at Mustafa Kemal University Medical Faculty Neurosurgery
      Department.

      Inclusion criteria:

        -  Idiopathic PD responsive to L-Dopa treatment,

        -  Between 40-75 years of age,

        -  Having received bilateral STN DBS surgery at least six months prior to the investigation
           to ensure stable stimulation parameters,

        -  Mentally normal patients that could understand and respond to a directives. The
           evaluation will be made by the face photos of the patients. The face photos for the
           expressions including [normal], [sad], [happy], and [angry] were obtained at frequencies
           including 130 Hz, 60 Hz, 99 Hz, 230 Hz and off-stimulation. The face photos will
           evaluate by the software and by the volunteers with the aim of a website:
