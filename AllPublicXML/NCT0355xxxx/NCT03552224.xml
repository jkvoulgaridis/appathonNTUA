  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date, all the electrophysiological methods for auditory testing rely on the measure on
      synchronous evoked auditory nerve activity. This measure only takes into account the response
      of the first action potential in every auditory fibber, but provides no information about the
      neural response during a sustained activity. This can explain why in experimental models, a
      loss of more of 80% of auditory nerve fibbers cannot be detected by usual
      electrophysiological measurements. In this study we aim at investigating the global
      spontaneous and sound evoked auditory nerve activity by recording directly the electrical
      field by an electrode placed directly on the auditory nerve of subjects during a skull base
      surgical procedure. We expected to demonstrated differences in the electrical activity
      between subjects with or without hearing loss.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  18 - 80 years ( inclusive borders)

          -  patient having to undergo surgery at the level of the ponto-cerebellar angle
