  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the feasibility and safety and efficacy of collecting and
      infusing autologous umbilical cord blood (UCB) in newborn infants with hypoplastic left heart
      syndrome (HLHS) and transposition of great arteries (TGA).

      Rationale: Neonates with HLHS and TGA have significant brain injury as demonstrated by
      peri-surgical MRI. Moreover, there a substantial tendency to suffer from chronic cardiac
      condition as low cardiac output state and valvular insufficiency. Treatment of neonates after
      hypoxic ischemic injury at birth with autologous UCB was shown to safe and improved
      developmental outcome. The effect of UCB is most likely achieved by reduction of free
      radicals injury and pro-inflammatory and apoptotic process.

      Hypothesis: Treatment with UCB immediately after the first cardiac surgey, with in the first
      week life will reduce the brain injury demonstrated by MRI and reduce the choronic cardiac
      problems

      The aim of this pilot study is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of infusion of
      autologous umbilical cord blood (UCB) in neonates with with hypoplastic left heart syndrome
      (HLHS) or transposition of great arteries (TGA).

      This is a prospective, matched control study, Phase I-II trial to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of autologous UCB infusion in neonates with HLHS or TGA. The study group will
      consist of neonate that were diagnosed by prenatal fetal ultrasound with HLHS or TGA and
      their UCB was collected at the time of delivery.

      The study group will include the patients with UCB and the control group will be patients
      without UCB.

      All patients will have their surgery within 2 weeks from birth. The UCB will be infused to
      the patients in study group as soon as the patient has stabilized after the surgery and not
      more than 7 days after surgery.

      Both groups will be followed similarity:

      During hospitalization:

      Neurological and cardiac evaluation a day before surgery, 7 days after surgery and at
      discharge.

      Blood tests for immune and growth factors a day before surgery, at the time of infusion (or
      intended infusion for the control group) ,1 and 7 days after infusion.

      have a cardiac and brain MRI before the surgery and within 14 days after surgery.

      Brain and cardiac MRI before surgery, 7-14 days after surgery.

      Ambulatory follow up (similar to routine follow up):

      Cardiac and neuro-developmental evaluation at 1,6,12 month Blood tests for immune and growth
      factors at 1 month
