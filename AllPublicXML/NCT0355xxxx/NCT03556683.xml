  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: To determine if inhaled hypertonic saline (HS) accelerates airway mucociliary
      clearance (MCC) in well-controlled moderate to severe asthmatics.

      Participants: Non-smoking adults with well controlled moderate to severe asthma

      Procedures (methods): After undergoing a general health screen, participants will undergo a
      lung transmission scan to create an image of the lungs. Participants will then inhale
      nebulized radiolabeled aerosol and sit in front of a gamma camera for 2 hours to measure
      clearance of radiolabeled particles from the lungs (procedure called gamma scintigraphy),
      which will be used to calculate baseline MCC. Participants will then inhale HS, with
      spirometry performed before and at regular intervals after HS to assess for clinically
      significant reductions in lung function. Vital signs and symptom questionnaires will be
      administered as well. If they are deemed tolerant to HS (i.e. no clinically significant
      deterioration in lung function, vital signs, or symptom questionnaire scores), participants
      will move forward to the next study visit. At the next visit, participants will again inhale
      nebulized HS and will undergo a gamma scintigraphy scan immediately after to measure the
      acute effects of HS on MCC. At a separate visit, participants will inhale nebulized HS and
      undergo gamma scintigraphy scan 4 hours later to measure prolonged effects of HS on MCC.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18-60 of both genders-

          -  Moderate to severe asthma at baseline (determined by Step 3 therapy or greater or by
             asthma impairment) and well-controlled asthma at the time of enrollment, as determined
             by NHLBI Expert Panel Report 3 guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of asthma.

          -  Negative pregnancy test for females who are not s/p hysterectomy with oophorectomy.

          -  FEV1 (forced expiratory volume 1 sec) of at least 70% of predicted for age, sex,
             height, and race/ethnicity (without use of bronchodilating medications for 12 hours or
             long acting beta agonists for 24 hours).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects who meet any of these criteria are not eligible for enrollment as study
        participants:

          1. Clinical Contraindications:

             Any chronic medical condition considered by the PI as a contraindication to the study
             including significant cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic renal disease, chronic
             thyroid disease, history of chronic infections/immunodeficiency, or history of
             tuberculosis Any acute infection requiring antibiotics within 4 weeks of study. Mental
             illness or history of drug or alcohol abuse that, in the opinion of the investigator,
             would interfere with the participant's ability to comply with study requirements.

             Medications which may impact the results of the study treatment, or may interfere with
             any other medications potentially used in the study (to include steroids, beta
             antagonists, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents) Active smoking to include
             e-cigarettes within 1 year of the study, or lifetime of &gt; 10 pack-years of smoking
             Allergy/sensitivity to study drugs, or their formulations. History of intubation for
             asthma Unwillingness to use reliable contraception if sexually active (birth control
