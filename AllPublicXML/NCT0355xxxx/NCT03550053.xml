  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Reconstruction of the mandible commonly employs the use of metal plates to provide a
      framework for placement of bone grafts. The standard approach to reconstruction involves
      bending these plates to the mandible intraoperatively. A novel technique involves bending
      plates to three dimensional (3D) printed models of the mandible prior to surgery. No study
      has performed a quantitative analysis and comparison of these two different strategies. The
      purpose of this study is to compare reconstructive plating strategies (preoperative versus
      intraoperative bending) for mandibular reconstruction using 3D quantitative analysis.
      Preoperative diagnostic CT scans of the head/neck of 20 patients scheduled to undergo
      mandibular reconstruction will be obtained and imported into 3D modeling software. A computer
      based 3D reconstructed mandible will be printed. Simulated reconstruction will be replicated
      by contouring mandibular reconstruction plates to each model. The plates will be marked,
      sterilized and brought to the operating room on the day of surgery. Each patient will be
      randomized to either preoperative (n=10) or intraoperative (n=10) plate bending groups. The
      group will be revealed to the primary surgeon on the day of surgery and the patient will
      either be fit with the plate bent preoperatively or will undergo fitting with a plate bent
      intraoperatively. Following reconstruction of the mandible, the patient will undergo
      intraoperative cone beam scanning. Using scans performed pre- and post-mandibular
      reconstruction, the 3D simulated mandibles will be compared based on the position of the
      mandibular condyle within the Temporomandibular Joint. In addition, the percentage of surface
      area contact between the plate and mandible and the postoperative occlusion attained will be
      determined and compared between groups. It is expected that the preformed plates will have
      improved contact surface area, and better achieve pre-reconstruction occlusion when compared
      to plates bent intraoperatively.

      Patients will be identified through attendance at the Wharton Head and Neck Clinic at
      Princess Margaret Hospital or attendance at the Toronto General Hospital Otolaryngology -
      Head &amp; Neck Surgery clinic as requiring resection of mandibular pathology and subsequent
      reconstruction with bony free flap. Chart review (electronic) of these patients will be
      performed to obtain demographic information and factors such as tumor type, site, stage and
      prior treatment. Data will be obtained from CT scans to create 3D models, including anatomic
      parameters required for 3D printing of the mandible. Following reconstruction, a number of
      variables will be collected (i.e. position of the mandibular condyle within the
      temporomandibular joint, percentage of surface area contact between the plate and bone, type
      of occlusion/bite and degree of conformance). All of this data will be stored in a password
      protected Excel spreadsheet located on a secure University Health Network computer. Twenty
      participants will be enrolled into this study and randomized to one of two groups:
      intraoperative plate bending (n=10) or preoperative plate bending (n=10) using a 3D printed
      model. While the participant can be blinded to the strategy that will be pursued, the surgeon
      performing the reconstruction will not be blinded.
