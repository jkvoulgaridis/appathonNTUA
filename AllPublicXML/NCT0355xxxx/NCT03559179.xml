  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this pilot study is to program an opioid use disorder (OUD) clinical
      decision support (CDS) tool for use in an electronic medical record (EMR) and obtain high
      primary care physician (PCP) usability and acceptability. The OUD-CDS is based on the
      NIDA-Blending Initiative white paper, &quot;Clinical Decision Support for Opioid Use Disorders:
      Working Group Report,&quot; which itself is based on national evidence-based guidelines (American
      Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM 2015), VA (VA 2015). As such, this pilot study aims to
      help PCPs achieve accepted standards of care in OUD treatment. The secondary objectives of
      this pilot study are to evaluate the usefulness of the tool by comparing OUD case-finding,
      medication-assisted therapy (MAT) and referral patterns pre- and post-CDS deployment for PCPs
      with and without CDS access.
