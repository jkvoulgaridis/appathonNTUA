    <textblock>
      This study is designed to assess whether consumers select and use norgestrel 0.075 mg, a
      progestin only pill for contraception, in a manner consistent with the OTC package directions
      in an Over-the-Counter (OTC)-like setting.

      Subjects will be primarily recruited via passive recruiting methods, such as in-store
      posters, direct mail postcards, and digital space advertising.

      Respondents to advertisements will either call Clinical Research Organization (CRO) call
      center or visit the study website for initial screening (during which data regarding age,
      gender, and minimal study exclusion criteria will be collected) and scheduling of an
      in-person enrollment visit at a local participating research site.

      During the face-to-face enrollment visit, potential subjects who meet the inclusion and
      exclusion criteria for the study will be given an (empty) study medication package and will
      be allowed as much time as they need to review the information on the outside of the entire
      package. Subjects will then be asked if the product is OK or not OK for them to use.

      Qualified subjects then will be allowed to purchase (pharmacy sites) or be given (clinic
      sites) the study product.

      Approximately 47 sites will be used, comprising retail pharmacy research sites and women's
      health clinics or adolescents' clinics.
