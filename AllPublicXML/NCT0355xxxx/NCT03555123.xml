    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of intravenous
      infusion of Levosimendan for 24hrs in patients with ADHF who will be hospitalized with ADHF
      and continue to have symptom of dyspnea at rest(NYHA Class III or IV) despite with treatment
      of SOCs(include intravenous diuretics, vasodilators and/or positive inotropic drugs but
      except amrinone and milrinone) within 48hrs

      Efficacy is measured by Clinical composite classification(Improved, No change, Worse),
      bio-marker(change of BNP and ST-2), Patient's Global Assessment, NYHA functional
      Classification, hospitalization period and renal function tests(change of creatinine, BUN and
      NGAL) Safety is measured by recording the incidence of adverse events(AEs), vital signs,
      clinical blood safety tests(biochemistry, hematology) and concomitant medications
