  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although there has been interval improvement in reducing disparity in mammography utilization
      in medically underserved communities since the 1990s, significant disparities persist and
      should be addressed. In the 40-65 year old age range, there is significant disparity in
      screening mammography utilization in Hispanic women compared to their white counterparts.

      Culturally adapted patient-targeted healthcare interventions can help reduce ethnic
      inequalities in access to cancer screening programs. Promotoras, culturally appropriate
      patient navigators for the Hispanic community, have been shown to increase screening
      mammography rates in the Hispanic/Latino population.

      However, there is little research exploring the interaction between these lay community
      health workers and community members. This proposal aims to assess this interaction by
      measuring the impact of a Promotora working with community members in either a group setting
      or individual setting. Understanding this interaction can lead to more effectively designed
      future community interventions. Primary outcomes in this study will include women's reported
      measures of interpersonal processes of care (communication and interpersonal style) during
      screening mammography care, trust in the healthcare system, and satisfaction with cancer
      screening care when compared to those receiving standard of care.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Reported Measures From Interpersonal Processes of Care Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 2 weeks after consent/screening mammogram.</time_frame>
    <description>Selected scales (communication and interpersonal style) of the Interpersonal Processes of Care Survey will be the primary outcome. A total of 18 (corrected from orginal submission) questions will be administered. The questions are scored on a scale from 1-5 with higher scores indicating higher frequencies of the construct. The compiled scores will range from 5-90. Scales with negative associations (discrimination, hurried communication) will be reversed. Thus, higher scores for all items will indicate a more positive experience.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Reported Measures From the Distrust in the Healthcare System Scale. Reported at Baseline and Post Intervention. Also Reported as the Change Between Baseline and Intervention.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, approximately 2 weeks after consent/screening mammogram.</time_frame>
    <description>Distrust will be measured with the Revised Healthcare System Distrust Scale. This 9 question scale is divided into two subscales: competence and values. The questions are scored on a scale from 1-5. The total score will range 5-45, with higher scores indicating higher levels of trust. Baseline distrust measured at time of initial consent/screening. Post-intervention distrust measured at time of post-survey which took place approximately 2 weeks after screening (varied as to when patient could be reached for survey). Difference in distrust is subtracts the baseline score from the post score.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Reported Measures From the Satisfaction With Cancer Related Care Scale.</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 2 weeks after consent/screening mammogram.</time_frame>
    <description>Satisfaction with care will be measured with the Patient Satisfaction with Cancer-Related Care (PSCC) Measure. This is an 18 question measure. The questions are scored on a scale from 1-5. The total score will range 5-90, higher scores indicate higher satisfaction with care.</description>

        <title>Patient Reported Measures From Interpersonal Processes of Care Survey</title>
        <description>Selected scales (communication and interpersonal style) of the Interpersonal Processes of Care Survey will be the primary outcome. A total of 18 (corrected from orginal submission) questions will be administered. The questions are scored on a scale from 1-5 with higher scores indicating higher frequencies of the construct. The compiled scores will range from 5-90. Scales with negative associations (discrimination, hurried communication) will be reversed. Thus, higher scores for all items will indicate a more positive experience.</description>

        <title>Patient Reported Measures From the Distrust in the Healthcare System Scale. Reported at Baseline and Post Intervention. Also Reported as the Change Between Baseline and Intervention.</title>
        <description>Distrust will be measured with the Revised Healthcare System Distrust Scale. This 9 question scale is divided into two subscales: competence and values. The questions are scored on a scale from 1-5. The total score will range 5-45, with higher scores indicating higher levels of trust. Baseline distrust measured at time of initial consent/screening. Post-intervention distrust measured at time of post-survey which took place approximately 2 weeks after screening (varied as to when patient could be reached for survey). Difference in distrust is subtracts the baseline score from the post score.</description>
