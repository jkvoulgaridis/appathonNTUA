  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vaginal delivery is commonly accompanied by trauma of the genital tract. Perineal trauma is
      classified into four degrees based on anatomic structures involved and severity of
      lacerations according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (ACOG) and
      the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG). Episiotomy is an intentional
      perineal incision performed by midwifes or obstetricians to enlarge vaginal opening during
      the second stage of childbirth and has become the most common surgical procedure worldwide. A
      routine use of episiotomy was proposed to prevent severe spontaneous lacerations, although it
      failed to to demonstrate a clear protective role with no benefits both for mother and baby.
      Therefore the guidelines changed in a selective use of episiotomy, and we have introduced it
      in our routine obstetrics care. Nevertheless, second-degree lacerations comprise a wide range
      of lesions, from a minimal involvement to a massive damage of the perineal muscles.
      Therefore, it was never confirmed that selective use of episiotomy reduce the perianal trauma
      in the range of second degree lesions.

      We designed a prospective observational study with the introduction of a new classification
      of perineal trauma recorded with the usual data retrieved in delivery ward register. The aim
      is to definitively investigate if selective use of episiotomy reduce the overall perineal
      trauma.
