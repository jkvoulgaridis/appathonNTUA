  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Myoma of the uterus or uterine fibroids are benign tumors that appears in the myometrium or
      the muscular layer of the uterus. It is one of the most common diseases in pre-climax women,
      reaching 12-25% of all gynecological diseases. There is an opinion that the true prevalence
      of myoma is much larger and reaches up to 80%, i.e., practically every second woman has it,
      often without knowing about. For the treatment of MM, surgical removal of the nodes or
      removal of the uterus is used. In addition, GnRH-agonist therapy is practiced, as well as
      embolization to block blood flow in the tumor. We propose to evaluate the immunotherapy
      approach in an open label Phase II study in 20 women with myoma, for whom no alternative
      therapy is available.

      Myoma or uterine fibroids are one of the most common gynecological diseases, which occurs in
      at least one third of women older than 35 years, and after 40 - in every second. We will test
      a new tablet preparation, V3-Myoma, obtained from hydrolyzed, inactivated blood and tumor
      tissues of patients with uterine myoma. When administered orally, V3-Myoma should cause a
      specific anti-tumor immune response and an anti-inflammatory effect. Such an effect is due to
      the phenomenon known in immunology, called oral tolerance, leading to a reduction in tumor
      mass and a decrease in inflammation. An important advantage of our approach is the absence of
      any negative side effects. In the next three month, we will conduct Phase II open label
      clinical study of this intervention in 30 women with confirmed diagnosis of myoma.
