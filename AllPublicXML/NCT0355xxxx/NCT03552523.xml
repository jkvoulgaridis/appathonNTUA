  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our goal is to conduct an outpatient study testing the bionic pancreas in the insulin-only
      configuration at a set-point of 100 mg/dl in 10 adult (≥ 18 years of age) subjects with type
      2 diabetes in a random-order crossover study versus usual care with daily injections or an
      insulin pump.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of two 7 day study arms: one usual care, and one insulin-only bionic
      pancreas at a set point of 100 mg/dl. The co-primary outcomes will be the mean Dexcom CGM
      glucose level and time &lt;54 mg/dl, both in the last five days of each arm because these will
      be predictive of outcomes in long term use. The first two days will be excluded to allow for
      the extended washout of long acting insulins.

        Type 2 diabetes group: Age ≥18 years and clinical type 2 diabetes managed with:a multiple
        daily injection insulin regimen that includes NPH insulin and a rapid-acting insulin
        (insulin lispro, insulin aspart or insulin glulisine), an insulin pump filled with a rapid
        acting insulin, or a multiple daily injection insulin regimen that includes Lantus or
        Levemir and a rapid acting insulin.

        Hemoglobin A1c &gt;7%

        Prescription medication regimen stable for &gt; 1 month (except for medications that will not
        affect the safety of the study and are not expected to affect any outcome of the study, in
        the judgment of the principal investigator)

        Live within a 60 minute drive-time radius of the central monitoring location

        Willing to remain within a 120 minute drive-time radius of the central monitoring location
        throughout the study

        Have someone over 18 years of age who lives with them, has access to where they sleep, is
        willing to be in the house when the subject is sleeping, and is willing to receive calls
        from the study staff and check the welfare of the study subject if telemetry shows a
        technical problem or severe biochemical hypoglycemia without subject response and the
        subject does not answer their telephone (up to two individuals can share this role, but
        they must be willing to carefully coordinate with each other and the subject so that one of
        them is clearly designated as having this responsibility at any given time)

        Willing to wear one infusion set and one Dexcom CGM sensor and change sets frequently (an
        insulin infusion set every other day throughout the study) Have a mobile phone they are
        willing to keep with them and answer calls from study staff.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Unable to provide informed consent (e.g. impaired cognition or judgment)

        Unable to safely comply with study procedures and reporting requirements (e.g. impairment
        of vision or dexterity that prevents safe operation of the bionic pancreas, impaired
        memory, unable to speak and read English)

        Current participation in another diabetes-related clinical trial that, in the judgment of
        the principal investigator, will compromise the results of this study or the safety of the
        subject

        Pregnancy (positive urine HCG), breast feeding, plan to become pregnant in the immediate
        future, or sexually active without use of contraception Subjects must use acceptable
        contraception for the two weeks prior to the study, throughout the study and for the two
        weeks following the study. Acceptable contraception methods include: Oral contraceptive
        pill (OCP), Intrauterine Device (IUD, hormonal or copper), Male condoms, Female condoms,
        Diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide, Contraceptive patch (such as OrthoEvra),
        Contraceptive implant (such as Implanon, Nexplanon), Vaginal ring (such as NuvaRing),
        Progestin shot (such as Depo-Provera), Male partner with a vasectomy proven to be effective
        by semen analysis

        Need to go outside of the designated geographic boundaries during the study

        Current alcohol abuse (intake averaging &gt; 3 drinks daily in last 30 days), use of marijuana
        within 1 month of enrollment, or other substance abuse (use within the last 6 months of
        controlled substances other than marijuana without a prescription)

        Unwilling or unable to refrain from drinking more than 2 drinks in an hour or more than 4
        drinks in a day or use of marijuana during the trial

        Unwilling or unable or to avoid use of drugs that may dull the sensorium, reduce
        sensitivity to symptoms of hypoglycemia, or hinder decision making during the period of
        participation in the study (use of beta blockers will be allowed as long as the dose is
        stable and the subject does not meet the criteria for hypoglycemia unawareness while taking
        that stable dose, but use of benzodiazepines or narcotics, even if by prescription, may be
        excluded according to the judgment of the principal investigator)

        History of liver disease that is expected to interfere with the anti-hypoglycemia action of
        glucagon (e.g. liver failure or cirrhosis). Other liver disease (i.e. active hepatitis,
        steatosis, active biliary disease, any tumor of the liver, hemochromatosis, glycogen
        storage disease) may exclude the subject if it causes significant compromise to liver
        function or may do so in an unpredictable fashion.

        Renal failure on dialysis

        Personal history of cystic fibrosis, pancreatitis, pancreatic tumor, or any other
        pancreatic disease

        management including: unstable angina, angina that prevents moderate exercise (exercise of
        intensity up to 6 METS) despite medical management, myocardial infarction within the last
        12 months of screening.

        Known history of CAD that is not appropriately medically managed, e.g. not currently
        treated with ASA or other anti-platelet drug, a statin, and anti-hypertensives if indicated

        Known history of CAD but participant is currently smoking tobacco

        Abnormal EKG consistent with increased risk of malignant arrhythmia including, but not
        limited to, evidence of active ischemia, prior myocardial infarction, proximal LAD critical
        stenosis (Wellen's sign), prolonged QT interval (&gt; 440 ms). Other EKG findings, including
        stable Q waves, are not grounds for exclusion as long as the participant is not exclude
        according to other criteria. A reassuring evaluation by a cardiologist after an abnormal
        EKG finding may allow participation.

        Congestive heart failure with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Classification
        III or IV

        History of TIA or stroke in the last 12 months

        Seizure disorder, history of any non-hypoglycemic seizure within the last two years, or
        ongoing treatment with anticonvulsants

        History of hypoglycemic seizures (grand-mal) or coma in the last year

        susceptible to RF interference

        Unable to completely avoid acetaminophen for duration of study

        Established history of allergy or severe reaction to adhesive or tape that must be used in
        the study

        diabulemia or omission of insulin to manipulate weight

        History of intentional, inappropriate administration of insulin leading to severe
        hypoglycemia requiring treatment

        Use of oral anti-diabetic medications other than metformin

        Lives in or frequents areas with poor Verizon wireless network coverage (which would
        prevent remote monitoring)

        Any factors that, in the opinion of the principal investigator would interfere with the
        safe completion of the study
