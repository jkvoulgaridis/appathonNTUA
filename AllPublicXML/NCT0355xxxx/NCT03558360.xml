  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bariatric surgery is currently the only method that has proven long-term effectiveness in
      obesity. Although the benefit of physical activity on weight loss has been demonstrated, no
      correlation has ever been reported between preoperative lean body mass and postoperative
      weight loss. Dry lean mass is probably an essential prognostic factor for the effectiveness
      of bariatric surgery.

      The main objective of this study is to define a preoperative dry lean body mass threshold as
      a worst prognostic factor for weight loss one year after bariatric surgery.

      The management of patients included in this study was modelled on the management usually
      offered to patients followed for the same pathology in the diabeto-endocrinology department.
      There are no study-specific examinations that are not part of current practice.
