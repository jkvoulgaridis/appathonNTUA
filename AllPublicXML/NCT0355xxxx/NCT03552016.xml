  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan on using riboflavin (a Vitamin that can easily be taken orally each
      day) and having the children involved in the study play outside (where there is UV light
      created by the sun) in order to prevent the eye from becoming progressively more
      near-sighted.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Myopia is equivalent to the colloquial term known as near-sightedness. This, in short, means
      that the image of one's environment is projected in front of the retina (rather than directly
      on the retina, which is ideal). Of course, glasses can be used to correct the image disparity
      that is created by being near-sighted (that is why a lot of people need glasses for blurry
      vision). However, glasses and spectacles and contacts do not correct the underlying problem.
      Most near-sightedness is due to the eye being &quot;too long&quot; and therefore the image projects in
      front of the retina. Ideally, if we could prevent the eye from becoming abnormally &quot;long&quot;,
      then we could prevent the progression of near-sightedness. Indeed, a child may only be
      slightly near-sighted early in life, but as he/she continues to perform activities within an
      arms length of their environment, they can become progressively near-sighted. Besides
      spectacle correction, people have tried topical atropine drops (medicated eye drops) and
      rigid contact lenses (orthokeratology) to attempt to correct near-sightedness. Atropine drops
      take a lot of cooperation from parent and child. Orthokeratology also requires a lot of
      cooperation, but also, does not permanently stall myopic progression. The investigators
      suggest a different means of potentially preventing near-sightedness from getting worse (and
      thus prevent the eye from getting &quot;too long&quot;). The investigators plan on using riboflavin (a
      Vitamin that can easily be taken orally each day) and having the children involved in the
      study play outside (where there is UV light created by the sun) in order to prevent the eye
      from becoming progressively more near-sighted.

    <masking>Triple (Participant, Care Provider, Investigator)</masking>
    <masking_description>The researchers involved, the project investigator, and the patients will be blinded from knowing which patient will get which treatment by assigning a number to each patient and having that patient take that number to the pharmacy where they will pick up their riboflavin. The dosage of riboflavin given to the patient will be chosen by the &quot;number&quot; that the patient gives to the pharmacy. There will be no labels revealing the dose of riboflavin that the patient receives. There will be placebo dose which contains a small dose of riboflavin that has been shown to not reach therapeutic levels.</masking_description>
