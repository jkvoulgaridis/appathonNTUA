      This pilot trial studies how well a novel oral therapeutic agent performs to treat patients
      with atopic dermatitis, particularly facial dermatitis.

    <textblock>
      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Overall response rate of atopic dermatitis in subjects as assessed using Dermatology Life
      Quality Index (a 10 question questionnaire used to measure the impact of skin disease on the
      quality of life of an affected person)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. , Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI), Total Severity Scoring (TSS) II. Safety
      assessment after 8 weeks with 4 weeks of oral treatment. III. VAS (Visual Analogue Scale, an
      instrument for the assessment of pruritus) at baseline through eight weeks.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receiving novel oral agent once a week for 4 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.
