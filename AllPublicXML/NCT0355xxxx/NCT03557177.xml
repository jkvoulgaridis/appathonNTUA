  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      incidence is increasing1,2. Whilst the prognosis is very good with the vast majority of
      patients cured with orchidectomy alone, those with high risk stage one non seminomatous germ
      cell cancer (NSCGT) or metastatic disease (NSCGT or seminoma) are treated by surgery followed
      by chemotherapy. Platinum based chemotherapy is associated with long-term cardiovascular
      sequelae.

      Endothelial dysfunction is a key component of early atherogenesis and the later stages of
      obstructive atherosclerosis, plaque rupture and thrombus formation. Whilst endothelial toxic
      effects of BEP chemotherapy appear to be central in the pathophysiology of associated
      complications, abnormalities in endothelial function as assessed by measures of brachial
      artery flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) have not demonstrated a consistent effect over time.
      When assessed within ten weeks of platinum-based chemotherapy9, no change in FMD was observed
      whilst marked decreases are seen immediately following treatment11 and also one year
      following treatment12. Therefore, the time-course of endothelial vasomotor impairment remains
      incompletely defined in a single prospective cohort.

      There remains an unmet need to identify a preventive treatment for patients with testicular
      cancer treated with platinum based chemotherapy to diminish the substantial risk of
      subsequent cardiovascular events. A future randomised trial of statin therapy in these
      patients is under consideration and results from this pilot study will inform its design.

      Before moving towards interventional studies the proposed pilot study will enable a better
      understanding of the nature, time-course and dose-dependent effects of the mechanisms
      contributing to increased cardiovascular risk.

      Single-centre, prospective pilot study assessing the cardiovascular effects of treatment with
      orchidectomy or orchidectomy plus cisplatin based chemotherapy for testicular cancer.
