  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to describe the effect of direct IL-17A inhibition with secukinumab
      as compared with the selective inhibition of IL-23 with guselkumab (p19 subunit blocker) in
      controlling inflammation in psoriatic plaques that remain active despite treatment with the
      non-selective IL-23 inhibitor ustekinumab (blocker of p40 subunit, shared by IL-12 and IL
      23).

      This is a 16-week, randomized, open-label, parallel-group, active-control, Phase 2a study
      comparing secukinumab 300 mg s.c. versus guselkumab 100 mg s.c. in subjects with plaque
      psoriasis who had an inadequate response to ustekinumab. Forty subjects will be randomized
      1:1 and treated for 16 weeks. In each patient, a target active refractory skin plaque (TCS
      ≥6) will be described and biopsied at baseline and at study end. The objective of the study
      is to assess the superiority of secukinumab over guselkumab in achieving clear/almost clear
      status (TCS 0-2) of the target plaques and describe the molecular mechanisms behind this
      difference

             24 weeks. The last administration must be at least 12 weeks before randomization

          -  absolute PASI score of 1-10 at Screening

          -  Presence of at least 1 refractory skin plaque, defined by a TCS of at least 6 and

          -  Drug-induced psoriasis (i.e., new onset or current exacerbation from beta-blockers,
             calcium channel inhibitors or lithium) at Baseline

          -  Previous treatment with more than one TNFα inhibitor or with IL-17A (including

          -  Use of other investigational drugs within 4 weeks before enrolment, or within a period
             of 5 half lives of enrollment/initiation of the study treatment, whichever is longer

          -  Ongoing use of prohibited treatments (see Section 6.2.2)

          -  Known immunosuppression (e.g., AIDS) at Screening
