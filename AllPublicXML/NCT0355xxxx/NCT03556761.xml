      A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled single center investigation of furosemide's
      effect on postpartum blood pressure control in pregnancies affected by hypertensive disorders
      of pregnancy

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are recognized causes of significant maternal/fetal
      morbidity and mortality, accounting for approximately 18% of maternal deaths worldwide. While
      significant research has been done on the evaluation and management of hypertension during
      pregnancy, studies of postpartum hypertension (PPHTN) are usually limited by their
      retrospective design and focus on inpatients in the immediate postpartum period (2-6 days),
      or patients who were readmitted due to complications related to hypertension. Few studies
      have investigated the incidence and proper management of hypertension in the postpartum
      period. Furthermore, in the United Kingdom, a review of maternal deaths determined that 10%
      were related to hypertensive disorders in pregnancy (HDP) in the postpartum period.
      Postpartum hypertension is also the cause of approximately 27% of readmissions to the
      hospital. These studies clearly show that PPHTN is associated with significant morbidity and
      that it is important to develop interventions that can reduce its effects.

      In patients with HDP, postpartum blood pressure has been shown to decrease in the first 48
      hours postpartum only to then increase in days 3-6 postpartum. This phenomenon is thought to
      be secondary to large fluid shifts, both secondary from fluid retention during the pregnant
      state as well as from fluids given intrapartum. Furthermore, large volumes of sodium are also
      mobilized into the intravascular compartment at this time. Given the latter, furosemide, a
      loop diuretic that mobilizes sodium and fluid excretion has been posed as a method to prevent
      severe range blood pressures and their associated maternal morbidity in the postpartum
      period.
