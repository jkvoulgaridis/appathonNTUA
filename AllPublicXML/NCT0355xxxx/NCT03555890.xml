  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be an open-label, randomized 2-way cross-over study to evaluate
      bioequivalence study between levocetirizine ODT and levocetirizine IRT in healthy Japanese
      male subjects. Approximately 48 subjects will participate in this study to receive a single
      dose treatments of levocetirizine ODT 5 milligram (mg) or levocetirizine IRT 5 mg. In Part 1,
      subjects will randomized in 1:1 ratio (12 in each Period) in Period 1 and 2 to receive single
      dose of levocetirizine ODT 5 mg with water or single dose levocetirizine IRT 5 mg with water
      in fasted state. In this part, comparison of bioavailability of levocetirizine ODT and
      levocetirizine IRT when taken with water in the fasted state will be assessed. In Part 2,
      subjects will be randomized in 1:1 ratio (12 in each Period) in Period 1 and 2 to receive
      single dose levocetirizine ODT 5 mg without water or single dose levocetirizine IRT 5 mg with
      water in fasted state. In this part, comparison of bioavailability of levocetirizine ODT
      without water and levocetirizine IRT with water in the fasted state will be assessed. There
      will be at least a 5-day wash out period between the intervention periods. The duration of
      each subject's participation in each part will be approximately 7 weeks from screening to
      follow-up.

    <description>Urine samples were collected for the measurement of urine pH. Urine pH is an acid-base measurement. pH is measured on a numeric scale ranging from 0 to 14; values on the scale refer to the degree of alkalinity or acidity. A pH of 7 is neutral. A pH less than 7 is acidic, and a pH greater than 7 is basic. Normal urine has a slightly acid pH (5.0 - 6.0).</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This was a single center, single dose, open-label, randomized, 2-part, 2-way crossover study. Bioequivalence (BE) between levocetirizine (levo) oral disintegrating tablet (ODT) and levocetirizine immediate release tablet (IRT) was evaluated in 72 healthy Japanese participants.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 133 participants were screened, of them, 72 participants were randomized to receive study treatment. All participants except one participant randomized in Part 2 (Initial study) completed the study.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Part 2: Change From Baseline in Amylase Levels</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected for the assessment of clinical chemistry parameters. Change from Baseline in amylase levels were evaluated. The Baseline value was the latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including those from unscheduled visits. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline value from the post-dose visit value.</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected for the assessment of clinical chemistry parameters. Change from Baseline in calcium, cholesterol, chloride, glucose, high density lipids cholesterol, potassium, low density lipids cholesterol, sodium, phosphorus inorganic, triglycerides and urea/BUN levels were evaluated.

        <description>Blood samples were collected for the assessment of hematology parameters. Change from Baseline in basophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, monocytes and total neutrophils levels were evaluated. The Baseline value was the latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including those from unscheduled visits. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline value from the post-dose visit value.</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected for the assessment of hematology parameters. Change from Baseline in hematocrit was evaluated. The Baseline value was the latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including those from unscheduled visits. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline value from the post-dose visit value.</description>

        <title>Part 2: Change From Baseline in Red Blood Cell Count</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected for the assessment of hematology parameters. Change from Baseline in red blood cell count was evaluated. The Baseline value was the latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including those from unscheduled visits. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline value from the post-dose visit value.</description>

The dipstick test gives results in a semi-quantitative manner, and results for urinalysis parameter of urine bilirubin, urine occult blood, urine glucose, urine ketones, urine protein and urine urobilinogen can be read as negative (-), trace and 1+ indicating proportional concentrations in the urine sample.

        <description>Urine samples were collected to assess urine bilirubin, urine occult blood, urine glucose, urine ketones, urine protein and urine urobilinogen by dipstick test. The dipstick test gives results in a semi-quantitative manner, and results for urinalysis parameter of urine bilirubin, urine occult blood, urine glucose, urine ketones, urine protein and urine urobilinogen can be read as negative (-), trace and 1+ indicating proportional concentrations in the urine sample.

        <description>Urine samples were collected for the measurement of urine pH. Urine pH is an acid-base measurement. pH is measured on a numeric scale ranging from 0 to 14; values on the scale refer to the degree of alkalinity or acidity. A pH of 7 is neutral. A pH less than 7 is acidic, and a pH greater than 7 is basic. Normal urine has a slightly acid pH (5.0 - 6.0).</description>

        <title>Part 1: Urine Specific Gravity</title>
        <description>Urine samples were collected for the measurement of specific gravity. Urine specific gravity is a measure of the concentration of solutes in the urine and provides information on the kidney's ability to concentrate urine. The concentration of the excreted molecules determines the urine's specific gravity. The urinary specific gravity measurement is a routine part of urinalysis. The reference range is 1.002-1.030.</description>

        <description>Heart rate was measured in supine position after 5 minutes rest. Change from Baseline in heart rate was evaluated. The Baseline value was the latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including those from unscheduled visits. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline value from the post-dose visit value.</description>

        <description>Single 12-lead ECG was obtained using an ECG machine that automatically calculates the heart rate and measures PR, QRS, QT, and QT interval with Fridericia's correction (QTcF). Change from Baseline in heart rate (ECG) was evaluated. The Baseline value was the latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including those from unscheduled visits. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline value from the post-dose visit value.</description>

          <description>Single 12-lead ECG was obtained using an ECG machine that automatically calculates the heart rate and measures PR, QRS, QT, and QT interval with Fridericia's correction (QTcF). Change from Baseline in heart rate (ECG) was evaluated. The Baseline value was the latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including those from unscheduled visits. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline value from the post-dose visit value.</description>
