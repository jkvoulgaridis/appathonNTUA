  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the feasibility of Vanadis NIPT for screening of T21, T18 and T13. The
      results obtained from Vanadis NIPT will be compared with the study site's current prenatal
      screening methods. The primary objectives are: 1) To assess the feasibility of Vanadis NIPT
      for screening of T21, T18 and T13 in the maternal healthcare setting, 2) To assess
      preliminary performance of Vanadis NIPT for screening of T21 in comparison to site's routine
      screening methods i.e. combined and integrated tests, and 3) To evaluate preliminary cost
      effectiveness of Vanadis NIPT use in different models. The secondary objective is to assess
      the feasibility of Vanadis NIPT regarding determination of fetal sex.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assess the feasibility of Vanadis NIPT for screening of T21, T18 and T13 in comparison to fetal karyotype from invasive testing, and by evaluating overall usability of the test in routine laboratory work.</measure>
    <time_frame>Three weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation includes the follow up for each woman and matching the results of combined and integrated test and with the results of NIPT and karyotype. Feasibility will be assessed by determining the concordance between chromosomal abnormalities determined by Vanadis NIPT and trisomies confirmed by karyotype analysis, and by assessing the overall usability in the public healthcare setting by evaluating e.g. turnaround time and user friendliness.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluate preliminary cost effectiveness of Vanadis NIPT by evaluating resources, false positive rates and detection rates</measure>
    <time_frame>Three weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Cost effectiveness will be evaluated when the test is offered to all women or only women with T21 risk between 1:100 and 1:2500 or between 1:11 and 1:1000, or alternatively to 3000 or 10000 women annually. Cost effectiveness will be assessed by taking into account the costs of NIPT, combined test, invasive procedure, fetal karyotype and counselling, the potential benefits (rate of reduction of invasive procedures, miscarriages, births with trisomy 21) and births with chromosomal diseases undetectable with NIPT.</description>
