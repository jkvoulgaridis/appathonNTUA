      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate whether use of antidepressants can reduce
      gingival inflammation in patients with periodontal (gum) disease. This study will also
      investigate the link between oral and systemic inflammation in patients diagnosed with
      depression and periodontal disease. Researcher will collect gingival crevicular fluid,
      plaque, tissue and blood serum samples to evaluate the link between these two diseases. The
      collection of gingival crevicular fluid, plaque and blood serum is relatively non-invasive,
      elicits minimal discomfort and does not require use of any anesthesia. The soft tissue sample
      will be collected as part of an otherwise planned periodontal surgical procedure under local
      anesthesia. In periodontal therapy (surgical procedures i.e. gum surgery, tooth extraction
      and or dental implant surgery) there is enough availability of remnant tissue for the
      collection of samples, which is otherwise discarded.
