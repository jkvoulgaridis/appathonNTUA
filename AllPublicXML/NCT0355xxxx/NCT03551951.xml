      Patients with resectable solid primary cancers and even limited number of metastases are
      potentially curable. However, most patients develop recurrences despite surgery. Also, early
      detection of lung cancer with low dose CT screening may cure patients at an early stage.
      Circulating and disseminated tumor cell (CTC/DTC) and circulating cell-free (cf) DNA
      isolation from the blood, urine and bone marrow will increase understanding of cancer spread
      and advance knowledge to develop individualized therapies and improve screening.

      Background: Patients with resectable solid primary cancers and even limited number of
      metastases are potentially curable. However, most patients develop recurrences despite
      surgery. Circulating and disseminated tumor cell (CTC/DTC) and circulating cell-free (cf) DNA
      isolation from the blood, urine and bone marrow will increase understanding of cancer spread
      and advance knowledge to develop individualized therapies. These liquid biomarkers might also
      be suitable for screening purposes and early detection of in high risk subjects for lung
      cancer.

      Hypothesis and Rationale: CTCs/DTCs and cfDNA isolated from the blood, urine and bone marrow
      undergo pheno- and/or genotype changes. CTCs/DTCs have potential for dissemination and tumor
      growth in vivo. Investigating the biology of liquid biomarkers in the blood, urine and bone
      marrow will significantly increase understanding of cancer biology of early and advanced
      stages.

      Specific Aims: CTCs/DTCs and cfDNA will be quantified and characterized for genetic
      alterations and expression of key signaling/proliferation biomarkers and grow in vivo in nude
      mice.

      Study Design: 100 cancer patients will be recruited for CTC/DTC/cfDNA isolation from the
      blood, urine and bone marrow with innovative techniques. Bone marrow will be drawn only
      perioperatively in cancer patients undergoing anesthesia for surgery. 200 high-risk
      individuals undergoing lung cancer screening with a low dose CT will also be included for
      blood and urine collection to test the usefulness of these liquid biomarkers for early
      detection of lung cancer. In addition, 20 individuals with benign disease will also be
      included as controls. CTCs/DTCs, cfDNA and cancer tissue pheno- and/or genotype analysis will
      be performed with different innovative techniques. Furthermore, CTCs/DTCs will be enriched,
      cultured and characterized. Tumor growth potential will be studied in nude mice.

      Relevance: This study addresses fundamental aspects of cancer disease being the cause of
      death in 1 out of 4 persons in the US. Innovative CTCs/DTCs characterization can shed light
      on the tumor biology, and identify therapy targets. Results of this study can be
      fundamentally important to understanding cancer spread and development of personalized
      therapies, and improve early detection.

          -  Subjects of all genders and ethnicities.

          -  Subjects with the diagnosis of a solid cancer (n=100) of all stages will be included
             (lung, esophageal, stomach, bile duct/pancreas, colorectal, melanoma, sarcoma).

          -  In patients undergoing surgery for cancer the histopathology should preferably be
             pathologically proven by a previous or novel biopsy. Yet, patients with a high cancer
             suspicion by radiology and clinical picture that undergo cancer surgery will not be
             excluded. No additional biopsies, testing or interventions will be performed for the
             purpose of this study if the medical treatment will not require it.

          -  Subjects must be capable of giving informed consent.

          -  Lung cancer screening eligibility criteria (n=100): 55-80 years old, &gt;30 pack years
             smoking history, and current smoker or have quit within the last 15 years)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant women.

          -  Subjects with the concurrent diagnosis of an active secondary (synchronous) malignancy
             besides basal cell carcinoma of the skin will be excluded, if there is evidence of
             disease burden or if the patient is currently being treated with chemotherapy.

          -  Subjects with a hemoglobin of &lt;8g/dl in the morning of the procedure will be excluded.

          -  In subjects who require intraoperative transfusions of &gt;4 units of red packed blood
             cells (RPBCs), no further blood will be drawn for CTC/DTC/cfDNA analysis during
             surgery or on postoperative day 1.

          -  In patients with coagulation disorders that could lead to significant bleeding (such
             as hemophilia, significant thrombocytopenia) requiring prophylactic administration of
             coagulative products, no bone marrow aspiration will be performed.
