    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a study drug
      known as LY3471851 in participants with SLE. The study will last about 79 days for each
      participant.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      LY3471851 is a potential first-in-class therapeutic that may address an underlying immune
      system imbalance in people with many autoimmune conditions. It targets the interleukin (IL-2)
      receptor complex in the body in order to stimulate proliferation of inhibitory immune cells
      known as regulatory T cells. By activating these cells, LY3471851 may act to bring the immune
      system back into balance.

      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and immunologic
      effects of multiple doses of LY3471851 in participants with minimal to moderate SLE. The
      effects on SLE disease activity will also be evaluated. SLE participants will be randomized
      to receive multiple subcutaneous (SC) doses of LY3471851 or receive placebo. After receiving
      the last dose of LY3471851 or placebo, participants will be followed for an additional 50
      days to evaluate safety, PK, pharmacodynamics (PD), and preliminary efficacy.
