  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is widely acknowledged that the transition from paediatric to adult health services should
      be a multidimensional and multidisciplinary process that addresses the medical, psychosocial,
      and educational needs of adolescents and young adults (AYA). Despite this, there is currently
      a scarcity of research examining the relationships between psychosocial factors (e.g.,
      anxiety, social support) and transition readiness in AYA with uveitis. This study therefore
      aims to examine the relationships between psychosocial factors and transition readiness in
      pre-transfer adolescents and post-transfer young adults aged 10-25 years diagnosed with JIA
      at a single centre.

      In total, 25 adolescents aged 10-16 years, together with a parent/guardian, will participate
      at Sheffield Children's Hospital and 10 young adults aged 16-25 years will participate at
      Sheffield Teaching Hospitals. Participants completed a battery of self-report questionnaire
      measuring psychosocial factors (anxiety/depression, social support, family functioning,
      health-related quality of life) and transition readiness (transition knowledge and skills,
      self-efficacy). Uveitis disease severity was also measured during clinic appointments. A
      subset of participants will also be asked to take part in a focus group. This study received
      full ethical approval, and all participants will give their written informed assent or
      consent before taking part.
