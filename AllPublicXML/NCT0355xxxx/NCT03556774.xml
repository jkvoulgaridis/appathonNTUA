  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this single-blind, randomized trial, undertaken in China with 8-week interventions and
      follow-up to 52 weeks, about 2,200 providers will be randomly allocated to the intervention
      or control group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have been showed that providing behavioral and pharmacotherapy interventions
      for cigarette smoking patients was effective but rare among Chinese healthcare service
      providers. In order to minimize the huge gap between the shortage and demand for smoking
      cessation training program and smoking cessation service, this 'WeChat WeQuit' smoking
      cessation training program has been designed to assess whether it will increase Chinese
      healthcare service providers' utilization of behavioral and pharmacotherapy interventions for
      cigarette smoking cessation or not.

      In this single-blind, randomized trial, about 2200 HSPs will be randomly selected (by
      randomizeR, https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=randomizeR) to 8-week intervention (behavioral
      and pharmacotherapy interventions for cigarette smoking patients to help them quit smoking)
      group or control group that only communicates without any standard smoking cessation
      practices related messages, and follow-up to 52 weeks. The trial will be carried out in into
      two phases, the first phase is the pilot study (n=200, 8-week intervention and follow-up to
      16 weeks) and the second is the main study (n=2000, 8-week intervention and follow-up to 52
      weeks). It is hypothesized that 'WeChat WeQuit' training program will improve Chinese HSPs'
      utilization of behavioral and pharmacotherapy interventions for cigarette smoking cessation
      and increase quit rate for smoking patients.

    <description>Participants who allocate to the intervention group will receive regular smoking cessation training program messages by professional team. One to six messages will be sent per day for 8 weeks. Hand copy of behavioral and pharmacotherapy interventions manual will send to each HSP by mail after randomization. One to three messages will be sent per week until the end of the 1-year follow-up. They will also be encouraged to communicate the experience of using behavioral and pharmacotherapy interventions in their group.</description>

    <description>Control group participants will not receive any smoking cessation messages by professional team. They will receive messages of thanking them for being in the study and reminding them of the time until 52-week follow-up. One to six messages will be sent per week for 8 weeks.
