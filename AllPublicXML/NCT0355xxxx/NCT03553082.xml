  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: The removal of Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA) in children may be associated with
      respiratory adverse events. The incidence of these adverse events may be influenced by the
      type of anesthesia maintenance. It is not clear whether Total Intravenous Anesthesia (TIVA)
      with propofol is associated with a lower incidence of respiratory events upon removal of LMA
      as compared to maintenance with sevoflurane.

      Specific Aim: The primary aim of this study is to compare the prevalence of respiratory
      adverse events following LMA removal in patient receiving TIVA versus sevoflurane
      inhalational anesthesia in a pediatric population aged between 6 month and 6 years old.
      Secondary outcomes include quality of induction, maintenance and emergence from anesthesia
      between the 2 groups as evidenced by ease of LMA insertion, absence of bucking or movement
      during the procedure, time to LMA removal, and absence of emergence agitation.

      Methods: In this prospective randomized clinical trial, children will be enrolled in one of
      two groups: Group 1 will receive propofol for induction and maintenance of anesthesia, Group
      2 will receive sevoflurane for induction and maintenance of anesthesia. In both groups
      patients will be mechanically ventilated. At the end of the procedure, LMAs will be removed
      when patients are fully awake as defined by the return of reflexes, eye opening, and
      purposeful movements.

      Significance: Data comparing the influence of TIVA and sevoflurane on the occurrence of
      respiratory adverse events after LMA removal are limited. Both techniques are standard of
      care at our institution. However, as per our clinical observations, we hypothesize that TIVA
      is superior to sevoflurane. This study will identify the technique that provides optimal
      anesthetic conditions and improved patient's safety.
