  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study AG348-C-007 is a multicenter study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      treatment with AG-348 in a minimum of 20, with up to 40, subjects with pyruvate kinase
      deficiency (PKD), who are regularly receiving blood transfusions. The study is comprised of
      two parts. During the Part 1 Dose Optimization Period of the study, all participants will
      start on a dose of 5 mg AG-348 administered twice daily. Over the course of Part 1 each
      participant's dose will be optimized individually, up to a maximum dose of 50 milligrams
      (mg), twice daily. During the Part 2 Fixed-Dose Period, participants will receive AG-348 at
      their optimized dose from Part 1.
