  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the clinical curative effect of
      mindfulness-based cognitive therapy(MBCT) for major depressive disorder(MDD). Moreover, we
      will also explore the relationship between P300 potential and erroneous negative potential
      (ERN) variation and clinical symptoms in MDD and MBCT.

      This study is a randomized-control trial with two study arms: half of patient cases will
      receive usual medication treatment with the serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and half of
      patient cases will receive MBCT added to the usual medication treatment. This study is also a
      case-control trial, there will be matched normal controls compared with patient cases through
      a range of psychological scales and electroencephalogram.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as a prospective, assessor-blinded, randomized-control, case-control
      clinical trial with 70 MDD cases and 35 matched normal controls.After signed the Informed
      consents, MDD cases will be assigned to two groups randomly by the table generated by
      Microsoft Excel 2010 to ensure the random distribution between groups. The group of each
      patient will be allotted by the research coordinator so that evaluators will be blind about
      it, and patients will be asked to not mention the intervention conditions to evaluators.

      As the research tools, a range of self-rating scales, other-rating scales and behavioral
      tests and EEG will be mainly applied to assess clinical symptoms and brain state of
      participants at baseline (week 0), during the intervention (week 2, 4 and 6), at the end of
      the intervention (week 8), and during the maintenance phase (week 12, 20 and 32).

      After 8-week intervention, all of the participants including MDD cases and normal controls
      will enter the follow-up. Participants of medication group will continue their treatment
      options without changing the types and doses of medication compared with what they used in
      the intervention period. MBCT group is the same that participants will maintain their
      medication treatment and practice MBCT exercises at home.

    <description>The Hamilton Depression Scale-24 (HAMD-24) is the most common other-rating scale to measure the severity of depression symptoms for adult. It is a clinical instrument with good validity and reliability, and most of the 24 items weighted from 0 to 4.</description>

    <description>The Self Compassion Scale (SCS) is proved to be an instrument featured good characteristics for reliability and validity. There are 26 items divided into 6 Subscales (out of 5 points from almost never to almost always), including self-kindness, self-judgment, common humanity, isolation, mindfulness and over-identification.</description>

    <description>MBCT group is a treatment group used mindfulness- based cognitive therapy added to the usual medication treatment, and guided by two therapists for 8 sessions. Every group of 6 people can form a closed structural group. Each session lasts 2 hours once a week, and has daily homework assignments.</description>

    <description>Medication group is a control group that can choose to use the serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) approved by China food and Drug Administration (SFDA) for the treatment of depression (fluoxetine, paroxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline, citalopram and escitalopram).</description>

    <description>Patients participating in the experimental group will receive the MBCT intervention besides the usual medication treatment. The intervention is implemented by the manual adapted from the MBCT for Depression (Segal et al. 2013). The modified version of the program has the same structure with the original manual combined the mindfulness training and the cognitive elements from CBT, but the content is more suitable for the Chinese. The instructors in this study are trained and certificated psychiatrists and psychotherapists with rich experience of working with MDD, and they will receive a weekly supervision conducted by a senior supervisor.</description>

    <description>Both of the MBCT group and the medication group will receive the medication treatment. The initial dose conforms the drug instructions, the dosage can be adjusted once a week, and the maximum dosage should not exceed the maximum amount by the instructions. MDD patients with sleep disorders can use drugs combined with benzodiazepine drugs, but not continuing for more than two weeks; while other psychotropic drugs are not allowed. All of the drugs used in this study are usual clinical drugs with good security, the common adverse reactions include nausea, dry mouth, constipation, diarrhea, indigestion, dizziness, drowsiness, fatigue, sweating, heart palpitations, delayed ejaculation in male, increasing blood aminotransferase without symptoms occasionally and so on.</description>
