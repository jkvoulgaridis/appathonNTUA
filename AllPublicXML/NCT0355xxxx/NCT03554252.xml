  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be randomly given one of two formats containing descriptions of health
      interventions. In one format, participants will have to read short summaries where results of
      the intervention are presented as frequencies and the side effects of health intervention are
      presented as percentages, while in another format the frames will be reversed (results will
      be presented as percentages and side effects as frequencies). After reading, participants
      will be asked several questions about the content of the summary and its conclusions.

    <description>Number of the correct answers about the content of the summary, which will consist of four multiple choice questions (with four possible answers where only one is correct, for each question) about the text the participants are reading. Questions will be developed by research team and revised by expert in health communication. The scale ranges from 0-4, where greater score indicates better understanding of the material.</description>

    <measure>Health numeracy</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>5 questions about the numerical tasks placed in medical content, total score is number of correct answers on those questions. The five questions are part of Numeracy Understanding in Medicine Instrument (Schapira et al, 2012), and we will translate only the questions focusing on Probability section. Cronbach's alpha in previous research was 0.86 (Schapira et al, 2012). The questions will be revised by independent translator and back translated to English. The scale range is from 0-5, where higher score indicates higher numeracy levels.</description>
