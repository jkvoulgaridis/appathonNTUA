  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will collect serum and urine specimens from pregnant patients along the full
      pregnancy continuum, assay each specimen for selected placental proteins, and examine the
      relationships between concentrations of the proteins and gestational age as determined by
      ultrasound.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will collect serum and urine specimens from pregnant patients along with
      ultrasound results and information about factors that may affect the concentrations of
      proteins or the estimation of gestational age. Investigators will obtain data across the full
      pregnancy continuum but we will over sample patients within five gestational weeks before and
      after the 10 week mark.

      Investigators will assay each specimen for selected placental proteins (Human placental
      lactogen (HPL), Schwangerschaftsprotein 1 (SP1), Pregnancy-associated plasma protein A
      (PAPP-A), A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase 12 (ADAM12), and Human chorionic gonadotropin
      (HGC)) and any other proteins of interest identified prior to running assays and will examine
      the relationships between concentrations of the proteins and gestational age as determined by
      ultrasound.

      The goal is to identify at least one compound and a concentration threshold for that compound
      that can be used for differentiating pregnancies of less than 10 weeks in duration from later
      pregnancies.
