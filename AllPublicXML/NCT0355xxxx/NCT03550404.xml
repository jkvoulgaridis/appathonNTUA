    <textblock>
      This community-driven study features a mixed-method, participatory design to examine
      help-seeking behavior and healthcare experiences of American Indian elders in New Mexico, in
      order to develop and evaluate a tailored intervention to enhance knowledge of, access to, and
      use of insurance and available services to reduce healthcare disparities. This study includes
      qualitative and quantitative interviews combined with concept mapping and focus groups with
      American Indian elders and other key stakeholders.

      This five-year project was developed by investigators from the Behavioral Health Research
      Center of the Southwest (BHRCS), a center of the Pacific Institute of Research and Evaluation
      (PIRE), the Health Committee of the New Mexico Indian Council on Aging (NMICoA), and the
      University of New Mexico (UNM). The project combines qualitative and quantitative interviews
      with concept-mapping (CM) techniques and focus groups to study insurance coverage,
      help-seeking behavior, and the healthcare experiences of American Indian Elders (AIEs) in New
      Mexico (NM). Practical knowledge grounded in the actual perspectives of AIEs and other key
      stakeholders may improve healthcare practices and policies for a population largely excluded
      from national and state discussions of health reform. The study data will also inform the
      adaptation and development of culturally tailored programming to enrich understanding and
      facilitate negotiation of a changing landscape of healthcare by AIEs. Our four specific aims
      are to:

        1. Assess how AIEs understand, access, maintain, and use insurance coverage.

        2. Characterize AIE help-seeking and healthcare experiences in dominant service delivery
           settings, i.e., Indian Health Service (IHS), tribally-run 638 facilities, and managed
           care programs.

        3. Identify and compare factors that affect AIE access to health care as perceived by
           multiple stakeholders, i.e., AIEs, outreach workers (OWs), healthcare staff and
           providers, public sector administrators, and tribal leaders.

        4. Develop and assess implementation feasibility of a structured intervention for OWs that
           promotes enhanced patient navigation, in addition to healthcare literacy, access, and
           usage among AIEs.

    <description>AIE Navigators will use the Seasons of Care app in the context of their everyday outreach work with AIEs over two four-month intervention periods (P1 and P2). Their goal will be to facilitate health literacy to shift attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors to create a &quot;Culture of Coverage&quot; for AIEs at individual, organizational/community, and policy levels. Separated by distance, the AIE Navigators will receive coaching as necessary, using virtual meeting space, to help refine their implementation skills from a member of the research team with experience in AIE health outreach.</description>

    <description>A web-based mobile application (app) called the Seasons of Care Elder Navigation Guide will assist elders, their families/caregivers, healthcare providers, outreach workers, and other community members in navigating healthcare and insurance systems. The app has the added advantage of being easy to update to respond to future changes in health care and insurance, and sustainable because it is not dependent on intensive training, developing, and retaining of individuals in professional navigation positions.</description>
