  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The vast majority of patients receive neuromuscular blockers during surgical procedures,
      either as a single injection to facilitate intubation or as repeated injections to induce
      muscle relaxation necessary for surgery. The action of neuromuscular blockers is monitored by
      measuring the contraction force of the adductor of the thumb after stimulation of the ulnar
      nerve.Different types of stimulation, such as train-of-four (TOF), post- Tetanus count (PTC),
      double-burst stimulation (DBS) measure different degrees of curarization.The duration of
      action of neuromuscular blockers has significant interindividual variability. If the
      investigators know how to measure the degree of curarization of a patient at a given time, it
      is difficult to know how long it will take to recover neuromuscular function.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if the individual recovery of a patient can be
      predicted form data obtained at the beginning of his/her recovery curve. The investigators
      propose to record all neuromuscular transmission monitoring data in 100 patients. From these
      data, the investigators will try to develop an algorithm that would extrapolate the recovery
      curve of an isolated patient from the fist neuromuscular monitoring data.

    <description>Monitoring of neuromuscular transmission will be done by TOFScan (IdMed, Marseille, France). This device is CE marked, and is used routinely in daily clinical practice. Prior to induction of anesthesia, the TOFScan is placed on a patient's hand and the two stimulation electrodes (ECG electrodes) are placed at the level of the ulnar nerve at the wrist. After induction of anesthesia and before administration of a curare, the TOFScan is calibrated according to the manufacturer's instructions. The TOFScan is placed in automatic mode, it will then automatically adapt its mode of stimulation to the depth of the curarization. The TOFScan measurements will be recorded on a PC connected to the TOFScan.</description>
