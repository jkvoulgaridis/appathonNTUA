  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current opioid epidemic has led to a renewed interest in exploring non-pharmacological
      techniques to treat post-operative pain. An increasing number of patients are suffering from
      the adverse effects of opioid use following surgery, including post-operative nausea and
      vomiting, respiratory depression, immunosuppression, constipation, and most recently,
      addiction. In the United States, over $600 billion is spent every year on opioid addiction,
      including $79 billion related to opioid addiction following surgery. Despite many initiatives
      to decrease the use of opiates in the preoperative setting, opioids continue to be regularly
      prescribed before, during and after surgery. Although the risk of opioid addiction following
      surgery is recognized, the percentage of patients becoming addicted to opioids following
      surgery is not well understood. To date, there has been virtually no agreement regarding the
      duration and dosage that qualify for opioid dependence following surgery, nor that a clear
      estimation of the factors such as biological, psychosocial and socioeconomic that increase
      the risk of using opioids for extended periods of time after surgery. Therefore, in order to
      combat this growing health crisis at the ground level, it is incumbent upon the medical
      community to explore alternative methods of pain control to treat the surgical population in
      order to reduce the incidence of post-operative opioid addiction.

      Percutaneous Nerve Field Stimulation (PNFS) is one of these recognized methods that ongoing
      research has shown to be effective as a complementary method of pain management. While PNFS
      is not a novel concept, clinical indications of auricular field stimulation have been limited
      in the past due to requirement of bulky, stationary and non-disposable stimulators and
      electrodes. These technological limitations made it difficult to establish the real clinical
      potential of auricular stimulation for the perioperative management of pain in surgical
      patients, despite the demonstration that auriculotherapy has been shown to relieve pain in
      the postoperative setting.

      The NSS-2 BRIDGE is a battery operated and disposable percutaneous auricular nerve field
      stimulator (Innovative Health Solutions, Versailles, IN, USA), that was recently cleared by
      the FDA and assigned a Class II Risk Designation; a class which includes surgical drapes,
      pumps and power wheelchairs. The indication for the NSS-2 BRIDGE is for the treatment of
      clinical symptoms related to opioid consumption and opioid withdrawal. These symptoms include
      abdominal pain, anxiety and post-operative nausea and vomiting; conditions which are also
      present following major oncologic abdominal surgery. The use of the NSS-2 BRIDGE device has
      been demonstrated to provide significant analgesia in patients with abdominal pain syndrome,
      and clinical trials are ongoing to assess the benefit of this approach for post-operative
      pain management. As compared to the present use of opioids for perioperative pain management,
      the use of a complementary, non-pharmacologic approach offers the advantage of analgesia
      without the associated side effects.

      Potential subjects (from both the prospective interventional and control groups) will be
      recruited in the pre-surgical clinic of Dr. David Bartlett once they are scheduled for major
      abdominal surgery. Patients will be asked for their interest in pursuing a research study
      that involves wearing a percutaneous, auricular field stimulator for five days as a
      supplementary method of post-operative pain control. Patients who agree to participate in the
      trial will sign an IRB approved Informed Consent Form.

      Once patient has signed the Informed Consent to participate in this pilot study, demographic
      information and medical history will be collected from each participant on the day of
      surgery. The NSS-2 BRIDGE device will be applied to the ear by Dr. Jacques Chelly or Research
      Coordinator Amy Monroe in the immediate post-operative setting (PACU), as Dr. Chelly and Amy
      Monroe have both completed the necessary training required by the company to apply the
      device. Rescue analgesia will be permitted as per the approved ERAS multi-modal anesthetic
      protocol, however, the patient will be made aware at the time of consent and throughout the
      trial that they can drop out of the study at any time if they do not like wearing the NSS- 2
      BRIDGE device.

      Randomization of both groups will occur by assigning the participant a subject ID number, and
      this ID number will correspond to a treatment allocation based on a pre-designed
      randomization schema. This treatment allocation (intervention/control) will be contained in a
      sealed, opaque, envelope with the subject ID number that is designated on envelope. The
      master randomization list will be created and held by an independent data monitor who will
      both create and hold the master randomization list.

      The patient will be assessed 12, 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 hours post-operatively to collect
      total opioid consumption, incidence of adverse events, and level of comfort while wearing the
      NSS-2 BRIDGE device. Additional data that will be collected includes total post-operative
      narcotic consumption, PACU narcotic consumption, time to readiness for discharge from PACU,
      time to bowel movement, time to oral intake (liquid and regular diet), time to hospital
      discharge, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, readmission to the hospital, percentage of
      patients readmitted because of pain related issues, overall patient satisfaction, patient
      satisfaction relating to pain management When the patient is discharged from the hospital,
      they will be asked to complete a patient satisfaction survey. For patients discharged with
      the device attached, removal instructions and pre-paid return envelope will be given to
      patient to remove the device at 120 hours and send back to the hospital. The patient will be
      contacted 3 months post-operatively to again assess patient satisfaction with the pain
      management after surgery, and to assess functional recovery.

      Post-operative nausea and/or vomiting will be evaluated by nausea score (0-10). Frequency of
      emesis and rescue antiemetic requirement will be collected per the institution's standard of
      care and transcribed from the medical record by research staff.

      Standard opioid conversion table will be used to convert the oral and IV narcotic utilized by
      the patients to IV morphine equivalent doses (MED) for analysis purposes.

      Time to patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) initiation on the floor will also be measured, as
      well as total PCA hydromorphone consumption over the 120-hour postoperative period.

      Overall patient satisfaction and satisfaction of pain management during hospitalization will
      be measured by a numerical rating scale with 0- worst satisfaction and 10 being the best
      satisfaction. The patient satisfaction test will be administered by a member of the research
      team.

      Number of patients with unsatisfactory pain relief defined as average Numerical Rating Scale
      (NRS) more than 5 with or without requirement of IVPCA for pain relief during the first 120
      hours postoperative period will be compared between the two groups and form the primary
      outcome for the study.

      Secondary outcome measures will include total post-operative narcotic consumption, PACU
      narcotic consumption, time to readiness for discharge from PACU, time to bowel movement, time
      to oral intake (liquid and regular diet), time to hospital discharge, intensive care unit
      (ICU) admission, readmission to the hospital, percentage of patients readmitted because of
      pain related issues, overall patient satisfaction, patient satisfaction relating to pain
      management, and cost analyses. Overall patient satisfaction and satisfaction of pain
      management during hospitalization will be measured by a numerical rating scale with 0- worst
      satisfaction and 10 being the best satisfaction. This patient satisfaction score will
      administered by member of research team.
