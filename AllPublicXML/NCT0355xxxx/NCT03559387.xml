      Randomized, Open-Label study to determine the dose, efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetic

      Forty Eight (48) adult female, chemotherapy treatment-naïve, stage I to III, breast cancer
      patients scheduled to receive FEC100 (3 cycles)/docetaxel (3 cycles) myelosuppressive
      chemotherapy will be enrolled into the study after they meet all the inclusion/exclusion
      criteria. Four (4) Cohorts of 12 patients each will be studied; they will be randomized
      either in the ANF-RHO™ treatment arm at different doses (10 μg/kg, 20 μg/kg, or 30 μg/kg, for
      the cohorts 1-3, respectively) or Neulasta® (6 mg / 0.6 ml SC injection, for cohort 4). For
      the cohorts 1-3, 12 patients from each of the respective ANF-RHO™ cohorts will be randomized
      with four patients from cohort 4 (Neulasta®). Patients in the ANF-RHO™ cohorts will receive
      study drug on Day 1 of each Chemotherapy cycle. Patients in the Neulasta® cohort will receive
      study drug on Day 2 of each Chemotherapy cycle. Doses of ANF-RHO™/Neulasta® will be provided
      for a total of 6 cycles (21 days each). The total duration of the study 129 ± 2 days (126
      Days of treatment period followed by end of study visit)

    <measure>Pharmacokinetic profile of ANF-RHO and Neulasta - Area Under the Curve (AUC[0-t])</measure>
    <time_frame>~ 128 ± 2 days</time_frame>
    <description>AUC[0-t] is an important parameter for determining as to how much of the drug is available in the body after administration of a drug formulation, in this case ANF-RHO vs Neulasta. Understanding the AUC for both these drug formulations will help us to determine the efficacy and safety profiles of these medicines.</description>

    <measure>Pharmacokinetic profile of ANF-RHO and Neulasta - Area Under the Curve (AUC[0-∞])</measure>
    <time_frame>~ 128 ± 2 days</time_frame>
    <description>Similar to AUC[0-t] which is estimated till time 't', in AUC[0-∞], the estimation is done on the concentration of the drug to an infinite time. Calculation of the AUC[0-∞], helps understand how much of the drug is available in the body at extremely low concentrations, beyond the limits of measurable concentrations.</description>

    <description>The parameter AUC[0-t]/AUC[0-∞] is useful to calculate the fraction of the Total AUC that was added due to the extrapolated AUC (AUC[0-∞]). It helps understand if the methods employed for determining the total AUC and drug's availability in the body are correct.</description>
