    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study which will be conducted at 1 to 2 sites.

      Subjects will be required to have a clinical diagnosis of AA, AU or AT with unilateral or
      bilateral loss of eyebrow hair.

      Subjects will apply study medication to the entire affected eyebrow(s), twice-daily for 24
      weeks.

      Safety and tolerability will be evaluated throughout the study.

      The duration of the study participation is anticipated to be a maximum of 233 days.
