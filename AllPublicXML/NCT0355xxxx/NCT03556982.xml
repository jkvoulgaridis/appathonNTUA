      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficiency of CD123-Targeted CAR-T in
      Treating Patients with relapsed/refractory AML
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The relapsed/refractory AML patients will receive FC (F,Fludarabine，C，Cyclophosphamide)
      chemotherapy followed by infusion of allogenic or autologous CD123-Targeted CAR-T cells.No
      graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prevention will be conducted before or after infusion.
      Dose-limiting toxicity,incidence of adverse events and disease response will be detected
      post-infusion.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  CD123-expressing AML must be assured and must be relapsed or refractory disease.
             According to current traditional therapies, there must be no available alternative
             curative therapies and subjects must be either ineligible for allogeneic stem cell
             transplant (SCT), have refused SCT, or have disease activity that prohibits SCT at
             this time.

          -  Estimated life expectancy ≥ 12 weeks (according to investigator's judgment)

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 2

          -  CD123 expression of the malignant cells must be detected by immunohistochemistry or by
             flow cytometry

          -  Patients must have measurable or evaluable disease at the time of enrollment, which
             may include any evidence of disease including minimal residual disease detected by
             flow cytometry, cytogenetics, or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis.

          -  Patients must have an healthy donor for T cells.

          -  Cardiac function: Left ventricular ejection fraction greater than or equal to 40% by
             MUGA or cardiac MRI, or fractional shortening greater than or equal to 28% by ECHO or
             left ventricular ejection fraction greater than or equal to 50% by ECHO.

          -  Renal function: Creatinine level of peripheral blood is required no greater than
             133umol/L.

          -  Females of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test because of the
             potentially dangerous effects on the fetus.

          -  Patients with history of allogeneic stem cell transplantation are eligible if there is
             no evidence of active GVHD and no longer taking immunosuppressive agents for at least
             30 days prior to enrollment.

          -  Ability to give informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evident signs suggesting that patients are potentially allergic to cytokines.

          -  Frequent infection history and recent infection is uncontrolled.

          -  Patients with concomitant genetic syndrome: patients with Down syndrome, Fanconi
             anemia, Kostmann syndrome, Shwachman syndrome or any other known bone marrow failure
             syndrome.

          -  Active acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) or requirement of
             immunosuppressant medications for GVHD within 4 weeks of enrollment.

          -  Concurrent use of systemic steroids or chronic use of immunosuppressant medications.
             Recent or current use of inhaled steroids is not exclusionary. For additional details
             regarding use of steroid and immunosuppressant medications.

          -  Pregnancy and nursing females.

          -  HIV infection.

          -  Active hepatitis B or active hepatitis C.

          -  Participation in a prior investigational study within 4 weeks prior to enrollment or
             longer if required by local regulation. Participation in non-therapeutic research
             studies is allowed.

          -  Patients with a known history or prior diagnosis of other serious immunologic,
             malignant or inflammatory disease.

          -  Other situations we think not eligible for participation in the research.
