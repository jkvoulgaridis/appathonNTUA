  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      the purpose of this study is to show that alirocumab with statin therapy have a s tronger
      stabilizing effect on vulnerable plaque in coronary artery disease than statin alone
      administration
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators investigate to evaluate the efficacy of alirocumab for vulnerable plaque.
      The investigators enrolled the patient with standard statin therapy who were detected
      vulnerable plaque by optical coherence tomography, and categorized into two group; the
      patients with alirocumab and rosuvastatin were categorized alirocumab therapy group, and the
      patients with rosuvastatin alone were categorized standard statin therapy group. The
      investigators compare these two group for outcomes.
