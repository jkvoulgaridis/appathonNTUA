  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To be aware of oneself as a unique entity in the world occurs early in human development and
      is the prerequisite of normal social functioning. The disturbance of self representation
      characterizes a variety of mental disorders such as autism and schizophrenia. Negative
      self-bias was found to serve as the core cognitive mechanism of depression disorder. However,
      there was no evidence to show the reason lead to negative bias. In the current study,
      investigators hypothesized that the blurring self representation was the neural correlates in
      depression disorder.

      To test investigators' hypothesis, investigators adopted the self-referential task and fMRI
      to investigate the neural representation of self in depression patients, and compared with
      healthy control.

    <description>We adopted the self referential task. In the task, participants were asked to judge whether a given word was appropriate to describe oneself (self-judgement condition), a celebrity (other-judgement condition) by pressing one of the two buttons with the index or middle finger. For judgments of each target person (i.e, self and celebrity), there were 3 categories of words describing the mental (personality traits, such as hard-working, friendly), physical (physical attributes, such as black hair, big eyes) and social (social roles, such as student, American) dimension of person knowledge. The fMRI task contained 6 runs, with 4.6 minutes per run.
This paradigm and task allowed us to investigated the neural representation of self by comparing the BOLD activity under self-judgement condition with BOLD activity under other-judgement condition.</description>
