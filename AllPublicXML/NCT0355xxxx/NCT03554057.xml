  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to reduce patient risk and costs to the healthcare system by improving the
      diagnostic yield of invasive coronary angiography through existing triage processes to
      improve risk stratification using Coronary Computed Tomographic Angiography (CCTA) as a first
      step in low risk patients. All low-risk patients referred for invasive coronary angiography
      will be potentially eligible for CCTA instead of invasive angiography as a first-line
      diagnostic test. All CCTAs will be read by both a level 3-trained cardiologist and a
      radiologist. The results of the CCTA, coupled with evidence-based management recommendations
      will be sent to the referring physician and an invasive angiogram will be arranged by the HIU
      triage, only when clearly indicated

    <description>Intervention sites will act as their own controls: outcomes of all eligible patients in the 24-months prior to the implementation of the intervention will be assessed from a routinely collected health administrative database. Eligible patients not undergoing CCTA (patient or physician refusal, or CCTA not available) will be captured and included in the control group as part of a sensitivity analysis during the intervention period</description>

        All eligible low-risk patients referred for invasive angiography will be recruited from the
        two interventional sites (approximately 240) via centralized triage process. Patients
        treated before the intervention implementation will be the control group (approximately
        480).
