    <textblock>
      150 pregnant women admitted for spontaneous, induced or augmented vaginal delivery and
      categorized as low risk for postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) were divided randomly into two
      groups. Carbetocin group (C) received 1 ampoule of Carbetocin (100 μg/ml) (Pabal®,
      Draxis/Multipharma, Egypt, under license from DRAXIS PHARMA-Canada) added to 10 cc saline and
      given IV after the delivery of the baby. Misoprostol group (M) received 2 rectal misoprostol
      tablets (800 μg) (Misotac; SIGMA Pharm, Cairo, Egypt) after the delivery of the baby. Blood
      samples were tested to measure hemoglobin levels upon admission to the labor room and 12
      hours after delivery
