    <textblock>
      Background: Patients with bilateral vestibular hypofunction (BVH) frequently presented with
      dysequilibrium, dizziness and oscillopsia, leading to increased risk for fall. The mainstream
      for treatment of vestibular hypofunction remains to be vestibular rehabilitation, yet the
      effects can be limited in certain cases. Through the application of minimal amount of
      electrical stimulation, galvanic stimulation can induce polarization in the vestibular nerve,
      stimulating the saccule, utricle and semicircular canals within the vestibular apparatus.
      Galvanic stimulation has also been proven to activate cerebral cortex regions such as
      parieto-insular vestibular cortex (PIVC) and temporal-parietal junction area. It has been
      documented that vestibular stimulation with stochastic resonance could improve quiet stance
      stability in patients with vestibular hypofunction. The 3 dimensional effects of dynamic
      walking as well as the change of vestibular ocular reflex during stochastic resonance
      vestibular stimulation have never been discussed. Purposes: This 3-year project aims to
      investigate the effects of vestibular stimulation in VOR, static and dynamic stability,
      activation/connectivity of cerebral cortex and mechanisms of neuronal changes. Methods: First
      year the motion analysis and ICS head impulse video goggles were used to observe walking
      stability and eye movements in 30 healthy and 30 patients with BVH. In the second year,
      stochastic resonance vestibular stimulation will be applied to 30 healthy and 30 BVH
      individuals respectively. Using functional MRI, the changes of activated/deactivated areas in
      the cerebral cortex during stochastic resonance vestibular stimulation will be observed in
      both groups. In the third year, 60 BVH patients will be randomized into either sham or real
      vestibular stimulation group. Both groups will receive 3 times per week for 4 weeks of
      vestibular rehabilitation with exactly the same exercise protocols. SIRT1 related anti-aging
      genes will be analyzed through blood samples. Expected achievements: Combining safe
      stochastic resonance vestibular stimulation and exercises in this 3-year project, the
      neuroprotective mechanisms of vestibular exercises will be elucidated. The optimal strategy
      for vestibular rehabilitation can thus be established.
