  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to assess whether 16 weeks of treatment with dupilumab as an adjunct
      to Timothy Grass Subcutaneous Immunotherapy (SCIT) improves upon the efficacy of Timothy
      Grass SCIT to reduce provoked allergic rhinitis symptoms, as measured by Total Nasal Symptom
      Score (TNSS) after nasal allergen challenge (NAC) with Timothy Grass extract at week 17.

      The secondary objectives of the study are:

        -  To assess whether 16 weeks of treatment with dupilumab as compared to placebo reduces
           provoked allergic rhinitis symptoms, as measured by TNSS after nasal allergen challenge
           (NAC) with Timothy Grass extract

        -  To assess whether 16 weeks of treatment with dupilumab as compared to dupilumab + SCIT
           reduces provoked allergic rhinitis symptoms, as measured by TNSS after nasal allergen
           challenge (NAC) with Timothy Grass extract

        -  To assess changes in serum Timothy-grass-specific immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4), serum
           Timothy grass-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE), and ratio of serum Timothy Grass-specific
           IgG4 to IgE over 16 weeks of treatment with dupilumab + SCIT as compared to SCIT
           monotherapy

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of 16 weeks of treatment with dupilumab as an
           adjunct to Timothy Grass SCIT

    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) Area Under Curve (AUC) (0-1 Hour (hr) Post Peak TNSS) in Response to Post Nasal Allergen Challenge (NAC) at Week 17</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 17</time_frame>
    <description>TNSS was participant-reported composite symptom assessment of 4 symptoms (rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, nasal itching &amp; sneezing), each scored on a scale from 0 to 3 where 0 = none, 3 = severe. TNSS total score was calculated as the sum of the response for all 4 individual nasal symptom scores and ranged from 0 to 12, where higher score indicated more severe symptoms. AUC of TNSS/component from time of the first observation to time of the last observation (AUC [0-1 hr]) was calculated by using the trapezoid rule. Data was reported for Dupilumab + SCIT and placebo matched to Dupilumab + SCIT monotherapy group in this outcome measure.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>A total of 214 participants were screened for study eligibility at 17 study sites in United States and Canada, of whom 103 were randomized to receive the study treatment. Screen failure was mostly due to inclusion criteria not met/exclusion criteria met.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants who met the eligibility criteria were randomized in 1:1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 4 treatment groups: Placebo, Dupilumab, Subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) and Dupilumab + SCIT.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Total nasal symptom score (TNSS) Area under Curve (AUC) [0-1 hour (hr)] at Baseline</title>
          <description>TNSS was a participant-reported composite symptom assessment of 4 symptoms (rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, nasal itching &amp; sneezing) each scored on a scale from 0 to 3 where 0 = none, 3 = severe. TNSS total score was ranged from 0 to 12, where higher the score indicated more severe symptoms. AUC of TNSS/component from time of the first observation to time of the last observation (AUC [0-1 hour]) was calculated by using the trapezoid rule.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) Area Under Curve (AUC) Post Nasal Allergen Challenge (NAC) Over the First Hour After the Challenge (0-1 Hour (hr) Post Peak TNSS) at Week 17 in Placebo vs. Dupilumab</title>
          <description>TNSS was participant-reported composite symptom assessment of 4 symptoms (rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, nasal itching &amp; sneezing) each scored on a scale from 0 to 3 where 0 = none, 3 = severe. TNSS total score was calculated as the sum of the response for all 4 individual nasal symptom scores and ranged from 0 to 12, where higher score indicated more severe symptoms. AUC of TNSS/component from time of the first observation to time of the last observation (AUC [0-1 hr]) was calculated by using the trapezoid rule. Data was reported for Dupilumab + placebo matched to SCIT and placebo matched to dupilumab + placebo matched to SCIT group in this outcome measure.</description>

        <description>Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were defined as adverse events (AEs) that developed or worsened or became serious during on-treatment period (time from the first dose of study drug up to the end of study [Week 24]). A serious adverse event (SAE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death, life-threatening, required initial or prolonged in-participant hospitalization, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly/birth defect, or considered as medically important event. Any TEAE included participants with both serious and non-serious AEs.</description>
