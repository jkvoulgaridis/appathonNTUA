    <description>The primary endpoint is the Summed Pain Intensity Difference over the first 6 hours (SPID6) after dosing compared between DFN-15 and placebo. Pain intensity will be measured using 11-point Pain Intensity Numerical Rating Scale (NPRS). Zero (0) equals no pain and Ten (10) equals worst pain imaginable.</description>

             alcohol abuse at screening and/or prior to extraction procedure.

          4. Positive results for the following (prescription included): Amphetamines,
             Barbiturates, Benzodiazepines, Methadone, Methamphetamine, Opiates, Oxycodone, and

             for pain.

         10. Donated blood products or had blood loss greater than 500 mL 30 days prior to
             Screening or between Screening and surgery.

         11. Member or relative of study staff or the Sponsor directly involved in the study.

         12. Previous participation in this study.

         13. Has received another new chemical entity (defined as a compound which has not been
             approved for marketing) or has participated in any other clinical study that included
             drug treatment within 30 days prior to the Screening visit.

         14. Currently receiving or have received within 7 days prior to investigational product
             administration in the study, any drug (s) that is metabolized by hepatic microsomal
