      The purpose of the study is to investigate the effect of Food, Gender, and Age on the
      Pharmacokinetic Profile of SUVN-911 in Healthy Subjects

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, single-center, open-label, single dose study to evaluate the effect of
      food, gender, and age on the safety and Pharmacokinetic profiles of single doses of SUVN-911,
      administered orally in healthy subjects.

      The primary objective is to evaluate the effect of food, gender, and age on the
      pharmacokinetics of a single dose of SUVN-911 administered orally to healthy subjects.

      The secondary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single dose of
      SUVN-911 administered orally to healthy adult male, female, and elderly subjects

    <intervention_model_description>Subjects will be enrolled in 1 of 3 cohorts; Cohort 1 (Food Effect Cohort), Cohort 2 (Gender Effect Cohort), and Cohort 3 (Age Effect Cohort). Subjects in Cohort 1 will receive a single oral dose of SUVN-911 on Day 1 under fasted or fed conditions and again on Day 8 under fasted or fed conditions (crossover design). Subjects in Cohort 2 and Cohort 3 will receive a single oral dose of SUVN-911 on Day 1.</intervention_model_description>
