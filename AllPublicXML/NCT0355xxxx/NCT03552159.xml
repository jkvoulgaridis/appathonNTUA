  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project was designed to test a model targeted intervention for dementia caregivers
      telephone program consisting of both psychoeducation and behavioral activation components to
      reduce the burden of caregivers. The program is delivered by telephone to increase
      accessibility and sustainability for caregivers.

    <textblock>
      The study compared two telephone interventions using a four-month longitudinal randomized
      controlled trial. For the first four weeks, all participants received the same
      psychoeducation program via telephone. Then for the following four months, eight biweekly
      telephone follow-up calls were carried out. For these eight follow-up calls, participants
      were randomized into either one of the two following groups with different conditions. For
      the Psychoeducation with BA (PsyED-BA) group, participants would receive eight biweekly
      sessions of BA practice focused on pleasant event scheduling and improving communications.
      For the Psychoeducation only (PsyED Only) group, there would be eight biweekly sessions of
      general discussion of psychoeducation and related information
