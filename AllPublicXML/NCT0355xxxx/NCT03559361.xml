      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of EPA- and DHA-enriched omega-3
      polyunsaturated fatty acid dietary supplements on a number of objective sleep measures
      (collected from Activity watches) and subjective sleep measures (collected from the Leeds
      Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire) before and after 26 weeks of supplementation
