  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the clinical study was to examine if practice could improve walking patterns
      associated with fall risks before patients with obesity underwent weight loss surgery. We
      hypothesized that patients would show improvements in their walking after completing the
      intervention. For the intervention, patients walked under five conditions: on flat ground at
      the beginning of the study, crossing three obstacle heights, and on flat ground at the end of
      the study for a total of 25 times.

      Obesity has a negative impact on aspects of walking associated with fall risks. After weight
      loss surgery, adults show improvements in walking. However, those who undergo surgery still
      show deficits in walking and an additional group of individuals do not undergo the procedure.
      Our objective was to examine if practice could improve gait patterns associated with fall
      risks before patients underwent weight loss surgery. Adults with obese body mass index
      between 30 to 60 years old who were eligible to undergo the Roux-en-Y weight loss surgery
      procedure walked under five conditions: initial baseline walking on flat ground, crossing
      three obstacle heights, and final baseline walking on flat ground for a total of 25 trials.
      Spatio-temporal gait parameters were collected using a gait carpet and body-worn sensors. The
      GAITRite mat was a 4.9 m long x 0.6 m wide pressure-sensitive mat with a temporal resolution
      of 120 Hz and a spatial resolution of 1.3 cm. LEGSysTM includes five wearable sensors
      containing triaxial gyroscopes, accelerometers, and magnetometers. Dependent variables
      selected included velocity (cm/s), cadence (steps/minute), step length (distance between
      consecutive steps), step width (lateral distance between feet), single limb support time
      (amount of time spent on one leg during the walking cycle), and double limb support time
      (amount of time spend on two legs during the walking cycle).

    <description>Adults with obesity will be asked to perform the obstacle crossing intervention for adults with obesity for reducing falls risk. This will involve crossing obstacles of different heights under five conditions: initial baseline walking on flat ground, crossing three obstacle heights, and final baseline walking on flat ground for a total of 25 trials. Spatio-temporal gait parameters will be collected using a gait carpet and body-worn sensors.</description>
