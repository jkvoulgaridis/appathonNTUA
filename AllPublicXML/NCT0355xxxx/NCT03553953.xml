  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational non-invasive study which aims to collect data from patients under
      general anesthesia in the operating room; this data will then be used for characterization
      and detection of artifacts that affect the EEG signal.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This observational, non-invasive study will be performed in order to identify the effects of
      physiological and environmental artifacts on the EEG raw data collected by the BIS™. This
      study will include 100 screened subjects (not more than 60 valid cases) and will take place
      in the Department of Anesthesiology at Rambam Health Care Campus. During the study, raw data
      from the BIS™ will be recorded simultaneously with EMG, EOG and ECG in order to diagnose
      their effects on the EEG signals as recorded by the BIS™. The raw data will be considered as
      the main parameters of the study. Additionally, a study coordinator will stay in the
      operating room during the surgery and will indicate the following parameters -

        1. Medical treatment (drug, dosage and time)

        2. Changes in hypnotic state (state, time)

        3. Any activity that may affect the EEG signals (i.e. electrical and mechanical artifacts
           from medical devices)

        4. Any activity that deviates from the clinical procedure

        5. Any adverse events or unusual outcomes From the list above, parameters a, c and d will
           also be considered as main parameters and parameters and parameters d and e will be
           considered as safety parameters.

      If applicable, BIS™ will be recorded after the surgery, at the PACU, for part of time the
      subject will be at the PACU or until the subject will be released from the department. The
      study coordinator/investigator will perform POD assessment at that time. The subject will be
      considered as valid case even if the data from the recovery room is missing.

      Demographic details and medical history will be copied by the study coordinator from the
      subjects' medical records.
