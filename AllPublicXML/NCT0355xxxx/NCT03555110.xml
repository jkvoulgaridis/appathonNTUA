      The aims of the study are to perform psychological intervention using EMDR Therapy (Eye
      Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing Therapy) in the preoperative period, evaluate the
      personality of each patient through the PFB test (Personality Factor Battery Test) at
      different times, compare the results obtained in the PFB test at different times of
      application and verify the existence of changes in the five major Personality Factors:
      Neuroticism, Extroversion, Socialization, Realization and Openness.

    <textblock>
      Obesity is a multi-factorial disease requiring a multi-professional approach. Psychological
      causes also contribute to the development and maintenance of obesity. Traumatic experiences
      may be a risk factor for it as well. Emotional issues of obese patient often interfere with
      the results of bariatric surgery, where a large number of bariatric patients regain the
      weight or change symptoms.

      The aim of the Effects of EMDR therapy with Severe Obesity Bariatric Surgery Patients
      randomized controlled trial is to determine the effects of 11 sessions of EMDR therapy, prior
      to surgery as compared to a control group. The Big Five personality factors will be used to
      evaluate the results. Both groups of patients will complete the Factorial Personality
      Battery, before the surgery, and 6 months and 12 months following bariatric surgery.

      The initial hypothesis is that EMDR therapy will provide sufficient changes after surgery in
      the personality dynamics of obese patients, which will in turn favor emotional balance and
      weight maintenance as compared to the control group.

    <description>30 morbid obese patients, 30 to 55 years old, submitted to Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing Therapy (EMDR) during the study with the frequency of Twelve sessions, including:
Three evaluation and preparation sessions,
Eight EMDR sessions weekly with variable length of 60 minutes and
One closing session. The total intervention time will be about 3 (three) months. After the end of the 12 sessions of EMDR therapy, the patient will be evaluated again individually to verify the existence of change in PFB test results about the 5 big factors. The instrument will also be reapplied three months, twelve months and thirty-six months after bariatric surgery.</description>

    <description>It is a psychotherapeutic approach effective on treatment for trauma and post-traumatic stress disorder. It is an intervention that allows the desensitization of negative emotions from traumatic experiences.This therapy modifies memories that have been processed non-adaptively and become painful and dysfunctional memories. During the procedure, the patient is encouraged to move the eyes from side to side, associating these movements with a &quot;target&quot; situation, previously defined at the beginning of the session. The ocular movements can be replaced by tactile or sonorous stimuli. The series of stimuli must continue until the memory of the traumatic event can be reprocessed adaptively, that is, without the emotional, negative or painful process associated with that memory.</description>
