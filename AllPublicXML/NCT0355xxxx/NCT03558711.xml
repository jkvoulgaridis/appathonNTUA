  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is the most frequently occurring male cancer in Belgium. Patients who have
      been treated for prostate cancer, i.e. by surgery and/or radiotherapy, in a substantial
      degree suffer from a tumor recurrence, often diagnosed by an increase in serum tumor marker
      PSA (prostate specific antigen) within the first few years. In these patients with evidence
      of a tumor recurrence after primary treatment, it is important to most exactly define the
      location(s) of tumor, to guide appropriate therapy by surgery, radiotherapy and/or
      hormonotherapy. In so-called oligo-metastatic disease targeted therapy may still be curative
      and prevent the disease from spreading to distant locations. Therefore it is of paramount
      importance to have an accurate tool of medical imaging to localize all possible locations to
      be treated.

      With some patients, the PSA-value is so low, that conventional nuclear medicine bone scanning
      or radiological CT or MRI cannot determine where the metastases are. Therefore, [18F]-Choline
      PET-CT was introduced to improve diagnostic imaging performance. However, in 30 to 40 percent
      of patients choline-PET does not localize tumor either, especially in small tumors and/or
      very low PSA values.

      The PSMA PET is already routinely used in many European centres, and has shown a superior
      accuracy in these patients as compared to conventional imaging techniques. This has been a
      very consistent finding in scientifically reported patient studies.

      Most of these investigations have been performed with PSMA labeled with Gallium-68. The
      investigators in Ghent, as others, have labeled PSMA with Fluor-18. This tracer provides many
      advantages, including a higher production yield enabling more patients to be scanned. Also
      from a perspective of radioprotection and financial costs, Fluor-18 is a better choice.
      Moreover, several recent studies, comparing Fluor with Gallium modalities seem to suggest
      equivalent or better diagnostic results, possibly because of a lower aspecific background
      activity.
