  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, open-label, safety, pharmacodynamic and efficacy study of entinostat in
      combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab in subjects with metastatic renal cell carcinoma
      (RCC) who have progressed on ipilimumab + nivolumab regimen. Prior to Phase II, a safety
      lead-in will be conducted to establish the RP2D of entinostat when used in combination with
      ipilimumab + nivolumab. Subjects will initially be treated with the combination of oral
      entinostat and intravenous (IV) nivolumab plus ipilimumab. Entinostat will be dosed weekly,
      and nivolumab and ipilimumab will be dosed every 3 weeks, for a total of four, 3-week cycles.
      Following these first four cycles, entinostat will continue to be administered weekly in
      combination with nivolumab every 2 weeks (ipilimumab will be discontinued), with treatment
      continued until disease progression or prohibitive toxicity. Anti-tumor activity will be
      assessed by radiological tumor assessments conducted at baseline and every 6 weeks thereafter
      using RECIST version 1.1.
