  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Delayed graft function (DGF) is an important phenomenon after kidney transplantation with
      direct and indirect implication on graft survival. Although its incidence and risk factors
      have been studied after cadaveric kidney transplantation cases, only few data is available
      regarding transplants from living donors. The present study was performed to investigate the
      frequency and risk factors of DGF among living-unrelated kidney transplant recipients among
      three transplant centers in part of Middle East.

      In this multi-center retrospective study, data from 480 transplanted patients had been
      collected from existing local hospital registries in three countries (Iran, Kingdom of Saudi
      Arabia (KSA), and Kuwait) with 3 years post transplantation follow-up. Data for this study
      was collected based on routine clinical practice of medical practitioners across the
      participating countries. A case report data collecting form was designed for gathering the
      data including the recipient and donor's characteristics prior to transplantation, and after
      transplantation up to three years post transplantation. Using binary logistic regression
      analysis, the potential risk factors for occurrence of DGF in living donor transplantations
      were tested. Graft and patient survival at 1, 2 and 3 years depending on follow-up time was
      evaluated.

        A case report data collecting form was designed for gathering the following data: the
        recipients and donors characteristics prior to transplantation, time on dialysis (months),
        first or second transplantation, panel reactive antibody (PRA) and human leukocyte antigen
        (HLA) mismatch, frequency of DGF, renal function, cold and warm ischemia time,
        immunosuppressive regimens (induction, if any used), adverse events, acute and chronic
        graft rejection, graft survival and patient survival at 1, 2 and 3 years follow-up.It was
        planned to recruit 500 patients, from 3 centers in 3 countries of Middle east. Distribution
        by country or region was as following :Iran (n=300), Kuwait (n=100) and KSA (n=100)
        subjects . As it was a retrospective disease registry with no access or possibility to
        recall patients, obtaining informed consent form from patients was waived up to the local
        regulatory processes. Approvals were obtained from each site to access patients' records
        and collect their data.
