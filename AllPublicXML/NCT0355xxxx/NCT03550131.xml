  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The lack of efficacious research-based interventions for such vulnerable older adults with
      Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/RD) and their caregivers (CGs) is a significant
      public health problem. Caregiving of sexual/gender minority older adults with AD/RD is of
      concern due to social stigma, marginalization, and isolation, which may be barriers to
      sustaining caregiving. It is necessary and timely to translate evidence-based culturally
      adaptable interventions for this underserved and stigmatized population. Reducing Disability
      in Alzheimer's Disease (RDAD) has been evaluated in a randomized controlled trial and has
      shown to successfully train community-dwelling CR (care receiver)-CG dyads to increase the
      physical activity and functioning of individuals with AD/RD and their CGs and to teach CGs
      techniques for managing behavioral symptoms of CRs. RDAD consequently decreases stress of
      CGs, delays institutionalization of CRs, and increases health related quality of life (HRQOL)
      of CRs and CGs. Thus, this study will evaluate the effect of the standard RDAD among lesbian,
      gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) CRs with AD/RD and their CGs, and this study will test
      a personalized intervention tailored to better respond to distinct risks experienced by CGs
      and LGBT CRs with AD/RD, addressing unique sexual/gender minority CG risk factors (e.g.,
      identity management, stigma-related adverse or traumatic life events, and lack of social
      support).

      We will address the following aims:

      Aim 1. Test the translation and enhancement of intervention designed to increase physical
      activities of older adult care receivers (CRs) with AD/RD and their CGs. Aim 2. Evaluate the
      short- and long-term effect of the standard and personalized intervention on primary
      (physical activity and functioning; perceived stress for CGs; independence/residential status
      (institutionalization) for CRs) and secondary outcomes (HRQOL; depressive symptomatology;
      behavioral disturbances for CRs). Aim 3. Test the moderating roles of CR-CG characteristics,
      including type of CR-CG relationship, sex, and severity of CR AD/RD, on the treatment effect
      of the standard and personalized intervention.

    <description>The IDEA intervention has the same exposure to treatment as the RDAD intervention. The behavioral component of the treatment manual is adapted to incorporate 3 risk factors that are empirically known to affect midlife and older LGBT populations.These include: 1) identity management; 2) stigma-related adverse/traumatic life events; and 3) lack of social support. All other aspects of the treatment are preserved.</description>
