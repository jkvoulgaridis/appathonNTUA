  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asymptomatic bacteriuria (AB) is a condition in which bacteria are detected in urine culture
      without urinary symptoms. The inappropriate use of antibiotic treatment for AB selects
      bacterial flora to express resistance mutations. Reducing inappropriate antibiotic use for AB
      is difficult, since the microbiology laboratory cannot distinguish patients with AB. The
      investigators study will use a restricted laboratory report requesting the physician to call
      the laboratory for culture results. The restricted report may reduce the rate of
      inappropriate treatment of AB.

      Positive urine cultures during the study period will be randomized to restricted microbiology
      laboratory reporting or standard microbiology laboratory reporting. Physician or patient
      consent will not be collected. Patient records will be assessed by the investigator to
      determine if patients have AB or urinary tract infection. Physician antibiotic treatment
      decision in both groups will be collected.
