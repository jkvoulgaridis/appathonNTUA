  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prior to reperfusion therapy, the major therapeutic breakthrough in myocardial infarction was
      the demonstration that ACE inhibitors or ARBs, given to prevent adverse &quot;remodelling&quot;
      (progressive dilatation and decline in systolic function) in high risk patients, reduced the
      likelihood of developing heart failure and the risk of death. The neurohumoral systems which
      are activated in patients after myocardial infarction (and in heart failure) are not all
      harmful and some endogenous systems may be protective. The best recognised of these is the
      natriuretic peptide system.

      A- and B-type natriuretic peptides are secreted by the heart when it is stressed and these
      peptides promote vasodilation (reducing left ventricular wall stress), stimulate renal sodium
      and water excretion (i.e. antagonising the retention of salt and water characterising heart
      failure) and inhibit pathological growth i.e. hypertrophy and fibrosis (key components of the
      adverse left ventricular remodelling that occurs after infarction and in heart failure).The
      augmentation of plasma levels of endogenous natriuretic peptides can be achieved through
      inhibition of neutral endopeptidase, also known as neprilysin (NEP), which is responsible for
      the breakdown of natriuretic peptides. Recently, the addition of neprilysin inhibition to
      blockade of the RAAS (using sacubitril/valsartan), compared with RAAS blockade alone, reduced
      the risk of heart failure hospitalisation and death in patients with HF-REF. These exciting
      findings may lead to a new approach to the treatment of heart failure, with an angiotensin
      receptor neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) replacing an ACE inhibitor as one of the fundamental
      treatments for this condition. We believe that the same approach may be beneficial in
      highrisk survivors of myocardial infarction. Recently, sacubitril/valsartan was shown to
      ameliorate adverse left ventricular remodelling in an experimental model of acute myocardial
      infarction. The objective of the present proposal is to gather &quot;proof-ofconcept&quot;,
      mechanistic, evidence in humans to support adoption of this new approach in patients at high
      risk after myocardial infarction as a result of residual left ventricular systolic
      dysfunction.

    <textblock>
      The objective of the present proposal is to obtain information, which is currently not
      available, on the cardiac effects of sacubitril/valsartan in patients with LVSD, better
      characterise the neurohumoral actions of sacubitril/valsartan and gather &quot;proof-ofconcept&quot;,
      mechanistic, evidence in humans to support adoption of this new treatment in patients at high
      risk after myocardial infarction as a result of residual LVSD.

      Surprisingly, there is currently limited evidence about how sacubitril/valsartan works in
      humans. PARADIGM-HF was a large pragmatic mortality/morbidity trial with no mechanistic
      sub-studies and this is also true of a ongoing trial (PARADISE-MI) in acute myocardial
      infarction. Moreover, both trials either used or will use an ACE inhibitor (enalapril and
      ramipril, respectively), rather than an ARB as the active comparator for
      sacubitril/valsartan; use of valsartan in our study will allow us to precisely define the
      effects of neprilysin inhibition. A-type (or atrial) natriuretic peptide (ANP), C-type
      natriuretic peptide (CNP) and adrenomedullin are substrates for neprilysin and may play a
      role in the action of sacubitril/valsartan but have not been measured in existing clinical
      trials (in part because of the instability of these peptides and unfeasibility of measuring
      them in multi-centre, multi-national trials).

      Indeed, ANP and CNP are more specific substrates for neprilysin than BNP. As has been
      mentioned above, cardiac fibrosis appears to be important in the process of LV remodelling in
      patients with asymptomatic LVSD and the development of HF-REF and is reflected in circulating
      biomarkers which may be influenced by sacubitril/valsartan
