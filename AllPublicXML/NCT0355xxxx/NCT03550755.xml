      The goal of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy of immunotherapy for cervical cancer based
      on a fundamentally new approach. We will test new tableted preparation, V3-Cervix, obtained
      from hydrolyzed, inactivated blood and tumors of patients with cervical cancer. When
      administered orally, it should cause a specific anti-tumor immune response and an
      anti-inflammatory effect. Trial is planned to last 3 months, recruit 20 volunteers,
      administer daily pill of vaccine and evaluate effect on tumor size and tumor markers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cervical cancer (CC) is a malignant neoplasm that occurs in the cervix. Histologically, there
      are two main types: adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. Cervical cancer is most
      common in middle-aged women (35-55 years of age), in 20% of cases it is found over the age of
      65 years. Cancer of the body and cervix are the most common type of malignant tumor of female
      genital organs. It is believed that human papillomavirus (HPV) is the main risk factor
      causing cervical cancer. Cervical cancer combines surgical treatment, radiotherapy and
      chemotherapy. Current immunotherapies did not show much success. The prognosis depends on the
      stage of the disease: 5-year survival rate at the first stage is 78.1%, at the second stage -
      57%, at the third - 31%, at the fourth - 7.8%. There is no specific cervical cancer marker,
      usually a panel of markers is used including CA125, beta-hCG, CEA, SCC, CA19.9 and CA27.29.
      The goal of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy of immunotherapy for cervical cancer based
      on a fundamentally new approach. We will test new tableted preparation, V3-Cervix, obtained
      from hydrolyzed, inactivated blood and tumors of patients with cervical cancer. When
      administered orally, it should cause a specific anti-tumor immune response and an
      anti-inflammatory effect. Trial is planned to last 3 months, recruit 20 volunteers,
      administer daily pill of vaccine and evaluate effect on tumor size and tumor markers.
