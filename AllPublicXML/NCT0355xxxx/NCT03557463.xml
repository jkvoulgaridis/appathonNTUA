  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aging populations experience a decline in adaptive immune system function also known as
      immunosenesence. Nutritional approaches to stimulate and strengthen the immune system are
      needed for this growing segment of the population. A controlled, randomized, double blind
      pilot study was conducted using two different protein sources as nutritional supplementation
      to enhance vaccine response. Our objective was to examine the immune stimulating effects of
      dairy protein subjected to ultraviolet radiation (UV-C) radiation treatment process instead
      of pasteurization. Participants were 21 healthy individuals over 60 years of age who consumed
      6 g of the dairy protein or a comparison, soy isoflavone protein, twice a day for eight
      weeks. DTaP vaccine administered at week 4. Non-parametric t-tests revealed a significant
      increase in Tetanus antibodies in the dairy group compared to the soy group at week 8. These
      findings suggest additional benefits of UV-C treated unheated dairy protein as a solution to
      counteract immunosenescence, but warrant further study in elderly and other populations that
      might benefit from immune system stimulation.

        Inclusion criteria included participants be more than 60 years of age. Volunteers underwent
        a physical examination and health assessment by a physician to ensure the absence of
        exclusion criteria which were regular consumption of greater than one unit of milk and/or
        milk products (milk, yogurt, fresh cheese, etc.) a day at the time of enrollment, known
        milk allergy, food faddism, other non-traditional diet, prolonged consumption of dairy
        supplements (greater than one daily during the previous four weeks), use of tobacco
        products in the previous 10 years, underlying neoplasia or immunological disease, including
        hypergammaglobunemia, renal disease or failure, use of steroids or immunosuppressive drugs
        in the previous eight weeks, reduced physical activity (New York Heart Association classes
        III-IV). Having received a DTaP vaccine within the last five years was an exclusion
        criteria for the study, but patient records were incomplete for many volunteers on this
        aspect. Therefore, volunteers with an initial Tetanus antibody level above 3 IU/mL were
        excluded from the study results as the volunteer was assumed to have had the DTaP vaccine
        within the last 5 years.
