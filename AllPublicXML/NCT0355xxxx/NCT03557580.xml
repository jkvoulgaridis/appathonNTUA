      Objectives: Primary Objective: To compare the pharmacokinetic characteristics of two
      isosorbide -5 -mononitrate extended -release tablets 40 mg of Qilu Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd,
      China and ISMO Retard (isosorbide -5 -mononitrate extended -release tablet) 40 mg,
      distributed by RIEMSER Pharma GmbH. following a single oral dose administration in healthy
      Chinese subjects under fed condition.

      Secondary Objective: To monitor the safety profile of the subjects exposed to the
      Investigational Medicinal Product.

      Study Design: a randomized, open label, balanced, 3-way crossover, single dose study under
      fed conditions.12 subjects will be randomized to one of the 3 treatment sequences. Each
      treatment sequence will consist of 3 periods, separated by a washout period of at least 7
      days. For sequence 1, first reference drug, then test formulation 1 and test formulation 2
      will be administered. The order for sequence 2 is test formulation 2, reference drug and test
      formulation 1. The order for sequence 3 is test formulation 1, test formulation 2 and
      reference drug.
