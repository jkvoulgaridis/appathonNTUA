      other cardiovascular risk factors in subjects with moderate hyperlipidemia without
      pharmacological treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, parallel, randomized and double-blind clinical-nutritional study of 8 weeks of
      duration and 2 study groups (1) Food supplement with extracts of the fungus Shiitake; 2)
      Placebo supplement with maltodextrin) to evaluate the effect of a food supplement derived
      from the Shiitake mushroom (Lentinula edodes) on the lipid profile, other cardiovascular risk
      factors and the intestinal microbiota in subjects with hyperlipidemia moderate without
      pharmacological treatment.
