      weights in children and their families.

      The purpose of the Phase 3 scale up project is to expand the reach and impact of Healthy
      Together (HT), by supporting the integration of the HT program into core services of
      organizations serving children (up to 18 years) and families, particularly those from
      under-served populations across diverse communities and settings in Canada. The HT program
      offers a flexible, effective, integrated approach, relevant to multiple contexts, creating
      potential to become a sustainable approach to promoting healthier weights in Canadian
      children. The objectives of the evaluation for Phase 3 are to:

        1. Describe the effectiveness of the HT program in relation to knowledge, attitude and
           behavior change at the individual, family, and community level.

        2. Monitor quality and sustainability of HT, when offered as part of core service by
           organizations to meet diverse community needs and cultural contexts.

        3. Create an effective knowledge mobilization framework to increase practice and policy
           influence of HT, in collaboration with regional, provincial and national networks.

    <description>The Healthy Together (HT) program is designed to reduce overweight and obesity among children and youth in priority populations such as Indigenous, immigrant and refugee, and low income families.The HT program consists of 30 sessions, each of which includes cooking and eating together, physical activity and a learning activity covering topics that promote healthy weights. The HT program is delivered by trained facilitators who are provided with a program manual and resources. Trained facilitators in participating community organizations offer the HT program by integrating it within core programming.</description>

        Community partner organizations with capacity and infrastructure to implement the HT
        program are eligible to be implementation sites. Priority is given to community
        organizations serving Indigenous, immigrants/refugees, low income/low literacy groups, and
        families residing in rural communities. All sites will be required to integrate HT into
        their existing services.

        families participating in programs offered by the partner organizations are eligible to
        attend HT. All interested families will be able to access the program regardless of their
        previous knowledge or skill level. Participants do not have to be overweight/obese to
        participate in sessions.

        HT Facilitators: Staff members who are identified by the partner organizations, trained to
        implement the HT program and directly involved in HT program delivery will be eligible to
        participate in the evaluation.
