  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research study involves an open label trial (i.e., participant selects one of 2
      interventions) to determine whether Veterans engaged in treatment for head and/or neck
      cancers find either of the two available behavioral treatments for pain (Self-Hypnosis or
      Mindfulness) helpful in managing pain, and if the study's delivery modality (providing audio
      recordings and workbooks for home use) is acceptable and feasible. If neither of the 2
      interventions seems appealing, the participant can participate in the study by completing the
      study assessments only (this option is usual care); however, the participant will not receive
      the study materials or one-on-one appointments with the study clinician.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At any given time, 2-8 Veterans are receiving treatment for head/neck cancer at VAPSHCS,
      which typically involves daily appointments over a period of 6-7 weeks. Some have tumor pain
      prior to treatment; many of those who do not have pain at the outset experience significant
      pain by week 3 of treatment. Individual clinical work with these Veterans using hypnosis and
      mindfulness interventions has been promising.

      The investigators will compare the efficacy of these two skills-based self-management
      approaches by looking at changes in pain and function from pre to post-treatment. This is an
      open label trial, so if there are sufficient participants who choose usual care, the
      investigators will also compare any pre-post changes to those subjects who elect usual care.
      Subjects will be up to 30 Veterans who are seeking treatment for head and/or neck cancer at
      VAPSHCS. Due to an open label model, the investigators anticipate that the treatment group
      size may be uneven. The investigators may find that participants select one intervention more
      than the others.

      The investigators have designed the intervention and measures in such a way as to minimize
      subject burden and to limit measures to those functional outcomes relevant to this
      population. The investigators will emphasize implementation aspects of the evaluation,
      measuring feasibility, relevance, and Veteran preferences.

      Knowledge generated from this study will include revealing treatment needs and preferred
      approaches to acute cancer pain management care for Veterans and demonstrating feasibility.
      The investigators anticipate that the findings will inform strategies to for making
      complementary meditation or self-hypnosis interventions available to Veterans dealing with
      cancer pain and pain related to cancer treatment. The investigators will learn if these
      interventions are feasible, acceptable, helpful and credible for Veterans undergoing active
      treatment for cancer.

    <description>Participant will have one brief meeting with a clinician in which they will learn about hypnosis and be provided with an informational booklet and with audiorecordings of hypnosis exercises. Participants will be encouraged to listen to the hypnosis recordings as much as they would like, whenever they would like to listen. The recordings are short inductions followed by therapeutic suggestions, including post-hypnotic suggestions. Participants will relax in a comfortable position with their eyes closed and will simply listen to the audio recordings that will include an induction followed by suggestions for decreased pain and improvement in co-morbid symptoms (e.g., improved mood and optimism, relaxation, sleep quality).</description>

    <description>Participant will have one brief meeting with a clinician in which they will learn about mindfulness meditation and be provided with an informational booklet and with audio recordings of mindfulness exercises. Participants will learn Vipassana meditation by listening to audio recordings, which is the specific form of mindfulness meditation (MM) typically implemented in mindfulness research. The emphasis is placed upon developing focused attention on an object of awareness, such as the breath. This focus is then expanded to include a more open, non-judgmental monitoring of any sensory, emotional, or cognitive events.Participants will be encouraged to listen to the meditation recordings as much as they would like, whenever they would like to listen.</description>
