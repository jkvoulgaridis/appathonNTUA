    <textblock>
      Sleep is essential to health. Quality of sleep, measure through indexes of sleep, is related
      to the incidence of obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and
      premature death. Sleep pattern changes as people age. They tend to have a harder time falling
      asleep and more trouble staying asleep than when they were younger. Studies have shown that
      food/nutrient intake may be associated with sleep duration, quality, and patterns.
      Singapore's population is aging rapidly and improving their indexes of sleep may result in
      their health promotion.

      Sleep is essential to health and indexes of sleep including duration, quality, and patterning
      are related to the incidence of chronic diseases and premature death. Changes in sleep
      patterns are a part of the aging process and as people age, they tend to have a harder time
      falling asleep and more trouble staying asleep than when they were younger. Certain
      cross-sectional studies have shown that food/nutrient intake may be associated with sleep
      duration, quality, and patterns. In the last decade, Singapore's population has grown older.
      However, limited research examined the association between food/nutrient intake and indexes
      of sleep in middle-aged and older population in Singapore. Therefore, with a growing number
      of elderly, studies on improving their sleep quality can play a significant role in improving
      their quality of life. This is a cross-sectional study and subjects require a 1-day visit
      (one time visit ONLY). Generally healthy middle-aged and older population will be recruited
      and after the phone screening and validated subjects will complete the medical history
      questionnaire and to be brought on the day of visit. During the visit, subjects will stay
      approximately 3-h to complete the testing. After completing the consent form, fasting-state
      blood collection and general health assessment will be conducted. Then subjects will be asked
      to complete the questionnaires to assess sleep quality and dietary intake.
