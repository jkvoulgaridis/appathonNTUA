  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Work-related musculoskeletal disorders are highly disabling. Therefore, finding preventive
      solutions is fundamental, in order to reduce the damages to workers and society. Therefore
      the objective of this study will be to evaluate the effect of passive and active pauses in
      the control of musculoskeletal complaints of office workers. This is a randomized controlled
      trial by cluster, which will be performed with 286 office workers (administrative sectors).
      Employees with physical disabilities will not be included in the study. The workers will be
      distributed into three groups: active control group, and the two intervention groups massage
      and workout gymnastics. The active control group and the other groups will be guidelines on
      ergonomic adjustments of the work station, and performing a 10-minute break every 50 minutes
      work. The intervention groups (passive and active) will receive different interventions:
      group massage in the chair and group gymnastics labor. The massage will be performed 2x per
      week for 10 minutes, and workout 2x per week for 15-20minutes. The primary outcomes assessed
      will be musculoskeletal complaints of pain intensity. And as a secondary outcome will be the
      ability to work, perception of ergonomic risk factors, psychosocial factors and fatigue,
      level of physical activity. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline and after 4 months. It is
      expected that exercise intervention (active pause) is more effective than passive pause
      (massage), and that pause and guidance can reduce musculoskeletal complaints, pain intensity,
      and other outcomes evaluated.

      Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria Office workers, who work at least 6 hours a day in a sitting
      position, will be included. disabled employees will not be included.

      Sample size: The prevalence of complaints and pain intensity in the arm, neck and shoulder
      regions, in addition to the lumbar region. A statistical power of 80%, Î± = 5%, sample loss of
      15% will be considered for the sample calculation. The reduction expected of the prevalence
      of musculoskeletal complaints and pain will be 20%. Therefore, it will be necessary to
      perform the study 286 workers, allocated in control group (CG), intervention groups (IG),
      passive rest break - Shiatsu - Quick massage (SGM); and comparative group using active rest
      break - Compensatory exercise program(CE).

      the outcomes will be evaluated at the individual level, since they reflect aspects of
      workers' health. Data on outcome measures will be assessed at baseline and after 4 months.
      After a period of 4 months, the sector that received only a break or massage can receive work
      gymnastics, if the hypothesis of this study is confirmed on the effectiveness of the exercise
      on the other interventions. Both groups of workers will be followed up in a longitudinal
      study in subsequent months and compared to the other workers identified, within the
      established criteria for risk analysis, for 4 months.

      Primary outcome: The occurrence of musculoskeletal symptoms (pain, tingling or numbness) will
      be evaluated by means of the Nordic Questionnaire for Musculoskeletal Symptoms The intensity
      of the pain will be evaluated by the Verbal Numerical Scale of Pain23. It is an 11-point
      scale, in which 0 means &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 means &quot;worst possible pain&quot;.

      Secondary outcomes: 1) Work ability index (WAI) to identify the worker's perception at the
      moment or in the near future; 2)

    <description>The occurrence of musculoskeletal symptoms (pain, tingling or numbness) will be evaluated through the Nordic Questionnaire for Musculoskeletal Symptoms (QNSO). The interviewee will answer simple questions (yes or no) regarding the musculoskeletal symptoms he has experienced in the last 12 months and / or the last 7 days, the occurrence of functional incapacity and the demand for help from a health professional in the last 12 months resulting from these symptoms.</description>
