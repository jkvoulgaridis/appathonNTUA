  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this clinical study is to evaluate and compare the bioequivalence between a
      single oral dose of vitamin D3 gummy vitamin versus vitamin D3 tablet in healthy adults.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that the gummy and tablet preparations of vitamin D3 supplement
      will be biologically equivalent, as defined by the absence of a statistically significant
      difference in bioavailability measured as blood levels of vitamin D3 after administration of
      the same oral dose of vitamin D3 as gummy and tablet supplementation.
