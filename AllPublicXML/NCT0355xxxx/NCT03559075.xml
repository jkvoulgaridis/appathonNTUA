  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In dermatology, topical anti-inflammatory medications, such as corticosteroids, are the
      mainstay treatment of managing patients with atopic dermatitis. However, caregivers are often
      apprehensive about choosing a topical steroid for a variety of reasons. Many caregivers are
      not aware that clinical trial evidence for these medications exist, and instead may rely on
      anecdotal evidence in choosing to take these medications. Because fear of the drug is
      inherently subjective, it can be modified with appropriate reassurance and presentation of
      evidence. The goal of the study is to learn whether caregivers are more confident in treating
      a child's atopic dermatitis after being presented with varying amounts of information.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atopic dermatitis is the most common chronic, inflammatory dermatologic condition in young
      children, with a prevalence approaching 25% in some countries. Topical corticosteroids, the
      mainstay treatment in managing atopic dermatitis, generally function to decrease inflammation
      and suppress the immune response. Topical corticosteroids are grouped into distinct
      categories based on their degree of potency, including very high potency (Clobetasol
      propionate), high potency (triamcinolone acetonide), medium potency (fluocinonide), and low
      potency agents (desonide).

      Caregivers are often apprehensive about choosing a topical steroid for a variety of reasons.
      These include hearing negative information about the drug from friends or family, being
      nervous about treatment, or seeing the drug or its side effects negatively portrayed in the
      media. Many parents/caregivers are not aware that clinical trial evidence for these
      medications exist, and instead may rely on anecdotal evidence in choosing to take these
      medications.

      Because fear of the drug is inherently subjective, it can be modified with appropriate
      reassurance and presentation of evidence. By understanding what kind of information will
      allow caregivers to be confident in their decision to use a topical corticosteroid,
      dermatologists may improve treatment adherence and outcomes. The goal of the study is to
      learn whether caregivers are more confident in treating a child's atopic dermatitis after
      being presented with varying amounts of information about the treatment.

    <description>Groups 1, 2, and 3 will be compared to assess whether caregivers are more willing to use a medication to manage their child's atopic dermatitis if presented with clinical trial evidence, anecdotal evidence, or both. Groups 4, 5, and 6 will be compared to assess whether caregivers are more willing to use a topical steroid to manage their child's atopic dermatitis if presented with clinical trial evidence, anecdotal evidence, or both. The results from groups 1, 2, and 3 will then be compared to the results from groups 4, 5, and 6 to assess whether the use of the word &quot;steroid&quot; impacts the caregiver's willingness to treat.</description>
