  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Invasive cervical cancer incidence and mortality can be dramatically reduced through early
      detection and treatment, but many women do not complete screening at recommended intervals.
      Many low-income women in Virginia remain uninsured and are at significant risk of being
      medically underserved and failing to complete regular cervical cancer screening.
      Self-collection of specimens for HPV testing is an innovative approach that may increase
      access to cervical cancer screening in populations that do not participate in traditional
      clinic-based screening. Innovative delivery models are needed to reach at-risk populations.
      This study seeks to explore the acceptability and feasibility of pairing self-collection of
      HPV samples for DNA testing with mobile mammography in women living in rural Virginia.

      The proposed study aims to determine whether offering self-collection for HPV testing through
      the mobile mammography unit is an acceptable and feasible method to increase access to
      cervical cancer screening for under-screened women in rural Virginia. The procedures will be
      recruitment of under-screened women in rural Virginia to complete HPV testing using
      self-collection kits distributed through the mobile mammography unit. Regardless of HPV
      positivity, all women will be provided with information about cervical cancer screening
      (locations, cost, etc.), and will be encouraged to complete Pap screening by a clinician.
