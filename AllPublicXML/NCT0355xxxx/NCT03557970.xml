    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well edicotinib (JNJ-40346527) works in treating participants
      with acute myeloid leukemia that has come back or does not respond to treatment. JNJ-40346527
      may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      Evaluate preliminary efficacy of JNJ-40346527 in participants with relapsed/refractory AML.

      I. Best objective response rate (&gt; PR).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      Assess safety and survival associated with JNJ-40346527 to treat participants with
      relapsed/refractory AML. Assess the duration of disease response associated with
      JNJ-40346527.

      I. Overall incidence of treatment-related and non-treatment related toxicity. II. Duration of
      response. III. 12-month event-free survival. IV. 12-month overall survival.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the pharmacokinetics of JNJ-40346527 and effective inhibition of CSF-1R in marrow
      aspirates using plasma inhibitory assays, with established CSF-1R-sensitive cell lines.

      II. Identify the effect of JNJ-40346527 on leukemia cells and the immune microenvironment.

      III. Identify and quantify the specific subpopulation of cells that express CSF-1R in
      participants and correlate these with clinical response to JNJ-40346527.

      IV. Analyze the frequency of mutations using genomic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from
      leukemia participants to determine if there is a genetic signature that predicts response to
      JNJ-40346527.

      V. Using ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing (RNAseq), identify an expression signature in
      CSF-1R+ cells that predicts patient response.

      VI. Evaluate the effect of JNJ-40346527 on immune cell populations (cytotoxic T cells, etc.)
      and phospho-signaling proteins by mass cytometry (CyTOF) analysis in pre- and post-treatment
      samples in order to identify biomarkers that predict patient response and prioritize
      potential combination strategies for future clinical trials.

      VII. Determine how leukemia cells change in response to CSF-1R inhibition by assessing cells
      collected pre- and post-treatment using an ex vivo sensitivity to a panel of small molecule
      inhibitors to determine what new drug sensitivities may emerge in AML cells after CSF-1R
      inhibition.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive JNJ-40346527 orally (PO) twice a day (BID) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up within 2 weeks, at 4-6
      weeks until death or minimum of 12 months.

    <description>A Simon 2-stage minimax design will be used to determine best objective response. The best objective response and exact confidence interval will be determined using the binomial distribution for each arm separately. Response assessment will be based on best objective response rates within the first 2 cycles of study drug, including complete response (CR), CR with inadequate bone marrow recovery, partial response, stable disease, or progressive disease.</description>
