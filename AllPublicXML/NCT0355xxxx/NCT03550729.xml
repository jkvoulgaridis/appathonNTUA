  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The role of physical training in the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is
      controversial. The aim of the project is to evaluate the effect of physical training on
      markers of endothelial function and integrity and to identify those biomarkers associated
      with a better therapeutic response in patients with PAH and in an experimental model of
      pulmonary hypertension. Methodology: 1) Study in humans: sample size will be 50 patients with
      PAH. Responders and non-responders will be identified for a 12-week resistance training
      program. Before and after the physical training program, endothelial microparticles and
      circulating vascular progenitor cells, and metabolomic and mitochondrial function parameters
      in circulating endothelial cells will be analyzed. Patients will be identified in whom a more
      favorable response to the training program is obtained. Additionally, investigators will
      evaluate the relationship between this response and the biomarkers both at baseline and their
      change with the training program. 2) Study in a murine experimental model: investigators will
      study mice with pulmonary hypertension induced by the administration of Semaxanib (SU5416)
      and exposure to hypoxia for 3 weeks and control mice. Half of them will exercise on a
      treadmill for 3 weeks. At the end of the program the right ventricular pressure will be
      measured and the animals will be sacrificed. Morphometric studies in pulmonary and cardiac
      tissue, pulmonary endothelial function and metabolomic parameters in cardiac and skeletal
      muscle will be performed. Differences in these variables between the different experimental
      groups will be analyzed.
