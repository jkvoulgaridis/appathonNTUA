  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This application proposes a 2-arm randomized controlled trial comparing the impact of PHAT
      Life on 350 13-17 year-old offenders' risky sex, STI, substance use, and theoretical
      mediators when delivered by Youth Representatives (YR) vs. probation staff (PS). 100
      facilitators will be recruited to deliver the intervention and participate in the research.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main objectives of the proposed study are to compare the effectiveness,
      cost-effectiveness, and sustainability of Youth Representative-led vs. probation staff-led
      PHAT Life in a real-world juvenile probation setting. The Specific Aims of this study are:

        1. To conduct a methodologically-rigorous 2-arm trial comparing the impact of PHAT Life on
           350 13-17 year-old offenders' risky sex, STI, substance use, and theoretical mediators
           when delivered by Youth Representatives (YR) vs. probation staff (PS).

        2. To compare the costs and cost-effectiveness of 100 YR-led vs. PS-led PHAT Life with
           respect to the acquisition of incident STI.

      We hypothesize: (a) Compared to teens in PS-led groups, we expect teens in YR-led groups to
      report less risky sex and substance use at 6-month follow-up, to demonstrate greater
      improvement on theoretical mediators of risk, and to have fewer incident STI infections; (b)
      We expect YR-led PHAT Life to cost less and be more cost-effective than PS-led PHAT Life.
