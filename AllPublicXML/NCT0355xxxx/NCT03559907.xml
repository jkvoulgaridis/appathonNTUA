  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will estimate the unique and additive benefits of two parent-training
      programs (Cooking Matters for Parents and Promoting Routines of Exploration and Play during
      Mealtime) offered in undeserved communities.

      The overall purpose of this research study is to estimate the nutritional benefits (in terms
      of intake and variety) of the Mealtime PREP intervention, as compared to, and in combination
      with nutrition education programming being offered in underserved neighborhoods of the
      greater Pittsburgh area. This project will examine the effects of Mealtime PREP groups as
      compared with established nutrition education groups, Cooking Matters for Parents. More
      importantly, this study will determine if offering these interventions in combination offers
      greater benefits than each in isolation. There are two specific aims of this pilot trial.

        1. To examine the effects of a combined program (Cooking Matters + Mealtime PREP) in
           comparison to offering each of these programs (Cooking Matters vs. Mealtime PREP) in
           isolation on child nutrition over time.

        2. To explore the effects of each of these programs (Cooking Matters vs. Mealtime PREP) and
           the combined program (Cooking Matters + Mealtime PREP) on parental stress and
           parent/child interaction over time.

      The investigators predict that children in all three arms (Cooking Matters, Mealtime PREP,
      and Cooking Matters + Mealtime PREP) will demonstrate improved nutrition. The investigators
      also predict that participants who receive the Mealtime PREP intervention will demonstrate
      better stability of gains over time.

    <measure>Change from Baseline 3-Day Food Diary (dietary variety) at 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The 3-Day Food Diary is the preferred method of dietary assessment (intake and variety of food consumed) because of a balance between validity and burden. Includes all food consumed and approximate servings for 3 days.Frequencies of foods consumed from different food groups and basic nutritional intake related to the numbers of servings of food in each food group consumed will be calculated. Servings in each category will be compared to national daily recommendations.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline Nutrition Screening Tool for Every Preschooler (nutritional risk) at 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>17 item, validated screen for young children (1-5 years) that categorizes risk of nutritional problems into 3 categories (score range = 1 (minimum) - 68 (maximum); 1 - 20 = low risk, 21-25 = moderate risk, and 26+ = high risk). Higher scores indicate higher risk for nutritional problems (i.e. lower scores are better).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline Parenting-Stress Inventory, Short-Form (PSI-SF) at 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>36 item scale validated in a sample of low-income families with preschoolers to assess parental stress in three domains and overall. Raw scores are converted to percentiles for interpretation using this tool. For the total parenting stress score, and all three domain scores (Parental Distress, Parent-Child Dysfunctional Interaction, and Difficult Child), higher percentiles are interpreted as higher stress (range =1-99%) with scores &gt;90% indicating clinically significant levels of parenting stress.</description>

    <description>Cooking Matters for Parents focuses on teaching parents of young children important lessons about self-sufficiency in the kitchen. Participants have the opportunity to practice fundamental lessons including knife skills, reading ingredient labels, cutting up a whole chicken, and making a healthy meal for a family of four on a budget of ten dollars. Each session includes meal preparation, didactic teaching, and sharing the meal as a group. Instructors share their education and experience and discuss how to choose healthy, affordable fruits and vegetables at the grocery store. Each week, adults take home a bag of groceries after each class so they can practice the recipes taught that day.</description>

    <description>Parents are trained to deliver each intervention component during mealtimes using a step-wise, behavioral activation approach. The parent-training prong of the Mealtime PREP intervention incorporates four active ingredients of behavioral activation (1. skills training; 2. goal-setting; 3. activity scheduling; and 4. activity monitoring) to help parents build a family meal routine that is enriched with techniques to promote child food acceptance. Each week, parents will take home healthy groceries to practice making healthy snacks and side dishes in the home.</description>
