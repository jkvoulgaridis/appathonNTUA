  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic respiratory disease characterized
      by persistent respiratory symptoms and airflow limitation. Pervasive dynamic pulmonary
      hyperinflation (DPH) and intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEPi) can increase
      inspiratory threshold load and respiratory effort, leading to abnormal changes in respiratory
      mechanics and neural respiratory drive (NRD). Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation
      (NPPV) is not only widely used in respiratory failure, but also is one of the important lung
      rehabilitation strategies. Several studies have reported that the use of biphasic positive
      airway pressure (BIPAP) mode for NPPV can improve ventilation, reduce NRD, improve NRD
      coupling, significantly reduce inspiratory muscle load and relieve symptoms. However,
      relatively few studies are reported that the NPPV is used in COPD patients without
      non-respiratory failure. Therefore, we suppose that for stable COPD patients without
      respiratory failure, early intervention with NPPV may reduce DPH, eliminate the adverse
      effects of PEEPi, reduce the respiratory muscle load, improve the respiratory physiological
      characteristics, and delay the progression of the disease. Therefore, the purpose of this
      study is to observe the influence of different levels of BIPAP ventilation on respiratory
      mechanics and NRD in patients with stable COPD, and to explore whether BiPAP ventilation can
      be used as a pulmonary rehabilitation method for early intervention of COPD and provide a
      theoretical basis for subsequent clinical trials.

      The patients with COPD will be admitted in one intervention groups. Before using BiPAP
      ventilation, we will measure the relevant parameters of lung volume, respiratory flow,
      diaphragm electromyogram, neural respiratory drive mechanical and other baseline index. Then
      incremental pressure support will be applied to investigate the effects of different levels
      of BIPAP ventilation on respiratory mechanics and neural respiratory drive.
