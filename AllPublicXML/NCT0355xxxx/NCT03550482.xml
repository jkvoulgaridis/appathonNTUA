      It is expected that additional support with certain micronutrients may improve prognosis,
      decrease the frequency of side effects and complications and maintain high relative dose
      intensity of anticancer treatments. Food supplement ONCOXIN (ONCX) contains amino acids,
      vitamins, minerals and biologically active substances of natural origin with high
      immunostimulatory and antioxidant activity. Present study is a real world experience study
      intended to evaluate the efficacy of ONCX in cancer patients.

    <textblock>
      The study was conducted at 9 centers across the Russia and Kazakhstan. Patients were
      allocated in 2:1 comparison groups for the ONCX and control groups, respectively. A total of
      133 patients were enrolled in the study; 84 in the ONCX group and 49 as controls.

      ONCX contains microelements, vitamins, amino acids and certain naturally occurring,
      biologically active substances.

      It is expected that additional support with certain micronutrients may improve prognosis,
      decrease the frequency of side effects and complications and maintain the Quality of life in
      cancer patients.

    <intervention_model_description>Study multicenter open-label nonrandomized clinical trial in two parallel groups with a 20-day treatment period. No follow-up period was intended. Following visits were scheduled: Visit 1 - the first day of 2nd and further course of ACT before ACT drugs administration; Visit 2 - 7±1 days before next course of ACT; Visit 3 - the day of next course of ACT before ACT drugs administration (21±3 days after Visit 1).
It is expected, that the proportion of patients with MCID improvement in total SDS ESAS was 50% in ONCX group and 20% in control group (with baseline total SDS ESAS of 30 points). Based on patients` allocation as 2:1 in comparison groups for the ONCX and control groups, respectively, alpha 0.05 and power not less than 0.9 data of 120 patients has to be analyzed. With the dropout of 25% 150 patients has to be included in the study (100 ONCX/50 controls).</intervention_model_description>
