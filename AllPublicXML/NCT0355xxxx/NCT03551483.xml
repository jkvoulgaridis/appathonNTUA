  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research proposed here will evaluate whether a web-based recreation intervention, called
      ArtontheBrain, has positive health benefits to older adult users. ArtontheBrain incorporates
      three basic activities; learning (history of the artwork), play (telling stories, solving
      puzzles) and socializing with other users, either in person or online. It can be used alone,
      with another person, or in a group. It is modeled after participatory arts-based
      interventions which studies have shown are associated with health benefits in older adults,
      such as improved sense of well-being, physical health, decreased risk of dementia, and
      reduced need for health services. Our study will test ArtontheBrain at research sites and
      health agencies in Canada, the U.S., and the U.K. with older adults with and without
      cognitive decline. The study will also examine how well that app can support different user
      play modalities and whether it can effect positive health outcomes similar to face-to-face
      arts interventions.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our project seeks to validate the positive health impacts of a mobile health (mhealth)
      intervention, called ArtontheBrain; a web-based application (app) aimed at promoting
      cognitive health in older adults, aging at home, through mentally and socially engaging
      recreation. The app was created in response to research showing: a) older adults with chronic
      health conditions experience reduced access to enjoyable recreation due to various barriers
      (e.g., sensory loss, cognitive decline, mobility limitations, geography and low mood); and b)
      participatory arts-based recreation is associated with health benefits in seniors (e.g.,
      enhanced well-being, improved physical health, decreased risk of dementia, and reduced use of
      healthcare resources). There are limited evidence-based solutions for consumers and this
      clinical validation will provide information about the efficacy of ArtontheBrain in achieving
      positive health outcomes to guide health practitioners and older adult consumers toward
      proven products.

      Based on quality of life (QOL) benefits for older adults, reported from participatory arts
      interventions, we hypothesize that engagement with ArtontheBrain will produce similar
      improvements in QOL in our study participants, driven by specific features of this type of
      intervention e.g., self-directed, flexible level of complexity, driven by the user. Secondary
      outcomes hypothesized for engagement with the intervention, include benefits to: active
      living, aspects of cognition (e.g., attention control, reasoning) and health seeking
      behaviours. These hypotheses are encouraged by findings from our initial pilot testing which
      showed improvement in self-perceived health-related QOL and reduced doctor visits in our
      pilot participants and established proof of principle for the ArtontheBrain with respect to
      positive user feedback on their experience with this recreation app.

    <time_frame>Change from baseline social engagement at 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Social Engagement Survey evaluates an individual's level of social engagement by their social network size, social activities and social support. In the first section, social network size is measured by asking participants to list the names of people in their lives who meet the following criteria: 1) someone with whom you feel close and can talk about personal matters; and 2) someone you have contact with at least once per month. The next section comprises 6-items of social activities measured along a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (i.e., once a year or less) to 5 (i.e., every day or nearly every day) and participants are to report whether they have engaged in that activity in the past year. In the last section, participants are to respond along a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (i.e., very strongly disagree) to 7 (i.e., very strongly agree) on 4-items pertaining to social support.</description>

    <description>The ArtontheBrain intervention has three activities focused on a user selected artwork. The activities promote an in-depth analysis of the artwork and are organized into three activity categories; learn, play, and mingle. In 'learn', the options are to read and/or listen to the curatorial description of the artwork. In 'play', the options are to engage in a word search game, to engage in a visual puzzle game, or to engage in a storytelling game whereby a reminiscence or imaged story can be written. In 'mingle' the options involve social communications about the artwork that include seeing what other comments and seeing how the artwork has been rated by others. The mingle option permits the user to engage only with a select circle of users or to engage with a group of public users.</description>
