  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-adherence is widespread in the transplant community. Addressing issues associated with
      non-adherence remains a key challenge in transplantation, in part due to the difficulty in
      assessing its prevalence, as there is currently no 'gold standard' for use in routine
      clinical practice.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the non-adherence to immunosuppressive therapy,
      including tacrolimus once-daily, among Italian kidney transplant recipients receiving. Along
      with non-adherence evaluation, possible factors related to NA will be investigated
      (patient-related, condition/disease-related, therapy/treatment-related, etc.).

    <description>Proportion of non-adherent patients to immunosuppressive therapy as measured by the Basel Assessment of Adherence with Immunosuppressives Scale (BAASIS©-interview). The BAASIS© consists of four items (with a 6-point scale for responses ranging from never (0) to every day (5)) measuring patients' taking, skipping (or drug holidays), timing (&gt;2 hrs from prescribed time) and dose reduction of drugs. An affirmative answer to any of the first 4 questions results in assignment to the non-adherent group.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Describe the patient's belief about immunosuppresive medicines, as measured by the Belief about Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ). It is an 18-item measure comprising of two subscales (general harm and general overuse), and two subscales (specific necessity and specific concerns). Higher scores in the General-Harm and General-Overuse sub-scales represent an overall negative perception of medication. High scores in the Specific-Concerns sub-scale means that adverse reactions are potentially harmful and high scores in the Specific-Necessity sub-scale are indicative of the patient's need to adhere to medication to maintain health.</description>

    <measure>ACCEPT score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Describe the patient's acceptance toward immunosuppressive treatment, as measured by the ACCEPT questionnaire. It is a 32-items self-administered questionnaire and covers patient's opinion on: convenience of the medication, length of treatment, constraints due to medication, side effects and a general opinion on the medication. The score ranges from 0 (no acceptance) to 100 (maximum treatment acceptance).</description>
