    <textblock>
      This is a phase II clinical trial of SHR-1210 （an anti-PD-1 Inhibitor） simultaneously
      combined with hypofraction radiotherapy in patients with previously treated oligometastatic
      NSCLC.

      It is a single center, single arm, open label trial. Subjects with oligometastatic
      non-small-cell lung cancer who is previously treated will be recruited. 12 subjects will be
      enrolled at the first part of the study which aims to evaluate the tolerability of SHR-1210
      in combination with hypofraction radiotherapy. 30 subjects will be enrolled at the second
      part of the study which aims to evaluate the primary efficacy and safety of SHR-1210 in
      combination with hypofraction radiotherapy.
