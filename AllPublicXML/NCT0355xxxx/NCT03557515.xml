      This study seeks to decrease distress in the lives of the caregivers who are helping cancer
      patients who have entered a phase 1 clinical trial. The P1-CaLL study uses a psychosocial
      intervention aimed at decreasing distress through the utilization of adaptive coping
      strategies (e.g., meditation, emotion-focused coping) and cognitive behavioral techniques.
      Caregivers will receive 4 weeks of stress-management sessions (over the phone). Then, they
      will be randomized to receive 4 more weekly sessions of either Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
      or Metta-Meditation (over the phone). Participants will receive tasks to complete each week.
