    <textblock>
      Invariant Natural killer T (iNKT) cells are a unique subset of lymphocytes that express
      homogeneous TCR recognizing KRN7000 which was up-regulated by many kinds of cancer cells.The
      hypothesis of the investigators is that immunotherapy strategy of infusion of iNKT cells may
      resist inflection and decrease the tumor burden and improve overall survival. The purpose of
      this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of treatment of tuberculosis with malignant
      solid tumor by infusing of iNKT cells.

    <textblock>
      Treatment of tuberculosis with malignant solid tumor is great unsolved challenge to the
      physicians. Efficacy of conventional treatment, such as surgery, radiotherapy and
      chemotherapy is limited. AS novel therapy, immunotherapy shows great prospects.

      Human iNKT cells can directly lysis tumor cells by a perforin-dependent mechanism,and
      intracellular granzyme B expression may also potentiate cell killing. Tumor cells expressing
      CD1d may be especially susceptible to direct NKT cell lysis. iNKT cells play important role
      in immune regulation by secreting various cytokines. Expansion method of iNKT cells in vitro
      is developed as published in the patent of the investigators. Infusion of iNKT cells has been
      proved safe in mice.

      In this clinical trial, the safety and efficacy of the immunotherapy of infusion of iNKT
      cells are assessed.
