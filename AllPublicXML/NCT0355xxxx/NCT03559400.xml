  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Local application of antibiotics directly to the traumatic wound is a promising strategy for
      the prevention of infection after open tibia fractures, which are a significant source of
      disease burden globally, particularly in low-income countries. This pilot study aims to
      assess feasibility of a randomized controlled trial to measure the effect of locally applied
      gentamicin on risk of infection for open tibial fractures in Tanzania. If proven effective,
      local gentamicin would be a highly cost-effective strategy to reduce complications and
      disability from open tibial fractures that could impact care in both high- and low-income
      countries.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study is being conducted in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania to assess the feasibility of a
      masked, placebo-controlled, randomized trial to compare local gentamicin injection to saline
      injection in open tibial shaft fractures. The study will enroll patients within 1 week of
      injury. The active or placebo agent will be administered during the initial surgical
      debridement based on a web-based randomization tool. Patients will be followed for 1 year
      after surgery to assess for the occurrence of fracture-related infection (FRI), a consensus
      definition of infection after open fracture or insertion of internal fixation to treat
      fracture. Additional clinical and economic endpoints will also be measured.

      Depending on the outcome of the feasibility study, we may undertake a definitive trial to
      test the effectiveness of local gentamicin to prevent FRI. If proven effective, local
      gentamicin would impact the clinical care of open fracture patients both in Tanzania and
      likely in high-income settings as well. These data will also deepen the understanding of the
      clinical and economic impact of FRI in open fracture populations.

    <measure>Occurrence of fracture-related Infection (FRI)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome for the definitive trial is occurrence of fracture-related infection (FRI), a binary variable. Any of the four following diagnostic criteria are confirmatory for FRI:
fistula, sinus or wound breakdown
purulent drainage from the wound or presence of pus during surgery
phenotypically indistinguishable pathogens identified by culture from at least two separate deep tissue/implant specimens
presence of microorganisms in deep tissue taken during an operative intervention, as seen on histopathological examination.
All primary events will be reviewed by a masked adjudication committee comprised of 3 non-treating fellowship-trained orthopaedic trauma surgeons.</description>

    <description>EuroQol-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) measures general health status in five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. The raw score will be translated to a utility score ranging from 0 (death or no health) to 1 (perfect health) on a continuous scale using health-state valuations from Zimbabwe.</description>

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Radiographic healing as measured by the modified Radiographic Union Scale for Tibial fractures (mRUST). mRUST scores each cortex on an AP and lateral radiograph from a score of 1 (no callus) to 4 (remodeled, fracture not visible). Thus, mRUST ranges from 4 (worst healing score) to 16 (best healing score).</description>

    <measure>Function index for trauma (FIX-IT) score</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical healing of the fracture will be assessed using the Function index for trauma (FIX-IT) score, which evaluates weight bearing and pain in patients with lower extremity fractures. The FIX-IT score is a clinical outcomes assessment measure ranging from 0 to 12 points in two domains: the ability to bear weight (maximum 6 points) and pain at the fracture site (maximum 6 points). The maximum score of 12 indicates the highest level of function.</description>
