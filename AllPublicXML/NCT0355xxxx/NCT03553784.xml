  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are 21,500 gynaecological cancers diagnosed in the UK each year. These are often
      diagnosed later than common cancers, which is predictive of low survival and high
      psychological distress. There are few studies published which accurately map the profile of
      distress and supportive care needs in gynaecological cancer patients, nor which test
      psychological interventions to support this group.

      This study will use a non-randomised controlled trial design to explore the potential
      benefits of taking part in a psychological intervention designed in this group of women. The
      intervention is group-delivered and runs for eight weeks. It is delivered by psychologists,
      psychological wellbeing practitioners, and cancer nurse specialists. The investigators will
      use validated self-report questionnaires to assess how helpful this intervention is at
      reducing distress and improving quality of life in the participants. This will be done in
      comparison with a treatment-as-usual control group recruited from a second clinical site.
      This second group of participants will not receive the psychological intervention, but they
      will complete the same assessments, at the same time points. To ensure participants are well
      supported, data collection in control control group participants will be done by telephone
      interview rather than self-report questionnaires. Both groups of participants will undertake
      a three-month follow-up assessment to check the longer-term effectiveness of the
      psychological intervention.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>last 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A nine-item screening tool to assess symptoms of depression in the responding individual (Kroenke, Spitzer, &amp; Williams, 2001). The PHQ-9 uses a four-point rating scale (ranging from 0 to 3) asking how often in the last two weeks participants have experienced symptoms pertaining to appetite, concentration, energy hopelessness, and suicidality. Higher scores indicate higher levels of distress. The PHQ-9 has been established as a valid and reliable measure of depression severity (Kroenke et al., 2001).</description>

    <measure>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7)</measure>
    <time_frame>last 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A seven-item screening tool to assess symptoms of anxiety in the responding individual (Spitzer, Kroenke, Williams, &amp; LÃ¶we, 2006). The GAD-7 uses a four-point rating scale (ranging from 0 to 3) asking how often in the last two weeks participants have experienced symptoms pertaining to feeling anxious, worried, difficulty relaxing, and irritability. Higher scores indicate higher distress. The GAD-7 has been established as an accurate measure of anxiety (Swinson, 2006).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G)</measure>
    <time_frame>last 7 days</time_frame>
    <description>A 33-item screening tool to assess quality-of-life in patients receiving cancer treatment (Cella et al., 1993). The FACT-G uses a five-point rating scale (ranging from 0 to 4) asking how often in the last seven days patients have experienced difficulties in four dimensions of well-being: physical; social/family; emotional; functional. Higher scores indicate lower quality-of-life. The FACT-G is a well validated tool for measuring quality-of-life in cancer sample (Luckett et al., 2011).</description>

    <description>The intervention is group-delivered, low-intensity CBT similar to that used in IAPT (Improving Access to Psychological Therapies) Services in England. This intervention is already being offered as part of standard care at the Intervention site, and will not be altered by the study protocol, other than the requirement to complete a few more questionnaires. The intervention group meets weekly for eight weeks, and is facilitated by a clinical psychologist, a psychological well-being practitioner and a clinical nurse specialist from the medical oncology team. Content of the intervention is broad CBT, combining aspects of second-wave CBT, with elements of Narrative Therapy and ACT.</description>

    <ipd_description>An anonymised dataset will be prepared once our study is completed, primarily to ensure that access can be provided to journal editors and peer reviewers if requested through the publishing and dissemination process. We would consider requests to share this data with other research teams, provided that individual participants have consented to this .
In releasing such data we will include self-report psychological measures, demographics as reported to the research team by the participant, and clinical data as extracted from patient records. We will not release information on hospital site, simply reporting that participants were recruited from anonymised UK hospitals. Thus, without access to how these match NHS records, it ought not to be possible to identify individuals from this dataset. This is carefully explained to participants in the study information sheets as an assurance of commitment to participant anonymity.</ipd_description>
