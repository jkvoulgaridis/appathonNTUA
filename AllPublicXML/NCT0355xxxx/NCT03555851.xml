  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the influence of donor and recipient pharmacogenetics (PG), drug
      pharmacokinetics (PK), and T cell phenotypes and how it may permit a tailored dosing strategy
      to improve the therapeutic index of post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) and optimize the
      graft versus tumor effect, while minimizing acute and chronic graft versus host disease
      (GVHD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this single-arm, pilot study is to determine whether
      pharmacogenetics (PG) of Cy-related candidate genes from the recipients and/or donors
      (haploidentical and matched related donor HCTs only) germ-line DNA is associated with
      incidence and severity of acute and chronic GVHD. Secondary objectives include determining
      whether pharmacogenetics (PG) of Cy-related candidate genes from the recipients and/or donors
      (haploidentical and matched related donor HCTs only) germ-line DNA is associated with Cy (and
      metabolites) exposure and toxicities; quantifying Cy (and related metabolites) exposure
      measured as the area under the concentration time curve (AUC) from zero to 24 hours both
      before (day -6) and after transplant (day +3), and correlate exposure with incidence of acute
      and chronic GVHD, and Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs); and determining whether
      immune activation or polarization prior to or following Cy GVHD prophylaxis is associated
      with grade of acute or chronic GVHD grade and AESIs. Safety objects include evaluating Cy
      administered, adverse events of special interest (including deaths while on study therapy),
      selected laboratory parameters (including time to neutrophil recovery), and immunosuppressant
      concomitant medications administration. Initially, 20 participants (HCT recipients and their
      respective haploidentical or matched related donors) will be enrolled with a subsequent 100
      additional subjects enrolled.
