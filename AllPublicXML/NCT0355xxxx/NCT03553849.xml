  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are studying the use of a two-week very low calorie diet (VLCD) in obese
      general surgery patients in a randomized single-blinded trial. The investigators hypothesize
      that the VLCD will positively impact the perceived surgical difficulty, operative time,
      hospital length of stay and 30-day complications. Additionally, the investigators anticipate
      reduced perioperative blood glucose levels and a reduced need for perioperative insulin
      administration.

      The investigators' objective for this project is to determine the impact of a preoperative
      VLCD on outcomes for patients undergoing elective general surgery. Included are patients who
      are obese, BMI &gt;30, and scheduled by a Christiana Care-employed general surgeon for elective
      general surgery. Eligible patients are those scheduled for elective cholecystectomy, ventral
      or incisional hernia, umbilical hernia, and inguinal hernia surgery.

      The investigators will also be determining the feasibility of introducing a preoperative VLCD
      for patients undergoing elective general surgery in a Community Hospital setting.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are obese, BMI &gt;30, and scheduled by a Christiana Care-employed general
             surgeon for elective general surgery.

          -  Patients between the ages of 18 and 65.

          -  Patients scheduled for elective cholecystectomy, ventral or incisional hernia,
             umbilical hernia, and inguinal hernia surgery.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients will be excluded from the study if they have any of the following:

               1. Recent myocardial infarction (3-6 months).

               2. History of cerebral vascular accident (stroke).

               3. Diabetes mellitus with a history of severe ketoacidosis.

               4. Patients on SGLT2 inhibitors (glifozins) without insulin

               5. Chronic use of steroids, greater than 20mg daily.

               6. Bleeding peptic ulcer (unless there is radiological evidence of healing 6 months
                  prior to entry).

               7. A psychiatric history that includes suicide attempts and anyone taking
                  psychotropic drugs, including lithium carbonate.

               8. Active thrombophlebitis (or any other condition where decreased blood volume
                  would put the patient at risk).

          -  In addition, patients who are pregnant are excluded. If status is unknown, a pregnancy
             test will be required prior to the start of the VLCD.
