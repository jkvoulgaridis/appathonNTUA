      The drug being tested in this survey is called leuprorelin acetate injection kit 11.25 mg.
      This injection kit is being tested to treat people who have SBMA.

      This survey is an observational (non-interventional) study and will look at the long-term
      safety and efficacy of the leuprorelin acetate injection kit 11.25 mg in the routine clinical
      setting. The planned number of observed patients will be approximately 300.

      This multi-center observational trial will be conducted in Japan.
