  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators believe that this simple, clear, and objective study may be a great help in
      understanding the accommodative response during various accommodative stimulation conditions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose in this study was to investigate physiological changes in accommodative power,
      pupil diameter, astigmatic value, and axis when visual stimuli were applied under binocular,
      monocular (dominant eye, non-dominant eye, ipsilateral, and contralateral), and pinhole
      conditions using the WAM-5500 binocular autorefractor/keratometer (Grand Seiko Co. Ltd.,
      Hiroshima, Japan).

    <description>Astigamtic value in diopters and axis change in degrees were measured using WAM-5500 binocular autorefractor/keratometer The spherical equivalent (sphere + 1/2 cylinder) was used to assess the response to refractive stimuli. The principal meridian of the cylinder for 0.25D refractive stimulus was set to the baseline axis. For 2D, 3D, and 4D refractive stimuli, vertical movement was determined when the baseline meridian moved to the 90' axis, and it was considered horizontal movement when it moved to the 0' or 180' axis.</description>

    <description>: Subjects underwent a basic ophthalmic examination and the accommodative response to refractive stimuli was measured. Refractive stimuli were given at 0.25 diopters (D) (4 m distance), 2D (50 cm), 3D (33 cm), and 4D (25 cm) and stimulation was applied with the eyes in binocular, monocular (dominant eye, non-dominant eye, ipsilateral, and contralateral), and pinhole conditions. In addition, changes in the astigmatic value and direction of the astigmatism axis under binocular stimulus were evaluated.</description>
