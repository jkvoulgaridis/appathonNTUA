  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent TAF has introduced to have more safe profiles than TDF in clinical trials. Especially,
      TDF has the renal safety issue in high risk group including HIV, decompensated cirrhosis
      (ascites), uncontrolled DM etc.

      However, there is no available cohort data for treatment efficacy and safety in TDF-TAF
      switch therapy in treatment-naïve chronic hepatitis B.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate safety and efficacy of TAF switch therapy in patients
      with chronic hepatitis B who have been treated with TDF.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Must have the ability to understand and sign a written informed consent form, which
             must be obtained prior to initiation of study procedures.

          2. Adult male and non-pregnant, non-lactating female subjects, 18 years of age and older,
             based on the date of the screening visit. A negative serum pregnancy test at Screening
             is required for female subjects of childbearing potential (unless surgically sterile
             or greater than 2 years post-menopausal).

          3. Documented evidence of chronic HBV infection (e.g. HBsAg positive for more than 6
             months)

          4. Previous TDF naïve treatment (more than 96 weeks) baseline status including chronic
             hepatitis B with the following:

               -  HBeAg-positive and HBeAb negative at Screening

               -  Screening HBV DNA ≥ 1x 105 copies/mL

               -  Screening serum ALT level ≥2×ULN(80 IU/L) and ≤ 10 ×ULN (by center laboratory
                  range) OR

               -  HBeAg-negative and HBeAb positive at Screening

               -  Screening HBV DNA ≥ 1x 104 copies/mL

               -  Screening serum ALT level ≥2×ULN(80 IU/L) and ≤ 10 ×ULN (by center laboratory
                  range) OR

               -  Cirrhosis at Screening

               -  Screening HBV DNA ≥ 1x 104 copies/mL regardless of HBeAg status

                    -  Treatment naïve subjects defined as no history of antiviral therapy or &lt; 12
                       weeks of oral antiviral treatment with any nucleoside or nucleotide
                       analogue, including lamivudine or adefovir, clevudine, telbivudine,
                       entecavir

          5. The decision is made by the provider and patient to switch from TDF to TAF prior to
             discussion of the study of enrollment

          6. Following the decision to switch therapy, signed written informed consent after being
             instructed about the objective and procedure of the clinical study

          7. Must be willing and able to comply with all study requirements

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects who meet any of the following exclusion criteria are not to be enrolled in the

             pregnant during the course of the study.

          2. Co-infection with HCV, HIV

          3. Evidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (e.g. α-fetoprotein&gt; 50 ng/mL or as evidenced by
             recent ultrasound or other standard of care measure)

          4. Malignancy within 5 years prior to screening, with the exception of specific cancers
             that are cured by surgical resection (basal cell skin cancer, etc). Subjects under
             evaluation for possible malignancy are not eligible

          5. Current alcohol or substance abuse judged by the investigator to potentially interfere
             with subject compliance

          6. Currently receiving therapy with cytotoxic agent, nephrotoxic agents, or agents
             capable of modifying renal excretion

          7. Any other clinical condition or prior therapy that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, would make the subject unsuitable for the study or unable to comply with
             dosing requirements.
