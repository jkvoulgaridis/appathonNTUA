  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sevoflurane is as attractive inhalation agent fore deep sedation in children undergoing short
      invasive procedure because of lack of irritation to the respiratory tract, a pleasant odor
      and rapid clinical effect and recovery due to low blood gas partition coefficient.

      The aim of this study is to determine the optimum inspired concentration of sevoflurane
      required for immobility during botulinum toxin injection in spontaneously breathing children
      with cerebral palsy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All anesthetics were administered by a single experienced anesthesiologist. Before
      administration of sevoflurane, remifentanil infusion was started at a rate of 0.05 Î¼g/kg/min
      without initial bolus. Five minutes after the start of the remifentanil infusion, Anesthetic
      induction was performed progressively with inhaled 1-8% sevoflurane, if the patient was
      cooperative, otherwise directly to the 8%, and subsequent maintenance 2% in oxygen at 5 L
      /min. A face mask was connected to a Mapleson C circuit for it. Patients breathed
      spontaneously, unaided, via a pediatric face mask. A failure was defined as the patient
      continued to move after following the study protocol for sevoflurane inhalation. Insufficient
      sedation was treated with increments of 0.5% concentration to achieve the desired effect, ie,
      maintenance of immobility during botulinum toxin injection. The sevoflurane concentration in
      the next patient would be adjusted depending on the success or failure for immobility at
      given sevoflurane concentration ( if successful, 0.5% lower concentration, if failed, 0.5%
      higher concentration).

      The child was recovered from sevoflurane sedation at the end of botulinum toxin injection and
      transferred to post-anesthetic care unit.
