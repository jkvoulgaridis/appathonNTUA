      This phase Ib trials studies the side effects and how well talimogene laherparepvec works
      when given together with paclitaxel or endocrine therapy in treating participants with breast
      cancer that does not express the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) protein and
      has spread to other places in the body, cannot be removed by surgery, or has come back after.
      Biological therapies, such as talimogene laherparepvec, use substances made from living
      organisms that may attack specific tumor cells and stop them from growing or kill them. Drugs
      used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor
      cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from
      spreading. Estrogen can cause the growth of breast cancer cells. Drugs used as endocrine
      therapy, such as letrozole, anastrozole, exemestane, tamoxifen or fulvestrant, may lessen the
      amount of estrogen made by the body or may may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking
      estrogen from connecting to the cancer cells. Giving talimogene laherparepvec with paclitaxel
      or endocrine therapy may work better in treating participants with HER2-negative breast
      cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of intra-lesional talimogene laherparepvec
      administration in combination with paclitaxel or endocrine therapy in patients with
      metastatic, unresectable, or locoregionally recurrent HER2-negative breast cancer with
      injectable sites of disease.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy of talimogene laherparepvec in combination with paclitaxel in the
      study population using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria.

      II. To evaluate the efficacy of talimogene laherparepvec in combination with endocrine
      therapy in the study population using RECIST 1.1 criteria.

      OUTLINE: Participants are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts.

      COHORT I (PACLITAXEL): Participants receive talimogene laherparepvec intra-tumorally (IT)
      every 2 weeks for the first 12 weeks and then every 3 weeks thereafter. Participants also
      receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      COHORT II (ENDOCRINE THERAPY): Participants receive talimogene laherparepvec IT every 2 weeks
      for the first 12 weeks and then every 3 weeks thereafter. Participants also receive letrozole
      orally (PO), anastrazole PO, exemestane PO, tamoxifen PO on days 1-28 or fulvestrant
      intramuscularly (IM) every 2 weeks for 3 doses then every 4 weeks for the subsequent courses.
      Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up for 30 days.
