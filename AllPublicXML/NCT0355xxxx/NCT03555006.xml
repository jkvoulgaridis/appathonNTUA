      This study tries to evaluate the non-inferiority quality and safety of ultrasound
      examinations realise by electro-radiology assistant with a remote radiologist compared to
      those realize by electro-radiology assistant with a referent radiologist on site.

      The number of requests for medical imaging examinations is clearly growing while there is an
      understaffing among the radiologists. The solution is the amelioration of information
      transmission technologies, for organize a territorial teleradiology in order to care duty.
      Currently, in the ultrasound field, the investigators can't realize image transfer because
      analyse and expertise are made during examination and only reading of fixed images can't be
      enough for the examination interpretation.

      The most part of other developed countries recognize a paramedical job devoted to ultrasound.
      Tele-ultrasound is used in expert resort, for example during high-risk pregnancy.

      A French society commercializes tele-ultrasound robots, arranged by a caregiver beside sick
      person and a tele-radiologist realize acquisition of information and images with remote
      commands from robot.

      The CHR Metz-Thionville has a cooperation protocol between electro-radiology assistants and
      radiologists for the ultrasound practical, endorsed by Lorraine ARS and HAS (French health
      organizations) since 2012, and currently national impact.

      This study purpose to evaluation the non-inferiority of agreement between two interpretations
      of the same ultrasound realize by an electro-radiology assistant on the one hand by two
      radiologists present in the radiology service and on the other hand, one radiologist in by
      the radiology service and one remote radiologist.
