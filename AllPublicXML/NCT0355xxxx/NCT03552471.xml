      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of mirvetuximab soravtansine and
      rucaparib camsylate in treating participants with endometrial, ovarian, fallopian tube or
      primary peritoneal cancer that has come back. Drugs such as mirvetuximab soravtansine are
      antibodies linked to a toxic substance and may help find certain tumor cells and kill them
      without harming normal cells. Rucaparib camsylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving mirvetuximab soravtansine and
      rucaparib camsylate may work better in treating participants with recurrent endometrial,
      ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the recommended phase II dose (RPTD) of combination mirvetuximab soravtansine
      and rucaparib camsylate (rucaparib) in patients with recurrent endometrial, epithelial
      ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube carcinoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of combination mirvetuximab soravtansine and
      rucaparib in study patients.

      II. To explore the objective antitumor activity (complete and partial response) of
      combination mirvetuximab soravtansine and rucaparib as measured by Response Evaluation
      Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria in the study population.

      III. To measure the progression free survival. IV. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of
      mirvetuximab soravtansine and rucaparib in combination.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Explore additional biomarkers of response. II. Explore mutation characteristics and
      frequency with treatment response. III. Evaluate if companion diagnostics can be optimized by
      combining loss of heterozygosity (LOH) score and level of folate receptor a (FR-alpha)
      expression, and possible additional predictors of response.

      IV. Explore mechanisms of secondary resistance to treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.

      Participants receive mirvetuximab soravtansine intravenously (IV) on day 1 and rucaparib
      orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1 through 21. Courses repeat every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 30 days and then every 3
      months for up to a year.
