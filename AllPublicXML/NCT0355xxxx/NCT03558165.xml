  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, publicly funded standard of care testing in Ontario for stage IV lung cancer
      patients uses individual gene tests to look for mutations in the EGFR and ALK genes. This
      testing broadens treatment options for patients, however there are other gene mutations with
      corresponding targeted treatments that are not routinely tested for. This study will evaluate
      the utility and added value of using a next generation sequencing (NGS) panel, the Oncomine
      Comprehensive Assay v3, to profile stage IV lung cancer patients.
