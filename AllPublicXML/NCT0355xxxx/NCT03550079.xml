  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The femoral neck fracture is the most prevalent injuries which commonly encountered among
      older people with high mortality, morbidity and young fit healthy ones who subjected to
      high-energy trauma . Non-union or avascular necrosis of femoral neck fracture which lead to
      loss of labor capacity and death, is the most commonly occurred complication and results in
      considerable burden for family. The treatment is difficult and challenging, and to minimize
      the negative results such as limited mobilization or other complications, it is essential to
      take active prevention and appropriate treatment depending on fracture pattern and patients'
      characteristics as early as possible. However, current implant selections for femoral neck
      fractures remain a topic of greater interest and controversy, and vary substantially from
      each other .

      The incidence of femoral neck fracture accounts for 3.6% of all fractures, is the most
      prevalent injuries which commonly encountered among older people with high mortality,
      morbidity and young fit healthy ones who subjected to high-energy trauma . Non-union or
      avascular necrosis of femoral neck fracture which lead to loss of labor capacity and death,
      is the most commonly occurred complication and results in considerable burden for family. The
      treatment is difficult and challenging, and to minimize the negative results such as limited
      mobilization or other complications, it is essential to take active prevention and
      appropriate treatment depending on fracture pattern and patients' characteristics as early as
      possible. However, current implant selections for femoral neck fractures remain a topic of
      greater interest and controversy, and vary substantially from each other depending on the
      extent of displacement, fracture configuration, physiological age of the patient, bone
      quality or other relative factors. Nonoperative management is considered only when patients
      are seriously ill or presented with excessive surgical risk.
