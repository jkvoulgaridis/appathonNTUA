      To evaluate the following items in patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma
      receiving GSL treatment, Primary objective: Overall tumor response rate (by RECIST criteria)

      Secondary objectives:

      Disease control rate (Objective response rate + stable disease â‰§ 16 weeks) Time to tumor
      progression Progression-free survival Overall survival Clinical benefit response Quality of
      life Safety profile Biomarker of pancreatic cancer

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must have cyto-/histologically confirmed, recurrent or metastatic
             adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.
