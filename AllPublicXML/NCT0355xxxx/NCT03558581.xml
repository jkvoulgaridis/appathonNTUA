      Introduction: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a very frequent pathology, which can lead to renal
      failure and the need for renal replacement therapy. In people with chronic kidney disease
      (CKD) and diabetes mellitus (DM), glycemic control is very important for the prevention of
      microvascular injury. In this context, the Nursing Process (NP) is the instrument to guide
      care, contributing to the attention of individuals' needs. Objective: To evaluate the results
      of Nursing Outcomes Classification (NOC), obtained through interventions of the Nursing
      Interventions Classification (NIC) for the glycemic control, in patients with diabetes in
      renal replacement therapy, with a diagnosis of Unstable Glycemia, of the North American
      Nursing Diagnosis - International (NANDA-I). Method: Randomized clinical trial in three
      dialysis services in southern Brazil. Population: Type I and II diabetes patients on
      hemodialysis. Sample: Over 18 years old, literate, who accept to participate in the study by
      signing a Term of Consent Free and Clarified. Exclusion criteria: severe uncorrected
      deficiency in hearing, speech, total amaurosis, degenerative neurological diseases, or score
      less than 20 in the Mini Mental State Examination. Randomization occurred by clusters,
      considering dialysis shifts. The CG followed routine treatment and guidelines, while the IG
      received nursing interventions on a monthly basis for 6 months. Variables related to NOC
      scores and the knowledge, attitude and self-care tests for DM were applied before and after
      the intervention period. After the intervention period, a washout period of 06 months will
      occur, after which the variables will be collected.

      After randomization, the intervention group was assesses by a nurse determining the nursing
      outcomes (NOC)for the specific nursing diagnosis Unstable glycemia. One educational
      intervention per month was done:

        1. Teaching: individual and Teaching: disease process.

        2. Control of hyperglycemia and Control of hypoglycemia.

        3. Teaching: prescription drugs (prescription drugs, was carried out focusing on oral
           hypoglycemic agents and insulin)

        4. Teaching: psychomotor skills ( was performed with a view to the management and
           application of insulin). In case of use oral antiglycemic agent the Teaching:
           prescription drugs and control of hyperglycaemia and hypoglycemia was repeated

        5. Teaching: Foot care.

        6. Teaching: activity / prescribed exercises. After the completion of the six intervention
           patients were assessed for outcome classification the study will contemplate a 6 months
           washout between the NOC assessment ( end of interventions and final assessment)

    <description>DKNA has 15 multiple choice response items and covers aspects related to the general knowledge of diabetes mellitus. The questions are about basic physiology, food groups and substitutions, DM management in case of complications, and general principles of disease care).
The measurement scale used is from 0 to 15. A score (1) is assigned for correct answer and zero (0) for incorrect. Score greater than eight indicates knowledge about diabetes mellitus</description>

    <description>ATT - 19, it is an instrument that seeks the psychological adjustment measure for diabetes mellitus, developed as a response to the needs of evaluation of psychological and emotional aspects of the disease. It contains nineteen items that include six factors: a) stress associated with DM, b) receptivity to treatment, c) trust in treatment, d) personal efficacy, e) health perception, f) social acceptance, whose responses are measured through five-point Likert scale (I totally disagree - score 1, until I fully agree - score 5). The total value of the score varies from from 19 to 95 points. A score greater than 70 points indicates a positive attitude about the disease</description>
