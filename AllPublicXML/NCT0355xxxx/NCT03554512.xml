  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Telehealth is a means of providing care from a distance, at the convenience of the patient.
      This study will be testing the addition of Telehealth visits (TH) to the standard of care
      (SOC) following discharge from the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). This study will be
      used to determine whether Telehealth appointments post-NICU discharge can improve the
      experiences of parents in caring for their infant and reduce the number of health care visits
      they have with their infant within three months post-NICU discharge.

      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to two groups. One group will receive
      the standard of care, which means they will have an appointment in place with a primary care
      provider, pediatrician or return visit to the NICU post discharge. The second group will have
      the standard of care described above and two Telehealth visits within the first week at home
      with their infant.

      The study will explore the experiences of parents of NICU infants following their discharge
      from NICU, both those receiving standard of care (SOC) and the Telehealth monitoring
      intervention. Participants will be required to complete surveys online at 5 time periods:
      when parents decide to be part of the study, prior to discharge from NICU, 1 day after
      discharge, 2 days following the primary care provider visit and at 3 months following
      discharge from NICU. The questionnaires used will measure parental anxiety levels and
      parental confidence. The number of infant visits to the primary care provider, pediatrician,
      emergency department and NICU will also be collected at three months post-NICU discharge.

      A subset of participants (from both SOC and TH groups) will further participate in
      semi-structured interviews about their experiences in the NICU and caring for their children
      after discharge. NICU clinicians who consent will participate in semi-structured interviews
      about their experiences with the Telehealth intervention.

      The cost-effectiveness of the Telehealth intervention will be analysed in comparison to SOC.
