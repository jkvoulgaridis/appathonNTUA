    <textblock>
      This study evaluates three hemostatic methods for prevention of radial artery occlusion. One
      third of patients will receive patent hemostasis, another third will receive patent
      hemostasis plus ulnar compression and the last third will receive the StatSeal hemostatic
      disc.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main complication of the transradial access is the occlusion of the radial artery, which
      although clinically silent in most cases, has been associated with critical hand ischemia,
      more importantly it limits the radial approach for future coronary interventions, and limits
      the use of this conduit for coronary revascularization surgery and arteriovenous fistulas.

      Factors that prevent occlusion of the radial artery have been identified, including the use
      of several hemostatic techniques at the conclusion of cardiac catheterization.

      The patent hemostasis defined as a technique that allows permeability of the radial artery
      and at the same time ensures the absence of bleeding was the first hemostatic method that
      showed a decrease in the incidence of radial artery occlusion, it is currently the quality
      standard for hemostasis in transradial access worldwide. Recently, the patent hemostasis plus
      ulnar compression was described, which proved in a randomized clinical trial to be superior
      to conventional patent haemostasis, decreasing the incidence of radial artery occlusion to
      0.8% at 30 days. These hemostatic methods are a subject of current research worldwide. And
      more clinical trials are expected to confirm the superiority of patent hemostasis plus ulnar
      compression.

      The hemostatic discs used at the beginning as an attempt to reduce the times for the
      hemostasis of the radial access and therefore the recovery times in units of high volume have
      attracted attention for their effectiveness and their low incidence of radial artery
      occlusion, there are few reports who place it as a potential strategy to reduce the incidence
      of radial artery occlusion. Its effectiveness should be validated in dedicated trials with an
      adequate sample size.

    <description>The TR Band (Terumo medical) will be placed on the sheath entry site, the air bladder of the TR Band will be filled with 18 mL of air to achieve initial hemostasis. The sheath will be removed, air will be withdrawn slowly until a pulsatile bleeding is observed through the sheath's orifice, once this phenomenon occurs, 2 ml of air will be added to the air bladder and the absence of bleeding will be corroborated, immediately afterwards a pulse oximeter will be placed on the index finger of the patient and transient manual compression of the ipsilateral ulnar artery will be performed, patency of the radial artery will be corroborated by means of oxygen saturation and adequate pulse curve (Barbeau reverse test), if it is not possible to achieve patent hemostasis, it will be retried deflating 1-2 ml of the TR Band every 15 minutes until a positive reverse Barbeau test with absence of bleeding is achieved. TR Band removal will be attempted 2 hours after the procedure.</description>

    <description>The TR Band will be placed at the sheath entry site, the ipsilateral ulnar artery will be compressed at the Guyon's canal by placing a cylindrical composite made by wrapping 4 inch x 4 inch gauze around a 1-inch plastic needle cap, and compressing it using a circumferentially applied Hemoband. After occlusive compression of ulnar artery is confirmed by means of plethysmography, patent hemostasis protocol will be used for radial artery hemostasis as described at the patent hemostasis arm. The needle cap and hemoband that compresses the ulnar artery will be removed 1 hour after the procedure. TR Band removal will be attempted 2 hours after the procedure.</description>
