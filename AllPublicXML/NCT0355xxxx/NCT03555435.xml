  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many Veterans with mental health care needs go without care due to stigma, practical problems
      with getting services, and a high value on self-sufficiency. VHA has developed online
      programs aimed at fostering MH that are easy to access and may be more acceptable than
      psychotherapy. The purpose of this study is to learn whether peer-supported use of an online
      problem-solving course is acceptable and helpful and whether the study data can be collected
      online. Results of this pilot study would inform a larger study of the impact on
      problem-solving and mental health of a non-stigmatizing, online program - with and without
      peer support. If effective, peer supported online programs would improve the quality of care
      to Veterans with unmet mental health needs.

      Approval will be obtained from VA primary care staff leaders at Palo Alto Division and VA
      Palo Alto Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs) to mail notes and a study information
      card to patients who do not have stop codes for mental health or integrated care in their EMR
      records for the past six months. The study information cards will describe the study, how to
      enroll, and will direct the Veteran to REDCap eligibility screening questions. When
      eligibility is confirmed, REDCap will automatically alert research assistant to enroll
      participant and randomize.

      Primary Care Mental Health Integration staff at each clinic may also refer patients to the
      study by entering referral information directly into secure, encrypted REDCap files or by
      handing the patient a study information card.

      Community veterans will be invited via social media marketing. Ads will link to a study web
      site. Study web site will link potential participants to REDCap eligibility screening
      questions. When eligibility is confirmed, REDCap will automatically alert research assistant
      to enroll participant and randomize.

      Veterans who decide to be in the study will be assigned by chance to one of three groups: An
      On Your Own group, a Peer Support group, or a Wait group. Veterans assigned to take the
      Moving Forward course with peer support or on their own will complete the course online and
      practice the problem-solving skills they learned for six weeks. Finishing the Moving Forward
      course takes a total of about four hours. Veterans in the peer support group will speak with
      a Veteran who is experienced with the course on the phone for 15 to 20 minutes once a week
      during the study about using the ideas and exercises in the course to solve problems.
      Veterans assigned to the wait group will answer questions online about problem-solving skills
      and their well-being at the start and after six weeks). They will be able to take the course
      if they would like to after the six weeks have passed. Veterans in the On Your Own and Peer
      Support groups will answer questions online at the beginning, middle, and end of the study
      about problem-solving skills, their opinions about the course and about peer support (if they
      got it), and their well-being. This will take 10 to 15 minutes each time.

    <time_frame>change from baseline to study end (6 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The Problem-Solving Skills, Knowledge, &amp; Abilities Test is a brief, multiple-choice test that measures mastery of the basic concepts and skills that are included in the Moving Forward program.</description>

    <time_frame>change from baseline to study end (6 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The GAD-7 assesses the severity of anxiety symptoms associated with generalized anxiety in terms of the proportion of days assessed in which the symptoms were present. Score range 0-21; higher value represents greater anxiety symptom severity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Screen for Posttraumatic Stress Symptoms Change</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline to study end (6 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Screen for Posttraumatic Stress Symptoms (SPTSS), which has strong internal validity ( =0.91) and concurrent validity when correlated with other measures of PTSD (58). In recent combat Veterans, the SPTSS had a sensitivity and specificity of 0.89 to predict PTSD diagnosis from the SCID PTSD module (59). Updated to reflect the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for PTSD, the SPTSS allows assessment of symptoms related to multiple traumatic stressors, has a reporting period of one week (which reduces error due to lack of recall), and clear response options that reflect frequency and are grounded in time (e.g., &quot;1 or 2 times per week&quot;) as recommended by PROMIS measure developers (60). SPTSS scores have been shown to be sensitive to change over periods as brief as one week (61). Because it assesses frequency of experiences rather than distress about symptoms, the SPTSS may be less subject to stigma.</description>

    <measure>WHO-5 Well-Being Index Change</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline to study end (6 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>This widely-used 5-item measure assesses subjective psychological well-being. Its design for use around the world and translation into 30 languages are indicative of its usefulness as a measure for a diverse population. Score range 0-25; higher scores indicate better well-being.</description>

    <description>The PHQ-9 assesses the severity of depression in terms of the proportion of days assessed in which the symptoms were present. Score range 0-27; higher scores indicate more severe symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Stigma measure (EZ-EASI)</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline to study end (6 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The Endorsed and Anticipated Stigma Inventory (EASI) is a tool for assessing different dimensions of stigma-related beliefs about mental health among military and veteran populations. Findings based on a national sample of U.S. veterans deployed in support of Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) in Afghanistan or Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) in Iraq suggest that the EASI is a psychometrically sound instrument. Specifically, results revealed evidence for the internal consistency reliability, content validity, convergent and discriminant validity, and discriminative validity of EASI scales.</description>
