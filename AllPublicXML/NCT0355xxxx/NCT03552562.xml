  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of diabetes and diabetes-associated complications is still increasing. Several
      major long-term complications of diabetes such as cardiovascular disease, chronic renal
      failure, diabetic retinopathy and others relate to the damage of blood vessels. Given that
      the eye provides the unique possibility in the human body to directly visualize blood
      vessels, much interest has been directed towards studying the ocular circulation and retinal
      oxygen metabolism.

      Although data of large epidemiological studies indicate that changes in retinal vessel
      caliber reflect other diabetes related factors, such as fasting glucose levels, there is
      still conflicting evidence on blood flow alterations in patients with diabetes. Strongly
      related to ocular blood flow, investigation of retinal oxygen metabolism has received a lot
      attention. In particular, hypoxia is assumed to be major trigger of neovascularisation in the
      retinal of diabetic patients The present study seeks to investigate both ocular blood flow
      and tissue oxygen extraction in patients with type II diabetes. For this purpose, total
      retinal blood flow will be assessed with bi-directional Fourier Domain Doppler Optical
      Coherence Tomography (FDOCT). Furthermore, retinal oxygen saturation will be measured
      non-invasively by a fundus camera based system. Based on data of retinal blood flow and
      retinal oxygen saturation, retinal oxygen. This will help to better understand ocular blood
      flow changes and oxygen metabolism in patients with type II diabetes.

    <measure>Total retinal blood flow (DVA and FDOCT)</measure>
    <time_frame>60 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>To determine the total blood flow in the eye, OCT measurements were performed with a rectangular scanning pattern around the optical nerve head.</description>

    <measure>Retinal vessel diameter (DVA)</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The DVA allows for the real time measurement of retinal vessel diameters in vivo.
The DVA is a commercially available system (IMEDOS, Jena, Germany) which comprises a fundus camera, a video camera, a real time monitor and a personal computer with an analyzing software for the accurate determination of retinal arterial and venous diameters. Every second a maximum of 25 readings of vessel diameter can be obtained. For this purpose the fundus is imaged onto the charge coupled device chip of the video camera. The consecutive fundus images are digitized using a frame grabber. In addition, the fundus image can be inspected on the real time monitor and, if necessary, stored on a video recorder. Evaluation of the retinal vessel diameters can either be done online or offline from the recorded video tapes</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Retinal oxygen saturation (DVA)</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>In particular, retinal oxygen saturation measurement is based on the image analysis by the DVA software of two monochromatic fundus images as recorded by a standard DVA. In an image, obtained by the camera and filter assembly, the operator has to mark the vessel of interest by a mouse click. The vessel is traced automatically applying the following procedure. The vessel walls are located as photometric edges in the vicinity of the mouse cursor in the green channel image. If edges are determined, the search is continued in their proximity.</description>

    <measure>Autonomic and sensomotoric neuropathy measurements</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Assesment of heart rate variability is a standardized, non invasive method for quantification of autonomic (sympathetic and parasympathetic) control and thus preferably used for evaluation of cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN) in diabetes. This measurement of CAN is based on analysis of heart rate variability either in time-domain (cardiovascular reflex tests to standardized stimuli including deep breathing, Valsalva maneuver and orthostatic load)or in frequency-domain, using a short-term modified orthostatic load. Short- term spectral analysis of HRV is obtained from recordings consisting of 256 seconds of artifact-free records each using a VariaCardio® system (Advanced Medical Diagnostics Group, UK).</description>

    <intervention_name>Fourier Domain Color Doppler Optical Coherence Tomography (FDOCT)</intervention_name>
    <description>Fourier domain OCT is based on a local phase analysis of the backscattered signal and allows for bidirectional Doppler flow imaging.(Leitgeb et al. 2003a; Leitgeb et al. 2003b) It does not need reference arm scanning and records one full depth and Doppler profile in parallel. The system operates with an equivalent A-scan rate of 25 kHz and allows real time imaging of the color encoded Doppler information together with the tissue morphology at a rate of 2-4 tomograms (40 x 512 pixel) per second. Despite the high detection speed we achieve a system sensitivity of 86dB using a beam power of 500μW at the cornea. The fundus camera allows simultaneous view for selection of the region of interest. We observe bi-directional blood flow and pulsatility of blood velocity in retinal vessels with a Doppler detection bandwidth of 12.5 kHz and a longitudinal velocity sensitivity in tissue of 200μm/s. Diffuse luminance flicker will be applied during the measurements for 60 seconds.</description>
