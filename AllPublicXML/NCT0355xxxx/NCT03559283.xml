  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates cognitive-motor interference in stroke patients who is responsible an
      alteration of spatio-temporal gait parameters. It's proved in the literature but the
      underlying pathophysiological mechanisms remain poorly understood. fNIRS is a functional
      imaging technique that evaluates this interference under optimal conditions. The purpose of
      this study is to evaluate the hemodynamic activity of the CPF in walking post-stroke patients
      under different DT conditions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Walking is a motor task that involves cognitive functions. The parameters of walking and
      brain activity are modified in situations requiring significant attentional and cognitive
      demand. fNIRS is an interesting functional neuroimaging technique for studying cortical
      activity when performing a Dual Task (DT). To our knowledge, no studies have examined
      cerebral oxygenation levels in post-stroke patients based on different cognitive loads during
      walking. Understanding cognitive contributions in a dual-task walking situation is necessary
      to providing targeted interventions and preventing falls.

      Patients included in the study will be evaluated in single cognitive task, with two levels of
      difficulty, single walking motor task, and dual task with two levels of cognitive difficulty.
      The fNIRS will record the hemodynamic activity of the prefrontal cortex for the cognitive
      slope and the GAITRite will record the walking parameters.

    <description>A sensor placement will be performed on the patient's forehead to record brain activity when walking, when performing a mental task, and when performing both tasks at the same time.

    <intervention_name>Walking and Record Cortical Activity</intervention_name>
    <description>The cortical activity of each patient is recorded by NIRS under the following conditions:
Simple task : The patient walks on an electronic walking track (GAITRite system) over 10 meters. The data collected are the spatio-temporal parameters of walking.
Cognitive task alone : two conditions of the n-back test (1-back and 2-back) to study neural activities related to working memory. The duration of realization will be 30 seconds by condition and we retain the number of errors realized.
Double Task : Achievement of the motor task (10-meter walk) is performed at the same time as a &quot;weak&quot; cognitive task (1-back) and a &quot;high&quot; cognitive task (2-back). The spatio-temporal parameters and the number of errors are collected by the observer.</description>
