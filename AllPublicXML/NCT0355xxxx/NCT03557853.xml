  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale. Coxitis in AS is inflammation of hip(s) affecting significant number of patients.
      It is associated with worse function and more expressed axial disease requiring hip
      replacement at end-stage. Number of studies dedicated to coxitis treated with TNF alpha
      inhibitors is very limited.

      Primary objective. To evaluate change of functional impairment in AS patients with coxitis
      from baseline to 12 months of therapy with golimumab by BASFI in daily clinical practice

      Study design. This study is a non-interventional prospective observational cohort study
      conducted in multiple centers across Russia.

      Study population. Patients with ankylosing spondylitis (according to the modified New York
      criteria) with coxitis newly prescribed golimumab during the course of usual clinical care
      will be enrolled and followed prospectively for 24 months with data collection at the
      approximate time points: baseline (pre-treatment) and consequent every 6 months. Patients
      will receive golimumab as prescribed in regular clinical practice.

      Statistical Methods. Quantitative variables will be tested for normal distribution using the
      Shapiro-Wilk test. The hypothesis of equality of variances will be tested using Levene's
      test. Quantitative variables matching a normal distribution will be described in terms of the
      mean ± standard deviation, and values outside of the normal distribution as medians, 25% and
      75% quartiles. Qualitative variables will be presented in the form of percentages of the
      absolute value N.

      Sample Size and Power Calculations. Sample size calculation is based on data from GO-RAISE
      registration study in which golimumab was evaluated in patients with AS. The baseline BASFI
      was 5.0 which changed by mean (± SD, standard deviation) −2.5 (± 2.12) at week 52
      (approximately 12 months). The analysis of the data shows that the minimum necessary sample
      size should be 18 patients to show a statistically significant change of BASFI from baseline
      to 12 months. On this basis and considering that the dropout rate over the two years is
      expected to be 30%, we decided that the necessary number of patients to be included into
      protocol should be 39 individuals. It is expected that around 27 patients will be included in
      the patient set completing the study. Power of the study is 90% with formula evaluation P =
      1-β where P is power and β is type 2 error = 10%.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of BASFI (Bath Ankylosing Spodylitis Functionality Index)</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The BASFI is a self-assessment instrument for defining and monitoring functional ability (physical functioning) in patients with AS. Contains 10 items: 8 items concerning activities referring to the functional anatomy of the patients (bending, reaching, changing position, standing, turning, and climbing steps) and 2 items assessing the patients' ability to cope with everyday life.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of BASMI (Bath Ankylosing Spodylitis Mobility Index)</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 12 and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The BASMI is an instrument that is typically used to assess mobility of spine and hip joints. The BASMI consists of 5 items which are clinical measures of cervical rotation, tragus to wall distance, lumbar flexion, lumbar side flexion, and intermalleolar distance. Each item is scored from 0 to 10 based on individually defined cut points.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of ASDAS-CRP (Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score)</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 12 and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>ASDAS is an instrument to measure disease activity in AS based on a composite score. The score includes patient-reported assessments of back pain, duration of morning stiffness, peripheral joint pain and/or swelling, general well-being, and a serologic marker of inflammation (erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR] or C-reactive protein [CRP]).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>BASRI-hip (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Radiology Index)</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 12 and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>In BASRI-hip hips radiographs are graded on a scale of 0-4 (0 - no change; 1 - suspicious: focal joint space narrowing; 2 - mild: circumferential joint space narrowing &gt;2mm; 3 - moderate: circumferential joint space narrowing ≤ 2mm or bone-on-bone apposition of &lt;2 cm; and 4 - severe: bone deformity or bone-on-bone apposition of ≥2 cm)</description>
