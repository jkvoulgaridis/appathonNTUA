      The objective of this program is to allow treating physicians to supply/continue to supply
      Certolizumab Pegol (CIMZIAÂ®, CZP) to adults suffering from Crohn's Disease (CD), and who are
      considered not suitable for treatment, intolerant, have medical contraindications or had
      insufficient response with an authorized conventional therapy, including other authorized
      biologics.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        - Patient comes from ending open label studies such as WELCOME -C87046, COSPAR - C87065,
        MUSIC - C87043, PRECISE 3 - C87033, PRECISE 4 - C87034 and C87088

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has been treated with any experimental biological or non biological therapy
             other than Certolizumab Pegol (CZP) within 5 plasma half-lifes*

          -  Has been treated with an approved biological, namely infliximab within the last 8
             weeks, and adalimumab within the last 2 weeks*

          -  Known hypersensitivity to CZP or any of its excipients

          -  Current or recent history of severe, progressive, uncontrolled renal, hepatic,
             haematological, gastrointestinal (other than Crohn's disease), endocrine, pulmonary,
             cardiac, neurological, or cerebral disease

          -  Serious or life threatening infection within the last 6 months, any signs of current
             or recent infection

          -  Active or latent tuberculosis (TB): if one or more of the 3 criteria is positive for
             evidence of TB infection*:

               1. A medical history of or a recent (&lt; 6 months) active tuberculosis (TB)

               2. A recent (&lt;6 months) chest X-ray with signs consistent with TB infection

               3. A recent (&lt;6 months) positive purified protein derivative (PPD) skin test
                  (defined as induration or 5mm or more) and/or an indeterminate or positive
                  QuantiFERON-TB Gold or Elispot test.

        It is recommended that patients are monitored at least annually for active and latent TB by
        both 1) a chest X-ray read by a pulmonologist or radiologist and 2) a PPD skin test and/or
        Elispot/ QuantiFERON TB Gold test

          -  Patient received live vaccinations including, but not limited to, oral polio, herpes
             zoster, measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) or nasal influenza within the last 8 weeks or has
             planned live immunizations during the planned period of administration of CZP

          -  Known prior or concurrent viral hepatitis B and C

          -  Known Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection

          -  Concurrent malignancy or a history of malignant disease

          -  History of a lymphoproliferative disorder or any signs or symptoms suggestive of this
             disease

          -  History of or concurrent New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III/IV heart failure

          -  As the safety and efficacy of CZP has not been established in patients younger than 18
             years of age, drug is not recommended for use in these patients until further data are
             available

          -  As no data are available in pregnant women, drug should not be administered to female
             patients of childbearing potential - unless an adequate method of contraception is
             used - or to pregnant/lactating female patients.*

        '*' Not applicable (NA) for patients on treatment with CZP from trials such as WELCOME
        -C87046, COSPAR -C87065, MUSIC - C87043, PRECISE 3 - C87033, PRECISE 4 - C87034 and C87088.
