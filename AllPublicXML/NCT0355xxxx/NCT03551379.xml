      The purpose of this observational study is to record performance of a double balloon
      endolumenal interventional platform during complex colon polypectomy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic removal of Complex colon polyps (benign polyps &gt;=2cm) is a technically challenging
      procedure. Complex benign polyps have a greater chance of becoming cancerous if not removed.

      The DiLumen™ Endolumenal Interventional Platform is a non-sterile, single-use, close-fitting
      sleeve that fits securely over a standard endoscope to stabilize it in the large intestine,
      and facilitates use of the endoscope for optical visualization, diagnosis, and treatment. The
      device is indicated to ensure complete positioning of an endoscope in the large intestine and
      assist with optical visualization, diagnosis, and endoscopic treatment.

      The device received 510k clearance on Dec 6, 2016. The study will evaluate performance of the
      device during routine, scheduled, endoscopic polyp removal for these large polyps.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects &gt; 18 years of age

          -  Subjects scheduled for endoscopic removal of suspected complex adenomatous polyps in
             the large intestine which are sessile or polypoid lesions ≥ 2cm, near the ileocecal
             valve, dentate line, over a fold, or at a flexure; and or lesions tethered to the
             colon wall due to previous incomplete resection

          -  Subjects willing and able to give informed consent

          -  Subjects who in the opinion of the Principal Investigator have no medical
             contraindication to endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) or endoscopic submucosal
             dissection (ESD)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with a contraindication to colonoscopy, including but not limited to active
             colitis, perforation, or stricture.

          -  Subjects with a history of open or laparoscopic colorectal surgery

          -  Subjects with a history of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)

          -  Subjects with a suspected malignancy on polyp assessment
