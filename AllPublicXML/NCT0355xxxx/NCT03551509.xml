      This trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of the ArthroFLEX® ECM scaffold graph as an
      augment in rotator cuff repair surgery to reduce the failure rate of rotator cuff repairs for
      large and massive rotator cuff tears.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, multi-center clinical trial to evaluate the
      effectiveness of an ECM scaffold graft to augment repair of a large/massive rotator cuff
      tear. The study will involve 70 patients. 35 patients will be randomly assigned to each arm
      of the study.

      Despite advances in surgical technology, repairs of large (3-5 cm) and massive (&gt;5 cm)
      rotator cuff tears (RCT) fail between 20%-90% of the time [1]. Due to their size and
      increased structural involvement, large or massive RCT present a substantial challenge to
      orthopaedic surgeons. [16] The repairs tend to fail at the suture-tendon junction, which is
      due to several factors, including tension at the repair and quality of the tendon [1-2,5].
      Full thickness tears are uncommon in younger patients, especially those less than forty years
      old and are usually traumatic in etiology. Younger patients also typically fair better
      following arthroscopic rotator cuff repair with fewer failures and more successful return to
      pre-injury level of function [16]. One strategy to augment repair of large to massive rotator
      cuff tears has been the development of biological scaffold materials, which are composed of
      extracellular matrix (ECM). The ECM composing the scaffolds are made from a number of
      tissues, including, but not limited to, small intestinal submucosa (SIS), dermis, and
      pericardium [3]. Studies to date include both prospective and retrospective in animal and
      human models, and include Restore, a porcine-derived SIS by DePuy Orthopaedics, GraftJacket,
      a human-derived, non-cross-linked dermis graft by Wright Medical Technology, and Zimmer
      Collagen Repair, a cross-linked porcine derived dermal graft made by Zimmer. Restore studies
      have shown no benefit and some even an increase in repair failure with recommendations not to
      use to augment repair. GraftJacket studies have shown a reduction in graft failure; however,
      several of the Restore and GraftJacket studies are limited by a lack of a control cohort. The
      Zimmer graft studies have conflicting results with both an improvement and no improvement in
      failure rates of repair. The prior studies listed are all in vivo; however, the majority are
      not randomized trials and thus do not have a control with which to compare data. In addition,
      some trials include open repairs. A lack of prospective, randomized, controlled, in vivo
      trials exist that evaluate the ability of the ECM scaffold graft augmentation in large to
      massive arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs to decrease the failure rate.

    <measure>Patient Outcomes: The American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeon Shoulder Score (ASES)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion (1 year after surgery). Specifically this assessment will be administered one time before surgery (during the preoperative examination) and then at every follow-up visit thereafter (6 wks, 3 mos, 6 mos, and 1 year after surgery).</time_frame>
    <description>The ASES is standardized form for assessment of the shoulder. There are patient-self-evaluation and physician assessment sections. The patient self-evaluation section form contains visual analog scales for pain and instability and an activities of daily living questionnaire. The activities of daily living questionnaire is marked on a four-point ordinal scale that can be converted to a cumulative activities of daily living index. The physician assessment section assesses range of motion, specific physical signs, strength, and stability. A shoulder score can be derived from the visual analogue scale score for pain (50%) and the cumulative activities of daily living score (50%).</description>

    <description>A disease-specific quality of life measurement tool for patients with rotator cuff disease. Patients will respond to by marking a scale with ranges between none and extreme. Information collected includes physical symptoms, such as pain and weakness levels in the shoulder, the impact of the patient's shoulder injury on their sports/recreational activities, work (inside or outside of the home), lifestyle/activities of daily living (ADL), and its emotional impact, such as frustration level, depression, and any worry/concern a patient might be about how their injury might affect their occupation.</description>

    <description>This activity scale was developed using established principles: item generation, item reduction, pretesting, and reliability and validity testing. The activity rating is a numerical sum of scores for five activities rated on a five-point frequency scale from never performed (0 points) to daily (4 points). Patients were scored on the following criteria: carrying an object 8 lb or heavier by hand, handling objects overhead, weight training with arms, swinging motion (ie, hitting tennis or golf ball), and lifting objects 25 lb or heavier. Two additional multiple choice questions provide a score assessing participation in contact and overhead sports. It can be used in conjunction with patient-based measures of shoulder outcome to define patient populations for cohort studies, and to assess activity level as a prognostic factor in patients with shoulder disorders.

    <description>The SSV is defined as a patient's subjective shoulder assessment expressed as a percentage of an entirely normal shoulder, which would score 100%. (J Shoulder Elbow Surg. 2007 Nov-Dec;16(6):717-21.)</description>

    <description>C Constant and A Murley. This scoring system consists of four variables that are used to assess the function of the shoulder. The right and left shoulders are assessed separately. The subjective variables are pain and ADL (sleep, work, recreation / sport) which give a total of 35 points. The objective variables are range of motion and strength which give a total of 65 points. More information on the Constant Score can be found here: https://www.shoulderdoc.co.uk/article/9.</description>
