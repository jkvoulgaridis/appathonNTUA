  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      NK cells can persist and expand in vivo following adoptive transfer and may have a role in
      the treatment of late stage malignancies. NK also express an activating Fc receptor that
      mediates antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and production of immune modulatory
      cytokines in response to antibody-coated targets. Nimotuzumab, an monoclonal antibody against
      EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor), may enhance the ADCC effect of NK cell. This study
      will evaluate the safety of combination of nimotuzumab and NK Cell in treating advanced
      cancer patients. Blood samples will also be collected for research purposes.

      This is a phase I clinical study of expanded NK cells from autologous origin. The NK cell
      will be selected and expanded ex vivo and infused back into patients. Nimotuzumab will be
      used 24 hours before infusion. 21 advanced cancer patients are planned to receive two cycles
      of NK cells and Nimotuzumab treatment. Biomarkers and immunological markers are collected and
      analyzed as well.

    <description>Peripheral blood lymphocytes will be collected. The NK cell will be selected and expanded ex vivo, then adaptive transfer back into patients. A total of 5.0 x 10^8/L NK cells will be infused in one cycle.To avoid allergic reactions, 50 mg hydrocortisone was intramuscularly injected into patient 30 min before cells infusion every time. Best supportive care was also provided for patients. Nimotuzumab will be used 24 hours before infusion. Patients continued receiving treatment unless they had unacceptable adverse effects, or progressive disease confirmed by CT and PET-CT or they withdrew consent.</description>
