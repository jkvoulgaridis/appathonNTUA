  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot feasibility study to examine the impact of providing a non-therapeutic
      resilience-based coaching telehealth program to the Support Partners (SP) of persons with MS
      (PwMS).

      Cognitive difficulties are a prominent feature in PwMS and prove to be a challenge for PwMS
      and the close family members that care for them. This study is a pilot telehealth program
      that aims to address these needs and improve the overall well-being of adults with MS and
      their Support Partners.

      A manualized program was developed utilizing the previous research study conducted
      literature, and the expertise and experience of the research study team. Funding was sought
      and obtained for 30 pairs to participate in the pilot. The 6-session program will address
      needs identified by this population and improve knowledge of cognition in PwMS.

      Study Objectives:

      Primary Objective:

      To conduct an evaluation of the feasibility of the resilience program by examining:

        1. Recruitment (i.e. willingness to participate in program)

        2. Participation rates and attrition

        3. Participant satisfaction of the program.

      Secondary Objective (Support Partner):

      To assess the potential long-term benefits of the program to Support Partners of PwMS.
      Program benefits will be assessed using the following outcomes:

        1. Sense of Competencies

        2. Understanding of cognitive impairment in MS

        3. Caregiver burden

        4. Positive Emotions.

      Secondary Objective (PwMS):

      To assess the potential long-term benefits of the program to PwMS. Program benefits will be
      assessed using the following outcomes:

        1. Relationship Satisfaction

        2. Perceived Support.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Feasibility: Participation rates and attrition</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Participation rates will be measured in terms of individual sessions completed. Attrition rates will be measured. Attrition or drop-out will be addressed as follows: those who drop out prior to the fourth session will be asked to complete a satisfaction questionnaire while those who drop out after the fourth session will be asked to complete post-measures and a satisfaction questionnaire.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Feasibility: Participant satisfaction of the program.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The Intervention Evaluation Questionnaire was created by the research lead as a self-report measure of the participant's evaluation of the intervention and the individual sessions. Participants' evaluation data will be presented as totals from one five-point Likert scale, three yes/no questions and four open questions. The scale question measures satisfaction with the program on a range from 0 (not at all satisfied) to 4 (very satisfied). In addition to this evaluation of the intervention, four questions will be asked at the end of each session to the participants of that session. This includes two five-point Likert scale questions and two open ended questions. The first scale question measures satisfaction with the session on a range from 1 (not at all satisfied) to 5 (very satisfied). The second scale question measures the perceived helpfulness of the session on a range from 1 (not at all satisfied) to 5 (very satisfied).</description>

Each item is a statement which the support partner is asked to endorse using a 5-point scale. Response options range from 1 (Yes, completely agrees) to 5 (no, completely disagrees). The three subscales are: satisfaction with care recipient (7 items), satisfaction with one's performance as a support partner (12 items), and consequences of involvement in care for the personal life of the support partner (8 items).</description>
