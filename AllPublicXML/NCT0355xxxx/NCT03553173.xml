  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized open-label parallel-group trial. 240 subjects will be recruited during 8
      months and a 12 months follow-up will be carried out for each one of them. The sample will
      split in two groups: control group (n=120) who will receive usual psycho-pharmacological
      therapy and the intervention group (n=120) who will receive usual therapy plus So-Lo-Mo app.

      The main objective of this study is to analyze the efficacy and efficiency of the So-Lo-Mo
      intervention applied to the smoking cessation process compared to usual care.

      Secondary objectives are:

        1. To monitor usual psycho-pharmacological therapies (bupropion, varenicline and
           behavioural therapy).

        2. To monitor healthy lifestyle and physical exercise habits.

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Smoking abstinence rate at 1 year measured by means of exhaled Carbon Monoxide (CO) and urinary cotinine tests. Subjects with cotinine concentrations &gt;200 ng/ml or CO &gt;6 ppm will be considered as smokers.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Efficiency: Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Expressed in terms of Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER), calculated by dividing the difference in total costs between the intervention group and the control group by the difference in Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY) between both groups. Costs associated to control and intervention groups will include healthcare resources utilization measured in terms of specialist consultations related to the smoking cessation process. Costs of pharmacological treatment and time employed by healthcare professionals during the design phase will also be taken into account. Benefit for patients will be expressed in terms of QALY. EuroQol-5D-5L questionnaire will be used to estimate QALY.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of Treatment-Related Adverse Events [Safety]</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>To monitor usual pharmacological therapies (bupropion and varenicline) in order to gather the incidence of related adverse events reported. Safety will be measured as the number of adverse events related to pharmacological therapies. The following adverse events have been identified related to each pharmacological therapy:
Varenicline: Nausea, vomit, headache, insomnia, abnormal dreams, constipation and flatulence.
Bupropion: insomnia, headache, dryness in the mouth, alteration of taste, skin reactions, convulsions, cardiovascular side effects and severe skin reactions.</description>

    <measure>International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ27) score [Physical activity]</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline (first evaluation in the study) to 1 year after</time_frame>
    <description>Physical activity will be measured in terms of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ27) score calculation at baseline (first evaluation in the study) and at the end of the intervention (after 1 year of follow-up). The result is expressed as metabolic equivalent (MET)-minutes per week. Interpretation:
Low: Individuals who not meet criteria for categories 2 or 3 are considered 'low'
Moderate: 3 or more days of vigorous-intensity activity of at least 20 minutes per day OR 5 or more days of moderate-intensity activity and/or walking of at least 30 minutes per day OR 5 or more days of any combination of walking, moderate-intensity or vigorous intensity activities achieving a minimum Total physical activity of at least 600 MET-minutes/week
High: vigorous-intensity activity on at least 3 days achieving a minimum Total physical activity of at least 1500 MET-minutes/week</description>

    <description>Healthy lifestyle will be measured in terms of the subject's BMI (weight in kg / height in m^2) at baseline (first evaluation in the study) and at the end of the intervention (after 1 year of follow-up).</description>

    <description>So-Lo-Mo is an innovative intervention based on mobile technologies and its capacity to trigger behavioral changes. In this sense, the App is a complement to pharmacological therapies to quit smoking providing personalised motivational messages, physical activity monitoring, lifestyle advices and distractions (mini-games) to help pass the cravings. The main objective of this App is to improve patient's adherence to the smoking cessation process making use of behavioral techniques in the form of motivational messages and/or Short Message Service (SMS).</description>
