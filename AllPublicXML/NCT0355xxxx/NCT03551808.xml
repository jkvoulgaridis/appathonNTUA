    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is determining the prophylactic effect of ketorolac tromethamine drop
      0.5% eye drop on the functional and anatomical ocular characteristics of the diabetic
      patients after the phacoemulsification surgery. Cystoid macular edema (CME) is a ocular
      disease which the retinal thickness is increased by 30 % incidence at least or the visual
      acuity is decreased to 20/40 according to clinical definition. Ketorolac tromethamine is an
      non steroidal anti inflammatory medication which is used for treatment and Prophylactic for
      CME. Teh aim of this study is prophylactic effect of ketorolac tromethamine on choroidal and
      retinal thickness after Phacoemulsification in Diabetic Patients. In this randomized clinical
      trial, 102 eyes of 102 diabetic patients were included. All patients were undergone
      phacoemulsification surgery at Torfeh Eye Hospital between September 2015 and January 2017.
      To evaluate the prophylactic effect of ketorolac tromethamine topical eye drop, all cases
      were asked to apply it one day before the s:surgery in each 8 hours and continue it for 4
      weeks after the surgery. Controls were not received placebo. All study population were
      examined using Snellen visual acuity chart, enhanced depth imaging optical coherence
      tomography (EDI-OCT). All patients were followed at 6, 12 and 24 weeks after the cataract
      surgery.
