  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a non-interventional observational study designed to assess the impact of
      passive exposure to IQOS environmental tobacco aerosol in Non-Smokers in a real-life
      restaurant setting.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to show that Non-Smokers, exposed to environmental tobacco
      aerosol from IQOS in a restaurant setting, do not have higher urinary levels of Biomarkers of
      Exposure (BoExp) to selected Harmful and Potentially Harmful Constituents (HPHCs),
      representative of Environmental Tobacco Smoke (ETS), compared to the urinary levels of BoExp
      measured in Non-Smokers before IQOS environmental tobacco aerosol exposure.

      Furthermore, the impact of passive exposure to IQOS environmental tobacco aerosol on IQOS
      Users and Cigarette Smokers, not using any tobacco or nicotine-containing products, will be
      investigated. This will enable the assessment of individuals with varying levels of exposure
      to HPHCs and determine whether there is any measurable additional exposure related to the
      environmental tobacco aerosol from IQOS.

      The study will also evaluate Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) through the assessment of
      concentrations of nicotine and selected HPHCs representative of tobacco-specific and IAQ
      markers in the air during exposure and non-exposure periods in a real-life restaurant
      setting.

Used at least 100 HeatSticks
Uses IQOS daily &gt; 1/day
Smokes a cigarette less than daily
Smokes less than 30 cigarettes/month
IQOS is &gt; 95% of tobacco/nicotine product (all product use) – excluding other products (e-cig/Ploom/etc.)
Non-Exposure Event: Non-Exposure event of 4h duration for the individual participants, where no use of any tobacco or nicotine-containing product is allowed, designed to establish background measurements in the absence of exposure to IQOS.
Exposure Event: Exposure Event to measure urinary BoExp to selected HPHCs representative of ETS in all participant groups, with up to 5h of exposure for non-smokers, cigarette smokers (not using any tobacco or nicotine-containing product, including cigarettes), and IQOS passive users (not using IQOS). Additionally, this event includes up to 8h of exposure for IQOS active users (using IQOS).</description>

    <reported_events>
      <time_frame>Adverse events were collected from the signature of the ICF by each subject until the end of the study, for a duration of up to 6 weeks for each subject.</time_frame>
      <desc>As this study was observational by design and was conducted in a post-market setting, adverse event (AE) reporting followed the Sponsor’s already established post-market Safety Surveillance Procedures for spontaneously-reported events. In case of a medical event, the study staff were advised to call the local emergency number to ensure appropriate medical treatment. Any related cost for treatment and transportation was to be borne by the Sponsor.</desc>
