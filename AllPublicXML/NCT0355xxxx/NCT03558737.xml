  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Very low birth weight infants are at increased risk of requiring prolonged duration of
      mechanical ventilation and multiple intubations, both of which are risk factors for
      ventilator-induced lung injury and BPD. Thus, it is important to investigate respiratory
      support methods that are able to effectively oxygenate and ventilate these high risk preterm
      infants while reducing their risk of lung injury. Nasal high-frequency ventilation is one
      potential intervention that may decrease the risk of respiratory failure in very low birth
      weight infants. Small studies have shown effective respiratory support over short time
      periods in infants, however these studies use nasal high-frequency oscillatory ventilation.
      To the investigators' knowledge there is no published studies looking at the use of nasal
      high-frequency jet ventilation in this high risk population.

      Use of non-invasive high frequency ventilation (HFV) has been described as a rescue method
      following failure of other non-invasive ventilator modes or as a means to increase the
      success post-extubation. When used as invasive high frequency ventilation, high frequency
      oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) or high frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) utilize
      supraphysiologic respiratory rates and small tidal volumes which has been shown to inflict
      less lung injury than conventional modes of ventilation.

      Using a mechanical newborn lung model, nasal HFV has improved CO2 removal when compared to
      conventional NIPPV. Animal studies in the lab of Kurt Albertine have shown improved
      ventilation and oxygenation in the high frequency nasal ventilation group versus the
      mechanical ventilation group in a preterm lamb model leading towards better alveolar
      formation noted histologically.

      The investigators hypothesize that extubation of very preterm infants to nHFJV will
      significantly decrease the rates of reintubation compared to those infants extubated to
      NIPPV.
