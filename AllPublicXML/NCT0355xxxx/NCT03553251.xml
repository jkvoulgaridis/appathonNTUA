  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish the rationale for the practice of performing an
      oral reintroduction test without previous skin tests in children at low risk of IgE-mediated
      reaction or drug-induced toxidermia, and to confirm the criteria for a drug reintroduction
      test could be performed without previous skin tests, without subsequent risk of reaction for
      the child. The primary endpoint will be the risk of a severe IgE-mediated or delayed
      hypersensitivity reaction in children who received beta-lactam drug reintroduction protocol
      prior to skin testing.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Children under 16 years of age coming for a consultation for a beta-lactam oral
             reintroduction test.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Refusal of the legal representatives of the subject for their child to participate in
             the study,

          -  If his age permits, refusal of the subject to participate in the study,

          -  Subject aged over 16,

          -  Pregnancy,

          -  Absence of affiliation of the subject to a social security scheme,

          -  Skin tests with incriminated beta-lactam already made before the consultation,

          -  Existence of contraindications to the realization of oral reintroduction drug test
             with the suspected antibiotic,

          -  Existence of criteria in the initial reaction suggestive of a non-low risk of
             IgE-mediated or delayed hypersensitivity to the incriminated beta-lactam, Taking
             antihistamine, corticosteroids or beta-blockers within 5 days prior to the oral
             reintroduction drug test,

          -  Travel abroad of the child scheduled within 7 days of the oral reintroduction drug
             test.
