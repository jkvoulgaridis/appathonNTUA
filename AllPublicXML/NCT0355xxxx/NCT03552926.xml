      This bi-centric cohort study aims at determining in patients with recent lacunar strokes (&lt;15
      days), the main clinical, radiological, or genetic predictive markers of recurrent stroke,
      cognitive impairment, dementia, depression gait disturbances and disability.

In each case, larger values are considered to represent worse outcomes. Scores larger or equal to 11 correspond to thresholds to define anxiety and depression &quot;</description>
