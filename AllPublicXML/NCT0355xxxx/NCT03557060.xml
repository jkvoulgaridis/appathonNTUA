      This study is a drug use investigation program of NUCALA. The objective of this study is to
      collect and assess information on the safety and effectiveness of the long-term use of NUCALA
      SC injection in daily clinical practice in subjects with Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with
      Polyangiitis (EGPA). All subjects who administered NUCALA for the treatment of EGPA after its
      approval of indication will be included in the study. In addition, after the approval,
      subjects who had already received NUCALA for EGPA prior to the conclusion of the contract
      will also be included. Approximately 300 subjects will be included in the study. The
      observation period per subject is up to 96 weeks (2 years) from the start of NUCALA
      administration for EGPA at a maximum. If a subject has withdrawn from/terminated
      administration of NUCALA, it will be until the withdrawal/termination. Additionally, to
      consider the safety and effectiveness of NUCALA administration in subjects who had withdrawn
      from/terminated due to symptom improvement, 48 weeks (1 year) follow-up investigation should
      be conducted as much as possible. The total study duration will be approximately 3 years (2
      years observation period and 1 year follow-up) from the approval of EGPA indication to the
      lifting of approval condition. NUCALA is a registered trademark of the GlaxoSmithKline [GSK]
      group of companies.

    <description>The response rate is the percentage of subjects assessed as effective. Effectiveness will be comprehensively assessed by any of effective or not effective at Week 12, 48 after the start of NUCALA administration, end of the observation period, or withdrawal/termination, based on the course of subjective symptoms, course of clinical symptoms, from the start date of administration to the end of the observation period. If effectiveness cannot be determined for some reasons, it should be assessed as indeterminable and its reasons should be recorded on the CRF.</description>
