  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intravenous thrombolysis is considered as the first choice for ischemic stroke. In the recent
      years, endovascular therapy is demonstrated to be effective to treat ischemic with big vessel
      occlusion. However, only a minority of patients can get intravenous thrombolysis or
      endovascular therapy due to the restricted time window and strict indications. Dual
      antiplatelet has been demonstrated to be effective in the patients with high risk of TIA or
      minor ischemic stroke (NIHSS&lt;4). But there is still stroke progression although dual
      antiplatelet. The ischemic stroke patients with NIHSS &gt; 3 has been recommended to give
      aspirin in most guidelines. Of those patients, mild to moderate stroke patients (3&lt;NIHSS&lt;10)
      will result in the poor outcomes if the progression occurs. In addition, large artery
      atherosclerosis (LAA) stroke is prone to progress. So, we argue that the mild to moderate
      stroke with LAA should be give more intensive antiplatelet. In the present study, argatroban
      combined with antiplatelet therapy (3-5 days) is used to treat the proposed patients to
      investigate the safety and effectiveness.
