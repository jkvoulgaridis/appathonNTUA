  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Presbyphonia is an age-related voice disorder that affects more than 10 million people in the
      United States. Presbyphonia is characterized by vocal fold atrophy that impairs older
      individuals' ability to communicate, leading to social isolation and reduced quality of life.
      Outcomes from current treatment approaches are often suboptimal for patients with
      presbyphonia as they do not sufficiently challenge the respiratory system to induce
      meaningful change. It is highly likely that the addition of respiratory training would result
      in greatly improved outcomes, such as the ability to speak loud and long enough to have a
      normal conversation. The purpose of this study will be to examine the effect of adding
      inspiratory muscle strength training (IMST) or expiratory muscle strength training (EMST) to
      standard of care voice therapy on respiratory and voice outcomes in patients with an
      age-related voice disorder.

      Forty-eight participants diagnosed with presbyphonia will be blocked-randomized into three
      intervention groups, using a 3-parallel arm design: IMST and voice exercises, EMST and voice
      exercises, and voice exercises during all session. Study endpoints will be the change in
      voice and respiratory measures after four treatment sessions compared to baseline values.
      Response to treatment will be analyzed to determine if there are subgroups of high- or
      low-responders based on baseline voice and respiratory characteristics.

    <description>The participants in the IMST arm will receive, in addition to standard of care voice therapy, inspiratory muscle strength training (IMST).
The IMST intervention will consist of 5 sets of 5 breaths in the inspiratory threshold device every day during four weeks, with a loading dose set at 75% of the participants' maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP). MIP will be measured once a week during the weekly supervised session to adjust the inspiratory trainer.</description>

    <description>IMST will be conducted using an inspiratory pressure threshold trainer (Philips Respironics® Threshold IMT or POWERbreathe® Medic Plus), which consists of a mouthpiece with a spring-loaded valve.

    <description>Voice exercises will consist of the Vocal Function Exercises (VFE) protocol, developed by Stemple (2005). It contains 4 steps: (a) sustain the vowel /i/ on the musical note F for as long as possible. Repeat as judged by the SLP. (b) Glide from the lowest note to the highest note. Repeat as judged by the SLP. (c) Glide from the highest note to the lowest note. Repeat as judged by the SLP. (d) Sustain the notes C-D-E-F-G for as long as possible. Each note will be repeated until the participant finds the right placement (forward-focused voice), as judged by the SLP. Humming will be used to facilitate placement.</description>

             will be given following a visual examination if the observations are consistent with
             the characteristics of a presbylarynx, as judged by the laryngologist.

          -  must be 50 years old and older.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  has received voice therapy in the past year

          -  presents with a vocal fold pathology other than presbyphonia

          -  has a known neurologic or a progressive neuromuscular disease

          -  has a medical condition that could be aggravated by the experimental intervention, or
             any condition judged by the physician (Dr. Halstead) as being unsuitable for RMST.

          -  has dysarthria or a language disorder

          -  has a hearing loss that is not adequately managed

          -  has a cognitive disorder that might affect treatment compliance

          -  is unable to give informed consent
