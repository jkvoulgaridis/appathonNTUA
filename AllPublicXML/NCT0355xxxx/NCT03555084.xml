  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phonak Hearing Systems pass through different development and study stages. At an early
      stage, feasibility studies are conducted to investigate new algorithms, features and
      functions in an isolated manner. If the benefit is proven, their performance is then
      investigated regarding interdependency between all available algorithms, features and
      functions running in parallel in a hearing aid (pivotal/pre-validation studies) and, as a
      result, they get optimized. Afterwards, and prior to product launch, the Phonak Hearing
      Systems undergo a final quality control in terms of clinical trials. This is a pre-validation
      study, investigating optimized algorithms, features, functions and wearing comfort. This will
      be a clinical evaluation which will be conducted mono centric at Sonova AG Headquarters based
      in St채fa (Switzerland).

    <description>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate if Virto B-Titanium hearing aids measured with the Titanium FitGuide (TFG) (extension of Virto B-Titanium) are less visible (deeper) than modeling without TFG (Virto B-Titanium) while maintaining wearing comfort on adult participants (new and existing users) with mild to moderately-severe hearing loss (M and P receiver ).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Measurement of acoustic Feedback Thresholds</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Secondary objective is to compare the acoustic feedback thresholds of the TFG- and without TFG- modeled devices in regard of an adequate sealing effect of the respective devices. Thereby, feedback thresholds, measured with the Phonak Target fitting software, must be comparable to average feedback threshold values of the respective shell forms (IIC / CIC). Acceptable feedback thresholds must guarantee an insertion gain [in dB SPL] of at least 20 dB in a specific frequency range.</description>

    <time_frame>3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Another objective is to investigate whether at least 50% of the screened population will get a deeper fitted device by the use of the TFG tool, proven by modelling software</description>
