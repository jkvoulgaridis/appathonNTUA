  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tuberculosis remains a concerning health problem, with Mycobacterium Tuberculosis (MTB) now
      causing more deaths than acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). GSK3036656 is a compound
      with a novel mechanism of action under development for the treatment of tuberculosis. It
      suppresses protein synthesis in MTB by selectively inhibiting the enzyme Leucyl t-ribose
      nucleic acid (RNA) synthetase. Thus, this study will investigate the early bactericidal
      activity, safety and tolerability of GSK3036656 in up to four sequential cohorts of subjects
      with rifampicin-susceptible tuberculosis. The primary objective of this dose-escalation study
      is to establish the anti-tuberculosis effect of GSK3036656 on serial colony forming units
      (CFU) counts of MTB in sputum over 14 days of therapy. Subjects in each cohort will be
      randomized in 3:1 ratio to one of two treatments: either GSK3036656 or standard-of-care
      (RIFAFOURÂ® e-275) regimen. The approximate duration of the study for an individual subject
      will be 5 weeks, including 1 week of screening, 2 weeks of treatment period and another 2
      weeks of final follow-up visit. RIFAFOUR e-275 is a registered trademark of Sanofi-Aventis.

          -  HIV infected subjects: having a cluster of differentiation 4+ (CD4+) count &lt;350 cells
             per microliter; or having received antiretroviral therapy medication within the last

          -  Women who are susceptible to heavy periods or heavy vaginal bleeding or spotting will
             be excluded in order to minimize blood loss and avoid confounding effects on the
