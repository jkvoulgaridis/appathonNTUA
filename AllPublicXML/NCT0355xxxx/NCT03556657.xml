  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to investigate the effects of a 6-session music therapy
      protocol on the pain, mood, quality of life, coping skills, and self-efficacy of adult
      patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) as compared to adult patients with SCD who receive
      standard care alone. The investigators will also determine the feasibility (delivery,
      acceptability, and usefulness) of the music therapy intervention for pain management and
      quality of life.
