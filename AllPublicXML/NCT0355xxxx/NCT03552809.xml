      The aim of this randomized controlled parallel-designed study was to evaluate clinical
      healing and patient comfort after conventional and diode laser assisted frenectomy operations
      in case of high papillary frenulum attachment. Forty-eight patients with high papillary
      frenulum attachments were included in the study. Patients were randomly divided into three
      groups; conventional frenectomy operation (Group C), frenectomy operation using diode laser
      (Group L) and diode laser asissted frenectomy with horizontal incision on the periosteum
      (Group L+P). Postoperative pain, difficulty in speaking and eating scores were assessed
      postoperative 3 hours and 1, 7, 14, 21 and 45 days using Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).
      Evaluation of epithelialization of the wound surface was carried out via hydrogen peroxide to
      the surface using a dental injector at postoperative 7, 14, 21 and 45 days. Plaque index,
      gingival index, bleeding on probing and probing depth were assessed at baseline and
      postoperative 7, 14, 21 and 45 days. All data were compared between groups and within each
      group.

    <description>Postoperative pain during eating and speaking will be evaluate via visual analog scale (VAS).Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) was used to evaluate pain, discomfort during speaking and chewing. VAS consisted of a horizontal line with a range of numbers from '0' to '10' of which '0' means 'no pain' and '10' means unbearable pain.</description>

    <description>For the conventional surgery, after application of local infiltration anesthesia of articaine HCL associated with epinephrine 1:100,000, the frenulum was grasped with a straight haemostat inserted into the depth of the vestibule; the tissue adjacent to the upper and lower surfaces of the haemostat was incised with a no.15 scalpel. After the diamond shaped resected portion of the frenulum was removed with the haemostat, muscle dilatations were excised on the submucosa of the lateral walls of the cavity. Horizontal incision was made on the periosteum with the help of a scalpel following the procedure. At the end of the operation, the wound was closed with absorbable sutures (4-0, Pegelak®, Doğsan Turkey).</description>

    <description>For the laser frenectomy, a diode laser device (λ = 810 nm, W: 4, GIGA Cheese II, China) was used to perform the procedure. The procedure was performed under local infiltration anesthesia with articaine HCL associated with epinephrine 1:100,000. The frenlum was held by a haemostat inserted into the depth of the vestibule while laser energy was applied to the upper and lower parts of the frenulum adjacent to the haemostat via a fibre tip (400 µm diameter, plain-ended, optical ﬁbre). The laser was carefully applied to the tissue and care was taken to avoid local necrosis of the periosteum or any bone structure.Following the bleeding control, the wound site was left to secondary healing. No sutures were necessary after procedure.</description>
