  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although it is known that the functions of pulmonary and upper limb is affected in late stage
      of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) negatively, the investigators do not have clear
      information about its early stage. The aim of this study was to investigate the differences
      in pulmonary and upper limb functions between children with DMD in early stage and healthy
      peers.

    <measure>Pulmonary Function Test (PFT)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The pulmonary function tests of the participants were evaluated with a spirometry. The child was asked to perform the spirometric tests for three times with maximum effort. The child was motivated before each attempt for stronger and longer expiration.The result of Pulmonary function Test were recorded.</description>

    <measure>The Performance Upper Limb (PUL)</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Upper limb functions of participants were evaluated with The Performance of Upper Limb (PUL) scale. This scale, which was shown to be reliable in DMD, has 22 items in total. It consists of 3 different levels of function: high, mid, and distal. PUL also has four items determining timed performance.</description>
