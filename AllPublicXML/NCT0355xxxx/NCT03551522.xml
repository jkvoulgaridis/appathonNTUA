           resonance imaging-proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) at Week 12

        2. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of seladelpar in subjects with NASH

      Secondary Objectives

           at Week 26 and Week 52

        2. To evaluate the effect of seladelpar on histological improvement of nonalcoholic fatty
           liver disease activity score (NAS) after 52 weeks of treatment

        3. To evaluate the effect of seladelpar on histological improvement of fibrosis after 52
           weeks of treatment

        4. To evaluate the effect of seladelpar on metabolic biochemical markers and biochemical
           markers of inflammation over 52 weeks of treatment
