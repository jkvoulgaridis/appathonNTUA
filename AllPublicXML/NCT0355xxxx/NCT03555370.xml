  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Each year, nearly 2 million children and adolescents have a sport-related concussion (SRC) in
      the U.S., but 57% of them do not receive appropriate clinical care following their injury.
      These injuries involve a wide range of symptoms including headache, dizziness, and sleep
      problems; and cognitive, emotional, visual, and vestibular impairment. The investigators have
      developed a clinical treatment model for SRC that addresses the heterogeneity of this injury
      using different clinical subtypes or profiles that inform precision interventions. To date,
      the investigators have identified cognitive, anxiety/mood, post-traumatic migraine, cervical,
      oculomotor, and vestibular clinical profiles. Patients with vestibular clinical profiles-
      involving dizziness, environmental sensitivity, and imbalance- are common (60-65% of
      concussions), and have worse outcomes and longer recovery following SRC. Consequently, the
      investigators have developed and applied precision vestibular treatments that can be matched
      to specific impairments and symptoms to actively treat patients with vestibular clinic
      profiles.

      To determine using a RCT design the effectiveness of standard of care behavioral management
      (i.e., sleep, walking, nutrition, stress management) to standard of care behavioral
      management (i.e., sleep, walking, nutrition, stress management) (STANDARD OF CARE) plus
      vestibular exercises (i.e., balance, eye-head movements, and dynamic walking exercises)
      (VESTIBULAR) for reducing recovery time, symptoms, and vestibular (balance, eye-head
      movements) and cognitive (e.g., memory, processing speed) impairment in adolescent patients
      with vestibular clinical profiles following sport--related concussion (SRC).

    <measure>Change in VOMS Scores (Vestibular Ocular Motor Screening) from Baseline to 4 Week/Visit 2</measure>
    <time_frame>Measures will be conducted at enrollment (within 10 days of injury) and at 2 weeks (+ or - 5 days) and 4 weeks (+ or - 5 days) following treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The VOMS assesses vestibular and ocular motor impairment via patient-reported symptom provocation brief assessments in 7 components: 1) smooth pursuits; 2, 3) horizontal and vertical saccades; 4) near point convergence (NPC); 5, 6) horizontal and vertical vestibular ocular reflex (VOR), and 7) visual motion sensitivity (VMS). Patients rate changes in headache, dizziness, nausea, and fogginess symptoms compared to immediate pre-assessment state on a scale of 0 (no symptoms) to 10 (severe symptoms) following each VOMS assessment to determine if each assessment provokes symptoms. Convergence is assessed by both symptom report and objective measurement of NPC distance, values are averaged across 3 trials. The VOMS takes approximately 5 min to administer.</description>

    <description>Standard of Care:
The standard of care protocol consists of standardized in office and at home behavioral management to include sleep, hydration, nutrition, and stress management interventions. Participants will also be assigned physical activity that they will complete during their visits and at home. Physical activity for the standard of care group will include 15 minutes of flexibility/range of motion exercises, and 10 minutes of aerobic-based daily physical activity (e.g.,walking, stationary cycle).</description>

    <description>The vestibular group will complete the behavioral management activities described above, as well as prescribed in-office and at home vestibular exercises from each of four groups: 1) gaze stability training (i.e., integrated eye and head movements on fixed target), 2) visual motion training (i.e., integrated eye and head movements with busy visual background), 3) standing balance (i.e., standing in different stances), and 4) dynamic gait (i.e., walking with head turns). Participants will be prescribed to one of four levels of these four exercise groups based on presentation of symptoms/impairment as indicated on the VOMS. Progression through the four levels will be based on symptom tolerance and successful completion of all exercises at the current level.</description>

Participants will be prescribed to one of four levels of these exercise groups based on presentation of symptoms/impairment as indicated on VOMS. Progression through the levels will be based on symptom tolerance and successful completion of all exercises at the current level.</description>
