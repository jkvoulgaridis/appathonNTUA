  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The 2-year research plan will test the Extended Put It Out Project (POP-6) in a pilot
      randomized trial (N=168) compared to TSP-6, as well as comparing POP-6 and TSP-6 to the POP-3
      and TSP-3 interventions from a previously-conducted trial. Participants will be young adults
      who smoke, identify as sexual or gender minorities (SGM), and use Facebook. Primary outcome
      will be biochemically verified 7-day abstinence from smoking at 3 and 6 months. Secondary
      outcomes will be a quit attempt (y/n), stage of change, and thoughts about tobacco abstinence
      at 3 and 6 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be randomized to one of two conditions: (1) a 6-month Facebook-delivered
      intervention addressing tobacco use, tailored to SGM young adults; or (2) a 6-month Facebook
      intervention targeting tobacco use. Both interventions will include 180 days of
      Facebook-based messages and activities tailored to participants' readiness to quit smoking.

      Assessments will occur at baseline, 3, and 6 months follow-up. Assessments will include
      measures on smoking, thoughts about abstinence, and SGM identity experiences. All
      participants who report no past 7-day smoking will be asked to give biochemical verification
      of smoking status with saliva nicotine test kits that will be mailed to participants.

    <description>A Smoking Questionnaire will assess the presence and number of 24 hr quit attempts since the last assessment, used to calculate presence of at least one quit attempt (y/n) in the assessment time period.
