  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A phase Ib/II, open-label, multicenter, randomized study designed to assess the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary anti-tumor activity of immunotherapy-based
      treatment combinations in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) that became
      refractory to first- and second-line standard therapies. Eligible patients will be assigned
      to one of several treatment arms.
