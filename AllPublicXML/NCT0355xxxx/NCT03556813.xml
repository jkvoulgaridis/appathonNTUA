      Chatbots (contraction of &quot;chat&quot; and &quot;robot&quot;) are a computer software program that use
      statistical learning and aim to simulate a conversation by text or voice message. The use of
      these chatbots was evaluated as part of the increase in therapeutic adherence and information
      on well-being and mental health.

      In clinical studies, chatbots are useful in gathering information through questionnaires
      directly submitted during conversations or through keyword analyzes. There is no longer any
      delay between the moment the patient notices a side effect, for example, and the moment when
      the patient announces it during a consultation. The responses given by the chatbot do not
      constitute medical advice and only provide information on the treatments envisaged or in
      progress in the context of the management of breast cancer.

      The main objective of the study is to show that the chatbot Vik's answers to the common
      questions asked by breast cancer patients about their therapeutic management are at least as
      satisfactory as answers given by a committee of multidisciplinary doctors

  <detailed_description>

      A total of 20 most frequently asked questions will be defined on a cohort of 150 breast
      cancer patients. These questions will be asked on the one hand to the chatbot Vik and on the
      other hand to a multidisciplinary medical committee (surgeon oncologist, medical oncologist
      and oncologist radiotherapist). The scientific quality of the responses of the two groups
      will be validated by a second multidisciplinary group of physicians, independent of the
      first.

      A cohort of 150 patients will then be randomized blind and in 1 to 1 to receive the responses
      of the chatbot Vik and the answers of the doctors' committee. Each patient will then have to
      answer the EORTC QLQ-INFO255-7 questionnaire, evaluating the quality of the medical
      information.
