      BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common serious heart rhythm disorder and is
      associated with a 4 to 5-fold increase in the risk of ischemic stroke. AF is often detected
      for the first time while a patient is hospitalized for an acute medical illness or after
      surgery. In these settings, AF can be transient and frequently asymptomatic; detection often
      occurs during prolonged periods of continuous ECG monitoring in an intensive care unit (ICU).

      Atrial Fibrillation Occurring Transiently with Stress (AFOTS) describes the manifestation of
      AF in the acute care setting as the only evidence of AF, for which the incidence and
      appropriate management are uncertain. AFOTS may be directly and uniquely due to a reversible
      precipitant and thus unlikely to recur after this precipitant is removed, thereby having
      minimal impact on the patient's long-term prognosis. Alternatively, AFOTS may be the first
      detection of a chronic condition that is already present but undiagnosed - facilitated by
      inpatient continuous ECG monitoring.

      Previous published studies have provided a wide range of estimates for the incidence of AFOTS
      in the ICU population (3-44%). Differences in estimates may be explained by the methods used
      to detect AFOTS in these studies.

      A precise estimate of the incidence of AFOTS is required in order to understand its long-term
      significance. The present study is designed to generate an accurate estimate of the incidence
      of AFOTS.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of AF, lasting 30 seconds or more, in
      hospitalized patients in the ICU over the age of 65 and without a prior history of AF. This
      will be achieved with a high-sensitivity, 14-day continuous ECG monitor.

      IMPORTANCE: AFOTS may be common, and may respond to established therapies for stroke
      prevention. However, varying methodologies in existing studies have resulted in wide
      variations around its incidence. The systematic protocol employed in this study will generate
      a precise and accurate estimate of the incidence of AFOTS.

      There is uncertainty around the incidence, recurrence and management of AFOTS. The results of
      this study will be integrated with those from the other studies in the AFOTS research
      program. Together, they will inform the monitoring of hospitalized patients for AFOTS, the
      outpatient rhythm monitoring for recurrences of AF and ultimately stroke prevention.

      STUDY DESIGN: This is a prospective descriptive epidemiologic study. It is a component study
      of the AFOTS Research Program.

      POPULATION: Consecutive participants aged 65 years and older without a history of AF, who are
      admitted to the ICU at Hamilton General or Juravinski hospital for treatment of medical
      illness or for recovery from noncardiac surgery.

      OUTCOMES: The primary outcome will be the proportion of patients with AF lasting 30 seconds
      or more, as detected by the patch monitor. Secondary outcomes will include: the proportion of
      patients who have AF documented by the clinical team; the proportion of patients with AF
      lasting 5 minutes or more, 1 hour or more, 6 hours or more and 24 hours or more; the burden
      of AF, defined as time spent in AF per 24 hours and the proportion of AF episodes that occur
      with an average heart rate of 1-40 bpm, 41-60 bpm, 61-80 bpm, 81-100bpm, 101-120 bpm, and
      121-140 bpm and &gt; 140 bpm.
