  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of treatment with
      Nemonoxacin compared with Tavanic® in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment-naive patients with CAP and patients with treatment failure will be screened and if
      eligible will be randomized to receive either treatment with investigational product or
      comparator. Patients will start to receive intravenous therapy with Nemonoxacin or Tavanic®
      and then upon a decision of investigator patients will be switched to oral therapy with the
      same product.

      Intravenous therapy will include two consequence infusions (antibiotic solution and placebo
      solution) to maintain blinding. Intravenous therapy should be given for at least 3 days and
      may be prolonged by a decision of investigator up to 7 days. Then investigator will switch a
      patient from intravenous to oral therapy on Day 4(8) of the study if the specific criteria of
      clinical stability are achieved. To maintain blinding during oral antibiotic therapy each
      Tavanic® tablet was placed into a capsule shell (over-encapsulated), that is identical in
      appearance to a Nemonoxacin-containing capsules.

      The average duration of treatment (including intravenous and oral therapy) for each patient
      will be 7(14) days and during this period patients should stay at hospital. After completion
      of the treatment patients can be discharged from the hospital and should return for
      examinations within 1-2 days after the last dose (end of treatment visit). Then the patients
      should attend the investigational site within 7-9 days after the last dose (test of cure
      visit). Then the investigator will contact the patients by phone within 21-23 days after the
      last dose (long-term follow-up visit).
