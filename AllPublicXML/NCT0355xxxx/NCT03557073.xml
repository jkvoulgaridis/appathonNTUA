      This study seeks to determine if postoperative phone calls by a physician affect outcomes in
      hand surgery. Patients who require operative treatment of hand and wrist fractures are
      randomly assigned to a group that receives a postoperative phone call or the control group
      that receives the standard postoperative care. Patient reported and medical outcomes are
      observed starting at 1 month postoperatively.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Brief Michigan Hand Questionnaire Score Difference</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month postoperatively.</time_frame>
    <description>A patient reported measure of hand function on a scale of 1 to 100. 100 indicates better hand function and 1 indicates worse hand function. The measure is obtained form a survey that has been published in multiple peer reviewed articles. This score can be subtracted from preoperative score to obtain a difference in score of preoperative compared to postoperative.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Patient compliance with treatment recommendations</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>Patient compliance with treatment as documented in their medical record. Patients are either compliant or not compliant (values can be 0 or 1), i.e., their physician states that they followed instructions or they did not.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Patient satisfaction with their overall care</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month postoperatively.</time_frame>
    <description>Patient satisfaction with their overall care, as determined on a 5 point Likert scale. 1 is strongly satisfied whereas 5 is strongly dissatisfied.</description>

    <measure>Patient complication</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month postoperatively</time_frame>
