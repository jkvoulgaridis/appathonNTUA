  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study we are going to compare efficacy between suggestion method during video EEG
      recording by verbal suggestion in isolation and verbal suggestion along with cotton swab or
      tuning fork for inducing the paroxysmal event in children aged 5 to 18 years with suspected
      psychogenic nonepileptic events. Still there is paucity of data regarding the optimum method
      for video EEG by suggestion for psychogenic nonepileptic events. We are planning to recruit
      25 children aged 5 to 18 years in each of the three arms after taking informed consent from
      the guardian and then they will be subjected to video EEG by any one of the three suggestion
      methods.
