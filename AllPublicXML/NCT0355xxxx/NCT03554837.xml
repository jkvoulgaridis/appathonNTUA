  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The efficacy and safety of edoxaban has not been adequately studied in Asians versus
      non-Asians, who are quite different physiologically from each other. Compared with non-East
      Asian patients, the East Asia patients were twice as likely to have the reasons for requiring
      dose reduction of edoxaban, such as CrCl 30-50 ml/min (30.0% and 18.2%, respectively), weight
      ≤60 kg (30.6% and 7.8%, respectively), or concomitant use of verapamil or quinidine (P-gp
      inhibitors, 6.6% and 3.3%, respectively). This study is aimed to evaluate the safety of the
      low dose edoxaban therapy in patients with high bleeding risk and non-valvular AF in the real
      world population of Korea.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The efficacy and safety of edoxaban has not been adequately studied in Asians versus
      non-Asians, who are quite different physiologically from each other. Although 1,943 patients
      from East Asia (1,010 were from Japan, 469 from China, 234 from Taiwan, and 230 from South
      Korea) were included in ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48, majority of the patient (19,162) were from
      non-East Asia. Compared with non-East Asian patients, the East Asia patients were twice as
      likely to have the reasons for requiring dose reduction of edoxaban, such as CrCl 30-50
      ml/min (30.0% and 18.2%, respectively), weight ≤60 kg (30.6% and 7.8%, respectively), or
      concomitant use of verapamil or quinidine (P-gp inhibitors, 6.6% and 3.3%, respectively). Due
      to the relatively small number of patients in the East Asian group included in the analysis
      compared with that of the patients in the non-East Asian group, a limitation preventing it
      from providing sufficient power for such comparison is unavoidable. This study is aimed to
      evaluate the safety of the low dose edoxaban therapy in patients with high bleeding risk and
      non-valvular AF in the real world population of Korea.
