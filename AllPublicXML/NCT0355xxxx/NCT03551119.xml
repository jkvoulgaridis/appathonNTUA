  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background and importance: Hypertension is highly prevalent among Canadians with non-dialysis
      dependent chronic kidney disease (CKD). It is a modifiable risk factor for both
      cardiovascular (CV) events and CKD progression. Exercise is an effective strategy for blood
      pressure (BP) reduction in the general population but in people with CKD, hypertension is
      mediated by different causes (i.e. vascular stiffness, volume expansion) and it is unclear
      whether exercise will reduce BP in this population. Consequently, exercise resources are not
      offered in the routine multidisciplinary care of people with CKD and the prevalence of
      sedentary behaviour remains double that of the general population. The role of exercise in
      CKD management is also an important question for patients. From CIHR-supported workshops with
      patients, the role of lifestyle, such as exercise in CKD was a top research priority.

      Research aims: i.To determine the effect of exercise on mean ambulatory systolic blood
      pressure (SBP) in people with CKD compared to usual care. The investigators hypothesize that
      exercise training will significantly reduce BP compared to control. ii.To inform the design
      of a larger, multi-center trial evaluating the effect of exercise on the risk of CKD
      progression.

      Methods: A 160 participant, single center randomized trial of adults from Alberta Kidney Care
      North CKD clinics, Edmonton, Albert, Canada. Participants with an estimated glomerular
      filtration rate (eGFR) of 15-44 ml/min per 1.73m2 and SBP &gt;130 mmHg will be randomized,
      stratified by eGFR (&lt;30 versus â‰¥ 30) to an exercise intervention or usual care. The main
      outcome is the difference in 24-hour ambulatory SBP after eight weeks of exercise training
      between groups. Secondary outcomes include: BPs at eight and 24 weeks, dose of
      anti-hypertensives, aortic stiffness, CV-risk markers, CV fitness, 7-day accelerometry,
      quality of life, safety, and in an exploratory analysis, eGFR and proteinuria. The
      intervention is thrice weekly moderate intensity aerobic exercise supplemented with isometric
      resistance exercise, targeting 150 minutes per week and delivered over 24-weeks. Phase 1: one
      supervised weekly sessions and home-based sessions (eight weeks). Phase 2: home-based
      sessions (16 weeks). To detect a clinically important BP reduction of 5 mmHg between groups
      requires 128 patients (two sample t-test, alpha 0.05, beta 0.2, common standard deviation of
      10 mmHg). Assuming 20% dropout requires 160 patients. For the primary outcome, the
      investigators will use a mixed linear regression model in which BP is regressed on group,
      baseline SBP and eGFR, and time point.

      Expected outcomes: The findings from this study will address a significant knowledge gap in
      hypertension management in CKD, inform care-delivery and the design of a larger study on CKD
      progression. This proposal aligns with priorities for both patients and decision makers: to
      identify the role of exercise in CKD management and to reshape the delivery of renal care so
      that it is more consistent with patient values and preferences.

    <description>Personnel experienced in training people with chronic conditions (exercise specialist) will supervise the exercise training. At each in-center session in phase 1, the patient's exercise will be monitored to assess whether they are achieving target levels. Training intensities will be prescribed based on the most recent exercise test.
Phase 1: an eight-week program of once weekly-supervised facility-based exercise sessions and twice weekly home-based sessions.
Phase 2: a 16-week home-based exercise program overseen by an exercise specialist. During this phase, participants will be progressed through their home-based exercise program from Phase 1 on an individual basis.
i. Frequency. A minimum of three exercise sessions per week. ii. Intensity. A moderate intensity (40-60% heart rate reserve) based on exercise testing.
iii. Time. 150 minutes of exercise per week. iv. Type. We will prescribe aerobic exercise supplemented with isometric resistance exercises.</description>
