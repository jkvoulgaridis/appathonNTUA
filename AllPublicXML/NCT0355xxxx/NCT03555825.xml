    <textblock>
      The ArmeoSpring device is an exoskeleton (3 joints and 6 degrees of freedom) with integrated
      springs. The investigators hypothesize that 3 days of training for 6 weeks with the Hocoma
      Armeo Spring device will be efficient and more effective than one on one ArmeoSpring therapy.

      In the proposed study, 20 stable subacute and chronic stroke patients will be placed in two
      groups: 2:1 treatment for 3 weeks (2 patients on 2 robots with one therapist; 60 minutes on
      robot) then 1 on 1 intervention with the therapist (60 minutes of Hocoma Armeo Spring robotic
      training) or visa versa. Patients will be assessed using robotic kinematics and standardized
      occupational therapy motor assessments. The extreme precision afforded by robotic physical
      rehabilitation therapies makes them an appealing and growing field in rehabilitation.

      Determining efficiency of new technologies, while maintaining the highest quality of care, is
      of priority in the medical field at this time. Devices such as the ArmeoSpring could lead to
      reduced disability, thereby increasing function and improving quality of life in patients
      experiencing neurological illness or injury. The ArmeoSpring has potential to decrease cost
      for both the provider and patient over time while providing more engaging, evidence-based
      therapy.
