  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to see if an occupational therapist can help people
      with high blood pressure and/or diabetes find ways to better take their medicine.
      Participants will be recruited from the Jordan Valley Community Health Center in Springfield,
      Missouri.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the addition of an occupational therapy
      intervention to counseling by a clinical pharmacist (current usual care) compared to
      counseling by a clinical pharmacist only, will affect three-month medication adherence rates
      among community-dwelling adults with uncontrolled hypertension and/or diabetes.

      To meet this purpose, the following objectives will be addressed:

        1. to determine if the addition of the delivery of an occupational therapy intervention
           (specifically the Integrative Self-Management Intervention) to usual care improves
           three-month medication adherence rates, as measured by the Adherence to Refills and
           Medication Scale (ARMS-7), pill count, blood pressure and/or hemoglobin A1c.

        2. to determine whether the administration of the occupational therapy intervention in
           addition to usual care influences an individual's readiness for change as measured by
           the stages of change measure; and

        3. to explore whether participant demographics (e.g., gender, age, race/ethnicity, assist
           at home, co-morbidities, and number of medications) impact three-month medication
           adherence rates.

    <time_frame>Pill count will be completed approximately every 4 weeks over a 12 week period by the clinical pharmacist.</time_frame>
    <description>A percentage of adherence can be calculated by pill count which includes dividing the number of doses taken by the number of doses that should have been taken multiplied by 100.</description>

    <measure>Change in Blood pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>Blood pressure will be taken approximately every 4 weeks over a 12 week period by the clinical pharmacist.</time_frame>
    <description>Use of the manual auscultatory method for taking blood pressure will be completed by the clinical pharmacist. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures will be recorded and compared separately.</description>

    <description>The IMeds consists of a three-step process that leads the client from the reflection of past performance, to goal setting, and onto strategy identification and implementation. This intervention guides the client through identifying strategies in the following six areas: altering the medication management activity, advocacy, assistive technology, environmental modifications, and securing refills on time (Schwartz et al., 2017).</description>
