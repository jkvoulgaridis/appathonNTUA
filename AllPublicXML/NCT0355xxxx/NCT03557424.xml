      Core data from the BEFORE study:

      Sponsor: Heilpflanzenwohl AG Product: REFIGURA® Title: BEFORE study: Demonstrating the
      efficacy of REFIGURA® through a double-blind, three-arm, randomized, monocentric study Study
      duration: 8 weeks (56 days) Study location: MIT Gesundheit GmbH, Stechbahn 20-22, 47533 Kleve
      CRO: MIT Health GmbH, Stechbahn 20-22, 47533 Kleve Number of study participants: 165 (55
      patients per treatment arm)

      Summary:

      REFIGURA® (manufactured by KITOZYME, Parc Industriel des Hauts-Sarts, Zone 2, Rue de Milmort,
      680, BE-4040 Herstal, Belgium, Distribution: Heilpflanzenwohlkraft GmbH), is an approved
      medical device containing a combination of chitosan (a polyglucosamine ) and glucomannan.
      Chitosan is a vegetable fiber that binds fats in the intestinal lumen. Both substances are
      already approved and show few side effects. They are not absorbed into the body, but work
      directly in the intestine.

      The investigational medicinal products are used to treat obesity (weight loss) and to control
      weight. The effect is based on a reduction in caloric intake, by increasing the feeling of
      satiety and at the same time the appetite is reduced. As a result, the amount of food
      consumed is reduced and excessive food (cravings attacks) is prevented. It also reduces the
      intake of dietary fats.

      The study compares three treatment arms:

        1. placebo

        2. Verum (in the normal, approved dose)

        3. Verum (in the double dose)

      The patients are weighed, their body fat content is measured and the body size is measured.
      All measurement methods are non-invasive.
