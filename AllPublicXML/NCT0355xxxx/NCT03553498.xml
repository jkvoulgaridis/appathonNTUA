  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this randomized clinical trial is to compare the analgesic efficacy and side
      effect profile of IV acetaminophen as an analgesic adjunctive medication to IV hydromorphone
      for the treatment of acute pain experienced by patients in the Emergency Department (ED).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multimodal treatment of pain is a commonly used strategy to control pain by combining
      analgesics with different and complementary mechanisms of action. Oral acetaminophen combined
      with opioids is a mainstay of treatment of mild to moderate pain, while the use of IV opioids
      is the standard for treatment of severe pain in the Emergency Department. An IV formulation
      of acetaminophen is widely used in Europe and has recently been approved in the US. It has
      been studied for treatment of acute post-operative pain and renal colic. This randomized
      trial was designed to assess the effectiveness of the combination of IV acetaminophen and IV
      hydromorphone as a strategy to provide more effective treatment of acute severe pain in the
      Emergency Department with the possibility of reducing opioid consumption.
