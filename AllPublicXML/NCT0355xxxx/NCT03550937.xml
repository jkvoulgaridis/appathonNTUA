  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rotavirus remains among the leading causes of pediatric gastroenteritis requiring
      hospitalization in the world. Surveillance studies revealed that more than 90% of the global
      circulating rotavirus strains were predominated by several major genotypes. Clinical trials
      and post-marketing studies have demonstrated that the currently available rotavirus vaccine
      can provide sufficient protection against strains of the prevalent genotypes. However, the
      emerging strains with new genotypes were increasingly reported in the past decade, an ongoing
      surveillance of the strain changes is needed in the regions where the pediatric population is
      either fully or partly immunized. In this project, the investigators will setup a
      hospital-based gastroenteritis surveillance network by incorporating 8 major hospitals in
      northern, central, southern and eastern Taiwan. From 2013 to 2015, children aged 5 years or
      younger hospitalized to one of the 8 sentinel hospitals due to acute gastroenteritis will be
      screened for rotavirus infection, and viral proteins 7 [VP7] (G type) and viral proteins 4
      [VP4] (P type) genotypes of rotavirus will be determined for each infected case. The
      demographics and clinical manifestations of study subjects will also be collected and
      analyzed. Through this project, the investigators will be able to detect emerging genotypes
      of rotavirus and delineate the strain distribution during the two years of study in Taiwan.
      The investigators can also have more comprehensive understanding of the epidemiology of
      rotavirus regarding to the incidence, disease characteristics, temporal and geographic
      variations of severe rotavirus gastroenteritis in Taiwanese children. Results from this
      project will provide valuable information for future implementation of mass immunization
      against rotavirus in Taiwan.
