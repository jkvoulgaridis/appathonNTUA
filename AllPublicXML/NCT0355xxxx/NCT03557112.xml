      This study is aimed to investigate the short-term efficacy and toxicities of local advanced
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) treated with TPF regimen induction chemotherapy combined with
      nimotuzumab concurrent radiotherapy and cisplatin concurrent chemoradiotherapy.

      TPF program is currently the local advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma commonly used inducing
      chemotherapy, cisplatin is the preferred drug for the same period chemotherapy, however, due
      to heavier gastrointestinal reactions caused by cisplatin， direct damage to renal parenchymal
      and other adverse reactions often lead to anti-tumor therapy can not be smooth Carried out,
      resulting in treatment failure, thus affecting the survival of patients.In this study, Phase
      II clinical trials were performed. Patients with locally advanced local advanced
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma were nonrandomly divided into experimental group and control
      group.The trial group was treated with TPF regimen induction chemotherapy combined with
      nimotuzumab concurrent radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The control group was treated with TPF
      regimen induction chemotherapy combined with Cisplatin concurrent radiotherapy and
      chemotherapy.observed and compared the efficacy and toxicity of the two treatment to assess
      its safety and patient tolerance.
