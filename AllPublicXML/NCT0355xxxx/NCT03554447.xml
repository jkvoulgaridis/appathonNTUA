  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic benefits of pentoxifylline (PTX) in treatment of
      adult patients with MDD as it has anti-inflammatory and phosphodiastrase inhibition
      activities.

    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators evaluated the potential antidepressant effect of PTX in
      adult patients with MDD. the investigators hypothesized that MDD patients taking add-on PTX
      would present greater amelioration of their depressive symptoms than patients taking add-on
      placebo. Furthermore, the investigators assessed the relationship between HAM-D score and
      several peripheral biomarkers as well as their role in diagnosis and therapeutic targets of
      MDD.

    <description>The principal measure of the outcome was the 17-items HAM-D. Scoring is based on the 17-item scale and scores of 0-7 are considered as being normal, 8-13 suggest mild depression, 14-17 moderate depression and scores over 17 are indicative of severe depression. Remission is defined as HAM-D total score ≤ 7 (primary outcome). Treatment response is defined as ≥ 50% drop in the HAM-D total score.</description>
