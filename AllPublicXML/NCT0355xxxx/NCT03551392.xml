  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study will test whether age-related cognitive and mood changes in older adults
      and those with Parkinson disease will be affected by near infrared (NIR) stimulation. The
      overall hypothesis, drawn from previous literature, is that exposure to NIR stimulation will
      have positive effects on brain health and will result in better cognitive and mood
      performance.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study of the efficacy of NIR stimulation for enhancing cognition and mood in
      nondemented older adults including individuals with Parkinson disease. Prior research
      suggests that NIR exposure may be neuroprotective and increases energy available to neurons.
      The current study will test whether age-related cognitive and mood changes in older adults
      and those with Parkinson disease will be affected by near infrared (NIR) stimulation.

      The study team will randomize older adults and those with Parkinson disease into treatment
      groups and evaluate neuroimaging and cognitive outcome measures, before and after an 12-week
      intervention involving transcranial and intranasal NIR. The protocol will involve both &quot; lab&quot;
      and &quot; home-based&quot; NIR stimulation. The overall hypothesis, drawn from previous literature, is
      that exposure to NIR stimulation will have positive effects on brain health and will result
      in better cognitive and mood performance.

    <description>The Negative Affect Scale from the NIH Toolbox Emotion module results in T-scores (mean=50, SD=10) for categories such as anger, sadness, and apathy. Scores below 40 indicate low levels of negative affect. Change scores will be calculated by subtracting the baseline scores from the post-test scores.</description>

             anticholinergic properties (due to potential influence on memory)

             implants).

          -  May have difficulties with activities of daily living, but this is due to physical
             symptoms of Parkinson disease and not because of cognitive problems
