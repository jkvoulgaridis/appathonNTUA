  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Research evidence shows that prevalence of pain in adolescents is increasing and
      is therefore recognized as a growing health problem. Psychological interventions delivered
      remotely through the internet may reduce intensity or severity of pain among children and
      adolescents with chronic pain. The iCanCope with Pain program is an existing web- and
      mobile-based self-management program, which is developed as a multi-center study funded by
      the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and is based on identified health care needs and
      current best practices for pain self-management.

      Objectives: The primary objectives are to describe the translation and cultural adaptation of
      the Norwegian version of the iCanCope with Pain mobile application and evaluate the effect in
      an upcoming randomized controlled trail with adolescents with chronic pain.

      Study sample: 16-19-year-old adolescents with self-declared persistent and/or chronic pain.
      Recruited from high schools in Southern Norway.

      Theoretical framework: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is explained by an integration of
      behavioral and cognitive theories of human behavior and psychopathology and is often the
      preferred treatment of choice for adolescents with different health disorders. The
      theoretical framework of CBT is integrated in the iCanCope with Pain app in terms of five
      components. The intervention group will receive the app with all five components: (I) symptom
      trackers for pain, sleep, mood, physical, and social function; (II) goal setting to improve
      pain and function; (III) coping toolbox of pain self-management strategies; (IV) social
      support; (V) age-appropriate pain education. The control group will receive the app with only
      the first self-registration component (I) symptom trackers for pain, sleep, mood, physical,
      and social function.

      Methods: Both qualitative and quantitative data will be gathered for evaluating the Norwegian
      version of the iCanCope with Pain app. Usability testing are assessed in both laboratory
      settings and in field using observation, interviews and questionnaires, which provide
      necessary information for an upcoming randomized controlled trail (RCT). Outcomes will in the
      RCT be measured at baseline (mid-April) and after an 8 weeks intervention (mid-June).

      The study is part of a PhD project.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. 16-19-year-old adolescents

          2. with persistent and/or chronic pain, weekly suffered and lasting 3 months or more
             based on subjective reporting

          3. be able to read and understand Norwegian

          4. have their own smartphone.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Adolescents with cognitive disability or diseases, because of the risk of not
             correctly understanding the iCanCope with Pain program via self-report, goal setting
             and/or library reading.

          2. Adolescents that have participated in the usability testing of the Norwegian iCanCope
             with Pain app

          3. Adolescents with diagnoses from a pathological or medical origin (e.g
             hematology/oncology patients) will also be excluded because the program was not
             specifically designed for these pain groups.
