  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The coming out of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies, with documented advantages
      and reduced costs respect to Sanger sequencing, has provided new appealing approaches to
      diagnostic testing. Despite this, its use for routine diagnostic purposes requires
      certification in terms of reliability, as well as a cost-effectiveness evaluation.

      To test the feasibility of using the Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (PGM) in clinical
      diagnosis, we assessed its performance to detect point mutations and big rearrangements
      previously identified with standard techniques. The diagnostic accuracy and the
      cost-effectiveness will be evaluated by Health Technology Assessment (HTA) analyses.

    <description>The accuracy of the Ion Torrent Personal Genome (PGM) to identify disease-causing mutations in patients affected by Multiple Osteochondromas (MO) and Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) needs to be validated for its routine diagnostic clinical use. To asses this, we will compare results obtained with the new NGS approach with those previously obtained with standard techniques (DHPLC/Sanger + MLPA) in a number of MO and OI patients.</description>

    <measure>HTA analysis to assess the cost-effectiveness, organizational and social implications of a screening strategy based on the IonPGM platform</measure>
    <time_frame>at 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>To demonstrate the pertinence in the use of this innovative technology in health care, we will examine the medical, social and economic implications according with Health Technology Assessment (HTA), a multi-disciplinary field of policy analysis applied to many different health care technologies before their diffusion and use. HTA aims at evaluating the real effectiveness of medical interventions, their proper use, access criteria and qualitative improvements, the clinical and organizational benefits, therefore suggesting how to manage, promote and discourage them.</description>
