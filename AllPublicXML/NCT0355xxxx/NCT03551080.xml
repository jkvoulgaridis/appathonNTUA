  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this randomized double blind cross-over study 8 healthy persons were injected with 0.8
      ng/kg body weight lipopolysaccharide (LPS) /endotoxin and placebo at two different occasions.
      The aim was to investigate how pain sensitivity and health perception change in response to
      an acute immune activation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eight healthy participants were included in this randomized and balanced double blind
      cross-over study. They were injected two times, once with the active component and once with
      placebo. Participants were recruited by advertising and screened through questionnaires and a
      health examination by a physician. They were asked not to engage in strenuous physical
      activities, sleep regular hours and refrain from alcohol the day before the experiment. If
      the participants felt ill, e.g. coming down with a cold, they were instructed to call and
      were rescheduled for a later appointment. C-reactive protein (CRP) was assessed to exclude
      participants having an ongoing infection on the experimental day. Pregnancy was also an
      exclusion criteria and a pregnancy test was administered for all female participants on
      arrival. Several pain sensitivity measures were performed baseline and at peak inflammatory
      response 1-2 hours after injection. Subjects filled out questionnaires at baseline, 90
      minutes and 4,5 hours after injection.
