  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, Phase 1 study of orally administered VMD-928 in adult
      subjects with advanced solid tumors or lymphoma that have progressed or are non responsive to
      available therapies and for which no standard or available curative therapy exists
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, Phase I, FTIH, multiple-dose, dose-escalation and cohort expansion
      multi-center study conducted in three parts to identify a safe and pharmacologically active
      dose and regimen for VMD-928 monotherapy, which can be implemented in Phase 2 studies (the
      RP2D). The regimen will be identified using an adaptive design, multiple-ascending dose study
      in cancer patients. To conserve patients in the lower dose cohorts, dose escalation will
      begin with an accelerated titration scheme. A second part of the study will assess antitumor
      activity at the RP2D. The third part of the study will collect tumor samples before and after
      treatment to assess biological activity.
