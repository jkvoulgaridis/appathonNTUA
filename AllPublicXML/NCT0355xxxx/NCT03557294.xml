  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of the proposed research is to test whether varenicline (Chantix) is safe
      and effective as an over-the-counter (OTC) medication.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Given the recent research on varenicline showing that it is more effective than nicotine
      patch and bupropion, and with the removal of the box warning, research is needed to assess
      whether smokers can use varenicline without a prescription and formal behavioral support. To
      test this, the primary goal of the proposed research is to test whether varenicline is a
      candidate for switching from prescription (Rx) to OTC, and whether a dose lower than that
      currently approved is as effective in an OTC environment. To understand the within-person
      mechanisms explaining how and when OTC varenicline might improve cessation outcomes, the
      investigators also propose to assess experience with OTC varenicline via (a) ecological
      momentary assessment (EMA).

      Primary Objectives:

        1. To assess the safety and effectiveness of the current FDA-approved 1 mg b.i.d.
           varenicline for smoking cessation in comparison with placebo when used in a simulated
           OTC study condition.

        2. To assess the safety and effectiveness of .5mg b.i.d. varenicline in comparison with 1mg
           b.i.d. varenicline and placebo when used in a simulated OTC study condition.
