    <textblock>
      Treatment of vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) and atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC) is a
      challenge for the ophthalmologist and patients because of its wide variation in presentation
      and recurrence in nature. Patients has to be dependent on long term steroid control and
      suffered from complications, such as steroid glaucoma and secondary infection. About 32% of
      VKC patients is refractory to steroid treatment and another 35.4% of patients showed partial
      response. Tacrolimus ointment or eye drops are promising anti-inflammatory agents that have
      been shown very effective against VKC for patients suffering from severe VKC resistant to
      topical cyclosporine. Although tacrolimus eye drops is very effective in severe cases of VKC,
      unfortunately, it is only available in limited countries. Because of the unavailability of
      tacrolimus eye drops and side effect of long-tern steroid use, we tried to find other options
      for these severe VKC and AKC. Because there will be concomitant atopic dermatitis in the
      eyelid of severe cases of VKC and AKC, we retrospectively collected in cases using topical
      tacrolimus dermatological ointment on the skin of upper eye lid in the treatment of severe
      VKC and AKC with concomitant atopic dermatitis. Here, we reported 10 cases with either VKC or
      AKC whose symptoms resolved significantly with dermatologic tacrolimus ointment applying on
      eyelids.
