  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression is highly prevalent among people living with HIV (PLHIV) in Malawi and elsewhere
      in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Besides its high prevalence, depression likely represents an
      important barrier to consistent HIV care engagement and long-term viral suppression. However,
      the potential for depression treatment to improve HIV care outcomes has received little
      attention in the region, in part because of limited mental health infrastructure. In this
      study, the investigators will evaluate the impact of a depression treatment program
      integrated within existing HIV clinics on depression response, retention in HIV care, and
      viral suppression. It is expected that this evaluation will yield important evidence on the
      impact of depression treatment integrated with HIV care for improving HIV care and mental
      health outcomes in Malawi.

      Study population:

      The evaluation will abstract screening data for adult (≥18 years old) patients newly
      initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) who are screened for depression at the two clinics
      before and after the integration of the depression treatment program, and additional
      treatment and outcome data for those patients who screen positive for depression.

      Study Size:

      Across the two clinics, the investigators expect to abstract depression screening data for
      approximately 2,300 patients. The investigators expect to abstract further treatment and
      outcome data for approximately 640 patients who screen positive for mild, moderate, or severe
      depression.

      Study Duration:

      Evaluation and dissemination activities will last two years.

      Study Evaluation:

      To evaluate the impact of the mental health treatment program on HIV care outcomes, the
      investigators will collect data on HIV appointment adherence and viral load at 6 months
      following ART initiation.

      To evaluate the impact of the mental health treatment program on mental health outcomes the
      investigators will collect data on depression symptoms at baseline through 6 months following
      ART initiation.

      Study Design Overview:

      The study will employ a pre-post design in two HIV clinics in Lilongwe to evaluate the impact
      of integrating the depression treatment program within existing clinic operations on HIV and
      mental health outcomes. The investigators will use existing medical records and the
      depression patient registry maintained by the Ministry of Health-run clinics to abstract
      routinely collected clinical data. Using these data, the investigators will compare mental
      health and HIV outcomes before and after the integration of the depression treatment program.
      Depressive symptoms will be measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9). The
      PHQ-9 is a self-report questionnaire designed to assess depression through nine questions
      that come directly from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th
      Edition (DSM-IV) signs and symptoms of major depression. Additionally, the investigators will
      conduct short qualitative interviews with clinic and Ministry of Health staff about the
      integration of the depression screening and treatment program and with patients on their
      understanding of depression and satisfaction with depression screening and treatment.

    <measure>Proportion of participants who achieve depression remission (PHQ-9 score less than 5)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months after ART initiation</time_frame>
    <description>Depression remission is defined as scoring less than 5 on the PHQ-9 approximately 6 months after ART initiation. The PHQ-9 is a self-report questionnaire designed to assess depression through nine questions that come directly from the DSM-IV signs and symptoms of major depression. The 9 items describe problems associated with depression, and participants must rate how often the patient has been bothered by the problems in the last 2 weeks on a 0-3 scale. The scores are summed for a total depression score, ranging from 0-27, with 0-4 being minimum and indicating no depressive symptoms, 5-9 mild depression, 10-14 moderate depression, 15-19 moderately severe depression, and 20-27 severe depression. Depressive symptoms will be measured with the PHQ-9 at baseline through approximately 6 months after ART initiation.</description>

    <description>The depression treatment program combines measurement-based antidepressant treatment with PST with clinical response appropriate to the level of depressive severity. Patients scoring 0-4 on the PHQ-9, indicating no depression, receive no treatment. Patients scoring 5-9 on the PHQ-9, indicating mild depressive symptoms that likely are not a full major depressive episode, are offered PST. Patients scoring 10 or above on the PHQ-9, indicating moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms, are first offered anti-depressants. For this group, PST will be an alternative or augmentation option for those who do not tolerate or respond to antidepressant treatment. All patients' depressive severity is monitored with the option of modifying their treatment plan if their symptoms worsen or do not improve.</description>
