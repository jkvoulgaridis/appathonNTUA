  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-site randomized clinical trial comparing 3 modes of delivering the Managing
      Fatigue course for reducing fatigue in individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS). The primary
      hypothesis is that the teleconference and internet versions of the course will be noninferior
      to the one-on-one, in person version in terms of the primary outcome of fatigue and secondary
      outcome of quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fatigue is one of the most common and debilitating symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS). MS
      fatigue can impact all aspects of quality of life, including physical, mental, and social
      function. MS fatigue is a profound barrier to participating in meaningful activities, such as
      employment and hobbies. Currently, the FDA has not approved medications for MS fatigue in the
      United States (US). However, there are empirically tested, non-pharmacological strategies
      that can support people with MS in reducing the impact of fatigue. Thus, the aim of the study
      is to compare 3 modes of delivering the Managing Fatigue course—2 telerehabilitation formats
      (teleconference and internet) and 1-to-1, in-person format (traditional mode of clinical
      service delivery)—upon outcomes important to people with MS, i.e., fatigue and its impact on
      physical, mental, and social function. The intervention arms will focus on reducing fatigue
      as a strategy to directly improve physical, mental and social functioning.

    <description>Fatigue will be assessed with Fatigue Impact Scale. Fatigue Impact Scale is a 40-item questionnaire that measures impact of fatigue on day-to-day life. Scale ranges from &quot;no problem&quot; (0) to &quot;extreme problem&quot; (4). Total scores will be computed by summing responses for each item. Scores can range from 0 to 160.</description>

    <description>Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale and Community Participation Indicators will be used.
Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale is considered measure of health-related quality of life. It consists of 29 self-report questions that includes 2 subscales: physical function and mental function.
Community Participation Indicators consists of 20 questions about various social activities and community roles. Participants are asked to rate their frequency of engagement, whether it was important, and whether they were doing it enough.</description>

    <description>This intervention arm will be a 6-week, group-based course involving weekly 80-min teleconference sessions. It will be delivered in small groups (6-12 participants) to maximize participants' opportunities for interaction. A program manual divided into 6 sections, 1 for each week that includes worksheets and homework activities will be given to the participants. Occupational therapists will facilitate the sessions. Participants and the OT will dial into 1-800 conference call line on the designated date and time.</description>

    <intervention_name>Internet</intervention_name>
    <description>The internet course is similar to the teleconference format. It will occur in a 6-week period and be group based; i.e., 8-12 participants will begin the intervention at the same time and interact with each other during the 6-week period. Participants will be given a username and a password to view a different session each week at a time convenient for them. Each session will include completing practice activities and sharing information (e.g., offering advice and support to one another through the discussion forum). OTs will facilitate the discussions by responding to entries, asking questions, and providing encouragement to complete sessions.</description>

    <description>Unlike the teleconference and internet courses, the number and length of sessions for the 1-to-1, in-person course will vary over the 6-week period. The OT will cover all 6 topics, but the pace will be tailored to the participants' needs and preferences. Thus, although the topics are consistent, OTs are able to spend more time on topics that participants find pertinent to their situations. The participant and OT will be instructed to meet at least 3 times with at least 7 days between each session.</description>
