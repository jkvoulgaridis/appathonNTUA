      Participants diagnosed as having fibromyalgia, osteoarthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis are
      to be brought to a minimum symptom state using a 3-week period during which they are to
      ingest modest doses of cortisol tablets with weekly lowered tapered doses. Thereafter, the
      participants are to be taught to self-administer cortisol tablets on the as-needed basis to
      maintain the minimum symptom state. For this, they are to ingest a smaller-dosage, 5-day
      tapered regimen of cortisol tablets to quench each reoccurring exacerbation of the disease at
      its earliest stage. Participants are limited to using less than the safe use limit of
      cortisol per month and are required to include a minimum of 10 days per month during which no
      cortisol was ingested.

      OBJECTIVE: To define why and demonstrate how patient self-administration of cortisol with
      stress management eliminates chronic inflammation pain within fibromyalgia, osteoarthritis,
      and rheumatoid arthritis.

      METHODS: One thousand seventeen hundred and twenty (1,720) participants with chronic
      inflammation-containing diseases, were brought to a minimum symptom state using
      daily-administered cortisol tablets. Thereafter, participants used 5-day, small-dosage
      cortisol regimens to quench subsequent disorder exacerbations to maintain the minimum symptom
      state. Stressors as emotional traumas, infections, allergies, and injuries were minimized to
      reduce cortisol consumption and participant discomfort. This protocol is compliant with
      current United States Food and Drug Administration recommendations for cortisol use applied
      to corticosteroid-responding disorders.

    <intervention_model_description>All participants follow the same treatment protocol: First, the participants ingest a defined dosage, 3-week treatment of cortisol tablets to achieve a minimum symptom state. Second, after the first is complete, participants are trained to self-administer small-dosage, 5-day regimens of cortisol tablets to quench disease exacerbations to maintain the minimum symptom state.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Participant evaluation of disease symptom intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants determine Total Scores 7 days prior to cortisol initiation to obtain the average baseline Total Score. Participant Total Score change is plotted daily vs. time for study. Outcome: Total Score at 24 weeks vs. baseline.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants evaluate 50 symptoms for intensity using the 0 to 10 scale. 0 represents no disease intensity and 10 represents extreme maximum symptom intensity with the intermediate numbers defined as Mild I, Mild II, Mild III, Moderate I, Moderate II, Moderate III, Severe I, Severe II, Severe III for 2 through 9, respectively. The participant-determined disease intensity numbers of the 50 symptoms are added to obtain Total Score for each day.</description>
