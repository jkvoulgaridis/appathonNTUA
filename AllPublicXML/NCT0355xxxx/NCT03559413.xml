  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this clinical study is to evaluate the feasibility and safety of an individualized
      peptide vaccination approach in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). For this
      purpose, tumor-specific mutations are analyzed by comparative exome sequencing of tumor and
      healthy reference tissue. Expression of variants is further validated by RNA sequencing. In a
      second step, HLA-binding (human leukocyte antigen-binding) peptides derived from mutated
      protein sequences are selected for vaccination. The peptides are administered as a
      vaccination cocktail with adjuvant GM-CSF and Imiquimod over a course of 9 months and a total
      of 16 vaccinations. Primary objective is the de novo induction of a specific T cell response
      without unacceptable toxicity and acute GvHD (graft versus host disease).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Primary endpoint is &quot;success of treatment&quot; defined as a patient showing a vaccination-induced T-cell response without unacceptable toxicity and acute GvHD of Grade III or higher or extensive chronic GvHD until day 120 (after 10 vaccinations).</measure>
    <time_frame>120 days</time_frame>
    <description>Side effects wil be assessed according to NCI common toxicity criteria V4.0. GvHD will be graded according to Glucksberg criteria. A vaccine-specific response will be defined by an at least 2-fold elevated cytokine expression of CD4+ and/or CD8+ T cells over background in response to stimulation with the vaccine peptides. A vaccine-induced response will be defined by an at least 2-fold elevated response at a certain timepoint compared to pre-vaccination.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate CD4+ and/or CD8+ T-cell responses over the vaccination period.</measure>
    <time_frame>246 days</time_frame>
    <description>T-cell responses will be measured after completion of the study at day 246 and will be analyzed with regard to the T-cell responses at day 120.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate changes in minimal residual disease (MRD) during and after treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>246 days</time_frame>
    <description>Possible reduction of MRD levels on days 36, 120 and 246 (after 7, 10 and 16 vaccinations) measured as reduction of 1 log compared to baseline yes/no.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
