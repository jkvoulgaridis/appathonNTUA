  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single center, age de-escalation, partly-blinded, randomized study.

      The trial will be performed with the participation of 100 healthy children age 1-5 years who
      have been vaccinated with inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) and/or oral polio vaccine (OPV) in
      their first year of life and of 648 healthy 6 week-old infants, who will be pre-vaccinated
      with bOPV-IPV before being randomized to study groups. The allocation of 18-22 week-old
      infants to groups will be performed in a randomized manner. Following completion and Data
      Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) review of follow-up for general safety data (Serioius Adverse
      Events -SAEs-, Important Medical Events -IMEs- and severe adverse events -AEs), a DSMB
      recommendation to proceed will result in randomization of the final cohort of infants.
      Allocation of 1 to 5 year-old children to groups will be performed in a randomized manner.

      The DSMB will establish and continuously assess stopping rules for safety.
