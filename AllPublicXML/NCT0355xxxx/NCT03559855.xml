  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled trial testing the effectiveness of a program provided
      in Colorado high schools by the Center for Relationship Education based in Denver, Colorado.
      14 schools are randomly assigned to either provide the Real Essentials curriculum as part of
      health or similar classes or teach these classes as usual. The study design includes surveys
      administered pre-program, post-program and at 6-month and 12-month follow ups. Primary study
      outcomes are increased knowledge of healthy relationships and reduced risky sexual behavior.
