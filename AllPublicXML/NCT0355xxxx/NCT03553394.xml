  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Reduced urinary output is a common postoperative issue for patients going through major
      surgery such as pancreatic surgery. Commonly this is treated by increasing fluid
      administration to the patients and sometimes also diuretics. However, overloading patients
      with fluid also have several risks and known complications. Studies have also shown that a
      short period of decreased urinary output in the postoperative period do not have an increased
      incidence of acute renal failure. The aim of our study is to investigate the difference in
      renal function and postoperative complications associated with fluid overload on these
      patients that are randomized to either receiving a fluid bolus directly when urinary output
      decreases or to await for a maximum of four hours to see if urinary output increases
      spontaneously.

      Patents after pancreatic surgery will be included in the study. Oliguric patients (urine
      output &lt;0.5 ml/kg/h) will be randomized to fluid bolus (5ml/kg Ringer's Acetate in 30
      minutes) or no intervention. Primary outcome is difference in urine output two hours after
      the fluid bolus or no intervention.
