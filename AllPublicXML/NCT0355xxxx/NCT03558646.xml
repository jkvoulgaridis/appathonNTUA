  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Europe, hydroxocobalamin (cyanokit) has been used for suspicion of cyanide intoxication
      associated with the inhalation of fire smoke (1). However, the impact of hydroxocobalamin on
      outcome has never been thoroughly evaluated. While hydroxocobalamin has long been presented
      as being side-effect free, recent data suggest that in patients with severe burns, its use
      was associated with the occurrence of acute renal failure by intra tubular precipitation of
      oxalate crystals (2, 3). The purpose of this observational study is to investigate the
      association between use of hydroxocobalamin and outcome after smoke inhalation.

      In Europe, hydroxocobalamin (cyanokit) is the antidote recommended by expert consensus in
      cases of suspicion of cyanide intoxication associated with the inhalation of fire smoke (1).
      However, cyanokit has never been evaluated in this indication. Clinical data suggest that in
      patients with severe burns, its use is associated with the occurrence of acute kidney injury
      by intra tubular precipitation of oxalate crystals (2, 3). The purpose of this observational
      study is to investigate the association between use of hydroxocobalamin and outcome after
      smoke inhalation. The results of this study should guide future research and advice on the
      benefit-risk ratio of hydroxocobalamin.
