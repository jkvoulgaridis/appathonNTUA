      The FIL_VERT study is a phase II, open label, multicenter clinical trial. The primary of
      objective of the Study is to evaluate the efficacy of Venetoclax ABT-199/GDC-0199) in terms
      of overall response rate (ORR) in patients with relapsed/refractory BCL-2 positive peripheral
      T cell lymphoma not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS), angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL)
      and other nodal T-cell lymphomas of T-follicular helper origin (TFH)

      This is an open-label, multi-center, single arm phase II trial, with a two-stage design, to
      evaluate the activity and safety of ABT-199 single agent in patients with BCL-2 pos R/R
      PTCL-NOS, AITL, TFH.

      A pre-screening evaluation of immunohistochemical positivity of BCL-2 will be performed in
      the relapse biopsy, if available, or otherwise in the initial biopsy. BCL-2 evaluation will
      be centralized (FIL Laboratories). Only patients with a percentage of BCL-2 positive tumor
      cells ≥ 25% will be included onto the study. Patients will receive ABT-199 until disease
      progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent and/or the investigator determines
      that further therapy is not in the patient's best interest. The primary objective of the
      study is ORR which will be evaluated after 3 cycles of treatment.

      ABT-199 will be administered orally at the dose of 800 mg once daily. Patients will receive
      ABT-199 until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent and/or the
      investigator determines that further therapy is not in the patient's best interest (e.g., due
      to non-compliance, toxicity...) Response evaluation will be performed initially after 3
      cycles from the beginning of treatment with ABT-199 (Response Assessment 1) and then every 3
      cycles during the first 12 cycles, every 4 cycles from cycle 13 to 24; for those patients
      still on therapy after 24 cycles, the response evaluation, after this time, will be performed
      every 6 cycles.

      Response will be evaluated according to the Lugano 2014 classification.

      TLS is an important identified risk for ABT-199 in oncology studies, especially in CLL. Since
      there are no available data on the risk of TLS in PTCL, the risk of TLS development should be
      closely monitored during the study.

      TLS prophylaxis includes:

        1. ABT-199 will be administered according the following ramp up:

             -  week 1 day 1: 20 mg

             -  week 1 day 2-3: 50 mg

             -  week 1 day 4-7: 100 mg

             -  week 2: 200 mg

             -  week 3: 400 mg

             -  week 4 and following: 800 mg

        2. Hospitalization and monitoring of the subject should occur for a minimum of 72 hours
           after the initial dose. Discharge of the subject is dependent upon review of chemistry
           labs 72 hours after the first dose of ABT-199

        3. IV hydration (150 cc/hr, as tolerable) must be started upon admission and continued
           during hospitalization at least for 72 hours after the initial dose of ABT-199. Urine
           output must be monitored

        4. Allopurinol 300 mg daily to be initiated 3 days before treatment and continued for up to
           5 weeks based on the ongoing risk of TLS development. Subjects allergic to allopurinol
           must use another anti-hypeuricemic drug. Consider use of rasburicase if subjects
           baseline uric acid level is elevated

        5. The investigator decision to proceed with ABT-199 treatment initiation and subsequent
           ramp up will be after having evaluated the normal value of the following biochemistry
           (potassium, uric acid, phosphorus, calcium and creatinine).

      Biohemistry labs (potassium, uric acid, phosphorus, calcium and creatinine) must be performed
      as follow:

        -  week 1 (ABT-199 dose from 20 to 100 mg/daily): at timepoints 0 (pre-dose, within 4 hours
           from ABT-199 administration), 6-8, 24, 48, 72, 96 hours after the first dose of ABT-199.
           Day 2 dose should not be administered until the 24 hours post-dose labs are reviewed by
           the investigator;

        -  week 2 (ABT-199 dose 200 mg/daily): at timepoints 0 (pre-dose, with-in 4 hours from
           ABT-199 administration), 6-8, 24 hours after. Day 2 dose should not be administered
           until the 24 hours post-dose labs are reviewed by the investigator;

        -  week 3 (ABT-199 dose 400 mg/daily): at timepoints 0 (pre-dose, with-in 4 hours from
           ABT-199 administration), 6-8, 24 hours after. Day 2 dose should not be administered
           until the 24 hours post-dose labs are reviewed by the investigator;

        -  week 4 (ABT-199 dose 800 mg/daily): at timepoints 0 (pre-dose, with-in 4 hours from
           ABT-199 administration), 6-8, 24 hours after. Day 2 dose should not be administered
           until the 24 hours post-dose labs are reviewed by the investigator Nephrology (or other
           acute dialysis service) must be consulted/contacted on admission (per institutional
           standards to ensure emergency dialysis is available).

      The efficacy interim analysis will be performed after enrollment of 18 patients. It is to be
      planned a stop in recruitment of at least 3 months to have the results of response
      assessment. The primary efficacy analysis will consist of an estimate of ORR on the efficacy
      population after the first 3 cycles of therapy, with 90% confidence intervals (according to
      1-sided alpha error of 0.05). To proceed to the second stage, the minimum number of patients
      with an ORR is 3/18.
