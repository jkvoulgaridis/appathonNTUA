  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The benefits of exercise for general health and wellbeing in older adults are
      well-established. Balance exercises such as tai chi and yoga, along with resistance training,
      can improve or maintain physical function in older adults and enhance muscle strength.
      Furthermore, aerobic activity is critical for maintaining and improving cardiovascular and
      functional health. Noncontact boxing has recently seen a surge in popularity among
      individuals with Parkinson's Disease (PD), with components of both aerobic and balance
      exercise. While participants anecdotally note improvements in stress and physical function,
      this has only been minimally studied. However, drawing on this experience and the combined
      aerobic, balance, and mindfulness practices that comprise karate, we hypothesize that
      participation in structured karate programs may offer similar or greater benefits.
      Specifically, the aim of this study is to test whether and to what degree a community-based
      karate class tailored for individuals with early- to middle-stage Parkinson's Disease (PD) 1)
      is feasible; and 2) improves objective and patient-reported outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For 10 weeks, eligible subjects will engage in twice-weekly karate classes, specifically
      designed for individuals with early to middle stage PD, focused on incorporating upper and
      lower limb movements in multiple directions, increasing awareness throughout the body,
      shifting body weight and rotation, relaxation of the muscles, improving reaction time, using
      complex repetitive actions to improve coordination, footwork training and centered weight
      shifts to help with fall prevention, and striking shields for self-defense and stress relief.

      Before beginning the karate classes, each subject will attend a pre-intervention focus group
      during which subjects will complete an assessment focused on overall mobility, gait, balance,
      mood, and quality of life. Subjects will be prompted to share their thoughts on exercise,
      balance, and mindfulness practices in general and in PD specifically.

      Following the 10 weeks of twice-weekly karate classes, subjects will attend a
      post-intervention assessment and focus group during which the pre-intervention assessments
      will be repeated and the subject's impressions about the karate classes and their
      effectiveness will be measured.

      Finally, the study team will contact subjects 6 months post-intervention to assess continued
      engagement in karate or related activities and again, the subject's quality of life and
      global impression of change.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in mobility as measured by the Timed Up &amp; Go (TUG)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Timed Up &amp; Go (TUG) is a well-validated, brief measure of mobility. To complete this assessment, subjects sit in a standard arm chair and are instructed that when the team member says &quot;Go&quot;, they should stand up from the chair, walk at their normal pace to a taped line, turn, walk back to their chair at a normal pace, and sit down again. The study team member will record the TUG results in seconds using a stopwatch. A lower TUG result indicates greater mobility. Scores at the pre- and post-intervention focus groups will be compared.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in overall well-being as measured by the Patient Global Impression of Change Scale (PGIC)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Global Impression of Change Scale (PGIC) is a single-item rating scale that asks subjects to rate their overall response to the intervention using a 7-point rating scale. Percentages of subjects endorsing each of the 7 response options will be compared. This scale will be completed at the post-intervention focus group.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in balance abilities as measured by the Functional Reach Test (FRT)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Functional Reach Test (FRT) is a brief, valid, reliable, and practical assessment of balance. This test involves a yardstick being mounted on a wall at shoulder height. The subject is asked to stand next to the yardstick, extend the arm closest to the wall at 90 degrees of shoulder flexion, and the distance is recorded. The subject is then asked to reach as far as he or she can forward without taking a step, and the distance is recorded again. The difference between start and end position is the reach distance. Greater reach distances indicate better balance. Scores at the pre- and post-intervention focus groups will be compared.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in balance abilities as measured by the Tinetti Mobility Test (TMT)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Tinetti Mobility Test (TMT) consists of 2 subscales: balance tests (9 items, scored from 0-16) and gait tests (7 items, scored from 0-12), where higher scores reflect better performance. Scores at the pre- and post-intervention focus groups will be compared</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in anxiety as measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) is a brief, 14-item highly validated scale for measuring anxiety (7 items) and depression (7 items), where scores of &gt;8 for either anxiety or depression indicate probable symptoms. Scores at the pre- and post-intervention focus groups will be compared.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in cognitive abilities as measured by the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>In the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), the subject uses a reference key to pair specific numbers with given abstract geometric figures in 90 seconds. Scores are the correct number of pairs made in 90 seconds, with greater scores indicating greater cognitive abilities. Scores at the pre-and post-intervention focus groups will be compared.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in short-term memory abilities as measured by the Digit Span Test (DST)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Digit Span Test (DST) tests the number of digits a subject can recall in the correct order after hearing them. The experimenter says numbers slowly at one second intervals. Subjects are asked to repeat the numbers in the order they were given. A subject's digit span is the number of items they are able to report back in order correctly. Scores at the pre-and post-intervention focus groups will be compared.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Sustainability of an exercise program in patients with PD</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>During the six month follow-up phone call, subjects will be asked whether they have continued to participate in any structured karate or martial arts classes. If yes, frequency and location of these classes will be asked. If no, reasons for lack of participation will be asked. Larger numbers of &quot;yes&quot; responses would indicate program sustainability.</description>
