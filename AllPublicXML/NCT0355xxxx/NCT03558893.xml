  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be the first to distinguish the relative contributions of sleep, circadian
      and behavioral mechanisms to the non-dipping BP profile in Black adults and will lay the
      groundwork for optimizing therapies dependent on mechanisms, such as targeting sleep,
      targeting circadian rhythmicity, or targeting behaviors, and raising the possibility that
      ideal therapy for hypertension (HTN) may differ by race. This research will ultimately help
      to improve health and survival in black populations with HTN.

      By studying standardized behaviors and regulators of BP during sleep and behavioral stresses
      across all circadian phases, this protocol will allow us specifically to:

        1. To determine if poor sleep, while controlling for circadian phase, contributes to the
           higher overall BP and reduced nocturnal drop in BP in Blacks compared to Whites.

        2. To determine if reduced BP responses to standardized behavioral changes across the day
           and night contribute to the higher overall BP and reduced nocturnal drop in BP in Blacks
           compared to Whites.

        3. To determine if reduced circadian amplitude of BP contributes to the higher overall BP
           and reduced nocturnal drop in BP in Blacks compared to Whites.
