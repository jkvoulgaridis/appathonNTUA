    <textblock>
      This study consists of a 4-week screening period, a 24-week treatment period for all
      participants, followed by a 28-week treatment period extension (to 52 weeks in total) for a
      subset of at least 60 and up to 80 participants, and a 2-week post-treatment follow-up
      period. This is an outpatient study in people who currently suffer a minimum of 2 migraines
      per month. During the study, participants will be instructed to use no more than 2 doses of
      the study drug INP104 within a 24-hour period, 3 doses in a 7-day period. Participants will
      self-administer INP104 intranasally.
