  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      My study will employ a convergent mixed methods two-arm parallel randomized controlled
      design. The qualitative strand will primarily rely on semi-structured interview procedures to
      answer the following questions: (1) How do adolescents perceive and experience the phenomenon
      of nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI)? (2) What do adolescents believe needs to be done to
      address NSSI? The quantitative strand will primarily rely on clinical interview data,
      self-report measures, and an experimental task protocol to answer the following question:
      What is the impact of a brief mindfulness induction (versus a control condition) on
      self-injury attentional bias among self-injuring adolescents?
