  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overactive bladder (OAB) is a clinical syndrome defined by the International Continence
      Society (ICS) and the International Urogynecological Association (IUGA) as urinary urgency
      (sudden and uncontrollable urge to urinate) possibly associated with urinary frequency
      (urination greater than 8 times per day), nocturia (2 or more urinations per night) or
      urinary incontinence (UI). In most cases no root cause is found, so it is referred to as
      idiopathic overactive bladder (iOAB).

      The treatment of iOAB is based primarily on hygiene and dietary measures and perineal
      rehabilitation. If these are insufficient, medical anticholinergic treatment is offered.

      Second-line therapies are based on percutaneous neuromodulation of the tibial nerve,
      neuromodulation of the sacral roots S3 and intra-detrusor injection of botulinum-A toxin.

      iOAB has a significant negative impact on patients' quality of life, particularly in cases of
      associated urinary incontinence. It is at the origin of low self confidence.

      A significant proportion of patients with iOAB are not managed or are not satisfied with
      treatment.

      A strong epidemiological correlation between AVH and metabolic syndrome (MS) was demonstrated
      in a literature review of 119 articles. MS is a clinical-biological syndrome defined by the
      National Cholesterol Education Program Adut Treatment Panel III (NCEP ATP III). The
      prevalence of OAB increases with that of obesity but only from a waist circumference of at
      least 100cm. S. Boudokhane showed in a prospective study of 34 patients with MS defined by
      the NCEP ATP III criteria that waist circumference, BMI and post prandial glucose were
      positively correlated with the presence of OAB measured by the PSU score (p&lt;0.05).

      Physical activity (PA) is defined as any body movement produced by skeletal muscles resulting
      in a substantial increase in energy expenditure above rest energy expenditure (WHO). The
      efficacy of AP on MS has been demonstrated in primary prevention and treatment of MS by the
      HERITAGE study and the controlled trial established under the Diabetes Prevention Program
      (DPP). The follow-up was conducted over 3.2 years and showed a significant decrease in the
      incidence of MS in the PA group by 41% compared to placebo (p&lt;0.001). The action of PA on
      iOAB has not been directly studied but some studies have shown that PA and pelvic floor
      muscle strengthening significantly and respectively decrease the number of mixed (p&lt; 0.0001)
      (14) or urgency (p=0.009) UI episodes. Since March 2017, the prescription of modified PA is
      possible.
