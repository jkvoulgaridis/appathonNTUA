  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this double-blind randomized study is to assess the effects of an
      early, enhanced supply of the essential fatty acids (FAs) arachidonic acid (ARA) and
      docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on brain maturation, clinical outcomes and quality of growth in
      immature infants (gestational age &lt;29 weeks) as compared to standard nutrient supply.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind randomized study. 172 preterm infants with gestational age &lt; 29 weeks
      will be enrolled. The intervention group will receive enteral supplementation with essential
      fatty acids, arachidonic acid (ARA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). The control group will
      receive standard supplementation with medium-chain triglycerides (MCT-oil). The main
      hypothesis is that early, enhanced supply of ARA and DHA will improve brain growth and
      maturation, as compared to standard nutrient supply. Secondary hypotheses are that early,
      enhanced supply of ARA and DHA will improve quality of growth and cognitive development as
      well as reduce the frequency of inflammation-related neonatal comorbidities and long-term
      cardiovascular disease risk. Primary endpoint will be assessed by magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI) of the brain at term equivalent age.
