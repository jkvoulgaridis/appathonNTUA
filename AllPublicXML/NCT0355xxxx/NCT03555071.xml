      The study is a single-center, double-blind, randomized, bridging clinical trial. The purpose
      of this study is to evaluate the consistency between each two lots of live attenuated
      varicella vaccines, to evaluate the non-inferiority of the immunogenicity of live attenuated
      varicella vaccines manufactured at commercialized scale compared to trial-scale, and to
      evaluate the safety of live attenuated varicella vaccines. 1197 healthy Chinese children aged
      1 to 3 years old were randomly assigned into four groups in the ratio 2:2:2:1. Children in
      the first three groups were administered with one dose of live attenuated varicella vaccines
      manufactured at commercialized scale, and children in the last group were administered with
      one dose of live attenuated varicella vaccines manufactured at trial-scale .
