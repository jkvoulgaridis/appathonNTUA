  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare FFR measurements done with adenosine to FFR
      measurements done with contrast, where the contrast is injected using the ACIST CVi automated
      contrast injector.

      The ACCELERATION study will support a safer approach to FFR for patients by potentially
      reducing toxic drug exposure (adenosine). The 2 main objectives of the study are:

        1. Perform a methods comparison between cFFR and the reference standard aFFR, where cFFR is
           performed using an automated injector with a standardized volume and rate of delivery of
           contrast with known osmolality.

        2. Evaluate the association between final post-PCI FFR and long-term clinical outcomes. The
           long-term clinical outcomes will include TVR and composite MACE (death, MI, and TVR) at
           30 days and 1 year.

    <measure>Comparison Between Contrast Fractional Flow Reserves (cFFR) and Adenosine Fractional Flow Reserves (aFFR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects' aFFR measurement will be plotted on the x-axis, and their cFFR measurement will be plotted on the y-axis. The plot will be examined for highly influential points and heterogeneity of variance along the range of measurement values. In addition, several types of difference plots similar to the Bland-Altman plot will be used to examine whether the size of the variance changes with changing measurement value, the bias changes with changing measurement value and the coefficient of variation changes with changing measurement value. Then, the appropriate model will be applied to describe the relationship of aFFR measured values to their corresponding cFFR values</description>

    <measure>Qualitative Method Comparison Between Contrast Fractional Flow Reserves and Adenosine Fractional Flow Reserves</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The qualitative method comparison assesses the agreement as to which lesion is flow limiting. If a lesion has an adenosine FFR measurement the cutoff value of 0.8, then the lesion is considered flow limiting. Using the model developed above, the contrast FFR measurement that corresponds to adenosine FFR measurement value of 0.8 will be used as the cutoff value for determining whether a lesion is flow limiting for contrast FFR.</description>

    <measure>Assessment of the Relationship Between Post-Percutaneous Coronary Intervention Fractional Flow Reserves and Long-Term Clinical Outcomes</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>assesses whether there is a relationship between final PCI FFR (resting, dPR, cFFR, aFFR) and long-term outcomes (death, MI, TVR). The model will include the known covariates for predicting revascularization outcomes: stent length, vessel diameter, diabetes, history of cardiovascular disease, and multi-vessel disease.</description>

          1. Have the capacity to understand and sign an informed consent or have a legally
             authorized representative (LAR) that can understand and sign an informed consent prior
             to initial arteriotomy access

          2. Age &gt; 18 years of age at the time of signing the informed consent

          3. Clinically stable and undergoing non-emergent cardiac catheterization for appropriate
             indications
