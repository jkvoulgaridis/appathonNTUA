      Prospective, multicenter, non-randomized study.

      Primary endpoint : to confirm the proper functioning of the device in vivo by analyzing intra
      and interobserver reproducibility of repeated measurements on healthy controls.

      Secondary endpoint : to describe the values of pelvic inclination while standing, sitting and
      lying in patients with severe hip osteoarthritis before and after total hip arthroplasty

      After signing the inform consent form:

      For the first endpoint (, 3 healthy volunteers of different morphotypes will have one
      consultation comprising :

        -  a medical examination

        -  10 measurements of pelvic inclination in sitting position, 10 measurements of pelvic
           inclination in supine position and 10 measurements of pelvic inclination in standing
           position, each realized per three different operators. These measurements will be
           carried out with navigated ultrasound.

      For the secondary endpoint, 30 patients awaiting for a hip replacement surgical intervention
      will realized one consultation the day before the intervention, and one consultation at 2
      months after surgery, each comprising :

        -  a medical examination

        -  3 measurements of pelvic inclination (1 standing, 1 sitting and 1 supine). These
           measurements will be carried out with navigated ultrasound.
