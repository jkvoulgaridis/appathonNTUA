    <textblock>
      Concomitant interventions included lifestyle modification with a personally tailored program
      of diet as detailed below and physical activity adjusted for age and specific physical
      limitations, targeting engagement in physical activity of at least 150 minutes/week. Lipid
      lowering and or blood pressure lowering drugs were prescribed as needed according to
      guideline-assisted medical practice. Patients were seen by a physician every 3 month. The
      dietitian had a weekly meeting with the patients for the first three months, every other week
      during months 4-6, once a month during month 7-9 and every 6 weeks during the last three
      months of the study.

    <description>BMI is calculated as weight in Kg divided by height in meters X height in meters. Percent change will be calculated as the difference in BMI units (kg/m2) between the final BMI and the initial BMI, divided by the initial BMI, multiplied by 100%.</description>

    <description>Nutritional recommendation consisted of moderate caloric restriction, set at 25% to 30% less than calories needed for resting metabolic rate. We applied a high protein Mediterranean diet with the following food group distribution: 30% as protein (&gt; 0.8 g/kg/d); 40% as carbohydrates with medium/low glycemic index; 30% as fat (≥10%monounsaturated fatty acid, ≤7% saturated fatty acid, no trans fats, and 1.6 g omega-3 for men and 1.1 g omega-3 for women). Diet was rich in olive oil, fish, chicken, nuts, white milk products, fruits, and vegetables but low in artificial sugars, commercial sweets, pastries, butter, margarine, and red meat. Dietary fiber content ≥25 g/day</description>
