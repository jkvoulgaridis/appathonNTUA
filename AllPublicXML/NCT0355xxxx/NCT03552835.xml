    <textblock>
      This study evaluated and compared the efficacy of no caries removal and sealing with a
      well-adapted and crimped stainless steel crown verses selective caries removal upto soft
      dentin and upto firm dentin in healing and/or preventing progression of moderate to deep
      occlusal dentinal caries.

    <textblock>
      Dental caries is a complex multifactorial disease and is one of the most prevalent diseases
      throughout history. It can cost a lot of money to treat and causes infection, pain and the
      loss of teeth. Choices for managing a carious lesion cover a spectrum of optionsâ€”from
      complete surgical excision, where no part of the visible carious tissue is left in the tooth
      before a restoration is placed, to the opposite extreme, where none of the carious tissue is
      removed and noninvasive methods are used to prevent progression of the lesion. Thus, this
      study compared efficacy of no caries removal and sealing the entire lesion verses partial
      selective caries removal to soft and to firm dentin in healing and/or preventing progression
      of moderate to deep occlusal dentinal caries in previously unrestored teeth by clinical and
      radiographic analysis in 4-7 year old children.
