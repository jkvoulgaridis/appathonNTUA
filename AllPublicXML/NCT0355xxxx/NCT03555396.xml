  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The fastest growing HIV epidemics globally are driven by injection drug use, but only a small
      percentage of HIV-positive people who inject drugs (PWID) have achieved viral suppression.
      The proposed project will adapt a couple-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence
      intervention for PWID and assess the feasibility and acceptability of conducting dried blood
      spot testing to objectively measure ART adherence as part of an intervention in a clinical
      setting. This project advances HIV intervention science by providing an intervention that
      leverages social support within the dyad to improve ART adherence among PWID, which could
      lead to increased viral suppression, thus decreasing HIV transmission and HIV-related
      morbidity and mortality.

      The purpose of this Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) is to provide the
      candidate with the training and expertise needed to transition to research independence in
      the science of HIV prevention and intervention. The fastest growing HIV epidemics globally
      are driven by injection drug use. Central Asia has some of the highest rates of injection
      drug use and one of the fastest growing HIV epidemics in the world. HIV-positive people who
      inject drugs (PWID) face many barriers to antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence, such as
      misperceptions about ART, stigma and substance use. Previous research among this population
      has shown that couple-based HIV interventions are highly efficacious at reducing risk
      behaviors, but there is currently no couple-based ART adherence intervention for PWID. The
      research aims of this proposal are to 1) identify core components of the SMART Couples
      intervention and other existing ART adherence intervention strategies and assess their
      appropriateness and feasibility as an integrated, couple-based ART adherence intervention for
      HIV+ PWID living in Kazakhstan (Phase 1); 2) adapt and refine SMART Couples and identify
      augmentative intervention strategies to create an integrated, couple-based ART adherence
      intervention for HIV+ PWID and their primary sex partners using results from Aim 1 (Phase 2);
      and 3a) pilot test the resulting couple-based intervention among 66 heterosexual PWID couples
      in Kazakhstan through a randomized control trial to assess the safety, feasibility, and
      acceptability of the intervention and obtain preliminary estimates of adherence outcomes in
      the intervention arm versus standard of care; and 3b) assess the feasibility and
      acceptability of conducting dried blood spot testing as part of an adherence intervention in
      a clinical setting (Phase 3). The proposed career development plan has been designed to
      augment the candidate's current training in epidemiology and enable her to 1) gain research
      skills in the design and adaptation of HIV interventions, with an emphasis on adherence among
      marginalized populations; 2) obtain methodological expertise in dyad and intensive
      longitudinal analysis and the triangulation of behavioral, biomedical, and technological
      data, particularly for the purposes of interpreting and analyzing these types of data to
      assess intervention efficacy and measure ART adherence; 3) acquire training in the conduct
      and analysis of qualitative in-depth interviews and focus groups, particularly for designing
      and adapting HIV interventions and assessing intervention feasibility and acceptability; and
      4) increase professional skills for a successful independent research career. These training
      goals will be achieved through a combination of didactic courses, specialized workshops and
      seminars, hands-on research, and an interdisciplinary team of experts. The research findings
      and methodological skills to be gained from this K01 have wide applicability for disease
      research and high transferability across diverse research settings.
