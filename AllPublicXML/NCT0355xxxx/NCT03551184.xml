  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this randomized double blind study, 52 healthy participants were injected with either 0.6
      ng/kg body weight or placebo to test if changes in pain sensitivity is associated with change
      in neural activity using BOLD MR scanning.

    <textblock>
      52 healthy participants were included in this randomized double blind study. Participants
      were injected once, and randomized to injection with with the active component or placebo.
      Participants were recruited by advertising and screened through questionnaires and a health
      examination by a physician. They were asked not to engage in strenuous physical activities,
      sleep regular hours and refrain from alcohol the day before the experiment. If the
      participants felt ill, e.g. coming down with a cold, they were instructed to call and were
      rescheduled for a later appointment. C-reactive protein (CRP) was assessed to exclude
      participants having an ongoing infection on the experimental day. Pregnancy was also an
      exclusion criteria and a pregnancy test was administered for all female participants on
      arrival. Pain sensitivity measures were tested at baseline and at peak inflammatory response
      1-2 hours after injection. Both deep and cutaneous pain at threshold and suprathreshold
      noxious levels were tested. Heat- and cold (cutaneous) pain sensitivity was assessed for
      threshold stimuli and intense noxious stimuli, as well as pressure (deep) pain thresholds and
      CPM (descending pain inhibition). These tests were conducted while the participants were in
      the MR-scanner to investigate neural correlates to change in pain sensitivity. Subjects
      filled out questionnaires at baseline, 90 minutes, 3.5 and 5 hours after injection.
