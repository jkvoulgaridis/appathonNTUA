      The aim of the present study is to compare the antidepressant effect of low frequency rTMS
      applied over the right temporal cortex with sham stimulation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TMS complies focal stimulation of the brain through a time varying magnetic field. Clinical
      controlled trials indicate that rTMS of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex may have an
      antidepressant effect and no serious side effects. Several clinical controlled studies
      investigating the antidepressant effect of low as well as high frequency rTMS of the right
      and left prefrontal cortex have been carried out with varying results.Research on the issue
      suffer from small and selected study populations.There is a need for additional clinical
      controlled studies on larger samples and methodological investigations to clarify what is the
      optimal stimulus design for the treatment of depressed patients.

      Recent research indicates that Depression is associated with an increased metabolic activity
      of subcortical areas especially the right hippocampus of the brain.

      Remission of depression symptoms is associated with normalisation of the described
      subcortical hyperactivity.

      Low frequency rTMS has shown to be associated with sustained reduction in neuronal activity.

      There may be an association between the activity decreasing effect of low frequency rTMS and
      reduction in psychiatric symptoms.

      The investigators want to test the hypothesis that low frequency rTMS of the right temporal
      subcortical areas (Hippocampus and and the parahippocampal part of CNS) may perform an
      antidepressant effect by normalizing the described hyperactivity of the subcortical areas in
      depressed patients.

      In addition the investigators want to test whether blood concentration of Brain Derived
      Neurotropic Factor( BDNF), the BDNF-genotype and saliva cortisol may be of predictive value
      in depressed patients.
