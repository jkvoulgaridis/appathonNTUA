  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently there are 2 popular stress reduction courses that are widely used in the US.
      Although they use somewhat similar techniques, it is currently unknown whether or not they
      work the same way, or if they are similarly effective at reducing stress. The study will
      directly compare these 2 courses. Participants will undergo approximately 4-5 hours of
      testing before and after each 8-week course.

    <measure>Brain Activity (fMRI) During the Body Scan Meditation</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Seed based functional connectivity analysis was performed using the Connectivity Toolbox (CONN) implemented within the Statistical Parametric Mapping program (SPM8; Welcome Department of Cognitive Neurology). Our seeds were located in the right inferior frontal gyrus pars opercularis (MNI coordinates: 54, 14, 16) and the dorsal anterior insula (MNI coordinates: 32, 20, 0). Note - MRI data from some subjects was either missing, not collected, or corrupted, and so the analyses were performed on just the subject of subjects who had complete datasets. This assessment reflects the total number of voxels per group.</description>

    <measure>Anxiety Severity Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>the Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI) is a measure of individuals discomfort with a variety of sensations associated with anxiety and panic and tends to be substantially higher in those with panic disorder (and attacks) than in those with General Anxiety Disorder. Scores range from 0 - 64. Lower scores mean lower anxiety.</description>
