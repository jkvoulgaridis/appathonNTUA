    <textblock>
      This protocol posting deals with objectives &amp; outcome measures of the extension phase up to
      48-50 months post booster vaccination, to assess long-term antibody persistence in children
      at around 30, 42 and 66 months of age, who received previously 4 doses of pneumococcal
      conjugate vaccine. The objectives &amp; outcome measures of the primary phase are presented in a
      separate protocol posting (NCT number = 00307554). This Protocol posting has been updated in
      order to comply with the FDA AA (Sep 2007).

      <recruitment_details>Primed groups included Synflorix vaccinated subjects in study 10PN-PD-DIT-007. The Unprimed Group, added only in Year 4,included subjects unprimed with any pneumococcal vaccine age-matched with primed groups. The study included 3 sub-studies (111345, 111346, 111347) corresponding to Year 1, 2 and 4 time points post Dose 1 in Study 10PN-PD-DIT-001.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>At screening, subjects with previous participation in 10PN-PD-DIT-007 study were invited to join this study. Informed consent was obtained and signed from subjects’ parents/guardians, check for inclusion/exclusion criteria and contraindications/precautions was performed, and medical history of subjects was collected.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Number of Subjects With Anti-vaccine Pneumococcal Serotypes Antibody Concentrations Greater Than or Equal to (≥) the Cut-off [Follow-up Period: Persistence Analysis in Year 1 (111345 Sub-study)]</title>
        <description>A seropositive subject was a subject whose antibody concentration was greater than or equal to (≥) the cut-off value. Analysis was performed using the 22F-inhibition Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), using 0.05 microgram per milliliter (µg/mL) as seropositivity cut off.</description>

            <description>This group consisted of subjects primed with Synflorix vaccine in the 10PN-PD-DIT-001 (1105553) and 007 (107046) studies. In 105553 study, subjects had been primed with 3 doses of Synflorix vaccine at 2, 3 and 4 months of age co-administered with Infanrix related vaccines. In 107046 study, subjects had received a booster dose of Synflorix vaccine at 12-18 months of age co-administered with Infanrix hexa vaccine. In this study, in the Year 4 (111347 study), subjects received at Month 48 (4 years post Dose 1 in study 105553) one additional dose of Synflorix vaccine. In addition, subjects were also offered vaccination against hepatitis A (2 doses of Havrix) and/or against varicella (a single dose of Varilrix).</description>

        <description>A seropositive subject was a subject whose antibody concentration was greater than or equal to (≥) the cut-off value. Analysis was performed using the 22F-inhibition Enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), using 0.05 μg/mL as seropositivity cut off.</description>
        <time_frame>At Year 2 (Y2) (post booster vaccination administered in study 10PN-PD-DIT-007)</time_frame>
        <population>The ATP cohort for persistence included all primed subjects from the Total enrolled cohort who had not received a vaccine or product forbidden in the protocol and for whom assay results available for the antibodies against at least one vaccine antigen component for the blood sampling taken at Year 2.</population>

            <description>This group consisted of subjects primed with Synflorix vaccine in the 10PN-PD-DIT-001 (1105553) and 007 (107046) studies. In 105553 study, subjects had been primed with 3 doses of Synflorix vaccine at 2, 3 and 4 months of age co-administered with Infanrix related vaccines. In 107046 study, subjects had received a booster dose of Synflorix vaccine at 12-18 months of age co-administered with Infanrix hexa vaccine. In this study, in the Year 4 (111347 study), subjects received at Month 48 (4 years post Dose 1 in study 105553) one additional dose of Synflorix vaccine. In addition, subjects were also offered vaccination against hepatitis A (2 doses of Havrix) and/or against varicella (a single dose of Varilrix).</description>

In 105553 study, subjects had been primed with 3 doses of Synflorix vaccine at 2, 3 and 4 months of age co-administered with Infanrix related vaccines. In 107046 study, subjects had received a booster dose of Synflorix vaccine at 12-18 months of age co-administered with Infanrix hexa vaccine. In this study, in the Year 4 (111347 study), subjects received at Month 48 (4 years post Dose 1 in study 105553) one additional dose of Synflorix vaccine. In addition, subjects were also offered vaccination against hepatitis A (2 doses of Havrix) and/or against varicella (a single dose of Varilrix).</description>

        <title>Antibody Concentrations Against Pneumococcal Serotypes [Follow-Up Period: Persistence Analysis in Year 1 (111345 Sub-study)]</title>
        <description>Pneumococcal serotypes assessed were 1, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F. Antibody concentrations against pneumococcal serotypes were determined as Geometric Mean Antibody Concentrations (GMC) and expressed as micro grams per milliliter (µg/mL).The seropositivity cut-off for the assay was ≥ 0.05 µg/mL.</description>
        <time_frame>At Year 1 (Y1) (post booster vaccination administered in study 10PN-PD-DIT-007)</time_frame>
        <population>The ATP cohort for persistence included all primed subjects from the Total enrolled cohort who had not received a vaccine or product forbidden in the protocol and for whom assay results available for the antibodies against at least one vaccine antigen component for the blood sampling taken at Year 1.</population>

            <description>This group consisted of subjects primed with Synflorix vaccine in the 10PN-PD-DIT-001 (1105553) and 007 (107046) studies. In 105553 study, subjects had been primed with 3 doses of Synflorix vaccine at 2, 3 and 4 months of age co-administered with Infanrix related vaccines. In 107046 study, subjects had received a booster dose of Synflorix vaccine at 12-18 months of age co-administered with Infanrix hexa vaccine. In this study, in the Year 4 (111347 study), subjects received at Month 48 (4 years post Dose 1 in study 105553) one additional dose of Synflorix vaccine. In addition, subjects were also offered vaccination against hepatitis A (2 doses of Havrix) and/or against varicella (a single dose of Varilrix).</description>

        <title>Antibody Concentrations Against Pneumococcal Serotypes [Follow-Up Period: Persistence Analysis in Year 2 (111346 Sub-study)]</title>
        <description>Pneumococcal serotypes assessed were 1, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F. Antibody concentrations against pneumococcal serotypes were determined as Geometric Mean Antibody Concentrations (GMC) and expressed as micro grams per milliliter (µg/mL). The seropositivity cut-off for the assay was ≥ 0.05 µg/mL.</description>

            <description>This group consisted of subjects primed with Synflorix vaccine in the 10PN-PD-DIT-001 (1105553) and 007 (107046) studies. In 105553 study, subjects had been primed with 3 doses of Synflorix vaccine at 2, 3 and 4 months of age co-administered with Infanrix related vaccines. In 107046 study, subjects had received a booster dose of Synflorix vaccine at 12-18 months of age co-administered with Infanrix hexa vaccine. In this study, in the Year 4 (111347 study), subjects received at Month 48 (4 years post Dose 1 in study 105553) one additional dose of Synflorix vaccine. In addition, subjects were also offered vaccination against hepatitis A (2 doses of Havrix) and/or against varicella (a single dose of Varilrix).</description>

        <title>Antibody Concentrations Against Pneumococcal Serotypes [Follow-up Period: Persistence Analysis in Year 4 (111347 Sub-study)]</title>
        <description>Pneumococcal serotypes assessed were serotypes 1, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F. Antibody concentrations against pneumococcal serotypes were determined as Geometric Mean Antibody Concentrations (GMC) and expressed as micro grams per milliliter (µg/mL). The seropositivity cut-off for the assay was ≥ 0.05 μg/mL.</description>
        <time_frame>At Year 4 (Y4) (post booster vaccination administered in study 10PN-PDDIT- 007)</time_frame>
        <population>The ATP cohort for persistence included all primed subjects from the Total enrolled cohort who had not received a vaccine or product forbidden in the protocol and for whom assay results available for the antibodies against at least one vaccine antigen component for the blood sampling taken at Year 4.</population>

            <description>This group consisted of subjects primed with Synflorix vaccine in the 10PN-PD-DIT-001 (1105553) and 007 (107046) studies. In 105553 study, subjects had been primed with 3 doses of Synflorix vaccine at 2, 3 and 4 months of age co-administered with Infanrix related vaccines. In 107046 study, subjects had received a booster dose of Synflorix vaccine at 12-18 months of age co-administered with Infanrix hexa vaccine. In this study, in the Year 4 (111347 study), subjects received at Month 48 (4 years post Dose 1 in study 105553) one additional dose of Synflorix vaccine. In addition, subjects were also offered vaccination against hepatitis A (2 doses of Havrix) and/or against varicella (a single dose of Varilrix).</description>

        <title>Antibody Concentrations Against Pneumococcal Serotypes [Follow-up Period: Immunogenicity Analysis in Year 4 (111347 Sub-study)]</title>
        <description>Anti-pneumococcal serotypes assessed were serotypes 1, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F . Antibody concentrations against pneumococcal serotypes were determined as Geometric Mean Antibody Concentrations (GMC) and expressed as micro grams per milliliter (µg/mL). The seropositivity cut-off for the assay was ≥ 0.05 μg/mL.</description>
        <time_frame>For primed groups: At Month 48+7 days after additional dose (D7);For unprimed group: at Day 0 (D0) (Pre-vaccination [PRE]), at Day 7 (D7) post dose 1 (of the 2-dose catch-up vaccination) and at Month 3 (M3) post dose 2 (of the 2-dose catch-up vaccination)</time_frame>
        <population>The ATP cohort for immunogenicity included all evaluable subjects for whom assay results were available for antibodies against at least one vaccine antigen component for blood samples taken 7 days after additional dose (primed subjects) or at pre-vaccination, 7 days post-dose 1, and 1-month post-dose 2 catch-up vaccination (unprimed subjects).</population>

In 105553 study, subjects had been primed with 3 doses of Synflorix vaccine at 2, 3 and 4 months of age co-administered with Infanrix related vaccines. In 107046 study, subjects had received a booster dose of Synflorix vaccine at 12-18 months of age co-administered with Infanrix hexa vaccine. In this study, in the Year 4 (111347 study), subjects received at Month 48 (4 years post Dose 1 in study 105553) one additional dose of Synflorix vaccine. In addition, subjects were also offered vaccination against hepatitis A (2 doses of Havrix) and/or against varicella (a single dose of Varilrix).</description>

        <description>Pneumococcal serotypes assessed were OPA-1, OPA-4, OPA-5, OPA-6B, OPA-7F, OPA-9V, OPA-14, OPA-18C, OPA-19F and OPA-23F. The seropositivity cut-off for the assay was ≥ 8. Opsonophagocytic activity was expressed as Geometric Mean Antibody Titers (GMT).</description>
        <time_frame>For primed groups: At Month 48+7 days after additional dose (D7);For unprimed group: at Day 0 (D0) (Pre-vaccination [PRE]), at Day 7 (D7) post dose 1 (of the 2-dose catch-up vaccination) and at Month 3 (M3) post dose 2 (of the 2-dose catch-up vaccination)</time_frame>
        <population>The ATP cohort for immunogenicity included all evaluable subjects for whom assay results were available for antibodies against at least one vaccine antigen component for blood samples taken 7 days after additional dose (primed subjects) or at pre-vaccination, 7 days post-dose 1, and 1-month post-dose 2 catch-up vaccination (unprimed subjects).</population>

          <description>Pneumococcal serotypes assessed were OPA-1, OPA-4, OPA-5, OPA-6B, OPA-7F, OPA-9V, OPA-14, OPA-18C, OPA-19F and OPA-23F. The seropositivity cut-off for the assay was ≥ 8. Opsonophagocytic activity was expressed as Geometric Mean Antibody Titers (GMT).</description>
          <population>The ATP cohort for immunogenicity included all evaluable subjects for whom assay results were available for antibodies against at least one vaccine antigen component for blood samples taken 7 days after additional dose (primed subjects) or at pre-vaccination, 7 days post-dose 1, and 1-month post-dose 2 catch-up vaccination (unprimed subjects).</population>

        <description>Solicited general symptoms assessed were drowsiness, irritability, loss of appetite and fever (any fever defined as temperature by axillary measurement of 37.5°C and above). Grade 3 drowsiness was defined as drowsiness that prevented normal activity; Grade 3 irritability was defined as crying that could not be comforted/prevented normal activity. Grade 3 loss of appetite was defined as subject not eating at all. Grade 3 fever was defined as axillary temperature &gt;39.5°C. Related AE was defined as any AE assessed by investigators to be causally related to administration of the study vaccine. Follow-up period was of 4 days (Days 0-3) after Synflorix vaccination in Year 4 Persistence and Immunological Memory 111347 Study, thus one period of 4 days for primed subjects and 2 periods of 4 days for unprimed subjects.</description>

          <title>Number of Subjects Reported With Solicited General Symptoms</title>
          <description>Solicited general symptoms assessed were drowsiness, irritability, loss of appetite and fever (any fever defined as temperature by axillary measurement of 37.5°C and above). Grade 3 drowsiness was defined as drowsiness that prevented normal activity; Grade 3 irritability was defined as crying that could not be comforted/prevented normal activity. Grade 3 loss of appetite was defined as subject not eating at all. Grade 3 fever was defined as axillary temperature &gt;39.5°C. Related AE was defined as any AE assessed by investigators to be causally related to administration of the study vaccine. Follow-up period was of 4 days (Days 0-3) after Synflorix vaccination in Year 4 Persistence and Immunological Memory 111347 Study, thus one period of 4 days for primed subjects and 2 periods of 4 days for unprimed subjects.</description>
          <population>The analyses were performed on the Total Vaccinated Cohort (TVC) which included all vaccinated subjects. The TVC for analysis of safety included all primed subjects with additional vaccine dose administration documented and all unprimed subjects with at least one vaccine dose administration documented.</population>

        <title>Number of Seropositive Subjects for Opsophagocytic Activity Against Pneumococcal Serotypes [Follow-up Period: Immunogenicity Analysis in Year 4 (111347 Sub-study)]</title>
        <description>A seropositive subject was a subject whose antibody concentration was greater than or equal to (≥) the cut-off value. Pneumococcal serotypes assessed were 1, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F. Analysis was performed with Unprimed group included. The seropositivity cut-off for the assay was 8.</description>
        <time_frame>For primed groups: At Month 48+7 days after additional dose (D7);For unprimed group: at Day 0 (D0) (Pre-vaccination [PRE]), at Day 7 (D7) post dose 1 (of the 2-dose catch-up vaccination) and at Month 3 (M3) post dose 2 (of the 2-dose catch-up vaccination)</time_frame>
        <population>The ATP cohort for immunogenicity included all evaluable subjects for whom assay results were available for antibodies against at least one vaccine antigen component for blood samples taken 7 days after additional dose (primed subjects) or at pre-vaccination, 7 days post-dose 1, and 1-month post-dose 2 catch-up vaccination (unprimed subjects).</population>

In 105553 study, subjects had been primed with 3 doses of Synflorix vaccine at 2, 3 and 4 months of age co-administered with Infanrix related vaccines. In 107046 study, subjects had received a booster dose of Synflorix vaccine at 12-18 months of age co-administered with Infanrix hexa vaccine. In this study, in the Year 4 (111347 study), subjects received at Month 48 (4 years post Dose 1 in study 105553) one additional dose of Synflorix vaccine. In addition, subjects were also offered vaccination against hepatitis A (2 doses of Havrix) and/or against varicella (a single dose of Varilrix).</description>

        <title>Number of Seropositive Subjects for Anti-pneumococcal Cross-reactive Serotypes 6A and 19A [Follow-up Period: Immunogenicity Analysis in Year 4 (111347 Sub-study)]</title>
        <description>A seropositive subject was a subject whose antibody concentration was greater than or equal to (≥) the cut-off value. Pneumococcal serotypes assessed were 6A and 19A. The immune responses were measured by 22F-inhibition ELISA. The seropositivity cut-off for the assay was 0.05 μg/mL.</description>
        <time_frame>For primed groups: At Month 48+7 days after additional dose (D7);For unprimed group: at Day 0 (D0) (Pre-vaccination [PRE]), at Day 7 (D7) post dose 1 (of the 2-dose catch-up vaccination) and at Month 3 (M3) post dose 2 (of the 2-dose catch-up vaccination)</time_frame>
        <population>The ATP cohort for immunogenicity included all evaluable subjects for whom assay results were available for antibodies against at least one vaccine antigen component for blood samples taken 7 days after additional dose (primed subjects) or at pre-vaccination, 7 days post-dose 1, and 1-month post-dose 2 catch-up vaccination (unprimed subjects).</population>

Subjects were not previously vaccinated with any pneumococcal vaccine and received 2 doses of Synflorix vaccine at 64-68 and 66-70 months of age (at Day 0 and Month 2).
The Unprimed Group was added only in Year 4 of the study.</description>

          <description>A seropositive subject was a subject whose antibody concentration was greater than or equal to (≥) the cut-off value. Pneumococcal serotypes assessed were 6A and 19A. The immune responses were measured by Opsonophagocytic Activity (OPA). The seropositivity cut-off for the assay was 8.</description>
          <population>The ATP cohort for immunogenicity included all evaluable subjects for whom assay results were available for antibodies against at least one vaccine antigen component for blood samples taken 7 days after additional dose (primed subjects) or at pre-vaccination, 7 days post-dose 1, and 1-month post-dose 2 catch-up vaccination (unprimed subjects).</population>

      <time_frame>Solicited and Unsolicited AEs: within 4 days (Days 0-3) and 31 days (Days 0-30) post Synflorix vaccination in 111347 sub-study for all subjects. SAEs related to study procedure were collected at Year 1 post booster vaccination in sub-study 111345 and from Year 2 up to Year 4 follow-up period in sub-study 111346-111347 for primed subjects. Any SAEs were collected during the vaccination period in the 111347 study (i.e. from Month 48-49 for primed subjects and from Month 0-3 for unprimed subjects).</time_frame>

          <description>This group consisted of subjects primed with Synflorix vaccine in the 10PN-PD-DIT-001 (1105553) and 007 (107046) studies. In 105553 study, subjects had been primed with 3 doses of Synflorix vaccine at 2, 3 and 4 months of age co-administered with Infanrix related vaccines. In 107046 study, subjects had received a booster dose of Synflorix vaccine at 12-18 months of age co-administered with Infanrix hexa vaccine. In this study, in the Year 4 (111347 study), subjects received at Month 48 (4 years post Dose 1 in study 105553) one additional dose of Synflorix vaccine. In addition, subjects were also offered vaccination against hepatitis A (2 doses of Havrix) and/or against varicella (a single dose of Varilrix).</description>
