      To determine the pharmacokinetic profile of IV (intravenous) and PO (oral) formulations of
      linezolid among children with cystic fibrosis and establish a dose regimen that will be safe
      and effective.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with cystic fibrosis who have pulmonary exacerbations associated with the isolation
      of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in their sputum will be identified by
      their primary physicians and by laboratory record review. If they meet the inclusion
      criteria, they will be invited to participate in the study. The primary outcome variables
      include pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic indices. The study end points include completion
      of the sputum and blood sampling for pharmacokinetic studies of both intravenous and oral
      formulations of linezolid and collection of microbiologic specimen (sputum and anterior nares
      cultures) one month after discharge. Additionally, pharmacokinetic data will be analyzed for
      effects of age and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) mutation on
      clearance of linezolid and for relationship between levels of linezolid achieved in sputum
      and blood and clinical outcome

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects &lt; 18 years of age inclusive, with a confirmed diagnosis of cystic fibrosis
             being admitted to the hospital for acute pulmonary exacerbation with MRSA isolated
             from sputum culture.

          -  Female subject of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test prior to
             the first dose of study drug, and if sexually active agrees to use an acceptable
             method of birth control per investigator judgment for the duration of the study.

          -  Subjects who are receiving medications with serotonergic (such as certain types of
             antidepressants) and adrenergic activity that can not be discontinued based on
             clinical judgment of the primary physician may be enrolled. These subjects will be
             monitored closely for serotonin- and sympathomimetic-associated toxicity.

          -  Subject (when able) and subject's parent /legal guardian agree to comply with the
             study requirements.

          -  Subject has sufficient venous access to permit administration of the study medication,
             collection of pharmacokinetic samples and monitoring of safety variables.

          -  Duration of linezolid therapy is expected to exceed 7 days.

          -  English and Spanish-speaking subjects.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with clinical or laboratory evidence of severe hepatic (Child-Pugh class C)
             disease

          -  Subjects with severe renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance &lt;30 mL/min)

          -  Subjects with a history of allergy to linezolid.

          -  Pregnant and breastfeeding subjects.
