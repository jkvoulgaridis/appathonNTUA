      The purpose of this study is to develop a technique for the intraoperative identification of
      human functional and epileptiform cortex using intrinsic signal imaging. The investigators
      propose that the ability to optically monitor neuronal activity in a large area of cortex in
      &quot;real-time&quot; will be a more sensitive and time-saving method than the electrical methods
      currently available. The applications of this technique will not only theoretically increase
      the safety and efficacy of many of neurosurgical procedures, but will be useful as an
      investigational tool to study human cortical physiology.

      Epilepsy is a disease affecting 1-2% of the population. Currently, the only known cure for
      epilepsy is surgery, which is much more effective at eliminating seizures arising from the
      medial temporal lobe compared with the neocortex. The problem with neocortical epilepsy is
      that the population of neurons underlying each epileptiform discharge varies over time. In
      addition, the spatial relationship between interictal events and the ictal onset zones, which
      are critical in defining the region of epileptogenesis, is not well understood and essential
      to the surgical treatment of epilepsy. Electrophysiological recording methods, although
      currently the &quot;gold standard&quot; in mapping epilepsy, are inadequate to address these questions
      based on restrictions due to volume conduction or sampling limitations. Optical recording
      techniques can overcome many of these limitations by sampling large areas of cortex
      simultaneously to provide information about blood flow, metabolism and extracellular fluid
      shifts that are intimately related to excitatory and inhibitory neuronal activity. In fact,
      optical recordings may actually be more sensitive to certain aspects of epileptic activity
      than electrophysiologic recordings. The goal will be to translate these findings into the
      operating room and map human neocortical epilepsy with the same optical techniques. Outcome
      following surgical resections to treat neocortical epilepsy will be correlated with the
      optical maps to determine the utility of intrinsic signal imaging in guiding brain surgery.
      These experiments will set the groundwork for implementing optical recordings in general
      clinical practice as a novel technique for mapping and predicting human seizures.
