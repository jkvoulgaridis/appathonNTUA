    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>The study was planned on 406 male or female participants infected with Human immunodeficiency type 1 (HIV-1) virus, aged 18 years or older, across 15 centres in the United States and at 1 site in Canada from 21 July 2005 to 11 September 2007. Study was early terminated prior to the completion of enrollment.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 24 participants comprised All Randomized Subject Population who were randomized in a ratio of 1:1 to GW873140 (aplaviroc [APL])+optimized background therapy (OBT) and placebo+OBT. Intent-to Treat (ITT) Population was n=24, used for all analysis.</pre_assignment_details>
      <group_list>
        <group group_id="P1">
          <title>APL + OBT</title>
          <description>Participants were administered APL tablets orally as 400 milligram (mg) twice daily (BID) for 48 Weeks. Each dose was to be given with food. The OBT regimen was chosen by the investigator prior to randomization, based on the participant’s prior treatment history, screening genotypic and phenotypic resistance testing results, and any prior resistance testing results if available. The drugs in the OBT regimen was chosen from the locally available ART and consisted between three and six drugs, one of which was ritonavir (RTV)- boosted protease inhibitor (PI). Low-dose RTV did not count as one of the OBT regimen drugs and RTV doses of &gt;400 mg/day were not permitted. Fixed dose combination tablets (FDC) was counted according to the number of compounds making up the FDC (e.g., combivir counted as two drugs [lamivudine and zidovudine], trizivir counted as three drugs, etc.). Kaletra (lopinavir [LPV]/RTV) was counted as one drug.</description>

          <description>Participants were administered matching placebo to APL tablets orally as 400 mg BID for 48 Weeks. Each dose was to be given with food. The OBT regimen was chosen by the investigator prior to randomization, based on the participant’s prior treatment history, screening genotypic and phenotypic resistance testing results, and any prior resistance testing results if available. The drugs in the OBT regimen was chosen from the locally available ART and consisted between three and six drugs, one of which was ritonavir (RTV)- boosted protease inhibitor (PI). Low-dose RTV did not count as one of the OBT regimen drugs and RTV doses of &gt;400 mg/day were not permitted. Fixed dose combination tablets (FDC) was counted according to the number of compounds making up the FDC (e.g., combivir counted as two drugs [lamivudine and zidovudine], trizivir counted as three drugs, etc.). Kaletra (lopinavir [LPV]/RTV) was counted as one drug.</description>

        <description>The area under the plasma HIV-1 RNA curve (AUC) was computed using the trapezoidal rule for all assessments (scheduled and unscheduled) at their actual time points. Baseline was defined as the mean of the Baseline (Day 1) and pre-treatment visit values. Participants without a Baseline assessment was removed from the analysis. The AAUCMB was computed by the AUC divided by the duration of the profile (i.e., the number of days on randomized therapy) minus the Baseline measurement.

        <description>The participants with treatment emergent toxicities of laboratory abnormalities for chemistry data is reported . Participants with toxicities were categorized according to the division of AIDS (DAIDS) toxicity grading scale. Scale ranges from grade 1(mild)=symptoms causing no or minimal interference with usual social &amp; functional activities, grade 2 (moderate)=symptoms causing greater than minimal interference with usual social &amp; functional activities, grade 3 (severe)=symptoms causing inability to perform usual social &amp; functional activities and grade 4 (potentially life threatening)=symptoms causing inability to perform basic self-care functions or medical or operative intervention indicated to prevent permanent impairment, persistent disability, or death. Scale ranges from 1-4, where higher grade reflects greater severity of symptoms. Baseline was defined as assessments done at Day 1. Only those parameters for which at least one value of toxicity grade was reported are summarized.</description>

Scale ranges from grade 1(mild)=symptoms causing no or minimal interference with usual social &amp; functional activities, grade 2 (moderate)=symptoms causing greater than minimal interference with usual social &amp; functional activities, grade 3 (severe)=symptoms causing inability to perform usual social &amp; functional activities and grade 4 (potentially life threatening)=symptoms causing inability to perform basic self-care functions or medical or operative intervention indicated to prevent permanent impairment, persistent disability, or death. Scale ranges from 1-4, where higher grade reflects greater severity of symptoms. Baseline was defined as assessments done at Day 1. Only those parameters for which at least one value of toxicity grade was reported are summarized.</description>

            <description>Participants were administered APL tablets orally as 400 mg BID for 48 Weeks. Each dose was to be given with food. The OBT regimen was chosen by the investigator prior to randomization, based on the participant’s prior treatment history, screening genotypic and phenotypic resistance testing results, and any prior resistance testing results if available. The drugs in the OBT regimen was chosen from the locally available ART and consisted between three and six drugs, one of which was RTV-boosted PI. Low-dose RTV did not count as one of the OBT regimen drugs and RTV doses of &gt;400 mg/day were not permitted. FDC was counted according to the number of compounds making up the FDC (e.g., combivir counted as two drugs [lamivudine and zidovudine], trizivir counted as three drugs, etc.). Kaletra (LPV/RTV) was counted as one drug.</description>

        <description>Assessment was performed at Day 1, Week 12 and Week 24. Baseline was defined as the assessments done at Day 1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the individual post-Baseline (Week 12 and 24) values.</description>

            <description>Participants were administered APL tablets orally as 400 mg BID for 48 Weeks. Each dose was to be given with food. The OBT regimen was chosen by the investigator prior to randomization, based on the participant’s prior treatment history, screening genotypic and phenotypic resistance testing results, and any prior resistance testing results if available. The drugs in the OBT regimen was chosen from the locally available ART and consisted between three and six drugs, one of which was RTV-boosted PI. Low-dose RTV did not count as one of the OBT regimen drugs and RTV doses of &gt;400 mg/day were not permitted. FDC was counted according to the number of compounds making up the FDC (e.g., combivir counted as two drugs [lamivudine and zidovudine], trizivir counted as three drugs, etc.). Kaletra (LPV/RTV) was counted as one drug.</description>

            <description>Participants were administered APL tablets orally as 400 mg BID for 48 Weeks. Each dose was to be given with food. The OBT regimen was chosen by the investigator prior to randomization, based on the participant’s prior treatment history, screening genotypic and phenotypic resistance testing results, and any prior resistance testing results if available. The drugs in the OBT regimen was chosen from the locally available ART and consisted between three and six drugs, one of which was RTV-boosted PI. Low-dose RTV did not count as one of the OBT regimen drugs and RTV doses of &gt;400 mg/day were not permitted. FDC was counted according to the number of compounds making up the FDC (e.g., combivir counted as two drugs [lamivudine and zidovudine], trizivir counted as three drugs, etc.). Kaletra (LPV/RTV) was counted as one drug.</description>

            <description>Participants were administered matching placebo to APL tablets orally as 400 mg BID for 48 Weeks. Each dose was to be given with food. The OBT regimen was chosen by the investigator prior to randomization, based on the participant’s prior treatment history, screening genotypic and phenotypic resistance testing results, and any prior resistance testing results if available. The drugs in the OBT regimen was chosen from the locally available ART and consisted between three and six drugs, one of which was RTV-boosted PI. Low-dose RTV did not count as one of the OBT regimen drugs and RTV doses of &gt;400 mg/day were not permitted. FDC was counted according to the number of compounds making up the FDC (e.g., combivir counted as two drugs [lamivudine and zidovudine], trizivir counted as three drugs, etc.). Kaletra (LPV/RTV) was counted as one drug.</description>

The OBT regimen was chosen by the investigator prior to randomization, based on the participant’s prior treatment history, screening genotypic and phenotypic resistance testing results, and any prior resistance testing results if available. The drugs in the OBT regimen was chosen from the locally available ART and consisted between three and six drugs, one of which was RTV-boosted PI. Low-dose RTV did not count as one of the OBT regimen drugs and RTV doses of &gt;400 mg/day were not permitted. FDC was counted according to the number of compounds making up the FDC (e.g., combivir counted as two drugs [lamivudine and zidovudine], trizivir counted as three drugs, etc.).

        <title>Change From Baseline in ECG Parameter of RR Interval, Uncorrected QT Interval, QTc Interval (Fridericia), QTc Interval (Bazette), PR Interval and QRS Duration During the Randomized Treatment Phase</title>
        <description>12-lead ECG assessments were obtained at Day 1 (triplicate measurements), Week 4 and Week 24. The assessments were done using an ECG machine that automatically measured RR, PR, QRS, uncorrected QT, QTc (Bazette) and QTc (Fridericia) intervals. Baseline was defined as the mean of the triplicate assessment done at Day 1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the individual post-Baseline (Week 4 and Week 24) values.</description>

            <description>Participants were administered APL tablets orally as 400 mg BID for 48 Weeks. Each dose was to be given with food. The OBT regimen was chosen by the investigator prior to randomization, based on the participant’s prior treatment history, screening genotypic and phenotypic resistance testing results, and any prior resistance testing results if available. The drugs in the OBT regimen was chosen from the locally available ART and consisted between three and six drugs, one of which was RTV-boosted PI. Low-dose RTV did not count as one of the OBT regimen drugs and RTV doses of &gt;400 mg/day were not permitted. FDC was counted according to the number of compounds making up the FDC (e.g., combivir counted as two drugs [lamivudine and zidovudine], trizivir counted as three drugs, etc.). Kaletra (LPV/RTV) was counted as one drug.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Cluster of Differentiation 4 (CD4) Cell Counts During the Randomized Treatment Phase</title>
        <description>The CD4 cell count is an indication of the strength of the immune system. The assessment of CD4 cell count was done by flow cytometry. Baseline was defined as the mean of the Baseline (Day 1) and pre-treatment visit values. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the individual post-Baseline (Week 12, 24 and 40) values.</description>

            <description>Participants were administered APL tablets orally as 400 mg BID for 48 Weeks. Each dose was to be given with food. The OBT regimen was chosen by the investigator prior to randomization, based on the participant’s prior treatment history, screening genotypic and phenotypic resistance testing results, and any prior resistance testing results if available. The drugs in the OBT regimen was chosen from the locally available ART and consisted between three and six drugs, one of which was RTV-boosted PI. Low-dose RTV did not count as one of the OBT regimen drugs and RTV doses of &gt;400 mg/day were not permitted. FDC was counted according to the number of compounds making up the FDC (e.g., combivir counted as two drugs [lamivudine and zidovudine], trizivir counted as three drugs, etc.). Kaletra (LPV/RTV) was counted as one drug.</description>

        <description>AUC (0- tau) GW873140 was defined as the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to tau. Blood samples for evaluation of GW873140 plasma PK was planned to be collected from all participants at Week 4, 12, and 24. Intensive PK sampling was planned to be conducted with the enrolled participants. All participants who were not part of the intensive PK group was planned to be part of the limited PK sample group. Participants were supposed to complete a diary card with the date and time of investigational product administration of the last dose prior to clinic visits on Weeks 4, 12, and 24. It was determined using the linear trapezoidal rule for increasing concentrations and the logarithmic trapezoidal rule for decreasing concentrations.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Who Were Bothered by Each of Several Specific Symptoms Evaluated Using the HIV Symptom Index Questionnaire During the Randomized Treatment Phase</title>
        <description>The HIV Symptom Index Questionnaire was planned to be used to evaluate how bothersome certain symptoms were during the conduct of this clinical study. The participant self-report instrument had 20 items, each of which asked about a specific symptom or group of related symptoms that participants might have had during the past 4 weeks and the degree to which the participant is bothered by the symptom. The symptom index comprised 32 common and HIV-specific symptoms scored in terms of presence/absence (1, 0) and severity on a 4-point scale (0 = not at all to 3 =quite a bit). Higher score represented greater severity of symptoms.</description>

        <description>The EuroQol is a standardized instrument for use as a measure of health related quality of life. It consists of two pages comprising the EuroQoL 5 Dimension 5 level (EQ-5D5) descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (VAS). The EQ-5D5 comprises of five dimensions of health (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and depression/anxiety). Each dimension comprises five levels of response (no problems, mild problems, moderate problems, moderate to extreme problems, and extreme problems). The EQ VAS records the respondents self-rated health status on a vertical graduated (0 to 100) VAS. Higher score represented greater severity of diseases.</description>
