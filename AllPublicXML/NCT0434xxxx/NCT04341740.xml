  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to collect health-related information as well as bone marrow
      and blood specimens to determine if a new form of treatment for patients with kidney and
      bladder cancer may be possible.

      This research will collect specimens from the bone marrow and blood to determine if a new
      treatment for kidney or bladder cancer may be possible. This research study will collect a
      bone marrow sample as well as a blood sample.

      Participation in the research study will last approximately 60 days which includes time to
      determine if the patient is eligible to participate in the study, perform the research
      procedures and follow-up with the patient following the research procedures to determine if
      they are experiencing any side effects. Participation will end approximately 30 days
      following the bone marrow collection.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age ≥18 years

          -  Histologically-confirmed, locally advanced unresectable or metastatic RCC (cohort A)
             or UC (cohort B).

          -  ECOG performance status of ≤1

          -  Adequate bone marrow function:

               -  Platelet count ≥ 100 × 10^9/L

               -  ANC ≥ 1.0 ×10^9/L

               -  Lymphocyte count ≥ 1.0 ×10^9/L

          -  Willingness to undergo bone marrow aspiration (BMA)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior hematopoietic stem cell transplantation

          -  Prior radiation to the pelvic region

          -  Use of systemic corticosteroids within 28 days of BMA

          -  History of another primary malignancy that has been diagnosed or required therapy
             within the past 2 years (except completely resected basal cell and squamous cell skin
             cancer, curatively treated localized prostate cancer, and completely resected
             carcinoma in situ of any site).

          -  Presence of an autoimmune disease (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis,
             systemic lupus erythematosis) requiring active systemic treatment. If the autoimmune
             disease has been treated, it must be stable clinically. (Hypothyroidism without
             evidence of Grave's disease or Hashimoto's thyroiditis is not considered an exclusion
             criterion.)

          -  Pregnant females as documented by a serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG)
             pregnancy test consistent with pregnancy, obtained within 21 days of BMA

          -  Infection requiring treatment with antibiotics, antifungal, or antiviral agents within
             7 days of BMA

          -  Known diagnosis of HIV or CMV infection or active viral hepatitis

          -  Administration of hematopoietic growth factor support within 14 days before bone
             marrow aspiration

          -  Chemotherapy administration within 28 days of BMA

          -  Unwilling or unable to comply with the protocol

          -  Prior or ongoing clinically significant illness, medical condition, surgical history,
             physical finding, or laboratory abnormality that, in the Investigator's opinion, could
             affect the safety of the subject.
