    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of yoga delivered remotely on adults
      with dystonia. This work will have implications related to physical interventions symptom
      management and quality of life as well as implications related to the role of tele-therapy.

      This is a single group intervention study of adults (18-80 years-old) with dystonia symptoms
      undergoing a 6-week intervention of 30 minute yoga classes delivered remotely through
      videoconferencing 2-3 times a week. Subjects with cervical dystonia will complete yoga
      classes delivered at-home with videoconferencing, receiving one-on-one yoga instruction
      including breathing, postures, and meditation/relaxation for two to three times a week. Data
      collection will occur remotely via videoconferencing at 0-weeks (baseline), 6-weeks (after
      the intervention), and 12-weeks (follow-up). Data collection will include demographics,
      mental health questionnaires, motor assessments, enjoyment, usability, and follow-up yoga
      status. Each yoga session will be video recorded to aide in recording adherence, adverse
      events, and challenges.

    <measure>Craniocervical Dystonia Questionnaire (CDQ-24)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (0-weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The 24-question CDQ-24 will be used to measure disease-specific quality of life. It is comprised of five categories, which are stigma, emotional well-being, pain, activities of daily living (ADL), and social and family life. Potential scores range from 0-100 with higher scores indicating worse quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Short form 36 health survey (SF-36)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (0-weeks), post-intervention (6-weeks) and at follow-up (12-weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 will be used to assess quality of life. It is a 36-item questionnaire that consists of eight domains: physical functioning (PF), role limitations due to physical health (RP), role limitations due to emotional problems (RE), vitality (VT), mental health, social functioning (SF), bodily pain (BP), and general health (GH). With higher scores indicating greater quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Beck Anxiety Scale (BAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (0-weeks), post-intervention (6-weeks) and at follow-up (12-weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The BAI will be used to measure symptoms of anxiety. The BAI is a brief measure of anxiety with a focus on somatic symptoms of anxiety. Respondents indicate how much they have been bothered by each symptom over the past week. Responses are rated on a 4-point Likert scale and range from 0 (not at all) to 3 (severely). Potential scores range from 0 to 63 with higher scores indicating greater symptoms of anxiety.</description>

    <measure>Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (0-weeks), post-intervention (6-weeks) and at follow-up (12-weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The TWSTRS- severity scale will be used to assess motor symptoms. The TWSTRS is a comprehensive scale designed to assess objective physical (severity subscale) and subjective findings (disability and pain subscales). With higher scores indicating greater severity of symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (0-weeks), post-intervention (6-weeks) and at follow-up (12-weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>BDI-II will be used to measure symptoms of depression. The BDI-II is a 21 item self-report measure. For each item the subject must choose one out of 4 statements of increasing severity regarding a specific symptom of depression. It is written approximately at a 5th grade reading level and takes about 5-10 minutes to complete. Potential scores range from 0-63 with higher scores indicating greater severity of depressive symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Five Times Sit to Stand Test (FTST)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (0-weeks), post-intervention (6-weeks) and at follow-up (12-weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The FTST, functional measure, will be administered to assess physical function. It will be administered using a chair in the participants' homes over a one-on-one Zoom videoconference. Participants will be encouraged to have another adult present during this portion of the data collection in case there is any loss of balance. Participants will be encouraged to use an armless chair approximately 63 centimeters from the ground and any deviation from this standard procedure will be documented. Time in seconds it takes the participant to raise from the chair 5 times will be recorded. Longer times will indicate poorer physical function.</description>
